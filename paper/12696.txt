Americans' Dependency on Social Security

                                                ABSTRACT

This paper determines the standard of living reductions that young, middle aged, and older households
would experience were the U.S. government to cut Social Security benefits (but not taxes) to deal
with its well documented (see Gokhale and Smetters, 2005) long-term fiscal crisis. To determine pre-
and post-retirement living standards in the absence and presence of Social Security benefit cuts the
paper relies on ESPlanner, a financial planning software program. ESPlanner calculates a household's
highest sustainable living standard taking into account the household's economic resources including
its claims to future Social Security benefits. The program also incorporates borrowing/liquidity constraints
that limit households' abilities to smooth their living standards over their life cycles. The analysis considers
both stylized single and married households of different ages and resource levels as well as actual
households sampled from the 2004 Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). The extent
of current and future living standard reductions in response to announcements of future Social Security
benefit cuts depends critically on the age of the household, when the cuts are announced, the size of
the cuts, the income of the household, and the degree to which the household is liquidity constrained.
For our stylized households on the brink of retirement the complete elimination of Social Security
benefits would entail retirement living standards reductions ranging from roughly one third to one
hundred percent depending on the household's income. Our SCF findings also point to a strong dependency
on Social Security. Indeed, 41 percent of older SCF couples and 33 percent of SCF singles would
experience a living standard reduction of 90 percent or more were Social Security benefits eliminated.
A surprising finding is the major dependency of very high-income households on Social Security.
Take the highest earning couple in our stylized sample. This couple earns $500,000 per year from
age 30 through age 64 when it retires. It enters retirement with over $2.3 million in assets. But given
the length of its potential retirement, the modest real return it can safely earn on its assets, its off-the-top
housing expenses, and its tax payments, this household is highly dependent on Social Security benefits,
notwithstanding their taxable status. Indeed, were this household denied all its Social Security benefits
on the eve of its retirement, it would suffer a 35.6 percent reduction in its living standard throughout
retirement.

1. Introduction
According to a recent, highly detailed, and conservative estimate by Gokhale and Smetters
(2005), the present value difference between the U.S. government’s projected future
expenditures and its projected future tax receipts exceeds $60 trillion! Closing this enormous
fiscal gap requires massive and extremely painful expenditure cuts, tax hikes, or both. Delaying
such adjustments exacerbates the fiscal crisis and raises the prospect of a major
financial/economic meltdown, including high and growing rates of inflation if the government
uses the printing press to “pay” its bills.

The inevitable adjustment to a sustainable fiscal policy will, no doubt, involve a variety of
different tax increases and expenditure reductions. But these tax hikes and spending cuts need
not be explicit. Instead, they may arise by allowing price hikes to outpace the indexation of tax
and expenditure provisions.

Will Social Security benefits come under the chopping block? Especially the Social Security
benefits of the rich? No one can say for sure. But what we can say and do study in this paper is
how potential Social Security benefit cuts would impact the wellbeing of different American
households.

Specifically, we examine the living standard impacts of immediate and permanent 30 percent and
100 percent cuts in Social Security benefits. In so doing, we don’t claim that cuts of either of
these magnitudes will necessarily arise or that any Social Security benefit cuts will be announced
any time soon. Instead, we examine cuts of these magnitudes to illustrate the dependency of the
population on Social Security and to help policymakers calibrate the cost to Americans of this
form of policy adjustment.

One may object to our exclusive focus on Social Security benefits in discussing Americans’
dependency on the system. Were Social Security tax cuts coupled with Social Security benefit
cuts, working Americans would be able to use their tax savings to limit the decline in their
current and future living standards. But given Social Security’s fiscal condition, the prospect for
reductions in taxes earmarked to finance Social Security benefits seems remote.

In determining pre- and post-retirement living standards in the absence and presence of Social
Security benefit cuts we rely on ESPlanner, a financial planning software program. ESPlanner
calculates a household’s highest sustainable living standard taking into account the household’s
economic resources including its claims to future Social Security benefits. The program also
incorporates borrowing/liquidity constraints that limit households’ abilities to smooth their living
standards over their life cycles.

Our analysis considers both stylized single and married households of different ages and
resource levels as well as actual households sampled from the 2004 Federal Reserve Survey of
Consumer Finances. Given the progressive nature of the Social Security benefit formula, one
would expect across-the-board benefit cuts to impact low-income households disproportionately
relative to high income households. And given that a) benefit cuts have a larger present value
impact on resources the closer they are to being received and b) younger households have more



                                                 2
time to adjust their saving behavior to prospective benefit cuts, one would expect older
households to experience disproportionately larger living standard reductions than younger ones.

These expectations must, however, be modified if some households are borrowing/liquidity
constrained. Compare, for example, two young households that are identical except that one is
liquidity constrained, while the other can borrow to smooth its living standard. The liquidity-
constrained household will experience no change in its current living standard from future Social
Security benefit cuts because it’s not financing current consumption out of those future benefits.
In contrast, the unconstrained young household will experience an immediate reduction in its
living standard because it is financing its current spending in part from its future Social Security
income. The flip side of this coin is that the liquidity constrained household will experience a
larger percentage decline in living standard at retirement than will the non-liquidity constrained
household.

This assumes that the liquidity constraints are, themselves, unaffected by cuts in Social Security
benefits. But, as shown here, large enough benefit cuts, by reducing or eliminating the future
income against which households wish to borrow, transforms borrowing-constrained households
into non-borrowing-constrained households. At that point, these households can no longer rely
on Social Security to finance their retirements and must save on their own. Doing so entails a
drop in their current consumption spending and, thus, current living standard.

Given the importance of liquidity constraints for the timing of consumption adjustments in
response to Social Security benefit cuts, it’s important to show households’ living standard
adjustments at different stages of their life cycles. This, indeed, is what we do.

Our findings for the stylized households may be summarized as follows. The extent of current
and future living standard reductions in response to announcements of future Social Security
benefit cuts depends critically on the age of the household, when the cuts are announced, the size
of the cuts, and the income of the household. Social Security benefit cuts of 30 percent, if
announced when a household is about to retire, can lead to retirement living standard reductions
ranging from roughly one third to one tenth depending on the household’s income. These
reductions in living standard are substantially reduced if the household learns at younger ages
about the benefit cuts and, consequently, has a longer time period over which to adjust.

For our stylized households on the brink of retirement the complete elimination of Social
Security benefits would entail retirement living standards reductions ranging from roughly one
third to one hundred percent depending on the household’s income. This presumes that the
announcement is made when the household hits age 65. If the announcement were made when
the household was age 35, the retirement living standard reduction would range from roughly 20
to 50 percent.

The most surprising finding in our analysis of stylized households is the major dependence of
very high-income households on Social Security. Take the highest earning couple in our stylized
sample. This couple earns $500,000 per year from age 30 through age 64 when it retires. It
enters retirement with over $2.3 million in assets. But given the length of its potential
retirement, the modest real return we assume it can safely earn on its assets, its off-the-top



                                                 3
housing expenses, and its tax payments, this household is highly dependent on Social Security
benefits, notwithstanding their taxable status. Indeed, were this household denied all its Social
Security benefits on the eve of its retirement, it would suffer a 35.6 percent reduction in its living
standard throughout retirement.

Our findings based on the SCF are quite similar to those based on the stylized households.
Almost two-thirds of young SCF households and over a quarter of middle aged SCF households
are borrowing constrained. Consequently, their immediate living standard falls relatively little in
response to a 30 percent benefit cut, but much more substantially in the case of a 100 percent
benefit cut. In the case of elderly SCF respondents their immediate living standards are highly
dependent on Social Security. Indeed, 41 percent of older couples and 33 percent of singles
would experience a living standard reduction of 90 percent or more were Social Security benefits
eliminated.

We proceed in section 2 with a description of ESPlanner. Section 3 describes our stylized
households and reports the living standard effects of the two alternative benefit cuts. Second 4
does the same for our Federal Reserve’s 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances data. Section 5
concludes.

2. ESPlanner
ESPlanner determines a households highest sustainable living standard within each non-liquidity
constrained interval of its life and the consumption, saving, and term life insurance holdings
needed to smooth the household’s living standard within each non-constrained interval. The
program uses dynamic programming in forming its recommendations. Dynamic programming is
needed to deal both with potential borrowing constraints and with non-negativity constraints on
life insurance holdings.

The program takes into account the following user-specified inputs: the household’s state of
residence, current and future planned children and their years of birth, current and future regular
and self-employment earnings, current and future special expenditures and receipts (as well as
their tax status), current and future levels of a reserve fund, current regular and retirement
account balances, current and future own and employer contributions to retirement accounts
(with Roth IRAs treated separately), current and future primary and vacation home values,
mortgages, rental expenses, and other housing expenditures, current and future states of
residence, ages of retirement account withdrawals, ages of initial Social Security benefit receipt,
past and future covered Social Security earnings, desired funeral expenses and bequests, current
regular saving and life insurance holdings, the economies of shared living, the relative cost of
children, the extent of future changes in Social Security benefits, the extent of future changes in
federal income taxes, FICA taxes, and state income taxes, current and future pension and
annuities (including lump sum and survivor benefits), the degree to which the household will
annuitize its retirement account assets, and values of future earnings, special expenditures,
receipts, and other variables in survivor states in which either the head or her spouse/partner is
deceased.




                                                  4
The living standard of members of a household is defined by ESPlanner as the amount of
consumption expenditure an adult would need make to enjoy as a single person with no children
the same living standard she enjoys in the household. The equation relating a household’s living
standard per member to its total consumption expenditure takes into account economies in shared
living and the relative cost of children.1 Consumption expenditure is defined by ESPlanner as all
expenditures apart from special expenditures, such as college tuition for children, housing
expenditures, taxes, life insurance premiums, regular saving, and contributions to retirement
accounts.

ESPlanner’s Tax Calculations
ESPlanner makes highly detailed federal income, FICA, and state-specific income tax as well as
Social Security benefit calculations. These tax and benefit levels are the only non-user specified
variables influencing the program’s consumption smoothing calculations.

The program’s federal and state income-tax calculators determine whether the household should
itemize its deductions, compute deductions and exemptions, deduct from taxable income
contributions to tax-deferred retirement accounts, include in taxable income withdrawals from
such accounts as well as the taxable component of Social Security benefits, check, in the case of
federal income taxes, for Alternative Minimum Tax liability, and calculate total tax liabilities
after all applicable refundable and non-refundable tax credits including the Earned Income Tax
Credit and the Child Credit. These federal and state tax calculations are made separately for
each year that the couple is alive as well as for each year a survivor may be alive.

Given the non-linearity of tax functions, one can’t determine a household’s tax rates in future
years without knowing its regular asset and other taxable income in those years. But one can’t
determine how much a household will consume and save and thus have in asset income in future
years without knowing the household’s future taxes. Hence, we have a chicken and egg, i.e., a
simultaneity problem that needs to be resolved to make sure that consumption and saving
decisions are consistent with the future tax payments they help engender.

ESPlanner’s Social Security Benefit Calculations

In determining Social Security benefits the program takes full account of the earnings test, early
retirement reduction factors, the delayed retirement credit, the re-computation of benefits, the
family benefit maximum, the phase-in to the system’s ultimate age-67 normal retirement age, as
well as offset and windfall elimination provisions.

ESPlanner’s survivor tax and benefit calculations for surviving wives (husbands) are made
separately for each possible date of death of the husband (wife). I.e., ESPlanner considers
separately each date the husband (wife) might die and calculates the taxes and benefits a
surviving wife (husband) and her (his) children would receive each year thereafter. Moreover, in

 Let C stand for a household’s total consumption expenditure, s for its living standard per equivalent adult, ki for the
number of children age i, i for relative cost of a child age i, N for the number of adults, and for the degree of
economies of shared living. The relationship between C and s in a given year is C    = s ( N + Σθ i k i )ν .
                                                                                                     i




                                                           5
calculating survivor-state specific retirement, survivor, mother, father, and child dependent and
survivor Social Security benefits, ESPlanner takes account of all the just-mentioned benefit
adjustment factors.

ESPlanner’s Algorithm
ESPlanner’s calculates time-paths of consumption expenditure, taxable saving, and term life
insurance holdings in constant (2001) dollars. Consumption in this context is everything the
household gets to spend after paying for its “off-the-top” expenditures – its housing expenses,
special expenditures, life insurance premiums, special bequests, taxes, and net contributions to
tax-favored accounts. Given the household’s demographic information, preferences, borrowing
constraints, and non-negativity constraints on life insurance, ESPlanner calculates the highest
sustainable and smoothest possible living standard over time, leaving the household with zero
terminal assets (apart from the equity in homes that the user has chosen not to sell) if either the
household head, her spouse/partner, or both live to their maximum ages of life.

The amount of recommended consumption expenditures needed to achieve a given living
standard varies from year to year in response to changes in the household’s composition.
Moreover, the relationship between consumption and living standard in a given year is non-linear
for two reasons. First, a non-linear function governs the program’s assumed economies of
shared living, with the function depending on the number of equivalent adults. Second, the
program permits users to specify that children are less or more expensive than adults in terms of
delivering a given living standard. The default setting is that a child is 70 percent as expensive
as an adult. Hence a household with 2 adults and 2 children is specified, under the default
assumptions, to entail 4 equivalent adults.

The program’s recommended consumption also rises when the household moves from a situation
of being liquidity constrained to one of being unconstrained. Finally, recommended household
consumption will change over time if users intentionally specify, via the program’s standard of
living index, that they want their living standard to change.

The simultaneity issue with respect to taxes mentioned above is just one of two such issues that
need to be considered. The second is the joint determination of life insurance holdings of
potential decedents and survivors. ESPlanner recognizes that widows and widowers may need
to hold life insurance in order to protect their children’s living standard through adulthood and to
cover bequests, funeral expenses, and debts (including mortgages) that exceed the survivor’s net
worth inclusive of the equity on her/his house. Accordingly, the software calculates these life
insurance requirements and reports them in its survivor reports.

However, the more life insurance is purchased by the potential decedent, the less life insurance
survivors will need to purchase, assuming they have such a need. But this means survivors will
pay less in life insurance premiums and have less need for insurance protection from their
decedent spouse/partner. Hence, one can’t determine the potential decedent’s life insurance
holdings until one determines the survivor’s holdings. But one can’t determine the survivor’s
holdings until one determines the decedent’s holdings.




                                                 6
Dealing with the tax and life insurance simultaneity issues as well as the borrowing and non-
negative life insurance constraints all within a single dynamic program appears impossible given
the large number of state variables such an approach entails. To overcome this problem,
ESPlanner uses an iterative method of dynamic programming. Specifically, the program has two
dynamic programs that pass data to one another on an iterative basis until they both converge to
a single mutually consistent solution to many decimal points of accuracy.

One program takes age-specific life insurance premium payments as given and calculates the
household’s consumption smoothing conditional on these payments. The other program takes
the output of this consumption smoothing program -- the living standard in each year that needs
to be protected – as given. This second program calculates how much life insurance is needed by
both potential decedents and their surviving spouses/partners.

This iterative procedure also deals with our two simultaneity issues. The trick here is to form
initial guesses of future taxes and survivor life insurance holdings and update these guesses
across successive iterations based on values of these variables endogenously generated by the
program in the previous iteration. When the program concludes its calculations, current
spending is fully consistent with future taxes and vice versa, and the recommended life insurance
holdings of heads and spouses/partners are fully consistent with the recommended life insurance
holdings of survivors.

3. The Living Standard Impacts of Social Security Benefit Cuts -- Stylized Households
This section examines the costs in terms of living standard reductions of Social Security benefit
cuts for a set of 14 stylized households. The 14 households differ with respect to their marital
status, annual labor earnings, assets, housing expenses, and college expenses. For each
household, we consider the impact of the benefit cuts arising unexpectedly at three different
points in their life cycle – when the household head and, if married, spouse are age 35, age 50,
and age 65.

Characteristics of Our Stylized Households
To determine each household’s asset levels at ages 35, 50, and 65, we first run ESPlanner with
no benefit cuts. Specifically, we run the program for each stylized household specifying the age
of the household head and, in the case of married households, the spouse as age 35. In this initial
run we specify the presence of two children ages 1 and 3. We also enter age-35 asset levels,
housing expenses, including the annual payment on a 30-year mortgage, initial earnings, and
annual college expenses when the children are ages 19 to 22. Finally, we assume that the
households’ labor earnings remain fixed in real dollars through time, that the households earns a
3 percent real (over and above inflation) pre-tax return on its investments, and that the husband
and wife both have maximum ages of life equal to 100.

Table 1 reports the characteristics of our stylized households as of age 35. Take, as an example,
the single household with annual earnings of $50,000. We assume initial age-35 asset holdings
equal $12,500. We also assume annual college expenditures of $12,500 per child, a $120,000
outstanding mortgage with a $1,500 monthly payment, $1,500 in annual property taxes, and



                                                7
$750 in annual home maintenance expenses. With the exception of our $50,000 upper bound on
annual college expenses, the non-earnings entries for the other households are scaled by their
levels of earnings; e.g., the single and married households with $100,000 in annual earnings have
initial assets at age 35 of $25,000, which is twice the initial assets of the single and married
households earning $50,000 per year.

Continuing with the example of the single age-35 household earning $50,000, we extract the
asset levels, remaining mortgage balance and length of mortgage, and remaining college
expenditures for this household at ages 35, 50, and 65. We then use these values as inputs in
three separate ESPlanner runs for this household at those three ages. In these separate runs we
specify, alternatively, no Social Security benefit cut, a 30 percent cut, and a 100 percent cut. In
following this procedure we are, in effect, treating the cuts as being a surprise at the time they are
announced. We are also holding as much constant as possible in comparing by age the living
standard adjustments to benefit cuts.

Illustrating Our Findings
Tables 2-4 show results from our age-35 runs under the three alternative benefit cut assumptions.
Specifically, the tables show the levels of consumption, regular assets, and taxes at ages 35, 50,
and 65. Tables 5-7 show results from our age-50 runs, displaying consumption, asset, and tax
values at ages 50 and 65. And tables 8-10 show results from our age-65 run, displaying
consumption, asset, and tax values only at age 65.

Take, as an example, the married age-35 household earning $30,000. Table 2, which assumes no
benefit cut, shows the household will consume $16,751 at age 35, $11,689 at age 50, and
$18,145 at age 65. The explanation for the lower value of consumption at age 50 is that the
children have left the household. The explanation for the higher value of consumption at age 65
than at age 50 is that the household is borrowing constrained until its late 50s when the kids have
been put through college and the mortgage has been paid off. As indicated in the table, the
household accumulates very little by way of retirement assets. This makes sense since the
household’s Social Security benefits are considerable relative to its household’s pre-retirement
consumption expenditure level.

How does this household respond to a 30 percent cut in its future Social Security benefits if it
learns about the benefit cut at age 35? The answer, according to table 3, is that the household
continues to spend essentially the same amount it was spending while young and middle age, but
that it begins saving more in its late 50s and early 60s to mitigate the reduction in Social Security
income, which begins at age 65. Indeed, by age 65 the household has $50,194 in assets
compared with only $5,435 in the case of no benefit cut.

Consider next what happens if this household learns at age 35 not of a 30 percent benefit cut, but
of a 100 percent benefit cut. In this case the household moves from being liquidity constrained
to being unconstrained and realizes that it will need to cut its current consumption if it wants to
have as high a living standard in old age as it has when young. As a comparison of tables 2 and
3 indicate, totally eliminating Social Security benefits engenders a 23.5 percent reduction in




                                                  8
living standards at ages 35 and 50 and a 50.7 percent reduction at age 65. These figures are, by
the way, reported in table 11.

Here again we see the critical role of saving responses in determining the ultimate living
standard impact of cutting Social Security – even for households doing little or no initial saving.
Indeed, at age 65 this household that would otherwise have saved only $5,435 in assets. When
Social Security benefits are eliminated, it ends up accumulating $224,144 by 65.

The Importance of Advanced Warning
Learning early that one’s benefits are to be cut can make a big difference to a household’s
consumption-saving response and to the associated retirement living standard reductions. This is
evident once one compares tables 11, 12, and 13, which show the percentage reduction in age-
specific living standards contingent on learning about the future benefit cuts at ages 35, 50, and
65, respectively.

In the case of the $30,000-earning married couple facing a 30 percent benefit cut, the retirement
living standard declines by 17.8 percent if the household first learns about the cut at age 35, 23.3
percent if the household first learns at age 50, and 32.2 percent if the household first learns at age
65.2 Note that the 32.2 percent retirement living standard decline is almost twice as large as the
17.8 percent decline.

The 100 percent benefit cut generates equally striking differences in retirement living standard
reductions depending on when the household learns about the cut. For our household in
question, learning at ages 35, 50, and 65 about losing its benefits leads to respective retirement
living standard reductions of 50.7 percent, 67.5 percent, and 100 percent.

Clearly, in delaying notification of this household that its benefits are to be cut, the government
is giving the household less time to adjust by altering its saving. The upshot is a distortion in the
life-cycle pattern of consumption. Gomes, Kotlikoff, and Viceira (2006) discuss this distortion,
which they refer to as the “excess burden of government indecision,” and show that it can be
economically significant.

Patterns by Marital Status, Age of Learning and Earnings Levels
Tables 11-13 indicate some interesting patterns by marital status, age of learning about the cut,
and earnings in the living standard responses to benefit cuts. First, controlling for total
household earnings the results for singles and married households are, broadly speaking, very
similar. Second, as suggested above, when the household learns its benefits are to be cut matters
a lot to its immediate living standard. Take the 30 percent cut. Across all earnings levels there is
essentially no change in current living standards whether the household first learns at age 35 or at


2
  The fact that the last figure – 32.2 percent – exceeds 30 percent can be understood by noting that while this
household’s primary income source has declined by 30 percent, its fixed housing expenses (property taxes,
homeowners insurance, and maintenance) have not declined at all. Hence, the percentage decline in consumable
resources is actually greater than 30 percent.


                                                      9
age 50. But there is a sizeable drop in the current living standard if the household first learns at
age 65 of the 30 percent cut.

The fact that benefit cuts, even as large as 30 percent, make so little difference to immediate
consumption of our young and middle-aged stylized household is testimony to the importance of
the liquidity constraints facing these households. On the other hand, if the cuts are large enough,
they will affect immediate as well as future living standards even at younger ages. Tables 11 and
12 shows that if households learn at either age 35 or age 50 that their benefits will be eliminated,
their current living standards fall by 18 to 28 percent, depending on their income, if they are
initially age 30 and by roughly 32 to 43 percent, depending on income, if they are initially age
50. There are some non-linear living standard reductions in tables 11 and 12. These reflect
different degrees and timing of liquidity constraints among the households as well as non-
linearities in income taxes.

Retirement living standards do, of course, respond substantially to the 30 percent benefit cut.
But the size of the response depends significantly on the household’s income and the timing of
the benefit cut announcement. If the 30 percent cut is first learned at age 30, retirement living
standards will fall by roughly one quarter for the lowest earning of our stylized households and
roughly 5 percent for the highest earning. If it is first learned at age 65, the living standard
reduction ranges from 32 percent for the lowest earning households to 11 percent for the lowest
earning households.

The largest living standard reductions occur, of course, in the case the benefit cut is 100 percent
and is announced when the household is age 65. In this case, the retirement living standard
reductions range from 100 percent to roughly 35 percent as one moves from the lowest to the
highest earning households.

The highest earning households, in table 13, are married households with $500,000 in annual
earnings. The fact that such households would suffer a 35 percent living standard reduction were
Social Security entirely eliminated at their point of retirement is quite striking. If correct, this
finding suggests that like low- and middle-income households, high-income households have a
major stake in preserving Social Security benefits.

But how can it be that such a high-earning household could be so vulnerable to Social Security
benefit cuts announced at the point of retirement? It’s not for a lack of saving. The $500,000
earning married couple arrives at age 65 with $2.3 million in assets. That seems like a lot of
money. But the pre-tax real return the household earns on these assets is only 3 percent, and it
has a potential retirement of 35 years to finance. By way of reference, 3 percent of $2.3 million
is just $69,000 per year. Of course the household will consume not just principal, but also
interest on its $2.3 million. But spending principal plus interest generates an annual income flow
of just $107,040. This is larger than it may seem because the household pays taxes on the
interest and also faces $22,500 in off-the-top housing expenses. Taxes at age 65 are $38,793.
They decline, of course, through time as the household runs down its assets and generates less
taxable asset income. But midway through retirement, at age 82, they are still quite high, in this
case $20,904.




                                                10
If one subtracts, say, $20,000 in taxes and $22,500 in housing expenses from the annual income
flow of $107,040, what’s left for the household to spend on consumption is $64,540. From this
perspective, the household’s combined $47,434 in annual Social Security benefits looms quite
large. Of course these benefits are, themselves, subject to federal income taxation, so they too
need to be considered on an after-tax basis. But these figures are enough to paint the picture.
They make clear why eliminating Social Security benefits for this household on the brink of its
retirement could easily reduce its sustainable living standard by 35.6 percent – the figure
reported in table 13.

4. The 2004 Survey of Consumer Finance Data
We now turn to the evaluation of the living standard costs of Social Security benefit cuts based
on actual households surveyed in the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). The SCF is
sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board in cooperation with the Department of the Treasury.
Since 1992, data have been collected by the National Organization for Research at the University
of Chicago (NORC). The SCF is conducted every three years and gathers detailed information
on the demographics, incomes, assets, and other financial characteristics of U.S. families. No
other U.S. data set collects financial data of similar quality.

The 2004 SCF surveyed 4,519 households selected from all economic strata. In the SCF, a
household unit is divided into a ‘‘primary economic unit’’ (PEU) — the family — and everyone
else in the household. The PEU is intended to be the economically dominant single individual or
couple (whether married or living together as partners) and all other persons in the household
who are financially interdependent with that economically dominant person or couple.

In this study, we restrict attention to only those observations in which the number of household
members coincides with the number of people in the PEU. This sample selection criterion
eliminates 434 observations (9.5 percent) from the sample.

The SCF incorporates 86 different marital status categorizations based on the participation of the
spouse/partner in the PEU and the actual presence of the spouse/partner in the household. We
include household with one of the following marital statuses: 1) “married, spouse usually there,
spouse in PEU”; 2) “living with a partner, partner in PEU, partner usually there”; 3) “separated
and currently single”; 4) “divorced/widowed and currently single”, and 5) “single”. Restricting
our sample to households with one of these four statuses further reduces our sample size, in this
case by 77 observations (1.5 percent).

Finally, we considered only households whose heads are 25 and above. This further reduced our
sample by 140 observations. After applying these sample selections, we arrived at a set of 3690
observations, i.e. a reduction of about 18 percent. From these observations, we choose 200 at
random, which we entered by hand in ESPlanner. We entered each observation by hand to
ensure that each of the inputs for a given household made complete sense; i.e., did not represent
unreasonable survey responses or extreme outliers. In the course of arriving at our final 200
cases, we eliminated 3 observations.




                                               11
Although our 200 observations constitute a random subsample of our selected SCF sample, they
don’t represent a random sample of U.S. households. The reason is that the SCF overweights
high income and high net worth households. To adjust for this fact we applied the SCF’s
household sample weights in calculating the distributions of living standard reductions arising
from 30 percent and 100 percent benefit cuts.

Imputations
The ages of respondents’ children are not reported in the SCF for privacy reason. Since these
ages are critical inputs into ESPlanner, we developed the following imputation strategy. We
assume children leave the PEU when they turn 19. The age of each child is computed as the
difference between the actual age of the youngest parent and the mean age of the mother at given
number of births obtained from the “National Vital Statistics Report” (volume 51, number 1).
The mean age of the mother is differentiated by the birth order of the child.

Other than demographic information, we collect data on labor earnings, special expenditure and
receipts, life insurance, financial assets, retirement accounts, pensions (current and future),
primary residence, property taxes, mortgages and social security. Labor earnings are
differentiated by head and spouse/partner as well as whether, in her primary job, the respondent
is an employee or self-employed. Earnings in secondary jobs reported by respondents are
treated as coming from employment as opposed to self-employment since the SCF does not
indicate otherwise. In addition to these procedures, we assume zero growth of real earnings in
the future.

In most cases, respondents reported their lengths of mortgages in addition to their monthly
payments and outstanding balances. In those cases where the length of a mortgage was not
reported, we assumed a 7 percent mortgage rate and used the monthly payment and outstanding
balance to infer the length of the mortgage.

We set the retirement age of a respondent or spouse/partner at the age she indicates she will stop
working altogether. If she indicates no plans to stop working, we assume she retires at 70 or at
their current age plus 1, whichever is greater.

Regular assets are formed by adding together the household’s reported holdings of stocks, bonds,
checking accounts, saving accounts, and other financial instruments. For retirement accounts we
collect data on the account balance, the amount of last year’s contributions, and the expected age
at first withdraw. The accounts are grouped in four categories, namely Keogh and SEP plans,
various IRA plans, Roth IRA and others. The category “others” includes all remaining defined
contribution retirement schemes such as 401(k), 403(b), supplementary retirement annuity, Thrift
plans, profit sharing plans and mixed (defined benefits-defined contributions) plans. These
groupings reflect the structure of the dataset and the requirements of ESPlanner.

The expected age at first withdraw may differ according to the retirement account. Since
ESPlanner assumes a single age at which all accounts are withdrawn, we use the expected age
connected to the largest account. However, if the household is already withdrawing money from
one of her accounts, we set the age at first withdraw equal to the current age.



                                               12
In the case of pensions, we collect data on each spouse’s/partner’s benefits, either those currently
being received or those expected to be received. The SCF reports information on up to three
defined benefit schemes for each spouse/partner. Data on indexation and survivor percentage are
limited. Consequently, when not reported, we assume no indexation of pension benefits and a 50
percent survivor’s benefit.

For respondents currently receiving social security benefits, we use the respondents’ reported
benefit start date and monthly payment. For households not currently collecting benefits, we
assume that all future employee earnings are covered by Social Security.

Past employment and self-employment earnings are also assumed to be covered by social
security. However, we do not have data on past covered earnings. Therefore, we assume
respondents started working at age 25 and that their earnings grew every year at a 5 percent
nominal growth rate, ending up in the current year at their reported current earnings levels.

The Living Standard Impacts of Social Security Benefit Cuts -- SCF Households
After inputting our SCF data into ESPlanner, we ran the program specifying no benefit cuts and
then twice again, specifying cuts of 30 percent and 100 percent. Tables 14 and 15 present
summary statistics with respect to the derived immediate and age-65 living standard changes
generated by our sample. The statistics in these tables are un-weighted. The subsequent
distribution tables employ household weights.

Table 14 shows that average and median immediate living standard changes are much larger for
older households as our analysis of the stylized households leads one to expect. In the case of a
30 percent benefit cut, the median immediate reduction is 13.8 percent versus 2.1 percent for
respondents age 25-44. With a 100 percent cut, the median reductions range from 13.0 percent
for the 25-44 respondents to 43.0 percent for the 65+ respondents.

The medians in table 15, which considers living standard reductions at age 65 for young and
middle aged households, are much larger than in table 14. For example, with a 100 percent
benefit cut, the median living standard reduction at age 65 for respondents age 25-44 is 30.7
percent – much higher than the median 13.0 percent immediate living standard reduction
reported for this age group in table 14.

This is what one would expect given the borrowing constraints facing young and middle aged
households in our sample. In our sample, 62.3 percent of households age 25-44 are liquidity
constrained, 25.8 percent of households age 45-64 are constrained, and 8.8 percent of households
age 65 and over are constrained.

There is considerable variation within each age group with respect to the living standard
reductions. The medians differ substantially from the means, and there is a wide range between
mean vales and the minimum and maximum values. The minimum values indicate that Social
Security benefit cuts can raise living standards for some households. The explanation here is
that the future benefit cuts lower the household head’s and, if married or partnered, her



                                                13
spouse’s/partner’s future income and, potentially, the need for life insurance to protect survivors’
living standards. In paying less life insurance premiums, such households end up with more cash
to finance a higher current living standard.

Tables 16-19 and figures 1-8 display distributions of immediate and, in the case of young and
middle aged households, age-65 living standard reductions by the age of the household head and
the size of the living standard reduction.

To begin, consider figures 1 and 2, which plot the data in table 16. Figure 1 applies to singles
and figure 2 to couples, whether married or partnered. Both figures show the percentage of
households in age groups with heads age 25-44, 45-64, and 65 plus experiencing different
percentage reductions in their immediate living standards resulting from a 30 percent cut in
Social Security benefits.

Young households, whether single or married, experience very small immediate living standard
declines. Indeed, 79 percent of single young households and 98 percent of married/partnered
young households experience a decline of 10 percent or less, reflecting the fact that most of these
households are liquidity constrained. Middle aged households experience slightly larger, but still
quite small immediate living standard reductions from the 30 percent benefit cut. In contrast,
older households, particularly older single households, are adversely affected to a significant
degree. A full third of older households experience immediate living standard reductions of 30
percent or more. Among single (coupled) older households, 8 percent experience living standard
reductions of 40 to 50 (50 to 60) percent.

Figures 3 and 4, based on table 17, repeat this analysis, but consider 100 percent benefit cuts. As
we saw among the stylized households, losing so much of one’s future income loosens liquidity
constraints, not because households can now freely borrow against their future income, but
because they no longer seek to borrow. As they see their future incomes fall, large numbers of
the households in our sample realize they must significantly increase their current saving and
lower their current consumption spending, often dramatically. This is true for almost all older
households as well as many middle-aged and younger ones.

The percentages of older singles and couples experiencing 90 percent or greater immediate living
standard reductions are 33 percent and 41 percent, respectively. The percentages of older singles
and couples experiencing 50 percent or greater living standard reductions are 52 percent and 58
percent, respectively. Clearly, the elderly in the SCF are highly dependent on Social Security
benefits.

Among the middle aged, some 61 percent of couples and 32 percent of singles would be forced
to cut their living standards by 30 percent or more in response to the announced elimination of
Social Security benefits. The corresponding figures for young couples and singles are 10 percent
and 31 percent, respectively.

Figures 5 and 6 based on table 18 shows how the living standards at age 65 of current young and
middle-aged households would be affected by a 30 percent benefit cut. The finding here is that
close to half of all these households would experience a 10–20 percent living standard reduction.



                                                14
These reductions in age-65 living standard are modest compared to those shown in figures 7 and
8 (based on table 19) in which the total elimination of Social Security benefits is contemplated.
Under this draconian cut, large fractions of young and middle age households experience living
standard reductions at age 65 and thereafter that range from 20 to 60 percent. For example, 89
percent of couples age 45-64 experience living standard cuts of 20 percent or more; and 36
percent experience cuts of 40 percent or more.

Regression Analysis of Determinants of Living Standard Reductions
To more fully understand the determinants of living standard reductions, we regress the
percentage change in immediate and age-65 living standards arising from 30 percent and 100
percent benefit cuts against marital status (single or couple), age of the head, the ratio of the
household’s current living standard before the cut to the average living standard in the sample,
the square of this ratio, and a dummy variable that takes the value one if the household is
liquidity constrained.

The results are presented in table 18. Consider the first two columns in which the dependent
variable is the reduction in immediate living standards from 30 percent and 100 percent benefit
cuts. Apart from marital status and the squared relative living standard ratio, all regressors are
significant. Older households experience larger reductions. Liquidity constrained households
experience smaller reductions. So do households with higher current living standards relative to
the average. The results in the last two columns, in which the living standard reduction at 65 is
the dependent variable, display similar signed coefficients.

5. Conclusion
Understanding the living standard implications for working and retired households of cutting
Social Security benefits requires more than simply considering the size of these benefits relative
to other resources. One needs to understand how Social Security benefits and other resources
stocks and flows combine to determine a household’s living standard time path in light of taxes
and borrowing constraints. This study uses ESPlanner to determine households’ smoothest
living standard paths assuming zero borrowing for purposes of consumption smoothing. It then
examines how the living standards of both stylized households and households surveyed in the
2004 Survey of Consumer Finances would respond to 30 percent and 100 percent benefit cuts.

The findings indicate that the vast majority of today’s elderly, even those with very high levels
of past earnings and large asset holdings, would experience very major living standard reductions
from such cuts. Younger and middle aged households would be less affected in the short run by
a 30 percent cut, since they are largely liquidity constrained. But such a cut would materially
alter their living standard in retirement. The full elimination of Social Security benefits would,
on the other hand, significantly reduce the current as well as the future living standards of
today’s young and middle-aged households as well as dramatically reduce the living standards of
most current elderly.
