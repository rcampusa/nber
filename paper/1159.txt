             CASE MIX, COSTS, AND OUTCOMES: DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

           FACULTY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES IN A UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL



         In order to gain insight into the possible consequences of

 prospective payment for university hcspitals, we studied 2,025 admissions

to the faculty and community services of a university hospital, measuring

differences in case mix, costs, and outcomes. The faculty service case

mix was disproportionately weighted toward the more costly diagnoses, but

even after adjustment for diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), costs were

11 percent higher on the faculty service. The differential was proportionately

greater for diagnostic costs than for routine or treatment costs, and

the differential was particularly large (70 percent) for patients with a

predicted probability of death (DTHRISK) of .25 or greater.

        The in-hospital mortality rate was appreciably lower on the faculty

service after adjustment for case mix and patient characteristics. The

mortality differential between the two services was particularly large for

patients in the high death risk category.

        Comparison of a matched sample of 51 pairs of admissions from the

high death risk category confirmed the above results with respect to costs

and in-hospital mortality, but follow-up revealed that the mortality rates

were equal for the two services at nine months after discharge.

                                  Introduction


           Prospective payment is a cornerstone of federal and state plans to

control health care costs.1 It is also perceived as a threat to the

financial viability of academic medical centers, whose costs per admission

exceed those of community hospitals.2'3 Many investigators attribute higher

costs to the distinctive mix of patients cared for in teaching hospitals.4

These patients undergo extensive diagnostic investigation, receive more

aggressive treatment, and stay in the hospital longer, in part because they

often present with more complex problems than their counterparts in nonteaching

hospitals. Each hospital's case mix changes little from year to year.5

if academic medical centers continue to serve patients like those they have

admitted in the past, and provide them with the same level of care, their

revenues will depend upon the case mix adjustment applied to prospective

payment.

           The case mix measure that will be applied under Medicare, Diagnosis

Related Groups (DRGs), is already in use in Maryland and New Jersey.6 DRGs

are groupings of ICD-9CM diagnostic categories modified by major surgical

procedures, patient age, and the presence of significant complications or

concurrent illnesses.7 Currently there are 467 DRGs, chosen to minimize

the variance in costs within each group.8 For some diagnoses, patients are

assigned to one category if hospitalization terminates in death, and to

another if they survive. Thus DRGs, like several other case mix measures,

reflect events and procedures during hospitalization in addition to patient

characteristics at admission. They do not measure health improvement or

hospital output defined in precise terms.
                                    2




       Teaching hospitals anticipating DRG-based payment schedules will

find little reassurance from previous studies of the relation between

hospital costs and case mix. These studies showed that teaching hospitals

havehigher costs even when case mix is held constant.3'9'1°   There has

been little discussion of the contribution, if any, of higher costs

to better patient outcomes. Both policy makers and the hospitals need to

know the causes of these cost differences and their implications. We explore

these issues by comparing patients admitted to the faculty and community

services of a major university-affiliated hospital, measuring the

contribution of case mix and other patient characteristics to differences

in costs between the faculty and community services. We identify subsets

of patients with particularly large cost differences and explore their

potential causes. Finally, we investigate whether higher expenditures are

associated with differences in outcomes, and discuss the implications for

hospital costs and performance under prospective payment. By studying

differences within a single hospital, we implicitly hold constant wage

rates, costs of materials and supplies, laboratory fees, pharmacy prices,

quantity and quality of nursing, and similar factors that confound

comparisons between different hospitals.

                              Data and Methods



 A. Sample and Data Base

         The basic population consisted of all admissions of patients aged

45 and over to a major university-affiliated
                                                 hospital during 1981. The
sample was limited to admissions that fell into diagnosis-related
                                                                    groups
meeting these criteria: (1) at least 20 admissions to each of the

faculty and community services; and (2) 10 or more deaths in the

DRG in 1981. The second criterion ensured adequate variation in outcomes

for the purposes of analysis. The type of attending physician determined

whether an admission was counted as a faculty or a community patient.

House officers participated in the care of 33 percent of the community

patients (community teaching service) and aLl of the faculty patients.

Usually faculty patients received care in distinct areas of the hospital.

The 43 admissions that lacked a specification of physician type were

excluded, to leave a final sample of 1,007 faculty and 1,018 community

admissions in 12 DRGs. These DRGs accounted for 16.2 percent of all

admissions and 29.5 percent of all costsof patients 45 and over. The

data were generated from a data base known as the "Care Monitoring System."

This system utilizes medical record discharge data, including patient

demographics, physician activity, outcomes, diagnoses, and procedures.

The data are classified by ORG and the medical record data are merged with

the financial record which assigns charges by service unit. For this study,

charges were assigned in three categories: routine (including room and

central service), diagnostic, and therapeutic.

B. Predicting Hospital Outcome

       The method of maximum likelihood was used to estimate a multiple

logistic equation relating the probability of death during hospitalization

to a number of personal characteristics. The dependent variable took the

value of one if admission terminated in death, and zero otherwise. Independent

variables were age and dummy variables for sex, urgency of admission, race,

area of residence, previous discharge, and each of the 12 DRGs. A predicted

probability of death.(DTHRISK) was computed for each patient by applying

the estimated logistic equation to the values of the variables for the

patient.



C. Cost and Outcome Adjustment

           We determined the contribution of patient mix to observed differences

in costs and outcomes by adjusting for DRG alone and for DRGs with personal

characteristics. These adjustments are analogous to indirect age adjustments.

To adjust costs for ORGs and other characteristics, we first derived a measure

of predicted costs. ifl the first stage linear regressions were estimated wIth

the natural logarithm of costs as the dependent variable and the following as

exogenous variables: dummy variables for sex, religion, type of insurance,

urgency of admission, race, location of residence., previous discharge, age

category, and ORG. To adjust for DRG alone we performed similar regressions,

omitting the other variables. The regression coefficients were then

applied to obtain predicted cost for each admission. The geometric means

of the ratio of actual to predicted costs (i.e., adjusted cost ratios) were

computed for the faculty and the community patients separately. Finally,

the adjusted cost was calculated as the adjusted cost ratio for faculty

(or comunity) multiplied by the mean costs for both groups combined. The

formula for adjusted costs for the faculty was:

                              i=l        NFAC



 where C. are the actual costs for the ith faculty patient,

 C1 are that patient's predicted costs, C is the mean cost for faculty and

 community patients combined, and NFAC is the total number
                                                                     of faculty patients
 in the group.

         Outcomes were adjusted in an analogous manner. To obtain the

 predicted risk of death for an individual,
                                                 adjusting for personal charac-
 teristics as well as DRGs, we used the predicted value of DTHRISK for that

 patient. The adjusted risk ratio for any group of patients was defined as

 the proportion of the group that actually died divided by the mean predicted

 death risk for the group. The adjusted risk was simply the adjusted risk

 ratio for either a community or faculty
                                             group multiplied by the percentage
of the combined population that died.



D. Sample of Matched Observations

        A sample of matched community and faculty patients was selected

for chart review. All patients whose predicted probability of death

(DTHRISK) was equal to or greater than .25 were identified.           This included
60 faculty and 140 community patients.
                                             Faculty/community pairs were then
matched by age, sex, and DRG. Close matches were found for 55 pairs of

patients, but 4 pairs were excluded because medical records could not be

located for one member of the pair. The remaining 51 pairs were compared

for costs and outcomes, their medical charts were reviewed, and their

status during the year following discharge was ascertained.

                            -      Results
        Patients admitted to the faculty and community services differed in

several important respects, as may be seen in Table 1. The former were much

more likely to he admitted for cardiac surgery or treatment for iymphoma or

leukemia. A disproportionate number of patients on the community service had

diagnoses of cerebrovascular disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,

or heart failure and shock.     The faculty service patients were substantially

younger (seven years difference, on average), less likely to be admitted on

an emergency basis,and much less likely to live within one-half hour's drive

of the hospital. The distributions (not shown in the table) of patients by

race, religion and insurance coverage were similar in the two services except

thatthose on the community side had a larger percentage of Medicare patients,

reflecting the difference in age distribution.

        Table 2 shows that the large cost difference between faculty and

community patients (59.6 percent) was substantially reduced (to 10.8 percent)

when costs were adjusted for differences in the distribution of cases across

the 12 DRGs. Additional adjustment for the socioeconomic characteristics of

the patients had virtually no effect (less than one percentage point) on the

overall cost differential of over $1,200 per case. Similarly, exclusion of

16 outliers (costs in excess of $100,000) had very- little effect on the

differential .   Costs are based on patient charges rather than the actual

value of resources used. Because the ratio of costs to charges varies by

type of charge, differences in charges may either overestimate or under-

estimate cost differences if the distribution of charges by type varies

greatly between the faculty and community services. There is some tendency

for a greater proportion of faculty charges to be for diagnostic services,

which have a lower cost/charge ratio, but the bias introduced by the use

of charges was less than one percent for the average DRG and less than

one—tenth of one percent for the 51 matched pairs comparison discussed below.

         Patients were allocated to four risk categories, based on their

predicted probability of death. These categories corresponded to values

of DTHRISK > .25 (9.9 percent of the admissions), between .15 and .24

(22.9 percent), between .05 and .14 (27.6 percent), and less than .05

(39.6 percent). Table 3 shows that the cost differential was largest among

the high-risk patients--those who, at the time of admission, had an

estimated probability of death of .25 or greater. For such patients, those

treated by faculty had costs that were 70 percent greater than those treated

by community physicians, after adjusting for case mix as measured by DRGs.

When costs were disaggregated into three major categories, the adjusted

percentage differential was greatest for diagnostic costs and smallest for

routine costs.

         Faculty service patients experienced higher costs, but Table 4

shows that they also enjoyed better outcomes as measured by deaths per

hundred admissions. Even after adjusting for DRGs and socioeconomic

characteristics, the community service patients were 34 percent more likely

to be dead at discharge (12.3 versus 9.2 deaths per hundred). Disaggregation

by DIHRISK shows that the outcome difference was most pronounced for the

costs.

         Analysis of the relation between the cost and mortality differentials

reveals substantial differences across the 12 DRG5. In one set (089, 105,

107, 274, and 403) there was a large mortality differential and virtually

 no difference in cost.   In a second set (082, 172, and 203) there were

 large differentials in both costs and mortality. And in a third set (014,

 087, 088, and 127) there was a large cost differential, but
                                                               adjusted mortality
 was actually slightlyhigher on the faculty service.    Interestingly, the

 allocation of patients by service and DRG appears to be responsive to these

 cost-mortality tradeoffs. For the first set of DRGs, where the faculty

 service had substantially lower mortality with no increase in cost, this

 service accounted for 63 percent of the admissions. By contrast, for the

 third set of DRGs,.where the faculty service had substantially higher costs

without lower mortality, only 27 percent of the patients were treated by

 faculty physicians. For the intermediate set of DRGs, admissions were

more equally divided, with 44 percent cared for on the faculty service.

        The results of a comparison of matched observations reported in

Table 5 strongly support the conclusions drawn from the larger sample and

offer additional insights concerning the differences between the two

services. The 51 admissions to the faculty service were matched by DRG,

age, and sex with 51 admissions to the comunity service. The patients

came from the following DRGs (number of pairs shown in parentheses):

014 (5), 082 (16), 087 (5), 172 (4), 203 (14), and 274 (7). All patients

had a death risk   .25.   Within this matched group the average cost was

more than twice as high in the faculty service. Moreover, this large

difference was not attributable to a few large outliers. In 41 of the 51

pairs, the' patient on the faculty service had the higher costs. The

difference in outcomes, as measured by status at discharge, was also

substantial: the death rate was almost twice as high among patients on

the community service.
                                     14



        Although these patients had been carefully matched by several

criteria, review of their medical charts revealed a large difference

in the proportion who had "do not resuscitate" (DNR) notation on their

charts. Only six of the 51 admissions to the faculty service had DNR

compared with 26 on the connunity service. This could reflect objective

differences in the medical condition of the patients that were not accounted

for by DRG, age, sex, and DTHRISK, or could reflect subjective differences

in patient or physician attitudes. Also, the low use of DNR on the faculty

service may result from administrative difficulties faced by house officers

who must obtain approval from the faculty supervisor in order to put this

notation on the chart. The difference in code status is large, but it does

not explain the differences in costs and outcomes. For 23 pairs where the

faculty and comunity patients had the same code status (21 were "resuscitate"),

the faculty-community differentials were similar to those for all the pairs.

Among the 23 pairs, 19 of the faculty service patients had higher costs.

        A much higher percentage of the comunity service patients were

local residents (could drive to the hospital in less than 30 minutes).

We were able to match 22 pairs by residence zone (19 were in the "local"

zone) but this matching did not reduce the cost differential. Among the

22 pairs, 18 of the faculty service patients had higher costs. The

differential in mortality was smaller than for all the pairs, but the

faculty service patients still had, lower death rates.

        There is no doubt that a higher percentage of the patients on the

faculty service were discharged alive, but there is considerable interest in

knowing how much longer they lived. The last line of Table 5 and Figure 1

provide answers to that question. For 48 pairs it was possible to ascertain

whether the patient lived for at least one year after discharge or, if not,

what the date of death was. The
                                  percentage surviving one year was quite
low, and equal for the two services. Figure 1 shows that there was still

considerable difference in survival rates six months after discharge, but by

nine months the difference between the two services had disappeared.

        Assuming equality in survival from nine months on, we find that the

48 faculty patients lived a total of 56 months longer than the community

service patients from day of admission. The differential in total costs

for the 48 pairs was $264,960. Thus, assuming that the longer survival was

attributable to the greater expenditure, the average cost of an additional

month of life was $4,698.

                                Discussion


        Our study, like studies comparing comunity and teaching hospitals,9''°

found that adjustment for case mix eliminated much of the faculty-community

cost differential in this hospital. Nevertheless, admissions to the faculty

service generated higher costs within DRGs that could not be explained by

other observed.patient characteristics. These higher costs were accompanied

by lower hospital mortality. Both cost and outcome differences were greatest

for the •high-risk group of patients.

        A number of plausible explanations could be offered for these findings,

with distinct and sometimes contradictory implications for health care

financing and for the costs of medical education. These may be divided

into explanations based on differences in physician attributes and practice

patterns, and those based on differences in patient populations.

        The differential in aIjusted costs probably reflects in part the

greater impact on the faculty service of the hospitaPs role as a training

institution and referral center. House officers and medical students have

major responsibilities for the care of patients on the faculty service.

They play no role for two-thirds of the coninunity service, and even when

the community patient is placed in a teaching situation the house staff has
                                       19




 less autonomy than on the faculty service. These trainees, who learn by

 doing procedures and interpreting diagnostic tests, may order such studies

 more readily because of their putative educational value.
                                                               The greater use
 of diagnostic services by trainees may also reflect their unwillingness or

 inability to rely as heavily as the more seasoned private physicians on

 the clinical examination)1

         Physician attitudes toward death may also contribute to the more

 aggressive care of the faculty service. An unwillingness to allow patients

 to die may have driven some house officers to press for more care, even when

 it led to little or no improvement in patient outcome. Private physicians,

who knew their patients better, were more aware of the patients' own wishes

Concerning continued life support. In many cases, the patients' preferences

may not have been known to the faculty physicians, who would have treated

aggressively when in doubt. Finally, the inexperience of house officers

and medical students may have led them to provide some services that had

few benefits for the patient.

        Physicians on the community service typically cared for patients

they had followed for long periods of time prior to hospitalization; thus,

they may have been better able to avoid duplication of tests
                                                               performed
outside the hospital and to minimize other costs associated with the work—up

of new patients. The patients admitted to the faculty service were unlike

community patients in several important ways. Faculty patients fell into

higher cost ORG categories and were less frequently admitted under
                                                                     emergent
conditions. In addition, detailed chart review suggested that seriously

ill patients on the two services differed in less readily quantified dimensions.

Community patients, for instance, were more frequently admitted for purely
                                      20



supportive care and less likely to receive extensive diagnostic work-ups

or to be admitted to the intensive care unit. Since the severity or stage

of illness can vary significantly within the high risk DRGs, control for

DRG will not eliminate this source of variation in service intensity. A

single ORG can include a patient presenting with a metastasis and an unknown

primary tumor requiring extensive diagnostic work-up, as well as a moribund

patient admitted for terminal care.

        Patient attitudes often contribute to variation in the type and

quantity of services provided. Patients suffering the same morbidity and

having the same prognosis will not seek the same care if their attitudes

toward death and toward medical intervention differ. A patient who is

emotionally prepared to die might not consent to intubation, mechanical

ventilation, and cardiac resuscitation, though his equally ill peer might

desire such measures. The latter patient is more likely to seek admission

to a faculty service, with its reputation for aggressive care. The much

higher proportion of "no code" (do not resuscitate) orders on the community

service probably reflects such patient preferences, in addition to differences

in prognosis and physician attitudes.

        Many studies of hospital costs have assumed that hospital output

could be represented by the volume of services provided.2 These measures

have been justly criticized because inappropriate and ineffective care add

to such "output." Patients seek improvements in personal welfare from a

hospital, riot the tests and treatments themselves; improvement in patient

welfare, however, is difficult to measure. Hospital survival is undoubtedly

an important component of welfare, and by this criterion, patients on the

faculty service did better.   En the matched sample of patients for whom
                                      21




 follow-up data were available the faculty patients also
                                                           enjoyed longer
 out-of-hospital survival. The distribution among DRGs and variation in

 other patient characteristics could only partially explain their lower

 mortality rates. Like the cost differentials, the outcomes deviated most

 for the highest risk group of patients and were likely to reflect differences

 in practice patterns as well as in the types of patients seen on each service.

         The more extensive use of diagnostic procedures and the generally

 more aggressive care provided on the faculty service may have reduced

 mortality while generating higher costs. In addition, the patients admitted

 to the faculty service may not have been as sick as their counterparts on

 the comunity service. Just as the patient in an early stage of cancer may

receive a more extensive work-up and more aggressive treatment than a patient

in the final stages of the same illness, he will also be less likely to die

during hospitalization. Because of the preponderance of
                                                           neoplastic diseases,
the variation in disease severity was probably greatest in the high risk

categories. The range of diagnostic and therapeutic decisions made at the

discretion of the physicians was much greater than for the, less risky

illnesses. Consequently, cost and outcome differences were greatest for

such patients.

        Because the patient populations may have differed, these results

do not prove that faculty physicians reduced mortality by providing more

aggressive care. However, if patients on the faculty service were less

likely to die simply because they were better risks, why did the faculty

service attract them? It is unlikely that chance alone could cause so

significant a disparity in patient populations. One explanation is that

community physicians waited longer to admit their patients to the hospital
                                     22



than did their faculty counterparts. By substituting outpatient for inpatient

services, they may have increased the proportion of their patients in the

final stages of illness while reducing hospital costs. Just as an

all-inclusive measure of costs of illness, including out-patient services,

may have shown less discrepancy between the faculty and community, better

control for stage of illness may have reduced the mortality differential.

        Patient perceptions of the difference in practice styles may underlie

systematic differences in the faculty and comunity patient populations.

Those patients who desired or were likely to benefit from more aggressive

care sought, or were referred to, the faculty. Not only did differences

in underlying disease contribute to the mortality differences, but they

determined what kind of care was appropriate. Notably, in the DRGs that

had mainly faculty patients, the faculty patients had lower mortality than

community patients, with similar costs. In the primarily community DRGs,

the community patients had lower costs than faculty patients, with simifar

mortality. It is as if most of the patients were allocated to the service

that would provide the best balance of costs and benefits. Neither the

faculty nor the community medical practice was necessarily better or worse,

merely different. There is no reason to expect or to desire patients with

diverse conditions and attitudes to receive the same care or to have the

same outcomes.

        The differences we observed between the faculty and community services

in the same' hospital are likely to understate the differences between teaching

and community hospitals. In the hospital studied, the same advanced,

specialized facilities were available, to the faculty and community patients,

and house staff participated in the care of some community patients.
                                         23




 Furthermore, faculty and comunity physicians in this hospital undoubtedly

 interacted more closely than faculty and conliIunity physicians in separate

 hospitals, contributing to a more homogeneous style of medicine. On the

other hand, outcome differences in the 12 DRGs we studied were greater than

in other DRGs, which had lower death rates.

         It is difficult to ascertain whether the aggressive care on the

faculty service contributed to lower hospital mortality, and it is even

more difficult to judge whether the reduced mortality was justified by the

cost. In the matched sample of seriously ill patients more than half were

discharged alive, but less than one—fifth survived for as much as one year.

We did not investigate the quality of life for the survivors. Some patients

undoubtedly benefited from the heavy utilization of costly resources, but

it is diffjcultto evaluate the tradeoff between costs and outcomes.

        Even if   the   extra costs on the faculty service are attributable to

education   of house staff and students, without corresponding patient benefits,
these activities may be worthwhile. Then it is appropriate not to ask
whether such costly care should continue, but whether it should be financed

with patient-care revenues. If these services have few educational benefits

and little value to the patient, other methods of training physicians should

be investigated. But if the aggressive services help some patients while

educating house staff, effort should be devoted to identifying the patients

most likely to benefit from such care.

        Patients who would benefit from aggressive care will suffer the

most with implementation of prospective payment. Under prospective payment,

hospitals will have incentives to manipulate discharge diagnoses to fit

patients into higher payment DRGs, to perform surgical procedures that shift

patients to other DRGs, to limit hospital stays, and to minimize daily

expenditures.12 Institutions that continue to practice the high-cost medicine

typical of the faculty service will suffer financial penalties. Less

aggressive services will become more corruiion. Institutions will face the

difficult challenge of both limiting expenditures and continuing to provide

aggressive care to those patients for whom it is appropriate. If hospital

services become more homogeneous, we may see hospital mortality rise.

Policy makers will closely monitor the effects of prospective payment on

expenditures; an important potential consequence of prospective payment will

be overlooked if they do not also monitor outcomes.
