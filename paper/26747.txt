                                         ABSTRACT

We conduct an empirical simulation exercise that gauges the plausible impact of increased rates
of college attainment on a variety of measures of income inequality and economic insecurity.
Using two different methodological approaches--a distributional approach and a causal
parameter approach--we find that increased rates of bachelor's and associate degree attainment
would meaningfully increase economic security for lower-income individuals, reduce poverty and
near-poverty, and shrink gaps between the 90th and lower percentiles of the earnings distribution.
However, increases in college attainment would not significantly reduce inequality at the very top
of the distribution.

I.      INTRODUCTION

        College-educated workers today have much higher levels of earnings, income, and

employment than those without college degrees, with especially large premiums awarded to

those who hold a bachelor's degree or higher. As documented by numerous studies, the relative

employment and earnings outcomes of individuals without a college degree have fared relatively

poorly in the wake of advancements in technology, globalization, and trade, among other factors.

Annual earnings of workers with a college degree or more have risen steadily over the past four

or five decades, while the earnings of those with lower levels of education have stagnated or

fallen (see for example, Autor 2014). Figure 1 shows that the college wage premium--which we

initially define in this figure in accordance with previous literature as the difference in log annual

earnings between those who have received a bachelor's degree and those who have not--

increased steadily from the early 1980s through around 2000, at which point it flattened, but did

not reverse. Today this college/high school wage premium remains at 90 percent and is similar

for men (88 percent) and women (92 percent).1

        Divergence in employment rates have exacerbated trends in relative earnings. Prime-age

adults with no more than a high school degree have experienced a sizable decline in employment

rates in recent decades, while employment rates among college-degree holders have fallen only

slightly. For instance, among men age 25 to 34 with a high school degree but no college,

employment rates fell from 89 to 82 percent between 1999 and 2018, as compared to a dip from

95 to 94 percent among their counterparts with at least a bachelor's degree (Abraham and

Kearney, forthcoming). Not surprisingly, economic insecurity, as captured by the likelihood of

                                                                                                                    2
living in or near poverty, is much higher among the non-college educated. In 2018, 4.4 percent of

college graduates lived below the official federal poverty threshold, as compared to 12.7 percent

of high school graduates and 25.9 percent of adults without a high school degree (Semega et al,

2019).

         The divergent economic outcomes of those with and without a college degree have led

many observers to emphasize the need for increased skill attainment, in particular increased

college attainment, to boost individual economic security and address rising income inequality.

The emphasis on increasing the supply of college graduates to the workforce as a response to the

rise in earnings inequality is consistent with the arguments emphasized in the 2008 book by

Goldin and Katz, The Race Between Education and Technology. The thesis of the book is based

on the canonical supply and demand framework of wage determination. In highly simplified

terms, the basic observation of Goldin and Katz (2008) is that during the 1980s and 1990s, the

demand for college-educated workers rose faster than the supply of college-educated workers,

leading to a rise in their relative wage.2

         In this paper, we conduct a simulation exercise that gauges the plausible impact of

increased rates of college attainment on a variety of measures of income inequality and economic

insecurity. Although several channels for increasing college attainment have been proposed--

including additional funding for higher education institutions, expanded access to free or reduced

tuition for students, and behavioral or information interventions--we set aside any consideration

of the costs or effectiveness of these various approaches to focus on outcomes. The results of this

simulation exercise reveal that a sizable increase in rates of college attainment would

meaningfully increase economic security for individuals near the bottom of the earnings


2
 This point has been suggested in related papers, including but not limited to Goldin and Margo (1992), Katz and
Murphy (1992), and Card and Lemieux (2001).

                                                                                                                   3
distribution. It would also shrink gaps between the 90th percentile and lower half of the earnings

distribution, as well as between the median and bottom in most cases. However, increases in

college attainment would not significantly reduce upper tail inequality or the amount of income

going to earners in the top percentiles. The policy prescription of increased educational

attainment should thus appeal to those whose primary concern is the economic security of poorer

individuals, but it will not satisfy the goals of those whose primary concern is the reduction of

overall income inequality or income shares at the top of the distribution.3



II.     DATA AND METHODS

        A.       Data

        Our primary data source for employment, earnings, income, and poverty status is the

Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey (March CPS), as

provided by IPUMS (Flood et al. 2019). The March CPS provides detailed information on the

composition of annual income for a relatively large, nationally representative sample of

households and is released more quickly than other public datasets that contain earnings.4 To

illustrate changes in earnings and inequality over a longer horizon, we consider both the 1980

survey (covering earnings from 1979) and the 2019 survey (covering earnings from 2018).




3
  This paper builds on a 2015 policy memo that Hershbein and Kearney wrote with Larry Summers and posted on
the Hamilton Project website (Hershbein, Kearney, and Summers, 2015). That memo described the results of
simulating how the distribution of earnings would change if one of every ten men aged 2564 without a bachelor's
degree were to be assigned one, with a random draw from the earnings distribution of existing bachelor's -degree
holders. In this paper, we expand on that earlier analysis by including men and women, considering increased
attainment of both associate and bachelor's degrees, using both a random distribution method and a causal parameter
assignment method, examining multiple thresholds of increased educational attainment, and using current data.
4
  The March CPS microdata are released in the fall of the survey year and contain annual earnings data for the
previous calendar year. American Community Survey (ACS) microdata constitute a larger sample but are released
with a greater delay and contain less detailed earnings data that covers a longer time period due to the staggered
nature of the survey throughout the year. We intend to repeat our simulation exercise with the decennial census and
the ACS, for the sake of comparison.

                                                                                                                 4
        We restrict our sample to adult civilians of prime age, 2554, to minimize concerns about

schooling and retirement decisions.5 We define four mutually exclusive, exhaustive education

categories: less than high school degree, high school graduate, associate degree, and bachelor's

degree or higher. High school degree includes GED holders and those who attended college but

did not get a degree. We measure employment as a binary variable that equals one if an

individual worked a positive number of weeks in the previous calendar year and had positive

labor earnings; we define full-time, full-year workers (FTFY) as those usually working at least

35 hours per week and at least 40 weeks of the year. We define an individual's annual labor

earnings as the sum of wages and salaries and non-negative business income over the same time

period.6 We adjust earnings for inflation to year 2018 dollars using the personal consumption

expenditures (PCE) deflator from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Because poverty status is

based on family rather than individual income, we construct an individual's poverty threshold

ratio by dividing that individual's total family income by the official poverty thresholds for the

individual's family size and type.7

        Table 1 presents summary statistics showing the earnings and income of adults in 1979

and 2018 for different samples. The first row of each panel reports selected percentiles of the real

earnings distributions for all FTFY workers age 25 to 54 in 1979 and 2018, respectively.

Subsequent rows show percentiles of the earnings distribution for men and women separately,



5
  Previous literature has typically focused on the working-age population, 1664, but since our simulation involves
increasing educational attainment, we believe it makes more sense to focus on the population for whom the
additional attainment is more reasonable and exclude those for whom further schooling is less likely.
6
  We exclude from the sample individuals for whom either of these components of earning is imputed. About 1% of
our 1980 and 2019 samples have a component of earnings topcoded. We do not attempt to adjust for topcoding, but
do implement a correction to use current topcoding methods for the 1979 sample, using historical income data
generated by Larrimore et al. (2008).
7
  These thresholds are provided annual by the Census Bureau (see https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-
series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html) and are already included in the IPUMS extracts we
use.

                                                                                                                 5
and then the pooled and gender-specific earnings distributions for all individuals age 25 to 54,

regardless of work status.

        The rise in inequality over this period is evident from these numbers. Among men,

unconditional earnings at the 10th, 25th, and 50th percentiles fell between 1979 and 2018, and

FTFY earnings at these percentiles were generally stagnant or increased only slightly. At the

75th, 90th, and 99th percentiles, however, earnings rose substantially, both unconditionally and for

FTFY men. Among women, both unconditional and FTFY earnings increased at all highlighted

percentiles, but the gains were much larger at the higher end of the distribution. Notably,

earnings are zero at both the 10th and 25th percentiles of the unconditional sample for women in

both 1979 and 2018, and although the 10th percentile of the unconditional earnings distribution is

positive for men in 1979, it is zero in 2018. This sharp decline at the bottom reflects a lower

likelihood of prime-age men having been employed at any point during the year; this likelihood

fell from 92 to 85 percent, with the decline almost entirely concentrated among men without a

college degree.8

        Appendix Table A.1 and Appendix Figure 2 show the earnings distributions of FTFY

workers in 1979 and 2018 by level of education. The table and figure show clearly how earnings

gaps have increased between education groups. For example, in 1979, median earnings among

high school graduate FTFY workers were approximately $38,300 (in 2018 dollars), as compared

to about $53,400 among FTFY workers with a bachelor's degree (BA) or higher. In 2018, the

comparable numbers were $40,000 and $70,000. The gap between the 90th percentile of earnings

among high school graduates and BA holders grew by an even greater amount. In 1979, the 90th

percentile of earnings among high school FTFY workers was roughly $72,600, as compared to

                                                                                                                    6
$113,200 among BA holders, but the comparable numbers in 2018 were $80,000 and $155,000,

a near doubling.

       These increases in wage inequality across education and time have occurred

simultaneously with increases in educational attainment--although, as Goldin and Katz (2008)

have argued, at a slower rate than previously. The first panel of Table 2 shows the shares of the

FTFY prime-age workforce (group A), FTFY male prime-age workforce (group B), FTFY

female prime-age workforce (group C), and all prime-age men (group D) with different levels of

education. Among the FTFY workforce, the share with at least a bachelor's degree has risen

from about one-quarter in 1979 to 45 percent by 2018, with a much more modest increase in the

associate degree share from about 9 to 11 percent. Because of the faster growth in educational

attainment for women relative to men, the educational increases for men specifically are smaller,

with BA-plus shares rising from 26 to 41 percent for FTFY men and from 25 to 36 percent for all

prime-age men, unconditional on work status. Given the observed changes in earnings by

education for different groups, our simulation exercise asks how earnings distributions would

change were the education shares for these groups to be shifted.

       B.      Methods

       We simulate three counterfactual scenarios. Simulation 1 raises the share of the sample--

across the different samples described above--with at least a bachelor's degree (BA share) to 50

percent. Simulation 2 raises the share of the sample with an associate degree (AA share) to 15

percent and the BA share to 50 percent. Simulation 3 raises the AA share to 20 percent and the

BA share to 60 percent. Both new AA holders and new BA holders are drawn from the existing

high school graduate population. For each scenario, we assign the "new" AA and BA holders

simulated earnings in two ways. The distribution method assigns a random draw from the



                                                                                                    7
distribution of existing AA or BA (including those with higher than a BA), conditioning on one

of 12 cells: 10-year age category (2534, 3544, 4554), race (white and other), and sex (male

and female). The causal parameter method assigns a causal estimate of the marginal AA or BA

returns using parameters from the existing literature, as described below.9 One benefit of the

distribution method is that it allows an individual who is currently out of the workforce to be

assigned positive earnings if they are simulated to earn a college degree. The causal parameter

method does not allow for employment responses at the extensive margin. The distribution

method also allows for heterogeneity in treatment effects, whereas the causal parameter method

uses a uniform percentage increase in earnings among the entire sample. On the other hand, the

causal parameter method may come closer to capturing the "marginal" policy parameter of

interest. We thus view the two methods as complements.

        In the causal parameter approach, high school graduates who are assigned an AA receive

a 29 percent annual earnings increase. This estimate is based on averaging the effects found for

associate degree receipt in Bahr et al. (2014) and Stevens et al. (2015). These papers identify

causal estimates using well-established individual fixed-effects methodologies. We assign the

high school graduates who are treated with a BA a 68 percent annual earnings increase. This is

an approximation of the likely causal effect of BA attainment for a marginal student admitted to

a less selective university, based on the findings of Zimmerman (2014). Zimmerman uses a

regression discontinuity approach and estimates that individuals just admitted to a less-selective

state university have a 22 percent increase in earnings 8 to 14 years after high school graduation

relative to those just missing admission. To get an IV estimate of the effect of BA attainment,



9
 While it would be desirable to use group-specific causal returns to different degree levels, the literature has not
produced robust causal estimates for different demographic groups, and so we assign the same AA premium and BA
premium to all individuals who have their college status shifted.

                                                                                                                   8
Zimmerman scales this earnings increase by the probability of attendance conditional on

admissions (49 percent) and the probability of BA completion conditional on attendance (50

percent), yielding an IV estimate of a 90 percent earnings increase as compared to below-

threshold earnings. This is almost surely an upper bound because, as Zimmerman acknowledges,

admission to the university likely affects earnings through other channels, namely, credit

completion without a degree. We thus adjust downward the 90 percent estimate. To do so, we

assume that roughly a quarter (or 5 percentage points) of the 22 percent earnings increase

associated with admission comes from the attendance without completion channel. We thus

apply the scaling to a 17 percent earnings increase, obtaining a 68 percent "IV" estimate of BA

attainment, rather than 90 percent.

        This 68 percent estimate is likely a conservative measure of the earnings premium

because it does not allow for the additional earnings premium that would be associated with a

more selective institution.10 Based on a regression discontinuity admissions cutoff at a more

selective university than the one considered by Zimmerman (2014), Hoekstra (2009) estimates a

20 percent local average treatment effect on earnings of enrolling at a state flagship university, as

compared to the likely counterfactual of attending a less selective institution. Thus, a reasonable

extension to the assignment of a 68 percent causal parameter (which we do not incorporate)

would be to assign some share of new BA holders an additional (multiplicative) 20 percent

premium.

        In both the distribution and causal parameter method, we further adjust earnings for the

relative wage effect that is likely to result from an increase in the share of the population with a



10
   Additionally, the baseline earnings from which Zimmerman's estimates are drawn include some individuals who
attend community colleges, whose earnings may be somewhat higher than those of high school graduates without
any college attendance.

                                                                                                                 9
college degree. To incorporate this relative wage response into our simulation exercise, we

follow the common paradigm in the academic literature, as described in Autor and Acemoglu

(2011), and specify a two-factor CES production function model. In one case, the model includes

BA and high school degree workers, and in the other case, the model includes AA and high

school degree workers.

         Appendix C describes our methodology for estimating relative wage effects and presents

the resulting relative wage responses. We estimate that within our sample, a 1 percent increase in

the relative supply of labor with a BA or more to non-BA high school graduates will narrow the

relative wage premium by 0.25 percent; analogously, a 1 percent increase in the relative supply

of AA-degree holders to high school graduates will decrease that relative wage premium by 0.18

percent.11 For instance, the first simulation raises the BA completion rate from 45.1 to 50.3

percent for our FTFY sample (group A in Table 2). In terms of relative supply effects in the

labor market, considering all adults (not just FTFY or prime-age) and weighting each individual

by their hours worked last year, this amounts to a change from 41.5 to 44.7 percent, which is

roughly a 14 percent increase in the hours-weighted relative supply of BA to non-BA labor

[0.415/(10.415) = 0.708; 0.447/(10.447) = 0.808; 0.808/0.708 = 1.141]. Thus, our simulation

adjusts for a 0.14 * 0.25  4 percent narrowing of the wage premium. This narrowing is assumed

to fall equally on each group, raising non-BA earnings by 2 percent and lowering BA earnings

(including BA-plus) by 2 percent. Because we draw from the pool of high school graduates to

assign college degrees, the relative supply of associate degree holders and high school graduates

also changes for the first simulation, with this ratio increasing by 7 percent, leading to a 0.07 *


11
  Although the relative wage parameter estimates from the regressions are defined for (i) BA (including BA-plus)
and high school graduates, and (ii) AA and high school graduates, when applying the adjusted wages to the
population, we include individuals without a high school degree in the lower-skill group, implicitly treating them as
perfect substitutes.

                                                                                                                   10
0.18  1 percent narrowing of that wage premium. When both AA and BA attainment is

changed, as in Simulations 2 and 3, we narrow the wage premia sequentially: first adjusting the

AA/high school wage premium, then narrowing the BA/high school wage premium. In

Simulation 2, the AA/high school wage premium narrows by 7 percent and the BA/high school

wage premium shrinks by 4 percent. In Simulation 3, the wage premia fall by 22 and 11 percent,

respectively.



III.   RESULTS

       Table 2 shows the practical impact of the three simulations on the numbers and shares of

degree holders for four samples: all FTFY workers, FTFY men, FTFY women, and all men

unconditional on work status. We focus on these four samples because the unconditional sample

of women includes a large share of non-workers. As shown in the top panel, in 2018 45.1 percent

of FTFY prime-age workers held at least a BA and 10.9 percent held an AA. (Among all adults

age 25 to 54, 39.9 percent held at least a BA and 10.7 percent held an AA; not shown in the

table). Simulation 1 raises the BA share to 50 percent, which is a modest increase when the

sample is limited to FTFY workers. For the full sample of prime-age individuals, this increase is

more substantial, requiring that 11.1 million more adults hold a bachelor's degree (from 39.9

million to 51.0 million; not shown in the table). Simulation 2 maintains the bachelor's degree

share increase to 50 percent and adds an increase in the share of the sample with associate

degrees to 15 percent; while the latter is only a 45 percentage point bump from 2018 levels, it

represents a relatively large proportional increase. Simulation 3 increases the respective shares to

60 and 20 percent. This requires an additional 21 million more prime-age adults to hold a

bachelor's degree and 9.9 million more to hold an associate degree, which are ambitiously large


                                                                                                  11
gains; even among the FTFY sample, the respective increases are 10 million and 6.2 million

(group A, Table 2). As described above, the simulation imparts new degrees to the current

population of high school graduates, which in 2018 composed 40.1 percent (41.4 million) of

prime-age adults and 37.7 percent (24.8 million adults) of prime-age FTFY workers.12

        Table 3 illustrates how one of our counterfactual simulations affects the earnings

distribution. It reports both observed earnings percentiles and simulated earnings percentiles, for

each simulation, using the distribution method, for all FTFY workers, FTFY men, FTFY women,

and all men. The simulations raise earnings in all four samples for roughly the lower three-

quarters of the earnings distribution, with the strongest gains in the middle. The highest

percentiles, however, show much smaller gains, or even losses among FTFY men, due to the

general equilibrium effects that lower the college wage premium.

        We are particularly interested, however, in how these changes affect distributional

outcomes. Table 4a thus reports percentile earnings ratios for the sample of all prime-age FTFY

workers, including changes based on all three simulations, according to both the distribution and

causal parameter methods. As can be seen in the table, there were large increases in the 90/10,

90/25, and 90/50 percentile earnings ratios between 1979 and 2018, reflecting disproportionate

growth at the top of the distribution (Table 1). However, there was actually a slight decrease in

the 50/10 ratio over this period.

        As the lower panel of Table 4a indicates, the simulation of a sizable increase in the rate of

bachelor's degree attainment would lead to meaningful reductions in earnings ratios between the

90th and lower percentiles among FTFY workers, and this is true for either simulation method, as



12
   Note that the simulations for the first three groups (FTFY samples) are based on raising education for all FTFY
workers by the stated amounts, not men and women separately in the FTFY men and FTFY women samples. For the
all-men group, education is raised for all (prime-age) men by the stated amount.

                                                                                                               12
both produce similar results. For example, the 90/10 ratio increased from 4.63 to 5.45 between

1979 and 2018. Simulation 3 (increasing AA rates to 20 percent and BA rates to 60 percent)

would bring that ratio down to 5.16 (distribution method) or 5.00 (causal parameter method),

reversing from more than half to all of the actual increase over this period.13 As suggested by

Table 3, the reduction stems from increases in the 10th percentile of FTFY earnings and smaller

proportional change at the 90th percentile. The same simulation also substantially reduces the

90/50, 90/25, and 50/25 earnings ratios, although the reductions are less dramatic. Simulations 1

and 2, which involve smaller shifts in degree attainment, produce correspondingly smaller, but

still sizable, reductions in these inequality measures. Interestingly, the causal parameter method

produces slightly larger reductions in the percentile ratios than the distribution method, and the

difference increases as the simulation becomes more extreme in the education shifts.14

         The estimates reported in Table 4a incorporate relative wage effects estimated using data

from 1979 to 2018. If we instead estimate relative wage effects using data from 1963 to 2018,

consistent with previous literature, the depressive effect of increased BA attainment on relative

wages would be larger and the depressive effect of increased AA attainment on relative wages

would be smaller (as shown in Appendix Tables C.1 and C.2). Appendix Table A.3 reproduces

the results from Table 4a using these relative wage effects instead. As can be seen in the table,

the simulated reductions in the 90/10 and 90/25 wage ratios are even larger. Simulation 3 reduces

the 90/10 ratio to 4.85 (distribution method) and 4.64 (causal parameter method). It reduces the

90/25 ratio to 3.50 (distribution method) and 3.29 (causal parameter method).


13
   Appendix Table A.2 reports the analogous results when relative wage effects are not taken into account. The
resulting reductions in inequality are, as expected, smaller, especially for the causal parameter method. For instance,
the simulated 90/10 earnings ratio under simulation 3 becomes 5.20 according to both methods, as compared to 5.06
and 4.95 when relative wages are adjusted.
14
   This gap likely relates to the large earnings variance among college graduates; while the causal parameter method
unambiguously increases earnings, the distribution method can result in some "treated" individuals having their
earnings reduced, if the draw is sufficiently bad.

                                                                                                                    13
        Tables 4b and 4c report results separately for FTFY men and women, using our baseline

approach. As in the pooled sample, the results from both the distribution and causal parameter

methods show that for both men and women, a sizable increase in the rate of bachelor's degree

attainment would lead to meaningful reductions in earnings ratios between the 90th and lower

percentiles. For example, among FTFY men, the 90/10 ratio increased between 1979 and 2018

from 3.86 to 5.58; simulation 3 would bring that ratio down to 5.18 (distribution method) or 5.04

(causal parameter method), reducing the increase in inequality by up to one-third. Among FTFY

women, the 90/10 ratio increased from 3.6 to 5.0; simulation 3 would bring that ratio down to

4.44 (distribution method) or 4.28 (causal parameter method), reducing the increase in inequality

by about one half. Sizable reductions are also observed for the 90/25 and 50/25 ratios. Again, we

see only small reductions (or for FTFY women, increases) in the 99/90 ratio, consistent with the

rising dispersion in earnings among college graduates.15 The causal parameter method produces

slightly larger reductions in the percentile ratios than the distribution method, but these should be

interpreted with caution as we do not have separate causal parameter estimates for men and

women.

        As discussed above, employment rates for prime-age men have fallen over time,

especially for less-educated prime-age men. Thus, it is also illustrative to examine how our

simulations would affect earnings ratios and employment rates (proxied by positive earnings) for

all prime-age men, regardless of work status. Table 4d reports observed and simulated earnings

ratios for this latter sample.16 As the 10th percentile of earnings for this sample is zero in both

1979 and 2018, we omit ratios with the 10th percentile in the denominator. The remaining ratios


15
  These reductions would likely be even smaller with better corrections for topcoded earnings.
16
  We do not report analogous results for the unconditional pooled sample of men and women or women separately,
as 34.6 percent of women reported no earnings in 1979, making comparisons of unconditional earnings ratios over
time less meaningful.

                                                                                                             14
all experienced large increases over the nearly 40-year period, chiefly driven by reductions in

earnings at the lower (and even middle) percentiles, which are in turn a symptom of the 7-point

reduction in employment rates. The causal method is less useful for this sample, since it only

increases earnings of those with positive earnings and does not allow for an extensive margin

effect on employment. Not surprisingly, the simulated effects on income inequality for this

sample are smaller at the lower end using the causal method than the distribution method. The

distribution method results show that increasing the BA rate to 60 percent and the AA rate to 20

percent could lead to meaningful reductions in the 50/25 and 90/25 unconditional earnings ratios.

The 50/25 ratio, which rose from 1.71 to 2.18, would fall to 1.88. The 90/25 ratio, which rose

from 3.33 to 6.00, would fall to 4.83. As expected, the more intense simulations are associated

with larger reductions. The distribution method simulation also suggests the employment rate

would rise by 1.22.8 percentage points, suggesting gains below the 25th percentile not captured

by the displayed ratios.17

        Table 5 reports the results of the simulated increase in college attainment on measures of

individual level economic insecurity, as captured by four poverty measures: deep poverty (family

income less than 50 percent of the federal poverty threshold), poverty (family income less than

the poverty threshold), near poverty (family income less than 150 percent of the threshold), and

low income (family income less than 200 percent of the federal poverty threshold). Here we

follow official rules and define an individual's poverty status by whether that individual's family

income is less than the corresponding Census poverty threshold, which varies by family size and




17
  We consider the employment rate to have increased when individuals switch from zero to positive earnings under
the simulation. The causal parameter method affects only the intensive margin and thus the employment rate is
unchanged by this method.

                                                                                                              15
composition.18 As reported in the table, all four measures of poverty increased between 1979 and

2018 among adults age 25 to 54. The share of prime-age adults living below the poverty line

increased from 8.2 to 11.3 percent, and the share living in deep poverty increased from 3.0 to 5.6

percent.

         To simulate the effect on poverty of increased college attainment, we calculate simulated

poverty rates by taking an individual's 2018 family income and adding any of their own

additional earnings assigned by the simulation. Our calculation assumes family structure is fixed

and there is no induced change in other family members' earnings; nor does it adjust income for

any changes in taxes and transfers that would result from an increase in family earnings. Because

this approach ignores any potential increase in taxes and reduction in transfer benefits, it likely

overstates the increase in "true" household income and corresponding reduction in poverty. (An

obvious exception is that some households might see an increase in their Earned Income Tax

Credit.) However, because in-kind transfers and taxes are excluded from official poverty

estimates, our approach is reasonable when using that measure as reference.19

         Based on the results of applying the distribution method, the simulated effect of

increasing the BA share to 60 percent and the AA share to 20 percent is to reduce the poverty

rate by 2.39 percentage points, from 11.3 to 8.91 percent in the sample using all civilian adults

age 25 to 54. Reductions in the near-poverty or low-income rate are larger, with the first falling

from 18.5 to 14.2 percent, and the second falling from 26.5 to 20.4 percent. Both of these


18

https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty/guidance/poverty-measures.html.
19
   We experimented with using the NBER Taxsim model to adjust family income for taxes; however, since Taxsim
calculates taxes owed and credits received, but does not include information about transfer benefits, the estimated
numbers are still not an accurate measure of what would likely happen to household income net of taxes and
transfers if earnings increased. In any case, the effects on poverty calculations are likely to be small because official
poverty statistics do not adjust household income for taxes paid or tax credits received, nor do they include in-kind
benefits such as SNAP. We have thus decided to report two benchmark estimates for poverty effects, one that
simply adds earnings to existing household income and one that calculates poverty rates based only on earnings.

                                                                                                                       16
simulated rates are lower than their actual levels in 1979. The rate in deep poverty also falls, but

only modestly, from 5.6 to 5 percent. This reflects the fact that very few people with a high

school degree live in deep poverty (7.1 percent). To decrease rates of deep poverty, an

intervention that targets high school dropouts (who have a deep-poverty rate of 12.7 percent)

would likely be more effective.

       The corresponding estimates from the causal parameter method imply smaller reductions

of roughly half the magnitude of those from the distribution method. This, in large part, reflects

that the former method does not allow for changes in the likelihood of employment and only

increases earnings for those who have positive earnings, while the latter method allows for these

changes, which are particularly likely to affect (near-) poverty measures.

       Appendix Table A.4 reports the results from calculating poverty rates using only

observed family earnings, ignoring other sources of income. These rates do not correspond to

official poverty statistics, but they allow us to gauge rates of economic self-sufficiency, as

captured by the share of prime-age adults in families who earn enough money to live above the

federal poverty threshold, or multiples thereof. In 2018, 19.5 percent of individuals lived in

families with earnings less than the federal poverty threshold, up from 17.2 percent in 1979.

Using the distribution method, raising the BA share to 50 percent would reduce this poverty

measure to 17.3 percent, back to its 1979 level; additionally raising the AA share to 15 percent

would reduce this poverty rate to 16.8 percent, and raising the BA share to 60 percent and the

AA share to 20 percent would further reduce the poverty rate to 14.8 percent. This total reduction

of 4.65 percentage points would correspond to 6 million fewer prime-age adults in poverty

(based on 2018 Census population counts). Similar declines would occur for the other poverty

thresholds.



                                                                                                   17
       The reduction in poverty rates from simulations using the causal parameter method is

much smaller, for the reasons discussed above. The difference in the simulated effects of poverty

rates between the two methods highlights how important the effect of increased college

attainment on the employment margin is for poverty avoidance and basic economic security.

       We further consider what increased college attainment of prime-age individuals could do

for child poverty rates. The results are presented in Appendix Table A.5. The share of children in

poverty (calculated using our data and the official federal poverty threshold) held steady between

1979 and 2018: 16.79 percent and 16.83 percent. These simulations suggest that the increased

household earnings associated with increasing the BA attainment rate to 60 percent and the AA

rate to 20 percent would reduce child poverty rates to 13.47 percent (distribution method) or

14.84 percent (causal parameter method.) There would be an even larger percentage point

reduction in the share of children living in households with income less than 200 percent of the

poverty rate. Increased economic security among children should be considered a key benefit

that would result from more educated prime-age adults, many of whom are parents to young

children.



IV.    CONCLUSION

       In this analysis we have simulated the effects of increasing college attainment, both

bachelor's and associate degrees, of men and women age 25 to 54 to gauge the likely effects on

earnings and earnings inequality. We have conducted the simulation using two distinct

approaches. The distribution method assigns individuals whose college status is randomly shifted

a draw from the earnings distribution of college-educated workers. The causal parameter method

assigns workers whose college status is randomly shifted a single earnings premium, based on



                                                                                                   18
existing studies in the literature. Both approaches suggest that increasing the educational

attainment of adults without a college degree will increase their average earnings, with gains

concentrated in the lower half of the earnings distribution. The distribution method further allows

for an increase in the likelihood of work, which is particularly important for raising earnings at

the bottom of the distribution. The results of the simulation also show meaningful reductions in

rates of poverty and near-poverty (family income less than 200 percent of the federal poverty

threshold). Increasing rates of college degree attainment will also moderately reduce inequality,

mostly by raising the lower-middle part of the earnings distribution relative to the upper-middle.

However, increased college attainment will have minimal effects on reducing overall inequality

back to the levels in 1979, as a greater share of the population with college degrees will not

meaningfully affect earnings at the highest parts of the distribution, where much of the rise in

inequality has taken place.

       In this paper we have provided a quantitative approximation to what could be achieved in

terms of reduced income inequality and increased individual economic security through a

meaningful, albeit feasible, increase in the share of prime-age adults with a college degree. We

have not attempted to argue for or against any particular way of achieving that result, though

obviously the question of how to achieve increased college attainment is of the utmost

importance. Nor have we made the claim that increasing college attainment is sufficient to

address the current degree of income inequality or income insecurity. We view the results of this

analysis as suggesting that increasing college attainment is an important potential response to the

rise in income inequality.

Note: Statistics are calculated for civilian men and women ages 25 to 54. Earnings are defined as the sum of annual wage, salary, and positive business
income, adjusted for inflation (to 2018 dollars) using the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Employment
is defined as having positive earnings in the reference year, and full-time, full-year workers are those working at least 40 weeks in the previous calendar year
and at least 35 hours usually worked per week.

Note: Statistics are calculated for civilian men and women ages 25 to 54. Earnings are defined as the sum of annual wage, salary, and positive business
income, adjusted for inflation (to 2018 dollars) using the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Employment
is defined as having positive earnings in the reference year, and full-time, full-year workers are those working at least 50 weeks in the previous calendar year
and at least 35 hours usually worked per week. See text for description of education categories.

Note: "FPL" is the federal poverty threshold as calculated by the Census Bureau for different family structures. Unlike Table 5, po verty rates here are
calculated relative to total wage, salary, and positive business income --but not other cash transfers or unearned income--in each household. Changes in
poverty rates reflect changes to each household member's earnings through treatment or general equilibrium effects.

Appendix C: Estimation of Wage Premia and CES Substitution Elasticity Estimates
C.1: Wage Premia
Construction of Relative Wage Series
We calculate composition-adjusted BA/high school and AA /high school relative wages overall and by
age or experience using the March CPS sample. These data are sorted into sex-education-experience
groups based on a breakdown of the data into two sexes, six education categories (high school dropout,
high school graduate, some college, associate's degree, college plus, and greater than college), and four
potential experience categories (0­9, 10­19, 20­29, and 30+ years). Log weekly wages of full-time, full-
year workers are regressed in each year separately by sex on the dummy variables for four education
categories, a quartic in experience, black and other race dummies, and interactions of the experience
quartic with three broad education categories (high school graduate, some college, and college plus).
The (composition-adjusted) mean log wage for each of the 48 groups in a given year is the predicted log
wage from these regressions evaluated for whites at the relevant experience level (5, 15, 25, or 35 years
depending on the experience group). Mean log wages for broader groups in each year represent
weighted averages of the relevant (composition-adjusted) cell means using a fixed set of weights, equal
to the mean share of total hours worked by each group over 1963 to 2018 (or 1979-2018, depending on
the specification) from the March CPS.

Construction of Relative Supply Measures
We calculate BA/high school and AA/high school relative supply measures using the March CPS
sample. We form a labor "quantity sample" equal to total hours worked by all employed workers
(including those in self-employment) with 0 to 39 years of potential experience in 48 gender-education-
potential experience cells: experience groups are ten-year categories of 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, and 30-39
years; education groups are high school dropout, high school graduate, some college, associate's degree
holder, college graduate, and post-college. The quantity data are merged to a corresponding "price
sample" containing real mean full-time weekly (March CPS) wages by year, gender, potential
experience, and education. (Wage data used for the price sample correspond to the earnings samples
described above.) Wages in each of the 48 earnings cells in each year are normalized to a relative wage
measure by dividing each by the wage of high school graduate males with ten years of potential
experience in the contemporaneous year. We compute an "efficiency unit" measure for each gender-
experience-education cell as the arithmetic mean of the relative wage measure in that cell over 1964
through 2018 (or 1979-2018). The quantity and price samples are combined to calculate relative log
college/high school and log associate's degree/high school supplies. We define the efficiency units of
labor supply of a gender-education-potential experience group in year t as the efficiency unit wage
measure multiplied by the group's quantity of labor supply in year t. Following Autor, Katz, and
Krueger (1998) and Card and Lemieux (2001), we calculate aggregate college-equivalent labor supply
as the total efficiency units of labor supplied by college or college-plus workers plus half of the
efficiency units of labor supplied by workers with some college. Similarly, aggregate high school­
equivalent labor supply is the sum of efficiency units supplied by high school or lower workers, plus
half of the efficiency units supplied by workers with some college. Our BA/high school (and AA/high
school) log relative supply index is the natural logarithm of the ratio of BA-equivalent to non-BA-
equivalent (or AA/non-AA) labor supply (in efficiency units) in each year. This measure is calculated
overall for each year and by ten-year potential experience groupings.


                                                                                                      38
C.2: Elasticity Estimates
BA/HS Elasticity of Substitution
We then use these measures of relative wages and relative supply to create estimates of how the wage
premia will respond to changes in the relative supply from our simulations. Following Acemoglu and
Autor (2011), we begin with a constant elasticity of supply production function with two inputs: high-
high skill labor (proxied for by those with a BA or more) and low-skill labor (high school graduates),
                                                                            
                                              -1                   -1       -1
                             = [( )                + (  )               ]        ,
where  is the elasticity of substitution between high- and low-skill labor, and AL and AH are factor-
augmenting technology terms. We can express the log wage premium as a function of relative supply
and technology,

                                               - 1      1  
                        ln w1 = ln     =           ( ) -  ( ).
                                                         
Allowing for a log-linear time trend for demand of skills, we can then estimate the following equation:

                              - 1      - 1                     1 
       ln w1 = ln     =           0 +                     -     ( ) .                                  (1)
                                        1                       
The resulting coefficient on the relative supply term (from the above log-log specification) measures
what percent the wage premium will fall for a given percent increase in the relative supply of BA
holders.


AA/HS Elasticity of Substitution
To estimate the analogous relative supply effects for a change in the AA/HS relative supply, we amend
the above two-factor production function to allow for a nest within the "low-skill" input: Associate
Degree holders (M) and those with a high school degree (L).
                                                                                              
                                                               -1                             -1
                                                               
                                   -1            -1 -1                               -1
               = [( (                   +            )     )        + (  )                ]        ,


where now  is the elasticity of substitution between high- and low-skill labor,  measures the elasticity
with the low-skill labor nest, and  and  are also factor-augmenting technology terms. We can express
the log wage premium as a function of relative supply and technology,
As above, we can express the AA/High School premium as

                             - 1       1  
            ln 2 = ln     =       ( ) -  ( ).
                                          
                                                                                                             39
Allowing for a log-linear time trend in demand for skills driven yields

                                 - 1      - 1     1  
                 ln 2 = ln    =      0 +      1  -  ( ).                               (2)
                                                     
Estimates
Table C.1 presents estimates of equation (1) above for several sample restrictions. The post-1992
interaction is included to allow for an evident trend change in the demand for skills around 1992. Using
the same data and methodology as Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and data from 1963 to 2008 (as they do),
we are able to replicate their coefficient estimate of -0.644 (reported in Table 8 of their handbook
chapter). In this table we we extend the data through 2018 and obtain an estimated coefficient on the
relative BA/HS supply of -0.712. Because our simulations include only 25-54 year-olds and are
restricted to the period from 1979 to 2018, it seems appropriate to restrict the estimating data to that age
group and time period. Column (2) uses data back to 1963, but restricts the sample to 25-54 year-olds.
Column (3) restricts the estimating data to our population sample and later time period. We incorporate
the estimate from Column (3) in our main specifications; it implies that a one percent increase in the
relative supply of college graduates (relative to high school graduates) will reduce the wage premium by
0.25 percent.

Table C.2 presents estimates of equation (2), the response of the AA/High School or wage premium to
changes in the AA/HS-less relative supply. We include the same progression of sample restrictions as
before. These estimates are more stable than the BA/HS data above. Column (3), with the preferred
sample, suggests that a one percent increase in the AA/HS-less relative supply leads to a 0.18 percent
decrease in that wage premium.
