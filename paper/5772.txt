                                           ABSTRACT



       The fiscal gains from, and hence the political incentives to, an increase in inflation rate of

ten percentage points may be substantial: with Swedish data from 1994, these gains would have been

an annual real flow of 3-4 percent of GDP, or a capitalized value of nearly 100 percent of GDP.

They would mainly have arisen from the nominalistic features of the tax and transfer systems rather

than from the traditional sources: seignorage and real depreciation of the public debt. The welfare

costs of such an inflation increase would have been even larger, however, and would thus have

reduced net welfare. Possible institutional reforms, aimed at making the political costs of inflation

more equal to the social costs, are presented and discussed.

      Can higher inflation dimitish the government debt and contribute to fiancing         the budget

deficit?   And how do these public fiance     concerns influence tiationary      expectations?   These

have &n     classic qu=tions in mwroeconoti         since the seminal papers by Auernheimer (1974),

Calvo (1978) and Barro (1983). The same questions recently hme               very relevant for several

European countries in the aftermath of the 1992-93 ERM crisis. In Sweden, our own country,

the government deficit in 1994 stood at about 1370 of GDP. 1 Increasing long bond rates and a

depreciating krona —aa well aa higher volatility in hancial       markets—were often explained by

a fear that “politicians wotid lose control of government tiancea and ~rt           to higher inflation

as a solution.”   Developments in other muntries with high debts and deficits, such as Italy or

Spain, were similar.

      Discussions of these issues in the media and in 6nancial markets are, however, sometimes

both simplistic and somewhat confused. In this paper we take the case of Sweden in 1994 as a

concrete example and try to answer four specfic questions. (1) How mu& wotid government

fiances have improved with a higher itiation rate? (2) What wotid the s~id          -ts   and benefits

of such a policy have been? (3) What political inoentivea and power did the government have

h increase the itiation    rati?   (4) What mess-       or reforms would reduce the likelihood that

bad public finances promote higher i~ation?          Even though we study a specific country in a

spectic time period, the four questions we deal with are of much more general interest. Our

discussions highlight the preferen-      of policymakera and the constraints imposed on them by

the institutions in the politi co-economic decision process. We thus adopt the new approsch in

macroeconomic research that tries to endogenize monetary and fid                 policy.2

    Section 1 introdu=       some notation and providea a formal background to our calctiations

by separating the government’s intertemporal budget constraint inti th-                 components that are

sensitive to the inflation rate and those that are not. This section also makes pr=ise some of

the assurnptiom behind the analysis h follow.

    %tion    2 contains our catiationa    of the budgetary gains in a high-ifiation          scenario relative

to a low-inflation -nario.     To determine the effects of higher Mation          we take a starting point

in 1994. Specifically, we consider government expenditm               and taxes -rding          to their 1994

rules, and the government’s net fiancial      position in 1994. We express the r-ults in two Merent

ways. One measure is the budget improvement in a single year: 1998. The other measure is the

discounted present value (in 1994) of the budgetary gains from all future years. We thus look

at the effects on the government’s profit-loss -U.nt          for 1998 and on its balance sheet for 1994.

    Our caltiations   in Section 2 reveal that the high tition          scenario entails substantial bud-

getary gaim. In %tion        3 we discuss the socti       custs and benefits of such a policy, relative to

an alternative where government fiances         are instead stabilized by direct budget cuts or tax

incr~.      We argue that the idationary       route entails the higher social costs.

    In Section 4, however, we argue that the politid -t-a of the inflationary rouk are likely

to appear lower than the social costs. We also argue that the existing Swedish policymaking

imtitutiona not only give the Politid       bodies the inmntive, but dso the power, h steer the

Swedish Riksbank towards an mmmodating             monetary policy that implements a high tiation

-nario.

    Given tb     ~clusiona,     it is not surprising if the Riksbank’s 2% idation             target came to

lack credibility in 1994. In Section 5, we di~            how such credibility problems affect the &

gains from high fition       and show that the additional mts         are indd     substantial.

    Th-     additional costs reinforce the conclusion that the incentives in 1994 to choose a high-

inflation solution to the M           problem seemed considerable. Since a return to the high tiation

rates of the seventies and eighties wotid, -rding               to our etimat=,      reduce net social welfare,

it is of interest to discuss measures and institutional reforms that would reduce the risks for a

return h high inflation. This is done in Section 6. -                  measures and reforms can be seen as

mechanisms ti bring the ~litid            costs of high inflation cl=r        in line with the social costs.



1 PREL-~


This section clti=        the nature of om dculations        in the mntixt of an intertemporal government

budget mnstraint, We also spell out the b=ic assumption                 behind the analysis to follow,

    Comider a on-=tor              model without mmrtainty.       The government’s expenditures, receipts,

and debt issue in yw          t must obey the budget comtraint


             (Ptgt+ Gt) + (R tb + t~t) =                                                                        (1)

             (~t+I    - ~t)    +   (Ptti +~t(mt)) +    ~    Qti [P. (t+l~v- t~.)+ (t+l~v        -   tB.)]   .
                                                      U=t+1

The fit     term on the left-hand-side of (1) represents total expenditures, including tramfer

payments, but excluding debt serv~.            For some expenditw,        ~, the government’s commitment

is &ed    in real terms; their nominal value is ~t~, Pt being the year t prim level,                    For other

expenditures, Gt, the government’s titment                   is ins~   fied     in nominal terms.

   The mnd           term represents government debt service. Let the vector {tB~}~=t denote claims

on the government (possibly negative), by the private sector, to future wney.                That is, tBV is the

sum of intereat payment and maturing principal in year v on the outstanding nominal government

debt.    Similarly, the vector {tbv}~=t denotea the private =tors                claims on the government to

future goods; i.e. the stream of future inte~t         and amortization on indexed mm foreign-currency

denominated debt (see further below). With this notation, (Pt t& + tBt) is total debt servioe,

in year t, on the outstanding government debt.

   The right hand side of (1) wptures government revenue. Let Qt. denote the year t prti                        of


                                                         3
one unit of money in period v. Then, the last term is the market value of tital debt issued in

year t. The fit      term is the value of new money printed in year t. The second term, fially,

repr-nts      total tax receipts at t. As expenditurea and debt, it is d-reposed        into a real and a

nominal component.       Note, however, that we have written the nominal mmponent M a function

of the inflation rate Tt(nt). This function capturea various non-neutrality-,           whereby effwtive

tax rat-     depend on the rati of inflation.

       It will be mnvenient to di-unt    future expenditurea and receipts back ti our starting year

94 (for 1994). For this purpose, detie          the nominal discount factir Dt and the real discount

factor &, by


                                        Dt    =                                                         (2)
                                                   X*:1       + ~v)
                                                          1
                                        ~.
                                                   ~“*    (1+ TV)‘

where i. &not=        the nominal interest rati from year v – 1 to year v, and rv denota                the

mrresponding real interest rate. The latter is de6ned by (1 + it) = (1 + rz) (1 + ~t) , where the

inflation rate XL in turn, is defied    w (1 + nt) = P.t/P”.l.        Normalizing the initial price level,

P., to unity, we may thus write Pt = ~=~+1 (1 + TV). It follows from these detitions             that


                                                  DtPt =&.                                              (3)


To writi the government’s budget constraint on present value form, multiply each of the budget

constraints in (1) with the compounding           nominal di-mt       factor Dt, and replace the market

pri-     Qu with Du in each exp-sion.        Then, add the rewritten budget comtraints from year 94

to aJ together and simplify the reatiting expression, to get




where m &not-         real bala-    w = Mt/Pt.3 In words, (4) simply shows that the real present

value of total government expenditurea at year 94 is constrained by the real present value of total




                                                      4
tax payments including the itiation              tax, less the market value of the outstanding government

debt including the initial money stock.

      An alternative and useful way to expr=                the government’s intertemporal budget constraint

is to follow Pe=n,      Persson and Svensson (1987) and define “rd”                       and “nominal mh   flows” as


                                .gZt =          G–gt-ab                                                           (5)

                             ~Zt       =        Tt(nt) + (Mt+l – Mt) – Gt – .Bt


The r-l    cash flow in year t is the excess of tax payments defied                  in real terms over expenditure

defied    in real terms less debt service on the indexed part of government debt.                      The nominal

csah flow in year t thus summarizes those parts of the budget that are sensitive to the realid

path for pri=,    either because they are defined b nominal te~                     or b=~       they depend on the

idation    rati in some other fashion. Expressions (4) and (5) imply:

                            m
                                                   2=
                                            P~ )x*
                                           at
                                       azt+—    =                  (4 SZt+ ~t SZt) = 0,                           (6)


where the fit     equality follows from (3). The pr=nt                value of total government cash flow is thus

unstrained     b be zero.



1.1    BASIC      ASSUMPTIONS


The effect on government tiances of two Werent                     paths for the pria level will be considered in

our dctiations.      In the low infldion          scenario we have


                             7rt = 7rL = %,                               t = 95, ....m.                          (7)

                                 ~t —.

                                                   —       = dt ((1 + ni)mt+l   – mt) =

                                                               5
in -rdance         with the Riksbank’s explicitly stati            itiation      target, a 2% inflation rate from

1994 and onwarda. In the higkinfi~tin                 -nario,    the itiation        rate is imtead 10 ~rcentage

points higher indefitely:4


                                Tt=7r     H = 1270,                        i!= 95, ....W.                           (8)


    We assume that Sweden is a small open -nomy                  so that we mn take the ex ante real interest

rate (gross of tax) w given from the world market. Furthermore, the same real interest rate will

apply to indexed and foreign —currencydenominated debt. We assume that


                                   rt = r = 570,                       t= 95, ....m.                                (9)


the real interest rate stays comtant at 5%.

    We must ~unt            for growth in mme of our calculation                 Denote the ~wth       rate between

year t – 1 and t by nt, . Then we sssume that


                                   ~=n=       2%,                      t = 95, ...lm.                            (lo)


    A tial     simplifying assumption is that money is neutral: the real path of the =nomy                           is

basically unaffected by the higher inflation rate .5 Specifically, we assume that relative prices

and real wagea in all sectors are unfited,                 so that ral        government consumption d-           not

change. This is obviowly           a strong a8aumption, given various non-neutralitia               in the -nomy.

One way to look upon our calctiations is that they measure the “impact effect” of a higher

itiation     rate and thus the immediate “temptation”                  k    solve the fiscal problem with higher

inflation.
   4Of course a jump in the inflationrate of 10 percentagepointi within a given year is unlikely;in mlity higher

Mation WOUMcome about more grsdudy. But our calculationsin the high-inflation=nario                  ean be interpreted

as a 12% amge iuflationfor the period 1994-98 and a stabk 12% Mation rate the-r.

rate. Rom (5)-(6), a straightforward summary m-ure              of the ifiationary     gains is


                                                                                                        (11)


the present value gains (in 1994 pri-)           in the real value of nominal cash-flow due to higher

itiation.     An alternative way of exp~ing        the gains follows from (3), namely


                                                                                                       (11’)


The latter measure is useful when mkulating            how much a permanently higher inflation rate

affects the market value of government debt:           (1 1‘) suggests caldating      the effect on market

value of a parallel shift in the nominal yield curve, which is easily done onm we know the

dumtion of the outstanding debt.

    When dtiating          the ti     gains from higher inflation, we assume that the government will

stabilize the debt ratio at the end of the current el=tion           period, i.e.     in 1998.    To set the

horizon at 1998 is natural; it marks the end of the current (fou-year)             election period, and the

incumbent social democratic government has indeed formtiated a goal to stabilize the debt ratio

in pmisely      this year. A horimn of four y-        is alm relevant in an international context; those

Euro~n        muntries that have succeeded in stabilizing a serious W         situation have achieved this

in about four yeara time (see Giavazzi and Pagano (1990b)). To make this ~urnption                 mncrete,

we assume that the real budget deficit falls from around ~              bn kronor in 1994 to about 20

bn kronor in 1998. We also assume that this improvement occurs in bth =narios.                     The low-

ifiation     -nario   thus entails a tigher     6A    policy with additional discretionary measures in

the budget.      We will assume that these budget measur-          apply to the spending and taxation

-Ponents        of the ~     -h*.

    To tid      out what th=        additional budget cuts should amount h in 1998, we cakulate a

mnd         measure of the gains from a higher inflation rate: the improvement of the mal budget

deficit in 1998, the fial y-        of the election period. We can calctiate the gain in this single y-r

2     BUDGETARY          GAINS       FROM        INFLATION


2.1    GAINS      FROM    DEPRECIATING              THE     GOVERNMENT                DEBT


The market value of the Swedish government debt by June 30, 1994, was 1224 bn Swedish

kronor,G corresponding to 80% of that year’s GDP, 1517 bn. From this gross figure, we fit

have to deduct what cannot be inflated away, i.e., the debt denominate                     in foreign currencies

(382 bn) and in index bonda (3 bn). And,            the 76 bn in kronordenominated             debt held by the

~ntral bank shoti      be deducted from the government’s gross position.

      Should the government debt held by the government pension (social security) system also

be deductd?       In a funded pension systim a higher or a lower yield on th=                      funds wotid

directly Meet the benefits; in this e            the funds bekng to the insured and are not part of

government wealth.       In Sweden’s pay-as-you-go        system, where the pension benefits have no

immediate relations to fund performance, 7 however, the funds can be regarded as government

wdth.     Thus the kronadenominatd           debt he~ by the social ~it          y =tor       shotid ind~      be

deducted.    Note that the same applies to all nornind assets of that sector — about 497 bn —

even if they m not government securitb;            mrporati bonds or mortgage bonds will equally fall

in value if itiation   increa8es and muses a A        loss to the government.

    6At an mchq    rate of about 7 kr per US ~u,     this is ~d   to about $175 bn.

   summing    up, we had by mid-1994 a net nominal government debt amounting to (1224-382-

3-76-497=)   265 bn kronor, or 17.5 percent of GDP, that mtid be depreciated in real value by

higher inflation.    How much could have &n                gaind    by such a policy?   As in Section 1, we

repr~nt    the net nominal debt in 1994 by a nominal cash bw,               {wB~}~~.    By (11), the change

in the present value of the net nominal debt is given by

                                                m

                                               x( D:
                                               t==
                                                          – D:
                                                                 ) ~Bt.
   By our assumption that the real interest rate r remains mnstant aa tiation                incrms     from

2% to 12%, the grces nominal interest rate, 1 + i = (1 + r)(l + n), increases by about 10%.

As the elasticity of the present value of a sequence of nominal payments with respect to the

gross nominal interest rati is given by its duration, we can use the duration of the net nominal

government debt h estimate the change in its present value from an increase in itiation.

   The duration of the Pm                 debt, denominated in domestic currency, w= 3.0 ym           in June

1994. The securities held by the ~sbank                 had approximately the same duration at that time.

Finally, the duration of the sasets in the social security sector is not public information, but it

can be ~            to   rollghly    2.5 y-.    The duration of the net debt is a weighted average of the

durations of the mmponents:

                                    839
                                    %“3”0-2”3”0-E”2”5                 =3”gyam”

At fist sight, it may seem strange that the average duration of the net debt (3.9 years) is higher

than the duration of the gross debt (3.0 years) and the =ts                 (3.0 and 2.5 years). But this is

quite natural; the relatively short asset portfolio is matched by the shotir             imtruments in the

debt portfolio. It is the knger debt instruments that remain.

    Thus, if (1 + i) increases by about l~o, and the duration is 3.9 ymrs, as a fit          approtiation,

the present value of the net nominal debt falls by about 39%.

    For a non-infiniteairnal change, however, this linear approximation overestimates the fall in

real value, aim     the bond prim is a convex function of the inter-t            rate. The exact fall in the

market value of the Sdsh              government debt mtid be computed using detailed data on actual


                                                           9
future wh     flows. Such a detailed analysis is, however, outside the mpe           of the present paper.

To get a rough estimate of the right order of magnitude we treat the debt as a single di-unt

bond with a duration of 3.9 years. By mid 1994, the net debt had a market value of 265 bn. At

that time, however, neither of the two inflation ratea was My           credible, w the nominal intereat

rate on four-y=    government bonda wsa neither 7 nor 17 percent, but approximately 9.5 pemnt.

We postpone the treatment of this ctiibdity          pmbkm to Wtion          5, however. At present, we

only mmpare two credible s-y            states, one with T =2%     and one with n = 12%.

      If z had&n     qual to Vo (rather than 9.5%) and the government debt had been a di-unt

bond with 3.9 yeara to maturity, the market value of government debt by mid-1994 would have

been 290 bn. If on the other hand i        hd    been qual to lVO, the market value of the net debt

would have been 205 bn. The Merem               of 85 bn is the government capital gain of choosing a

credible high-itiation    policy rather than a credible low-i~ation       policy.s

      As for the gain in the 1998 budget, the laat term in equation (12), one muld again make

a detailed computation b~          on the xtual     maturity structure.     But in this paper, we treat

the capital gain of 85 bn as ~ng             at a single point in time, corresponding tQ the average

duration of the outstanding debt, that is just before the mitie         of 1998. With r = 5%, the effect

on interest payments in 1998 is then 4.3 bn.



2.2    INCREASED         SEIGNORAGE


The gain from i~             aeignorage for a particuhu year 1998, at a higher rate of itiation,            is

given by the mnd       term in equation (12). In Sweden, like in most developed muntr~,             the base

for the inflation tax is srnaU. In 1994 the private sectir’s holdin~ of reins and banknotes were

approximately 70 bn kronor, about 5% of GNP. There are no reserve requirements for banks

and voluntary reserves held at the R.iksbank pay a market interest rati.              Higher tiation      and

higher nominal interest ratm lead w lower rd          bal~.       Estima&     of the sensitivity of money

  aThus the market value would be 29 percent lower for the high-inflation=nario      than for the low-in.tlation

mario.    This 6gure should be -pared    to the 39 percent obtained iu the linear approximationabove.

demand to the inte~t        rate vary; let us assume that an increase in i by one percentage point

tiucea     r-n by 0.5 percent (probably an underestimate).          Using mH = 66.5 and mL = 70, the

seignorage gain in 1995 is 9


                                     0.17 .66.5 – 0.07070.0 = 6.4 bn.


      At mnstant   2% re-al growth, it is rwnable           to assume that real balances will grow at a

similar ra~. Thus the gain bm         seignorage in 1998, our reference year, will be 1.024 -6.4 = 6.9

bn, With r = 5%, the diaunti              value in 1994 of a perpetual flow, starting by 6.4 bn and

growing at 2 percent, is 213 bn.



2.3    INCOMPLETE           INDEXATION           OF THE        TRANSFER         SYSTEM


The analogy between interest payments and mrtain government expenditures is emphasized in

the government budget mnstraints of Section 1. Most public expenditures would be classified

under the terms Gt and gt. But the caah fiws                wBt and ~b    mtid equivalently include any

claims of the private =tir       on the government that are due at time t, be that debt service,

social security payments, or some other kind of transfer. It goes without saying that the legal

status of such claims cotid vary, sa cotid the claimants’ ~ibilitia               to enforce the claim —

but -nomically         speaking, they are equivalent.        In this section we will deal with the most

important element of government’s transkr liability-,            namely the pension system. The total

pension payments from the public sector in 1994 amounted to 194 bn kronor before tax and

roughly 135 bn after tax. 10 We simp~y and regard the 135 bn as a s~y-state                  figure, i.e., we

disregard kng-run trends tiwards an ageing Popdation and the possible effects of future changes

in the pension syskm. As public pensiom are tied to the consumer pti                index, we can consider

   ‘Here, b,   we bd         the fact that the actual in-      rate by mid 1994 was neither 7 nor 17 p-nt,




at a lowerrate, on average,while ~     paymenti — k     housing allowanm h elderly~ns       with low pensions

— are not Wed at all.

these 135 bn as the yield on a stock of “indexed pension bonds” with a mmtant coupon, &w,

and itite        maturity. The present value of th=                mnsols, discounted at a growth-adjusted real

rate of 3 percent, is thus: &/O.03            = 135/0.03 = 4500 bn. This is almost four times the value

of the (-)         outstanding government debt. Now, the pension claims are not entirely real; in

practice they form a mixture of nominal claims ~Bt and real claims 944. Below, we discuss two

deviations from perfect indexation, where the real value of the ~nsion                        claims depend on the

inflation rate.11



2.3.1     DELAYED           INDEXATION


According to current legislation, indexation of pensiona is made with a delay: the pensions

of 1995, e,g., are determined by the change in the CPI between October 1993 and October

1994. For the average pension payment in 1995, the delay is thus about eight months.                                At a

higher itiation      rate, the rd      value of the 1995 pensions will be correspondingly                 lower. The

government’s gain can be mmputed 55



             &   “ [~&-B/12/P&      - ti_8,12/Pg]            =     1350 [1/(1 .02)”’~ - l/(1.12)””~]      =

                                135. [0.987 – 0.927]         =     8.1 bn kronor,


Si-     this gain remains for all futw,         2% real growth im~s             a gain in 1998 of l.0~         .8.1 = 8.8

bn. The ~nt          value of this perpetual stream in 1994 is 8.1/0.03=                 270 bn.



2.3.2     PAR~AL        INDEXATION


In the fall of 1994, the parliament ruled — as part of iti stabilization programme — that

pensions will be compensated for only 60% of itiation                      during the election period 1995-1998.
  llT~m     -    * &w ~ha   M      ~ trus~m that ~      rebtsd to the CPI in one way or mother (e.g., student ~m,

Vtious forms of ad       6ty       Schem=, foreign aid). Since thm         are relatively insignificantin comparison to

the pensions, we _ard          them in thk -text.     Unempbyment insur~            is qumtitatively importint, but the

-ral      unemploymentinsurancek~b            are indexsd ti ~~,        not k prices. Unemployment benefits are thus

un~anged in d       terms, given our ~ption         that d       wagsa are independentof the tiation   rate.




                                                             12
This temporary d~indexation         is equivalent to 40% of the stock of pension bonds being repld

by nominal bonds during a four-year periti—                     an open market operation where the private

sector is obliged h buy the nominal bonds 12 at a pre-determined pri~ equal to unity.13 In

the notation of Section 1, part of the d              csah flow ~zt is turned inti a nominal wh                  flow

~Zt.    Pemion payments as of lM          are mumed to be fully indexed again. The value of those 40

percent of the pension payments that are d-indexed                   in 1995 and re-indexed in 1999 from 1998

and onwards will amount to 1.@t-WJ0.4.             135- P’/Pgs         bn per year (in 1994 prices). The value,

in 1994 prim,    of the payments during 1995-1998 is instead given by 0.40135 bn discounted by

1.02. (&/Pw)      for 1995, by 1.022- (P~/Pgs)             for 1996, etc.

      Working out these computations for 2% and for 12% itiation,                     we tid    that the 1998 real

value of the de-indexed pension payments is 54.0 bn in the low-ifiation                   scenario againat 37.2 bn

in the high-inflation scenario. The gain from inflation in the 1998 budget is thus -aiderable:

16,8 bn.

      The qitalized   real value of the &indexed                payments, with n = 2% is 1672.3 bn with low

inflation, and 1171.8 bn with high i~ation.           The pr=nt         value in 1994 of the gain from the high

ifiation   is thus a staggering 500.5 bn.

      If 40% of the pension payments are de-indexed, we need to modify the -rlier                      amputation

of the effwts of delayed indexation,         Firat, the delayd          indexation is applicable to 6070 of the

earlier a~t       only, i.e. a p=nt         value of 162 bn or a budget improvement in 1998 of 5.3

bn.    For the remaining 40% of the pension liabilities, the value will instead be retied                          by

delayed indexation after 1998. The government can thus again appropriate a further part of the

real csah *,     ~ponding           to eight months of high inflation. The 1994 value of this budget

  12We MSUmethat such a d~indexation of the pensionsis implementediu simultaneitywith a de-indexationof

the tax schedulesand the other p~      of the social dty         system. fn that case, the ratio between gross and net

transferswill be approximately mst~t      and d~             by the averagetax rate on pensions, i.e., roughly 30%.

      To sum up: with simultaneous partial and delayed indexation, the inflation gains due to

partial indexation amount ti a present value in 1994 of W.5                bn, and 16.8 bn in the 1998

budget, whereas the inflation gains due to delayed indexation, amount to 162 + 57.5 = 219.5

bn, and 5.3+ 2.2=        7.5 bn, respectively.



2.4     NO~NALISTIC              FEATURES          OF THE    TAX    SYSTEM


The tax system de6.nes a *             of future payments from the private to the public sector, the

present value of which can be regarded as a net =t               of the public sector. As emphasized in

Section 1, the real value of this -t           depends on the nominalistic featur= of the tax system,

which make effective tax ra~           or tax b-    sensitive to the inflation rate.



2.4.1    THE INCOME              TAX


The prmnt tax schedules are in principle indexed, br+ts             being adjusted -rding       to the CPI.

In the fall of 1994, however, a partial return to the nominalistic tax achedula was introdud

by the decision that tu          brackets will be adjusted for 60 percent only of the inflation during

the period 1994-1998.        For every 2.5 percent of itiation,      the real value of each bracket will

thus be eroded by 1 percent.            The effects on government revenue depend in a complicated

way on the distribution of pre-t ax income and might very well be non-linear in the inflation

rate.    A-rding     to the ~asury’s         detailed computer model for simulating budget effects of

different @cy      experiments, rd        tax revenue is, however, approximately linear in the tiation

rate over the relevant interval. Spocifimlly, the model indimtes that a lowering of brackets by

one percenta~      point raises tax revenue by 0.75 bn. An inflation rate of 12 pe~nt,          rather than



                                                       14
2 percent, thus rai=      1995 tax revenue by 0.40100. [1.12 – 1.02] - 0.75= 3 bn. The effect grows

larger over time, through 1998, as the price level incresses. In 1998, the budget improvement is

0.4.100. [(1.12)4 – (1.02)4] 00.75. l.O& = 15.6 bn, where we have also included             2%   growth in the

tax base. In 1999, the tax schedulm are msurned h & r-indexed,                but the budget improvement

created by the d~indexation       during 1994-1998 mmaina indefitely               and incr~       at the real

growth rate of the economy.       The present real value in 1994 of this partial indexation of the

income t=    sched&     is qual to 427.8 bn.

    A further non-neutrality can be attributed either to the (labom) income tax or to the capital

income tax discussed in the next =tion.      On the one hand, privati pemion savin~ are deductible

against the income tax; on the other hand, once paid out, private pensions are taxed as ordinary

i~me.    Privati pension funds, amounting to 700 bn kronor in 1994, thus partly mnstitute an

implicit tax claim by the government (in this mntext, we do not distinguish between lti                    and

central governments; in practice, most of this t=        claim is held by la         municipalities).

    Of the 1994 private pension funds, 435 bn were invested in nominal securitia with an average

duration of approximately 2.5 years. A ten percent higher itiation rate will reduce the real value

of these nominal assets by approximately 20 percent (cf. the reasoning in Section 2.1 above), i.e.,

by 87 bn. The rd       value of the private pension ti          will thus be 613 bn in the high-inflation

case.

   In the high ifiation     case, the pension funds will give rise ti a perpetual flow of r-l           pension

~ymen~      Wud to 613” [0.17” (1 – Tp) - 0.12],        where   7P iEIthe   tax   rate paid by the insurance

companiea on fund returns (cf. Section 2.4.2 below). Of these pension payments, 30 permnt will

be paid to the local and oentral government aEincome tax.

   In the low-inflation u,      the tiw of real pension payments will instead be:

700 [0.17. (1 – Tp) – 0.02]. Setting 7P = 0.15, we get an annual tax flow of 4.5 bn in the high-

inflation case and of 8.3 bn in the low-inflation csae. Thus there is a yearly loss h the government

from tiationary    policy, equal to 3.8 bn, or a capitalized value (using the growth-adjusted real

rate of 3 percent) equal to 126.7 bn.

2.4.2   THE TAXATION           OF CAPITAL


Since Sweden has a nominal apital         income tax, the e~tive          tax rate on capital is Tc(r + n),

where the nominal t= rate is denoted by rc. With r = 0.05, the yearly differen~ in tax revenue

under the high-itiation    and the low-inflation scenario is


                        A~    = TC(0.05 + 0.12) oKH – TC(0.05 + 0.02) . KL,


where KH and KL denote the tm bsae (i.e., the real value of the nominal, taxable assets of the

private =tor)     under the high-inflation and low-inflation scenario, rea~tively.          The tax bases

K include government bonda ~ well as other securities issued by private agents. The tax rate

7C and the tax b       K Wer    over investors. Broadly speaking, the following kinds of investors

are active on the Swedish capital market:

    The tax base K has kn        negative for householda in the past, due to various forms of tax

arbitra~.     One of the objectives of the 1990-91 tax reform was to make such tax arbitrage 1=s

profitable,    In 1994, however, the net fiancial         position of the households was still negative,

In this context, we cannot make any reliable forecast of the househo~s                taxable tiancial   net

position for the next few years. h Section 4 below, however, we study the gains from tiation

in a credibility mntext, where the ma~tude           of new debt issue plays an important role, We

construct a numerid       example based on explicit assumptions of the government’s borrowing

requirement for the years 1994-1998. For insistency,          we will use the same assumptions for now,


                                                     16
and assume that the new debt issue will be distributed over investor categories in the same way

as the stock of goss debt was distributed in 1994, i.e., with 10% of the debt held by households

and 30% held by imurance companies.

     In that example, we assume a real borrowing requirement of 632 bn over the period.14 We

aasurne that the net position of the households will be 10% of that amount, or 63.2 bn, in 1998,

thus the income tax in that year will be 0.30”0.17”63.2 = 3.2 bn under the high-inflation -nario,

and 0.3000 .07-63.2 = 1.3 bn under the low-ifition                        =nario 15. m      gain from itiation    in 1998

is thus 1.9 bn, and if treated aa an annuity (which is not entirely correct, sinm the government’s

borrowing requirement varies over the years, cf. Table 4 below) it gives us a capital amount of

31.3 bn in 1994.16

     B*         and non-kancial          compani=     are subj=t      to ordinary corporate income tax. This tax

is based on the company profit, which is a net co=pt,                        and not on the yield of the mmpany’s

fiancial      =ts,      whi~ is a P          concept. It is difEcult to mtirnate the eff=t of an inc~                   in

the inflation rate on tuable             profits in the corporate =tor          . For simplicity, we therefore assign

this -tor       an eff43ctivet=     rate equal to zero.

     Life inaurana -panies17               pay a capital i~me             tax of 17 pe~nt     on average. Total assets

within the life insurance industry (mainly government and mortgage institute bonds) in mid-

1994 amounted to 700 bn. The duration of t~                         =ta     is around 2.5 Ywra.la Idation        will thus

erode the real value for 2,5 yeara, i.e., till December 31, 1996, on average. In the middle of 1994,

the interest rate on 2.5-year hod                  w~ approximately 9.5 pemnt,              which means that by the

end of 1996, tb             tids   will have grown to 848 bn. Then, the money will be reinvati                     at the

current interest rate, and will in the middle of 1998 have a nominal value of 1,034 bnlg under

the high-inflation -nario    (interest rate 17 peroent) and 923 bn under the low-tiation    -nario

(interest rate 7 percent). The real values of th=     amounts in 1994 pri-,     are 657 and 853 bn,

respectively. Tax revenue for these two cases is 0.17.0.17.657      = 19.0 bn with high inflation,

and 0.17-0.07-853     = 10.2 bn with low inflation. The Merence      is 8.8 bn. Treating this as an

annuity, and assuming that long-run pension savings grow at the same rate as real GDP, giv-

us a mpital value of 241.3 bn in 1994.

      The flow of new savings due to the government’s budget deficits should also be added.

~ting      this in the same way sa the households, we assume that the insurance mmpany share

of government debt remains 30 percent of the new debt issue of 632 bn; thus 190 bn will be

pld      in these companies by 1998. The tax on this is 0.17.0.17.190         = 5.5 bn for the high-

infiation case, and 0.17-0.070190    = 2.3 bn for the low-inflation case, i.e., an inflation gain for

the government of 3.2 bn in 1998. fieating    this, for simplicity, as an annuity, it mrresponds to

a capital of 52.6 bn in 1994. 20



2.4.3    TAX   COLLECTION


Sinm trees are paid h the government with a lag aftir the taxable income haa been earned, the

*     tax revenue is sensitive to inflatio~ this is the so called “Oliver&Tanzi effect.”   Although

the method of collection varies over different twea, we tid     it is sufEciently realistic to assume

an overall lag kngth of one month.

      The inmme tax revenue (central and ld      government) in 1994 w= around 300 bn, payroll

taxes and social insurance f-   collected 200 bn, and indirect taxes yielded 185 bn. Assuming the

mktion      of these 685 bn b be evenly distributed over the year, the government thus mllected

685/12 = 57 bn per month.       Since these 57 bn were paid with one month’s delay, it mn be




                                                 18
said that the government had a continuous, non-interest kring           claim on the private =tor

amounting to 57 bn. With a low inflation, the loss in real value would be 1.14 bn per year; with

high ifiation,   it wodd    be 6.84 bn. The differe~,     i.e. the government’s real loss from high

inflation, is 5.7 bn.

      With a two pe=nt     real growth rate, the high-tiation   policy wotid thus cause a 6,2 bn loss

in the budget of 1998. The capitalized value of all future l-s        due to lags in tax collection is

190 bn,21



2.5      SUMMARY


Table 1 summarizes the gains and losses when the iriflation rate g-           from 2% to 12%. We

indimti the gains and losses both in absolute terms (in mid-1994 prim)         and as percentage    of

1994 GDP. The total net gain is rather impr=ive:         a flow value in the 1998 budget amounting

to 3.6%, and a present value amounting to 95.8%, of 1994 GDP. It is noteworthy, however, that

the major gains do not, as many mnomists         might think, -rue    from the traditional sour~    of

idationary    banm,     i.e., from increased seignorage and a real depreciation of government debt.

Insti,     the major gains -rue     from the nominalistic features of tax and transfer systems. It is

worth emphasizing that th-        gains are so substantial that the appropria-ness   of de-indexation

as a means for restoring budget bala=        might be questioned. Such a de-indexation may crmte

an immediate real budget gain, but it also creates such strong incentiva        for inflation that the

overall eff=ts on the budget are not obvious, once we add the prospective eff=ts on credibility,

and thus also on nominal interest rak.      The8e issues will be discussed further in %tion   4 below.

3     SOCLAL      COSTS AND        BENEFITS          OF INFLATION          VS. EXPENDITURE

      CUTS      AND   TAX INCREASES


The budgetary gains from higher ifiation        are skable.    To find the net social welfare effect of

higher itiation    they have to be translated into social benefits, and then compared to the social

cot3tsof inflation, which is done in this section.



3.1    SOCIAL       BENEFITS      03? THE     BUDGETARY          GMNS      FROM      HIGH    INFLA-

       TION


The present value budgetary gains from inflation re~rted        above are 1454 bn, which corresponds

to about 95% of GDP. The tial          benefit of these budget gains equals the -ial        10SSof the

corresponding expenditure cuts and tax increasea that must be done in the low ifiation        mnario.

First mnsider a m        when the tradeofi between expenditure cuts and tax increases is socially

optimal: the marginal social cost of public funds is not only equalized over different sources of


                                                     20
revenue, but is also qual    to the =ial    marginal benefits of public expenditure, which in turn

are assumed to be equW           over different types of expenditure.   In this hypothetical case the

welfare eff=t is simply given by the marginal deadweight loss caused by incred           taxes of the

same p~t        value ~ the budgetary gains from inflation.

   Obviously, the -umption         of a socially optimal tradeoff betw=n      taxes and government

spending is not realistic. In the next =tion,       we argue that featurea of the Swedish politial

system imply that politicians had relatively strong incentiv= to choose the itiationary         route

despite its rots.   m       political distortiona also suggest that the starting point in 1994 w=

distirted, in that the social costs were not qualized across t=-    and social benefits not qualized

across expenditures.    Moreover, it is likely that there ww overspending, in the sew        that the

averagemarginal cost of tmea were higher than the avera~ marginal benefit of expenditure.

For some types of public expendit-,         the marginal benefit may even have been below unity.

Thus, private mnsumption waa more valuable at the margin so that a cut in those types of

s~nding    would in f~t   inc~       social welfare. In that situation, the actual social gain from

the high inflation alternative would depend on exwtly which taxea were increased and which

expenditurea were cut in the low itiation      alternative.

    fitimatea   of the marginal social mt     of public funds are mntrovemial, es~ially      after the

1990-91 tax reform. We a8sume, in line with Agell, Englund and *rsten                (1995), that the

marginal amt in the benchmark M            is 1.5, expressed in terms of private consumption, which

implim a deadweight loss of 0.5 (the marginal cost of public funds less one). We also consider

an upper bound for the marginal social benefit of 2 (a deadweight loss of 1). Thus, the present

value of social welfare gain of high itiation-the       redud   ddweight      loss, or excess value of

government over private spending-in        the benchmark case is 727 bn, that is about 48% of GDP.

The upper bod       for the social welfm    gain is 1454 bn, or 95% of GDP.

3.2    THE    SOCLAL       COSTS     OF INFLATION


From the aoeial gain in the previous section, we have to deduct the social -b              of i~ation   to

~s       the net social we~are effect of the high-inflation alternative. High inflation h= large and

well-known social costs, mn6rmed by the experience from the last few d~-.                  High ifiation,

even when anticipated, mmbined with =ming,ly unavoidable nominal t ax systems, adds h other

distortions and makea resom          allocation less efficient. Consumption, savings and investment

decisions are distorted. Empirically, high itiation is strongly correlati       with high variability and

low predictability of inflation. The restiting uncertainty in itself mntributes to making reso~

allocation 1-     efficient. In addition, high and variable itiation    results in huge redistributions of

wealth, for instance between families in rented apartment        and those in owner-occupied houses,

and generaUy betwmn ctitors            and debtors,    The high-tiation      alternative wotid resdt in

arbitrary 1~       for investors who have lent money to the Swedish government. Eventually, the

social costs of itiation    would most likely cause a lowering of tiation      to more r~nable      levels.

A return to lower idation        would, however, have dismal credibility, after another sad page of

Sweden’s inflation history, md therefore be correspondingly -tly              in terms of recession, lost

i-me      and unemployment.

      Several recent papers have di~         the potential deterioration of inv=tment and long term

growth that idation        may muse (Fischer (1993), Pindyck and Solimano (1993), Barro (1995)).

The cr~          untry mtimata    in these papers are controversial and vary between sizeable and

small; the jury is still out. One mult -ma       clear, though: inflation does not improve long-term

growth. At best it is neutral, at worst it can wuae a si=ble           deterioration, particularly at high

inflation rak.

      The exact costs of high inflation depend on detaila in the institutional framework, especially

the tax system, and can hen~ vary from country to country.               A precise estimate has, to our

knowledge, never been done for Sweden. Fischer (1994) — when surveying the cost of tiation

— reports that a 107o tiation        rate may imply a cost of 2-5% of GDP, excluding any growth

effects. Feldstein (1996) examin-           the social benefits of reducing anticipated idation       from 270 to

zero in the US, taking into munt              reduced distortion of household saving, housing demand and

money demand, as well as resulting public revenue changes. Public revenue eff=ts are indeed

the sub@t        of our previous tiations,            so in order to assess the relevant US number, we shotid

look at the estimates of social cost gross of revenue eff-ts.               Feldstein’s favoured eatimati of the

annual social benefits of going from            WO    to zero inflation amounts to about 1.170 of GDP. As a

more mnaemative estimate, he su~ts                    the number 0.8570. Under the wsumption of linmrity—

which mmt likely underestimates the social ret-a                  10% incra         in inflation would thus entail

an annual social mt          of 5.5% of GDP, with a kwer bound of 4.2570 of GDP. These estimat=

still exclude quite a few of the above mentioned custsm

     In general, Swdsh        tax= are much higher than US taxes. But the itiation distortions mainly

derive from capital t=ation,           where the relevant marginal tax rates are more comparable: since

the 19!30-91 tax reform basically all capital income, including capital gains, is taxed at the same

proportional 30% t= rati for all households and firms. The Swedish and US t=                       systems Mer

in a number of other ways, and a more det ded =Ssment                    is n~ary       for a precise mmparison.

Here we shall, however, apt               Febtein’s      favourite case and use it as a benchmark for social

mt    in Sweden. With a 5% real inte~t                 rati and a 270 annual GDP growth rate, the present

value of this social -t           is about 180% of GDP. If we instead use Feldatein’s lower boud,          we get

a social amt of 140% of GDP.m

     The pim        can now be put together. Deducting social ccets of ifiation             from the social gains

Aculated     in the previous section, we get the net social effect of the high inflation alternative.

  a2As a very rough mnsistincy -,           we u       mmpare our budget~     gains with those of Feldskin’s (where

F*teiu’s    originalestimatm are multi-         by –5 h make them mrrespnd ti a 10 percentagepoint in~          in

intlationinsti     of a 2 percentagepoint d~           ). Feldstein’stransformedbudgetary gains from seignorageare

then 0.58% of GDP (ours are 0.5%), and from capital iucome (includingimplicit subsidiesto housing) 1.3 – 1.5 =

–0.3% of GDP (ours are 0.9%). Thus, our budgetary gains from =pital inmme (kcluding mortgage deductions)

are higher. If we have exaggeratedthe budgetary gainsfrom upi~         inmme turn, our result mnmming the social

net utiability       of tiation    is strengthened.




                                                            23
In the bencbmark w,           the readt is a social loss, the p~nt    value of which is about 85% of

GDP. If we instead use the upper bound for the social gain and the lower bound for social cost,

we still end up with a loss, with a present value of about 4570 of GDP.



4 POLITICAL           INCENTIVES             AND     POWER          TO CHOOSE          THE    INFLA-

      TION   ROUTE


In order to evaluate the likelihood for a return to high itiation,    we must mnsider the alternative

to the inflation route; = we stated initially, a fiscal mnsolidation within the parliament period

with maintained low itiation        requires that the budgetary gains from high inflation are com-

pemated by other means: expenditure cuts and tax increasea. In this ~tion              we will therefore

briefly review the political costs and benefits of achieving fid       consolidation through inflation

or by other means.



4.1    POLITICAL      INCEN~


International experie~         shows that, among democratic industrial muntries, it is primarily

those with proportional election system-rather           than those with majority election or mixed

parliamentary-presidential systems-that        have had problems with their fid        situations during

the last decadea (Roubini and Sachs (1989), Grilli, Masciandaro and Tabellini (1991)).              The

reason seems to be that these muntries often have minority or coalition governments. Countries

where governments are short-lived also have @            problems more often.

      Experienm from the European muntriea also indimte that fiscal policy is systematically m-

relatedto the institutions in the budget p~         , i.e. the p~      in which budget decisiom are

prepared by the government, titi           by the parliament, and executed by the public administra-

tion. A weak budget pr~           seems h be a great hindrance for attempts to fiscal consolidation

(von Hagen (1992), Harden and von Hagen (1995)),             This can be understood along the lines

of the tkettil      politid     ecunomy literature on “universalism” (=,        for insta-,   Weingaat,

Shepsle, and Jokn        (1981)).    When the benefits of a particular type of public spending are


                                                    24
mncentrated ti a partitiar      region or a Particdar -tOr,          but the -t    dispersed over all tax

payers, and each special inte-t     faila to internalize the overall budget constraint, the end result

may be individually rational—but mllectively irrational-overspending              in all aresa.

      Swedish experience doea not mntradict the international picture. Sweden again has a mi-

norit y government, something which h= been the nde during the last 20 years of mostly too

expansionary M         policy. The Swedish budget process is one of the weakeat in Europe (Molan-

der (1992)).    That the existing institutions have not withstood the pressure and thereby con-

tribute    h the overly expansionary fiscal policy waa one of the main points in the analysis of

the hnornica      ~ssion       (Lindbeck et al. (1993)).

      When it came to solving the fiscal problems, the institutional mnditiona were hence far

from good. Chances were that it wtid        be exangly         ~dt      to push a sticiently       ambitious

mnao~tion        programme through the government and the parliament.               Given the outlook in

1994, most mmmentators were mnvind            that the mncmte        budget improvements suggested by

the government were imticient.       Estimatea of the necessary budget improvements to stabtie

the debt ratio in the election period ranged from 50 to 80 bn kr (3-570 of GDP). What is relevant

for the argument in this paper is the nua~ind co~lidation,             the last part of the msolidation

programme. Our point is that party politics and the ~wer             of special interats mtid make the

last, say, 50 bn appear very mtly        for the government in Politid       tirma.    The sum of 50 bn

quals     e.g. the (net) saving of mmpletely eliminating the child aUowance, the sickness benefit

and the (12 month) parental benefit to stay home &r             childbirth. Politicians tight       very well

mnsider in.tlation a politically d-per     way to get the last 50 bn. Instead of explicitly having to

anno~        ptisely   which expensea to cut, benefit h slsah, and twea h incr=,                  it might be

attractive to have in.tlation muse more anonymous expenditure cuts and tax incre-.

      Note that the above doea not imply that the government and parliament must n~arily

ar~     explicitly for inflation as a way to redu        the budget dekit,    But everything else equal,

the government and the parliament might be much less inclined b resist itiationary                  imptises

and support the Riksbank’s low inflation policy if the budget deficit is large than if it is small.


                                                    25
Thus, given the mnstant pressure from various special intereats on the Riksbank to mnduct a

more =mmodating            md expansionary monetary policy, the substantial budgetary gains from

ifiation,   and the resulting weaker support of the Riksbank from the government and parliament,

might tip the balanm tow~           more itiation.



4.2    THE    POWER        TO CHOOSE        INFLATION


It is thus far from inconuivable      that politicians in the government and the Parliment       might

have had strong incentives h accept or even support an itiationary              policy.   What are the

possibilities to induce the Riksbank to conduct an expansionary policy?              This is related to

the institutional setup of monetary policy and the degrm of independence of the Riksbank.

International e~rience       not only shows that countria       with more independent mntral banks

have generally had lower inflation. It also shows that a rapid increase of the national debt in

Euro-        Countria h= been _ated          with higher inflation in muntria    with lW independent

mntral banks, but not in countries with independent central banks (Grilli, Maacimdaro              and

Tabellini (1991), Jonsson (1994)).

      The modern tkretical      literature (Rogoff (1985), Cukierman (1992), Persson and TabeWni

(1993), Walsh (1995), Svensaon (1995a)) emphasizes three aspects of the institutional setup that

combined -n      improve monetary stability: (1) delegation of monetary policy tQ the mntral bank,

with a ckar mandate to the central bank to focus on prioe stability, with a larger emphtis          on

itiation    stabilization relative to employment stabilization, incentive mntrmts that increase the

central bank’s -t     of idation,   or an extra low tiation    target, (2) instrument-independence of

the central bank so that it can bt         pwue      the goal of monetary policy without giving in to

short-run politbl     p~       , and (3) -untability       of the central bank to achieve the goal, for

instance with sanctions for the Governor or the Board if the goal is not achieved.

      The status of the Riksbank is ambiguous in this contixt,         w is clear for imtance in the

report of the Riksbank Commission (SOU 1994:20) or in Svensson (1995b). On the one hand,

the delegation of monetary policy is far-reaching, even in au international perspective.           For



                                                      26
imtanw, exchange rate policy is &ided                  upon by the Riksbank and not the government .23 The

Riksbank has also announced an explicit idation                   target of 2%. On the other hand, the tiation

target lacks formal or legal backing from the parliament, the principal of the Riksbank. Some

social demccrat politicians have expr-                    a desire to add a growth or employment target to

the i~ation          target, something whi& w-             increase the demands for an tiationary         monetary

policy.       Momver,          the Governing Board is politically appointed by the parliament for each

parliament pried,          and it h~ a imposition           that gives the Board members of the ruling party

or dtion         in the parlimnt          a majority of the votes in the Board. Hence these Board members

can pursue the monetary policy they wish without the mnsent of the Governor. They can also,

at any time, without giving a ~n,                  &      the Governor. Thus, the result may be a Riksbank

that is very obedient to the short-run interests of the riding party or coalition in the parliament.



5    THE       CREDIBILI~                 PROBLEM


The Adulations          in Section 2 above compare two altemativea: a credible policy of low tiation

(with i = 0.07), and a credible policy of high tiation                        (with i = 0.17 ).   Our discussion in

Section 4 of the government’s and parliament’s inmntivea indicati that the temptation is strong

to follow the latter alternative; it leads to a permanent, real budget improvement of 55 bn kronor

(or between 3 and 4 percent of GDP) per year. In order to achieve an improvement of a similar

ma~tude         with a low-tiation          policy, the government wtid           have to perform very large, and

politically painful, spending cuts and/or t= incre=.

     To get a clear picture of the temptations facing the government and parliament in financial

dist=,        we cannot, however, simply mpare                  a hypothetic      high-itiation   policy to a hypo-
    ‘9Thig k ~ very rational setup, m m-y         ~~         Poh     ~ntati         have bed,      &   ex~ange rati

independent-trrd        banka, are plagued by the -tradktion        that the governmentis responsiblefor the exchange

rate policy and the central bank ia _bk             for monetary policy. -tly,      however,both the Governing130ard

of the Rikabati and the Swedish Treaswy have aurpti                monetary policy mmmenbtors by d~laring that the

_tity            of ach~         rati *     should be tranafd      h the government.

thetical low-ifiation    policy, We ah          have to take the actual situation into munt.    In Section

2 we anawered the question, ‘What are the budgetary gaina from a credible 12% inflation a

mmpared to a credible        WO     i~ation?”     The question to be dedt with in the present section is

instead: ‘What were the bud~tary                gains from a 12% i~tion   in 1994, when the actual value

of i waa around 10 pereent?

      This change of focus h= implications for our calculations of inflation gains from the tax and

tr~fer     systems. Th~      eff-       are, however, relatively small and will be disregarded here. As

to government borrowing, there is a large extra coat aasoeiated with the lack of credibility for

the low-inflation policy.



5.1    A NUMERICAL            EXAMPLE


The credibility problem is mainly ~iated                with the iaaue of new debt. In seetion 2,1 above,

dealing with the psibility          of reducing the real value of existing debt, the net &bt, which had

an average duration of 3.9 years, was the moat relevant m~pt.              For simplicity, we will aesume

that the new debt haa a duration of 4 years.

      The four-year inte-t    rate was 9.570 in the middle of 1994, Thus, neither the low-itiation      nor

the high-itiation   policy w= credible at that time. We assume that the market—like ou.raelves—

considered two -narios       ody. The probabilities associated to the low-ifiation      and high-tiation

=narios     are denoted by p and (1 – p), mpectively.         For an expecti   real yield equal to 5% and

a nominal market rate of 9.5%, we can compute the implied value of the probability of a low

inflation p = 0.75.

      At each point in time, the market will revise its p value M              on actual itiation.     This

could be modelled theoretically in a Bayeaian framework, assuming that the government haa

complete mntrol over monetary policy, that there cotid be two types of governments, one with

preferences for high itiation,       and one with preferen-      for low, and that the agents do not know

which type is in power at the moment. By observing actual inflation, the agenta can revise their

prior probabilities, and b=         their demand and supply of bonda on these. If the itiation       rate is



                                                        28
subj-t      to exogenous shocks, the tit      year’s performm        will not immediately reveal the type of

government in poweq a low inflation rate could be the mnsequenoe of either an inflation-averse

government, an inflation-prone government and a negative random shock to the itiation                       rate,

or an tiation-prone        government that mimics an inflation-averse government .24

    The rate at whi& the probability p will be revised in the light of actual tiation                       data

dependa on the distribution of random shocks.                A thorough investigation of this problem of

Bayesian learning is beyond the -of               the p=nt      paper. We will present a simple numerical

example, just to indicate the order of m~tude.

    Assume that the government ~                   a low itiation    policy. b the beginning, agents’ sub

@tive     probability of this event is 75%. We now wume             that the agents revise their probability

linearly over four yeara. ht us denoti the probability of a low-tiation                government, mnditional

on a low itiation        rate being obsemed, by p ‘,       This variable will develop mrding           to the pL

column in TabJe2.

    With regard to p H , the sub@tive           probability wigned       to a low ifiation      rate conditional

on a high ifiation        rate being observed, we assume that learning is faster.              We assume that

the probability goes linearly to mm in two years (mlumn pH in Table 2).                        The asymmetric

wumption          has support in the theory in wti         an inflation-prone government may temporarily

mimic the behaviour of an tiation-averse             government. Obsetig           low inflation doea therefore

not -Ssarily          signal that the government is itiation         averse.   However, the in.flation-avew

government would never mimic the i~tion-prone                   government and temporarily pursue high

itiation,        Therefore, observing high ifiation        is a strong indication that the government is

=tually     inflation-prone.

       The ex post real rate that is relevant for new debt issue is thus highly dependent on infla-

tion. To see the actual differenm in coet of borrming,              we n~    estimates of the governments

borrowing requirements during this period. Tabk 4 shows the hypothetical numbers mderlying

our dculations;         we have assumed that the borrowing requirement, which amounted to 200 bn

during the calendar year of 1994, falls by 45 bn per y-r               in real terms. ~s       is in no way a

fo~t           of the budget deficits during the period, but is intended to serve as a numerial          exam-

ple only. 25 The example is however consistent with the -ndition                      spelled out in Section 1

above, namely that government debt be stabilid                as a fraction of GDP by 1998.26 Since all our

computations refer to the situation in the middle of the year, we assume for simplicity that each

year’s borrowing tak= pl~            on July 1.

    b     addition to the net bomowing, the existing stock has to be rolled over.                In Section 2

above, we saw that the net debt, amounting to 265 b~on,               had an average duration of 3.9 ye-.

Here we will assume that 1/4 of the debt matures each year and has to be rolled over which

means that on tip of the linearly falling budget deficits, another 66 bWon has to be bomwed

each year. Of this -             borrowing requirement, we assume that 2/3 will be borrowed agaimt

bonds denominated in do~tic              currency, for which the real ex post interest rates of Table 3 are

rekvant. For simplicity, we assume the issued debt to have an average duration of 4 years.

   All this will readt in a higher cost for the low-inflation alternative, in the form of higher ex

post rd   interest payments. The higher cost is distribute        over the years in the way shown in

Table 5. A total of 177 bn in dom-tic      ~ncy        is borrowed in 1994. This leads to an incre~

ex post real interest coat for the low-infiation alternative of 17.7 bn in 1995 and each of the three

following years, since the ex post real inter=t rate Merence        for loans in 1994 is 10 percentage

points. A total of 147 bn has to be borrowod k domestic currency k 1995. The incti                    ex

post rd   interest at   will be 8.3 bn in 1996-1999. The total interest cost for the low-tiation

alternative is hence 26.0 bn, etc.

     The pmnt       value in 1994 of these costs, at r = 0.05, is about 97 bn, or 6.4% of GDP.

Noti also that the budget effmt is maximized in 1998, when it is about 2% of GDP. This gain

should be added to the budgetary gains from high idation                       estimated in ~tion         2. Thus, a

lack of credibility for the low inflation alternative hsa sizeable budgetary costs. This increasea

the relative attraction of the high-itiation           alternative 27, but also points to the importance of

remedies of reforms that incr~          the credibilityy of the low-inflation alternative. We also note

that there is a simple way of avoiding these ex post real interest costs, namely ti borrow against

indexed bonds or against bonds denominated in foreign currency.



6 MEAS-                 AND      INSTITUTIONAL                 REFORMS


C)ur discussion in Section 4 emphmized that an inflationary route looked politically cheaper

than the alternative route of transparent budget measures. Yet, in Section 3, we argued that

the social mts     of the tiationary        route were    higher. The maures           and imtitutional reforms

that we discuss in this section either bring about waler              incentives for the government and the

parliament to choose high tiation,          or else makes it harder forth=          Politid    bodies ti skr      the

central bank towards a more inflationary monetary policy. Another way to describe the refom

is that they bring the political costi of high idation            better in line with the social rots. 28

6.1     REFORM        OF POLITICAL           INSTITUTIONS


A fit    set of measurea changes the political institutiona in a direction that mak= it e=ier to

decide on a strict budget. U the conditions for a more disciplined budget policy are better, it

appears lew tempting to let part of the stabilization be carried out by higher inflation.29 One

routi would be to strengthen the part of the budget pr-s           that takes place in parliament. The

possibilities to push through a sufEcient programme of budget cuts wotid be enhanced if the

budget process were “turned around”, so that a binding dmision on the overall budget were taken

in one initial vote, instead of the current practim of deciding on individual components one by one

to arrive at a tial overall outmme.        Also, a stronger role for the standing finanm Committe

with r=ponsibility     for the overall budget—vis-a-vis     the standing spending mmrnitt-            wotid

contribute to this.

      Similar mwurea in other parts of the budget p~          , for example, to strengthen the ~easury

and the Prime Minister’s Offim in the budget preparation stage, wotid serve an analogow

purpose.    Empirical work by von Hagen (1992) and by von Hagen and Harden (1995) shows

that the budget discipline in European countries is ind~           si@cantly      mrrelated with mntral

features of the national budget pr~.



6.2     ~ASURES        TO LOWER           THE BUDGETARY            GA.INS FROM          HIGH INFLA-

        TION


Another set of measure      would instiad lessen the effect of itiation       on government fiances    and

hence make it less tempting to take the inflationary route, givl,n the overall budget stanm, Our

discussion in Sections 2 and 5 cl~rly       indicates a number of possibilitim to substitute real cash

flow for nominal cash flow, One would be restructuring the public debt, in connection with re-

placing maturing loans and with new debt issue. If the debt were restructured towarda indexed

debt and foreign-currency denominated debt, the net gains for higher tiation             wotid gradually

decrease. A shorter average duration of the public debt would also lower the ifiationary              gains

 ‘g See Lindti   et al. (1993, & 5) for a -ion    of a number of such cha~.



                                                    34
from higher inflation. Shorter maturities would, however, also increase the amount to be refi-

nanced each year and could hence contribute to volatility in financial markets. As previously

pointed out, the insight that the maturity structure and the composition of the public debt af-

fwts the government’s incentives has been around for some time in the theoretical literature. 30

Proposals to restructure the public debt in the dirwtion discussed here, have also been put

forward in the Swedish policy debate.31

    Another measure is to not allow transfer programmed with nominalistic features at the

margin.      One may argue that partial indexation could be exploited as a means to make real

budget cuts when other forms of budgetary consolidation are not viable. In fact, there are ways

of constructing such partial indexation without creating inmntives for high tiation.                       Gnsider

for instanm a transfer scheme with a nominally tied part which is capped at some low level of

ifiation.      With full indexation at Mation               rat-    above, say, 270 there is a lumpsum     gain, but

no additional gain at tiation            rates above        2Y0.   But such an arrangement is equivalent with an

annual 270 real cut in transfers with maintained indexation. The same reasoning applies to the

indexation of the basic allowance and the boundaries for higher tax brackets in the income tax

system,

    When it mm= to capital inmme taxation, -nomists                         have argued for quite some time that,

to avoid a number of unwanted distortions (recall the discussion in Section 3), the system ought to

be bd        on real rather than nominal returns. Our results in section 2 reinform these arguments.

Binding its hands not to cash in additional revenue through high ifiation                  by nominalistic capital

taation,      the government mntributea           to greater credibility for a low Mation        policy.

6.3    CENTRAL       BANK     REFORM


A third set of proposals mncems m-urea        to diminish the possibilities for pressuring the Riks-

bank in the direction of an mmmodating          inflationary monetary policy.     The theme of this

paper-that      M    inmntives in the pmnm       of large public deficits may trigger ifiationary

prms~has         its theoretical underpinnings in the Iitirature starting with Calvo (1978), even

though that literature tends to St=       a less mmprehensive set of m~anisms,          focusing on

seignorage and the real value of outstanding debt. Strengthening the independen~         of the cen-

tral bank h= also been a mmmon method h reach monetary stability in muntries plagued by

high itiation   or hyperidation:   in Europe in the inter-war period and in Latin Ameriu      in the

last decade,

      Concreti proposals about the ingredients in a credibility+nhancing     Swedish mntrd bank

reform have been given in the White Paper for the &ntral          Bank bmmission,      in H6mgren

(1994) and in Svensson (1995b).      Much of the poptiar discussion in Sweden has focused on

the credibility problems that arise form the short-run temptation to boost the economy with

an ambitious employment goal, taking its thmretical underpitings        in the academic literature

emanating from Kydland and Pr-tt          (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983). Concern for the

public fianm    questiom to some extent underlines other asp.~ts of central banking reform than

those emphasized in the Swedish debate. For imtance, the public fiance          perspective sugg~ts

that it wotid be of particular importance to close all doom for direct and indir=t financing of

government deficits by borrowing in the Mksbank,



7     CONCLUSION


We have studied the mnsequen-         of higher inflation from the Swdsh      perspective in 1994.

The budgetary gaim appeared considerable, even though they did not primarily emanate from

those channels that are traditionally emphasized in the literature, i.e., from incrd     seignorage

and from erosion of government debt. As we have shown, the largest budgetary gains imtead




                                                36
emanate from nominalistic featur= in the tax-transfer system. We have argued that a social

cost-benefit caltiua       clearly shows higher tiation          to be a more amtly way to stabilize the

Swdsh      public debt than the alternative of &scretionary tax increases or spending cuts. Still,

a politiuat ret-benefit     calculus may make the tiationary          route look more attractive.   We have

also shown that the -t          of lacking credibilityy is mnsiderable:    this makes the Mationary    route

seem even more tempting.          Finally, we have pointed out a number of measurea and reforms that

bring politid     ~ts     closer in line with political custs.

    what    has happened in the almost two yeara since the starting point for our calculations?

The development so far is not inconsistent with the low-inflation scenario. The Swedish Mation

rate is now a bit less than 270 and medium-term nominal intereat rates are about 2 permntage

points lower than in mid-1994. The real budget deficit, as we have defined it, has been shrinking

drastically and is approaching zero, as a retit             of a better economy as well as of considerable

discretionary measures. A number of the measures and reforms that we put forward in Section 6

have now been d=ided upn:            the National Debt Office is issuing increasing amounts of indexed

debt, some of the reforms of the budget prms            have b~n pursued, and a central bank reform is

again being mnsidered. The risk of a return to high itiat ion is not eliminated, but the outlook

for low tiation     appeara much brighter than a few years ago.
