We examine the effect of securities laws on stock market development in 49 countries. We find
almost no evidence that public enforcement benefits stock markets, and strong evidence that laws
facilitating private enforcement through disclosure and liability rules benefit stock markets.

I. Introduction.

         In this paper, we examine securities laws of 49 countries, focusing specifically on how these

laws regulate the issuance of new equity to the public. Security issuance is subject to the well-

known “promoter’s problem” (Mahoney 1995) – the risk that corporate issuers sell bad securities

to the public – and as such is covered in all securities laws.1 We analyze the specific provisions in

securities laws governing initial public offerings in each country, examine the relationship between

these provisions and various measures of stock market development, and interpret these correlations

in light of the available theories of securities laws.

         Our analysis draws on a theory of social control of business when both markets and

governments are subject to failure (Djankov et al. 2003). According to this theory, the efficiency

of alternative strategies of such control -- from private orderings, to private litigation over contracts

and torts, to still private litigation over public statutes, to government regulation, to state ownership

– is determined by the tradeoff between controlling market and government failure. More

interventionist strategies, such as regulation or state ownership, might limit market failure more

effectively, but are also more vulnerable to government failure. The optimal policy minimizes the

total social costs of market and government failure.

         For securities markets, this approach can be distilled down to three broad hypotheses

concerning optimal public policy. Under the the null hypothesis, associated with Coase (1960) and

Stigler (1964), the optimal government policy is to do nothing. The securities law is irrelevant or

even damaging. Securities transactions take place between sophisticated issuers and investors.



         1
           Teoh et al. (1998) and Dechow et al. (1996) present evidence consistent with the view that US firms
manipulate accounting figures to raise capital on favorable terms. Leuz et al. (2002) show that earnings’ manipulation
is more extensive in countries with weak investor protection.

                                                          3
Issuers, auditors, and underwriters have reputational and legal reasons, grounded in contract and

tort law, to certify the quality of securities being offered to investors, so as to receive higher prices.

Investors have an interest to become informed, and to buy securities underwritten by reputable firms,

so as to avoid being cheated. These market and general legal mechanisms suffice for securities

markets to prosper. Securities law is either irrelevant (to the extent that it codifies existing market

arrangements or can be contracted around), or damaging, in so far as it raises contracting costs and

invites political interference in markets (Easterbrook and Fischel 1984, Macey 1994).

        The other two hypotheses hold that “law matters.” Reputations, contract, and tort law are

insufficient to keep promoters from cheating investors because the payoff from cheating is too high

and because private litigation is too expensive and unpredictable to serve as a deterrent. To reduce

the enforcement costs and opportunistic behavior, the government can introduce a securities law

specifying the contracting framework.2           The two alternative hypotheses differ in how much

government intervention such a framework would optimally call for.

        Under the first alternative, which we call the private enforcement hypothesis, the principal

benefit of the securities law is the direct reduction in the costs of private contracting. According

to this hypothesis, the law can standardize securities contracts (by, for example, mandating

disclosure in a prospectus) and clarify liability rules for inaccurate or incomplete disclosure to

investors. Without standardized contracts, litigation is governed by contract and tort law, with grave

uncertainty about outcomes because such matters as intent and negligence need to be sorted out in

court (Easterbrook and Fischel 1984). Securities law can structure contracting and litigation by

          See Landis (1938), Friend and Herman (1964), Coffee (1984 ,1989, 2002), Simon (1989), Mahoney (1995),
Fox (1999), Stulz (1999), Black (2001), Beny (2002), and Reese and Weisbach (2002). Barth et al. (2003) make an
empirical case for the benefits of government regulation of banking.

                                                      4
explicitly describing the obligations of various parties and burdens of proof, thereby reducing the

costs to them and to the court of establishing liability. With standardized contracts and litigation,

the costs of enforcing contracts privately decline, benefitting markets.3

        Under the final, public enforcement hypothesis, even with a securities law private

enforcement incentives are often insufficient to elicit honesty from issuers, and a public enforcer,

such as a Securities and Exchange Commission, is needed to support trade. Public enforcement

might work because the enforcer is independent and focused and so can regulate markets free from

political interference, because the enforcer can introduce regulations of market participants, because

it can secure information from issuers and market participants – through subpoena, discovery, or

other means – more effectively than private plaintiffs, or because it can impose sanctions.4 Under

this hypothesis, the strength of public rather than private enforcement mechanisms introduced by

securities laws is most beneficial for market development.

        To distinguish these three hypotheses, we cooperated with attorneys from 49 countries to

assemble a data base of rules and regulations governing security issuance. We used the data to

produce quantitative measures of security laws and regulations, with a focus on private and public

enforcement. Finally, we examined the relationship between our measures of securities laws and

a number of indicators of stock market development. In the analysis below, we first motivate our

data collection effort using an example of an actual dispute, then present the data on securities laws

around the world, and finally investigate if and how these laws matter for market development.



        3
          This view is developed in Black and Kraakman (1996), Hay, Shleifer and Vishny (1996), Hay and Shleifer
(1998), Glaeser and Shleifer (2001, 2002), and Bergman and Nicolaievsky (2002).
        4
          These themes are developed in Landis (1938), Becker (1968), Polinsky and Shavell (2000), Glaeser, Johnson
and Shleifer (2001), Glaeser and Shleifer (2003), and Pistor and Xu (2002).

                                                        5
II. A Motivating Example.

       We focus on the agency problem between prospective investors in an initial public offering

and the “promoter” who offers shares for sale. In modern days, this promoter is usually the owner

or founder of a private company acting in concert with his distributors (or underwriters) and

accountants, but at least some of the law developed historically as a way to control share sales by

specialized promoters, who bought companies and then sold their equity to the public (Mahoney

1995). The promoter’s problem is fraught with potential conflicts of interest: the promoter wants

to sell the shares at the highest possible price while concealing bad information about the company

and diverting its cash flows and assets to himself. Both the adverse selection and the moral hazard

problems are severe, and if not addressed can severely undermine – possibly stop – fund-raising in

the stock market.

       Grossman and Hart (1980) show, however, that with perfect law enforcement (i.e., automatic

sanctions for not telling the truth), promoters have an incentive to reveal everything they know, at

least in a particular model. The reason is that, without such revelation, potential investors assume

the absolute worst. To the extent that the circumstances of the company are better or conflicts of

interest less severe, promoters have every reason to disclose them, and they cannot say anything

more optimistic than the truth because of the automatic sanctions. Grossman and Hart also point out

that, without perfect enforcement, these favorable results for the market solution do not hold.

       Contrast this theoretical paradigm with an actual example of a securities issue from the

Netherlands (Velthuyse and Schlingmann 1995). In 1987 and 1988, a Dutch Bank, ABN Amro,

underwrote some bonds of Coopag Finance BV, a Dutch financial company wholly owned by Co-op

AG, a diversified German firm. The bonds were guaranteed by Co-op AG. The prospectus was


                                                 6
drafted in accordance with the requirements of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and included audited

annual accounts provided by the issuer to ABN Amro. In conformity with the law on annual

accounts, the (consolidated) financial statements included in the prospectus omitted 214 affiliated

companies of Co-op AG with debts of DM 1.5 billion. Shortly after the issue, Dutch newspapers

published negative information about Co-op AG and the bond prices of Coopag Finance BV

plummeted. The creditors of Coopag Finance sued the underwriter, ABN Amro, for losses due to

its failure to disclose material information about the finances of Co-op AG. ABN Amro claimed in

response that “the damages, if any, did not result from the alleged misleading nature of the

prospectuses...” but rather from unfavorable events that took place after the offering. In addition,

the distributor argued that “an investigation by ABN Amro, however extensive, could not have led

to the discovery of deceit, because even the accountants appeared not to have discovered in time that

something was wrong...” (Velthuyse and Schlingmann 1995, p. 233). The successive Dutch courts,

however, ruled the distributor liable, and recognized explicitly that its duty, in presenting the

prospectus to investors, went beyond merely relying on the information provided by the issuer.

Instead, to avoid liability, the Supreme Court ruled that a distributor must conduct an independent

investigation of the issuer and prove that it cannot be blamed for the damages caused by the

misleading prospectus.

       As this example illustrates, a country as developed as Holland, as recently as 15 years ago,

did not have a legal framework in place to guarantee full disclosure as predicted by Grossman and

Hart (1980). Some of the differences between the example and their model are worth emphasizing.

First, neither the issuer’s nor ABN Amro’s reputation was evidently sufficient to ensure full

disclosure. Second, the problem for private enforcement was not that of inaccurate disclosure -- in


                                                 7
fact the issuer complied with the affirmative disclosure requirements, but rather the omission of

material information from the prospectus. This omission did not cause investors to assume the

worst; after all, they bought the bonds. Third, this omission raised the question for the court of

whether the distributor or the issuer was liable, with the distributor rather than the bankrupt issuer

having the assets to compensate investors. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, the court had to

resolve the crucial question of the standard of liability for the distributor, namely what were its

affirmative obligations to investors. The court did not presume, as in the model, that failure to

disclose automatically caused liability. Resolving this issue required extensive, and expensive,

litigation, leading to a particular standard of care. These differences between the case and the

model suggest that in reality, enforcement of good conduct might be costly, and hence we should

not necessarily expect efficient outcomes from unregulated markets.

        This enforcement-based reasoning forms the analytical foundation of the case for securities

laws. Market mechanisms and litigation supporting private contracting may be too expensive. Since

investors, on average, are not tricked (this is not an issue of market efficiency), they pay lower prices

for the equity when they are unprotected, and the amount of equity issued is lower (Shleifer and

Wolfenzon 2002, La Porta et al. 2002). Securities laws, in so far as they reduce the cost of

contracting and resolving disputes, can encourage equity financing of firms and stock market

development. The Dutch example also suggests that solving the promoter’s problem is important

not only for equity markets but for debt markets as well.



3. The Variables.

        Our data on the regulation of the promoter’s problem is based on answers to a questionnaire


                                                   8
by attorneys in the sample of 49 countries with the largest stock market capitalization in 1993 (La

Porta et al. 1998). We invited one attorney from each country to answer the questionnaire

describing the securities laws (including actual laws, statues, regulations, binding judicial

precedents, and any other rule with force of law) applicable to an offering of shares listed in the

country’s largest stock exchange in December of 2000.5                      All 49 authors returned answered

questionnaires, and subsequently confirmed the validity of their answers as we recorded them. All

the variables derived from the questionnaires and other sources are defined in Table I.



Private Enforcement

         As James Landis, the principal author of U.S. securities laws, recognized, making private

recovery of investors’ losses easy was essential to harnessing the incentives of market participants

to enforce securities laws (Landis 1938, Seligman, 1995). Efficiency considerations suggest that

the lowest cost provider of information about a security should collect and present this information,

and be held accountable if he omits or misleads. In the Grossman-Hart model (1980), for example,

the lowest cost providers are not the investors, but the issuers, the distributors, and the accountants.6

An efficient system would provide them with incentives to collect and present information to

investors, and hold them liable if they do not. In securities laws, this strategy generally takes the

form of disclosure requirements and liability rules that make it cheaper for investors to recover


         5
          We first approached authors who had published country reports on securities laws in publications such as
International Securities Regulation and International Securities Laws. When countries were not covered in such
publications or authors declined our invitation, we searched the Martindale Law Directory to identify leading law firms
practicing in the area of securities laws and invited them to answer the questionnaire. The respondents received a
questionnaire designed by the authors with the help of practicing lawyers in Argentina, Japan, and the United States.
         6
           Two other features of initial public offerings make “buyer-beware” rules unattractive. First, the scope for
fraud is very large. Second, the damages resulting from investing in reliance of a defective prospectus are much easier
to calculate than those that result from, for example, the use of a defective appliance.

                                                          9
damages when information is wrong or omitted -- the two features we try to capture empirically.

        We collect six proxies for the strength of specific disclosure requirements pertaining to the

promoter’s problem. The first and most basic question is whether promoters can issue securities

without delivering a prospectus describing them to potential investors in advance. Since every

country requires a prospectus before securities are sold and listed, the operational word here is

“delivering.” In some countries, it is possible to sell securities after a prospectus is deposited at the

company, or with the Supervisor, without delivering it to investors. Delivering a prospectus to

potential investors is an affirmative step in making disclosures to them. In addition, we keep track

of affirmative disclosure requirement in the following five areas: (1) insiders’ compensation; (2)

ownership by large shareholders; (3) inside ownership; (4) contracts outside the normal course of

business; and (5) transactions with related parties. We calculate a sub-index of “disclosure

requirements” as the average of the preceding six proxies.

        In addition to specific disclosure requirements, nearly every country has a residual disclosure

requirement that the prospectus includes all material information necessary to assess the value of

the securities being offered. When bad news hit after security issuance, the question becomes

whether this information was known or knowable to the issuer, the distributor, and/or the accountant

and omitted from the prospectus. As the Dutch example illustrates, the standard of proof in the cases

of such omission is central to private enforcement of securities laws. The centrality of the liability

regime has largely been lost in the recent legal literature, which has focused instead on the

importance of mandatory disclosure. Here we focus explicitly on the liability regime.7



        7
            Some have asked us to examine whether the availability of class action suits is associated with the
development of securities markets. A dummy equal to one if class actions are available in a prospectus liability case
is an insignificant predictor of the development of securities markets.

                                                        10
        There are basically four liability regimes. In the “base” case, the standard of liability is the

same as in torts, namely negligence: the plaintiff must show that the issuer, the distributor, or the

accountant was negligent in omitting information from the prospectus. The tort standard also

requires that investors prove that they relied on the prospectus to invest (reliance) or that their losses

were caused by the misleading information in the prospectus (causality). Some countries make it

even harder for the plaintiffs, who must show that the defendants were grossly negligent (e.g.,

“drunk”) or intentioned in omitting the information that later comes to light. The burden of proof

is less demanding than tort in countries where investors must prove reliance or causality or both, but

not negligence. Finally, the burden of the proof is lowest where plaintiffs only need to show that

the information in the prospectus was misleading (but not reliance or causality). The defendants are

either strictly liable, or they must themselves show that they exercised due diligence in preparing

the prospectus. This shift in the burden of proof from plaintiffs to defendants can, in principle,

significantly reduce the cost to the former of establishing liability.

        In our empirical analysis, we code the burden of proof in a prospectus liability case against

directors, distributors, and accountants and compute a “burden-of-proof” sub-index. Finally, we

combine the sub-indices of disclosure and burden of proof into a “private-enforcement” index.



Public Enforcement

        In the context of a securities markets, a public enforcer can be a Securities Commission, a

Central Bank, or some other supervisory body. For concreteness, we call the main government

agency or official authority in charge of supervising securities markets the Supervisor. We focus on

four broad aspects of public enforcement.


                                                   11
        The first aspect covers the basic attributes of the Supervisor, which we capture with four

variables. First, an effective Supervisor may need to be insulated from interference by the Executive

both to facilitate recruiting professional staff and to prevent political interference on behalf of

influential issuers. To measure the Supervisor’s independence, we keep track of whether its key

members are appointed through a system of checks-and-balances or unilaterally by the Executive.

Second, and relatedly, the independence of the Supervisor may be enhanced when its key members

may only be dismissed after due process rather than at the will of the appointing authority. Third,

an effective Supervisor may need to be focused on securities markets, rather than on both these

markets and banking, so that his success is more closely tied to that of the securities market.

Accordingly, we measure whether the Supervisor’s mandate covers securities markets alone.

Fourth, it may be important that the power to regulate securities markets be delegated to the

Supervisor, rather than remain with the legislature or the Ministry of Finance (Spiller and Ferejohn

1992). We measure whether the Supervisor has the power to regulate primary offerings and/or

listing rules on stock exchanges. We combine these four variables into a sub-index of “Supervisor

attributes”.

        The second aspect covers the investigative powers of the Supervisor. Unless the issuer, the

distributor, and the auditor are strictly liable for all false and misleading statements in the

prospectus(which never happens), the question arises as to why the information revealed to investors

was inaccurate. Did the issuer, distributor, or auditor have the information? If not, could they have

had it? At what cost? Did the issuer hide the information from the distributor or the auditor?

Answering these questions is costly, especially for private plaintiffs. A Supervisor can be

empowered to command documents from issuers, distributors, or accountants, and to subpoena



                                                 12
testimony of witnesses. Such powers can in principle enable the Supervisor to ascertain the reasons

for inaccuracy which can then – as a public good – become the basis for sanctions, or for criminal,

or civil litigation. We summarize the powers of the Supervisor to subpoena documents and witnesses

by forming a sub-index of “Investigative powers”.

       The third aspect – perhaps most directly intended to substitute for the weakness of private

enforcement – covers non-criminal sanctions for violations of securities laws. These sanctions may

involve ordering the directors of a public firm to rectify non-compliance with disclosure

requirements, to institute changes recommended by outside reviewers, and/or to compensate

investors for their losses. Such sanctions could be imposed separately on issuers, distributors, and

accountants, and we keep track of each category. We then average the scores for the sanctions

against the various parties to create a sub-index of “orders”.

       Finally, the fourth aspect covers criminal sanctions for violations of securities laws. We

keep track of whether criminal sanctions are applicable, to whom they apply, and what conduct

invokes them. We average the scores for criminal sanctions against directors, distributors, and

accountant to obtain a sub-index of “criminal sanctions”. These variables are of special interest

since a popular sentiment in the current discussions of securities laws sees criminal sanctions as

essential to enforcing good practices. We average the preceding four sub-indexes for public

enforcement to form the index of “public enforcement”.



Other Variables

       We are interested in understanding the effects of the various provisions in securities laws on

financial development. We use seven proxies for the development of securities markets in different



                                                 13
countries. The first variable is the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP scaled by the fraction

of stock market held by outside investors. (The results are qualitatively similar for the unadjusted

ratio of market capitalization to GDP.) The second variable is the (logarithm of the) number of

domestic publicly-traded firms in each country relative to its population. The third variable is the

value of initial public offerings in each country relative to its GDP. All three variables are five-year

averages of yearly data for the period 1996-2000. Theoretically, the first of these three measures

is the most attractive, since in theory better investor protection is associated with both a higher

number of listed firms and higher valuation of capital (Shleifer and Wolfenzon 2002). Except for

some differences in scaling and timing, these three variables were used in La Porta et al. (1997) to

study the consequences of investor protection through corporate law on stock market development.

         The fourth variable is a qualitative assessment of the ability of new and medium-sized firms

to raise equity in the stock market based on a survey of business executives by the Global

Competitiveness Report (1999). The fifth variable is the (median) premium paid for control in

corporate control transactions. In several theoretical models, this variable has been interpreted as

a measure of private benefits of control, which are higher in countries with weaker investor

protection (Grossman and Hart 1988, Dyck and Zingales 2003, Nenova 2003). The sixth variable

is a proxy for the quality of accounting information actually reported by firms, as measured by an

index of earnings’ manipulation (Leuz, Nanda, and Wysocki 2002). Finally, the seventh variable

is a proxy for ownership concentration among the largest firms in the country.8 Both theory

(Shleifer and Wolfenzon 2002) and prior empirical work (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer

1999) suggest that ownership concentration is lower in countries with better investor protection.


         8
           We also tried stock market turnover as a measure of liquidity. The results are qualitatively similar to those
for the variables used in the paper.

                                                          14
       To isolate the effect of securities laws on financial markets, we control for several factors

identified by previous research. The first of these is the level of economic development, which we

measure as the (logarithm of) per capita GDP. Economic development is often associated with

capital deepening. In addition, richer countries might have higher quality institutions in general,

including better quality of law enforcement, which could be associated with better financial

development regardless of the content of the laws (North 1981, La Porta et al. 1999). To further

address this issue, we use the measure of the efficiency of the judiciary from the International

Country Risk Guide as an additional control.

       La Porta et al. (1997, 1998) present evidence that measures of investor protection derived

from corporate law are associated with stock market development. This evidence raises the question

of which laws, if any, make a difference. Accordingly, in all our regressions, we include the anti-

directors rights index of the protection afforded to shareholders through statutory corporate law as

an additional control.

       As in many other studies in this area, the causal effect of securities laws on financial

development cannot be established with certainty. Following La Porta et al. (1997, 1998), we use

the legal origin of commercial laws as an instrument. The commercial laws of most countries

originate in one of four legal families: English (common) law, French civil law, German civil law,

and Scandinavian law, which have spread throughout the world through conquest, colonization, and

occasionally voluntary transplantation. Common and civil law are intimately connected to the

distinction between public and private enforcement that we are interested in testing. England

developed a common law tradition, characterized by independent judges and juries, relatively

weaker reliance on statutes, and the preference for contracts and private litigation as a means of



                                                15
dealing with social harms. France, in contrast, developed a civil law tradition, characterized by state-

employed judges, great reliance on legal and procedural codes, and a preference for state regulation

over private litigation. This makes legal origin a suitable instrument for the stance of the law

regarding public and private enforcement.



Overview of the Data

       Table II presents our data on securities laws. Countries are arranged by legal origin, and we

report means by legal origin as well as tests of the differences in these means. Common and civil

law countries differ significantly in our measures of both private and public enforcement. In the

private enforcement area, common law countries both have more extensive mandatory disclosure

requirements, and make it easier for investors to recover damages. In the public enforcement area,

these differences are smaller for Supervisor attributes (Supervisors in German and Scandinavian

legal origin countries are weaker than in the other two groups), and greater for investigative powers,

orders, and criminal sanctions. Compared to civil law countries, Supervisors in common law

countries have more extensive investigative powers and both criminal and non-criminal sanctions

are more severe. In the next section, we examine which dimensions of the security law matter for

financial development, and investigate the roles of securities and corporate law as determinants of

financial development.



IV. Securities laws and financial development.

       Table III presents the results of regressions of stock market capitalization to GDP ratio on

the anti-director rights index, efficiency of the judiciary, logarithm of GDP per capita, and each of



                                                  16
our individual sub-indices of investor protection through the securities law. Both higher per capita

GDP and efficiency of the judiciary are associated with larger stock markets, and these effects are

quantitatively large. Perhaps most interestingly, both disclosure requirements and burden of the

proof are positively correlated with larger stock markets. In contrast, none of our sub-indices of

public enforcement enters significantly. Finally, the index of anti-director rights is significant only

when combined with measures of public enforcement and drops out from the regressions that include

proxies for private enforcement. To put the results on private enforcement in perspective, in our

sample, the external-market-capitalization-to-GDP ratio ranges from 0.002 in Uruguay to 1.44 in

Switzerland. The estimated coefficient suggests that improving disclosure requirements by two

standard deviations – roughly the distance from Denmark or Norway to the U.S. – is associated with

an increase in the market-capitalization-to-GDP ratio of 0.27. Similarly, the estimated coefficient

suggests that lowering the burden of the proof by two standard deviations – the distance from Ireland

to the U.S. -- is associated with an increase in the market-capitalization-to-GDP ratio of 0.20.

       We do not report the results for other measures of stock market development and securities

law sub-indices because they are similar to those in Table III. The results on private enforcement

are consistently strong. Specifically, both broader mandatory disclosure requirements and a lighter

burden of establishing the liability of issuers, distributors, and accountants are associated with more

developed stock markets for all dependent variables except for earnings manipulation. With respect

to public enforcement, the results are much weaker. First, the Supervisor’s characteristics (i.e.,

independence, focus, and power to make rules) do not matter for any of the outcome variables.

Second, the Supervisor’s investigative power is only associated with more domestic firms. Third,

the Supervisor’s power to issue orders is only associated with more IPOs and less earnings



                                                  17
manipulation (and weakly – t-stat of 1.65– with more domestic firms). Fourth, criminal sanctions

only matter for IPOs. Criminal deterrence may be ineffective because proving criminal intent of

issuers, distributors, or accountants in omitting information from the prospectus is difficult.

       These results suggest a preliminary view of what works, and what does not, in security laws.

Public enforcement plays, at best, a modest role in the development of stock markets. Specifically,

there is no evidence that such factors as Supervisor’s independence or focus work. Both the

Supervisor’s investigative powers and the strength of both criminal and non-criminal sanctions only

matter for a narrow set of outcomes. In contrast, the development of stock markets is strongly

associated with measures of private enforcement such as extensive disclosure requirements and a

relatively low burden of proof on investors seeking to recover damages resulting from omissions of

material information from the prospectus.

       In the remainder of this section, we explore these preliminary findings from a range of

perspectives. To reduce the number of regressions, we focus on aggregate indices of public and

private enforcement. Since both of our private enforcement sub-indices work reasonably well,

aggregating them into an index is straightforward. Combining the sub-indices of public enforcement

may increase its importance of public enforcement if its various dimensions are substitutes.

       Table IV presents the results of regressing financial development on private enforcement

(Panel A), public enforcement (Panel B), and on both of them (Panel C). To interpret the results

on Table IV, note that, when securities laws are excluded from the regression, stronger anti-director

rights are associated with better stock market development for all dependent variables except the

index of access to equity (results not reported). Panel A shows, however, that private enforcement

knocks out anti-director rights as a significant predictor of market development. Instead, private



                                                 18
enforcement is associated with more developed stock markets for all seven dependent variables. The

estimated coefficients predict that a two-standard deviation increase in private enforcement is

(roughly the distance from Ireland to the U.S.) is associated with an increase of 0.30 in the external-

market-to-GDP ratio, a 55% rise in listed firms per capita, a 2.34 increase in the IPO-to-GDP ratio,

a 12 percentage point drop in the block premia, an improvement of 1 point in the access-to-equity

index, a decrease of 5.25 points in the earnings manipulation index, and a 10 percentage point drop

in ownership concentration.

        The results for public enforcement in Panel B are less consistent. For the number of listed

domestic firms and IPOs, it is public enforcement, but not anti-director rights, that matters, and the

economic effect of public enforcement in these regressions is large. A two-standard deviation

increase in public enforcement (roughly from Sweden to the U.S. ) is associated with a 42% increase

in listed firms per capita and adds 1.6 to the IPO-to-GDP ratio. In contrast, anti-director rights, but

not public enforcement, typically matters for the other measures of stock market development (with

the exception of earnings manipulation for which neither variable matters).

         Finally, Panel C presents the results of a horse race between our proxies for private and

public enforcement. The key result is that private enforcement is significant in all but one of the

regressions (earnings manipulation). In contrast, public enforcement is never significant when

combined with private enforcement (i.e., private enforcement knocks out public enforcement from

the regressions for domestic firms and IPOs).9 Finally, consistent with Panel A, the anti-director

rights index plays a minor role and is only significant in the regression for ownership concentration.

        The empirical result that investor protections through securities laws dwarf those from

        9
            The correlation between public- and private-enforcement is 0.43 (see Appendix B). The results are
qualitatively similar if we run horse-race regressions using each of the components of public enforcement rather than
the index.

                                                        19
corporate law in encouraging equity finance must be interpreted with caution. Corporate law and

securities laws may rely on similar rules (e.g., regarding the burden-of-the-proof in civil cases). For

example, the U.S. system of mandatory disclosure evolved out of common law principles applicable

to agents dealing adversely with their principals (Mahoney 1995). In fact, the correlation coefficient

between the anti-director index and private enforcement is 0.57 (see Appendix B).



V. Robustness

        In this section, we address three issues of robustness. First, is the weakness of our results

on public enforcement due to measurement problems? Second, what omitted variables may explain

the strength of our results on private enforcement? Third, is private enforcement endogenous?

        Public enforcement may only be effective in countries with efficient government

bureaucracies. To address this concern we have rerun our regressions for the sub-sample of

countries with per capita GDP above the median.10 We find no consistent evidence that public

enforcement is correlated with larger securities markets in these countries. A related concern is that

public enforcement may be ineffective if the Supervisor lacks adequate resources. To address this

concern, we have collected data on the number of employees that work for the Supervisor. We find

that the (log of) the number of employees is insignificant in our regressions. To get at the interaction

between public enforcement and the resources of the Supervisor, we break the sample according to

whether the number of employees working for the Supervisor is above or below the sample median

and run separate regressions for both groups of countries. Public enforcement is statistically

significant only for IPOs and earnings manipulation in countries with well-staffed regulators (and


        10
          The results are qualitatively similar if we break the sample using survey measures of the quality of
government.

                                                     20
for domestic firms in countries with poorly-staffed ones).

       It might be argued that financial markets are small where the state is large. For example, few

firms may be publicly-traded in countries where the state owns most of the capital. Omitted variable

bias may account for the strength of our results if private enforcement is negatively correlated with

the role of the state in the economy. To address this concern, we have included two measures of the

role of the state in the economy in our regressions: (1) the fraction of the capital stock in the hands

of state-owned companies from La Porta et al. (1999); and (2) the fraction of the banking assets

controlled by government-owned banks from La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2002). Our

results on securities laws remain qualitatively unchanged. Another omitted variable story holds that

countries with large capital markets may come to rely on private enforcement because their

institutions are more responsive to the interests of small investors. However, measures of

democracy and political rights are uncorrelated with private enforcement (and public enforcement).

Moreover, such measures are not significant predictors of financial development in our regressions.

       Finally, it is possible that governments adopt better securities laws in countries with buoyant

financial markets. For example, countries with large financial markets may adopt good regulations

because there are fixed costs of doing so. This argument is undermined by the systematic differences

in investor protection across legal origins. Reverse causality is also undermined by the fact that the

dimensions of the law that are expensive to implement – for example, having an independent and

focused regulator – do not seem to matter. On the contrary, what matters is legal rules that are cheap

rather than expensive to introduce. A second reverse causality argument holds that regulators swarm

toward large securities markets, because there are bigger rents to secure from regulating them. This

argument is also undermined by the fact that it is precisely the regulations that render the regulators



                                                  21
unimportant, namely those that standardize private contracting and litigation, that have the tightest

association with stock market development.

         We can partially address endogeneity problems using instrumental variables. In practice,

legal origin is the only suitable instrument. As a result, we cannot treat both securities and corporate

law as endogenous.11 To get around this problem, we replace private enforcement and anti-director

rights with the principal component of these two variables, which we call investor protection.12 This

principal component accounts for 79% of the variation in private enforcement and anti-director

rights. Table V presents the two stage least squares results using English legal origin as an

instrument.13 Investor protection is statistically significant for all seven proxies of stock market

development. These results should partially mitigate endogeneity concerns.



VI. Conclusion.

         In the introduction, we described the three hypotheses concerning the effect of securities

laws on stock market development. Our findings provide clear evidence bearing on these

hypotheses.

         First, the answer to the question of whether “law matters” is a definite yes. Our findings

corroborate the earlier research that shows that investor protections provided in corporate law matter

for securities markets, by showing that investor protections provided by the securities law also


         11
             In addition to legal origin, we tried proxies for culture (e.g., religious affiliation) and endowments (e.g.,
latitude and ethno-linguistic fractionalization) as instruments. However, the predicted values of private enforcement
and anti-director rights are highly collinear.
         12
           Similar instrumental variable results obtain if, instead of the principal component, we use the average or the
product of anti-director rights and private enforcement.
         13
          The first-stage F statistic is 31.45, which suggests that there is no problem of weak instruments (Staiger and
Stock 1997). The OLS and IV estimated coefficients are very similar in magnitude.

                                                           22
matter – perhaps even more so.

       Second, our findings suggest that securities laws matter because they reduce the costs of

private contracting and litigation rather than provide for public regulatory enforcement. When we

try to understand specifically what works in securities laws, we find that several aspects of public

enforcement, such as having an independent and/or focused regulator or criminal sanctions, do not

matter, and others matter in only some regressions.          In contrast, both extensive disclosure

requirements and a simple procedure to facilitate investor recovery of losses are associated with

larger stock markets.

       At the more general level, these results illustrate the theory of optimal institutions in Djankov

et al. (2003), which maintains that optimal intervention is shaped by the tradeoff between the costs

of market and government failure. For the case of securities markets, our evidence suggests that

the efficient institutional choice takes the form of private enforcement of public rules, which

encourages private recovery of damages by investors harmed by promoters. Other markets may call

for less government intervention, still others for heavier regulation. Generally speaking, it will take

an empirical approach, such as that undertaken here, to understand what institutions are efficient in

a specific environment. In this respect, this analysis confirms Coase’s (1960) view that efficient

institutional arrangements vary across activities, and minimize total transaction costs, including

both those of market and government failure.

                                             Table I - Description of the Variables
This table describes the variables in the paper. The Supervisor is the main government agency in charge of supervising stock exchanges.
The Issuer is a domestic corporation that raises capital through an initial public offering of common shares. The newly-issued shares will
be listed on the country’s largest stock exchange. The Distributor advises the Issuer on the preparation of the prospectus and assists in
marketing the securities but does not authorize (or sign) the prospectus unless required by law. The Accountant audits the financial
statements and documents that accompany the prospectus. Unless otherwise specified, the source for the variables is the questionnaire of
law firms and the laws of each country. The edited answers to the questionnaire are posted at
http://post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/shleifer/papers/securities_documentation.pdf.

 Variable                                                                   Description

                                                                   I.1 Disclosure requirements

 Prospectus           Equals one if the law prohibits selling securities that are going to be listed on the largest stock exchange of the
                      country without delivering a prospectus to potential investors; equals zero otherwise.

 Compensation         An index of prospectus disclosure requirements regarding the compensation of directors and key officers. Equals
                      one if the law or the listing rules require that the compensation of each director and key officer be reported in the
                      prospectus of a newly-listed firm; equals one-half if only the aggregate compensation of directors and key officers
                      must be reported in the prospectus of a newly-listed firm; equals zero when there is no requirement to disclose the
                      compensation of directors and key officers in the prospectus for a newly-listed firm.

 Shareholders         An index of disclosure requirements regarding the Issuer’s equity ownership structure. Equals one if the law or the
                      listing rules require disclosing the name and ownership stake of each shareholder who, directly or indirectly,
                      controls ten percent or more of the Issuer’s voting securities; equals one-half if reporting requirements for the
                      Issuer’s 10% shareholders do not include indirect ownership or if only their aggregate ownership needs to be
                      disclosed; equals zero when the law does not require disclosing the name and ownership stake of the Issuer’s 10%
                      shareholders. No distinction is drawn between large-shareholder reporting requirements imposed on firms and those
                      imposed on large shareholders themselves.

 Inside ownership     An index of prospectus disclosure requirements regarding the equity ownership of the Issuer’s shares by its directors
                      and key officers. Equals one if the law or the listing rules require that the ownership of the Issuer’s shares by each
                      of its director and key officers be disclosed in the prospectus; equals one-half if only the aggregate number of the

Ordinary least squares regressions of the cross-section of countries. The dependent variables are: (1) External market capitalization ratio; (2) Log of domestic firms
per capita; (3) Value of IPOs; (4) Block premia; (5) Access to equity; (6) Earnings manipulation; and (7) Ownership concentration. For each dependent variable,
we report three regressions successively controlling for the following securities laws variables: (1) Private enforcement (Panel A); (2) Public enforcement (Panel
B); and (3) both Private and Public enforcement (Panel C). In addition to the securities laws variables, all regressions include Anti-director rights, Log of GDP per
capita, and Efficiency of the judiciary. Robust standard errors are shown in parentheses. All variables are described in Table 1.

                                                      Table V - Instrumental Variables Regressions
Two-stage least squares regressions of the cross-section of countries. The dependent variables are: (1) External market capitalization; (2) Log of domestic firms per
capita; (3) Value of IPOs; (4) Block premia; (5) Access to equity; (6) Earnings manipulation; and (7) Ownership concentration. Investor protection is the principal
component of Private enforcement and Anti-director rights. In addition to Investor protection, all regressions include Log of GDP per capita and Efficiency of the
judiciary. The instrument is a dummy equal to one if the country’s legal origin is common law. All variables are described in Table 1. Robust standard errors are
shown in parentheses.
