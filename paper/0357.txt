                        Labor Mobility and Wages

                                 SUMMARY



     In this essay we explore the implications of human capital and search
behavior for both the interpersonal and life—cycle structure of inter—firm
labor mobility. The economic hypothesis which motivates the analysis is that
individual differences in firm—specific complementarities and related skill
acquisitions produce differences in mobility behavior and in the relation
between job tenure, wages and mobility. Both "job duration dependencet' and'
heterogeneity bias" are implied by this theory. Exploration of longitudinal
data sets (NLS and MID) which contain mobility, job and wage histories of men
in the 1966—76 decade yield the following findings, among others:
     1. The initially steep and later decelerating declines of labor mobility
with working age are in large part due to the similar but more steeply declin-
ing relation between mobility and length of job tenure.
     2. Given tenure levels, the probability of moving is predicted positively
by the frequency of prio moves and negatively by education. The inclusion of
prior moves in the regression reduces the estimated tenure slope because it
helps to remove the "heterogeneity bias" in that slope.
     3. The popular "mover—stayer model" is rejected by the existence of
tenure effects on mobility.
     4. Differences in mobility during the first decade of working life do not
predict long—run differences in earnings. However, persistent movers at later
stages of working life have lower wage levels and flatter life—cycle wage growth.
     5. The analysis calls for a reformulation of earnings (wage) functions.
Inclusion of tenure terms in the function permits separate estimates of returns
to general and specific human capital after correction for heterogeneity bias.
A rough estimate is that 50 percent of life—time wage growth is due to general
(transferable) experience and 25 percent each to firm—specific experience and
inter—firm mobility.

                          Labor Mobility and Wage!t


1. Introduction: Renewed Interest in Labor Mobility

    Labor mobility is one of the central topics of labor economics and

a long—standing subject of empirical research. Earlier studies reflected

primarily a concern with the allocative efficiency of the labor market.

They analyzed attitudes, job—change decisions and the direction of ob-

served labor mobility in attempts to ascertain whether information,

motivation and behavior of workers were consistent with the postulates

of economic theory.

     ifl a comprehensive survey of this literature (Parnes, 1970) the

author concluded that the evidence on the operation of market forces

was mixed, both among different studies and even within them. Although

research in the 1960's was more sophisticated and utilized larger data

sets than prior work it did not provide any change in perspective.

     Reviewing the more recent literature Parsons (1976) finds promise

in the emergence of human capital and of search theories as tools for

the analysis of labor mobility, labor turnover, and unemployment.

However, applied work in search theory     has,   thus far, only partially

touched on problems of labor mobility and of unemp1oyinent Its emphasis

has been largely on conditions terminating job search, rather than on

circumstances which generate it.

     The reformulation of labor mobility as a human capital investment

decision has been fruitfully applied to migration (Sjastaad, 1962, and

other work reviewed by Greenwood, 1976). The connection between invest-

ments   specific to the firm. (and   to larger units) and the incidence of


     *part I is an exposition and empirical analysis whch ranges over some-
what wider subject matter than Part II which focuses on the stochastic
structure of mobility processes. We are grateful to the National Science

industrial and occupational labor turnover has been elucidated in studies

of Becker (1962) ,   Oi   (1961) ,   and Parsons (1972)

     The novel approaches suggested by human capital and by search

theories are producing a renewed interest in the formerly stagnant field

of labor mobility. A further source of interest has come from stochastic

models of labor mobility. These made their initial appearance as the

"mover-stayer" model two decades ago (Blumen, Kagan, McCarthy, 1955) and

have recently reappeared in more sophisticated form.1

     The purpose of this essay2 is to explore the implications of human

capital and search behavior for both the interpersonal and life cycle

structure of inter-firm labor mobility. The apparent ambiguity in the

relation between labor mobility and wages which characterizes much of

the literature surveyed by Parnes is implicit and reconcilable in human

capital analysis: As a response to perceived gains in wages mobility

promotes individual wage growth, but to the extent that on-the-job invest-

ments contain elements of specificity, mobility is a deterrent to wage

growth. The study of differences in mobility behavior requires inform-

ation over time: Of special importance, in our approach, is information

on time spent in the firm (tenure) and on the life—cycle changes in job

attachments. The availability of longitudinal inicrodata (especially

NLS and MID panels) enables us to study these phenomena.

     The economic hypothesis which motivates the analysis is that indiv-

idual differences in firm—specific human capital behavior lead, via wage

effects, to heterogeneity in mobility behavior, and to "tenure effects"

on attachment to the firm. Implications for life—cycle mobility are

then derived in the absence or presence of "aging" (changes in mobility

with age, at given tenure levels). Both "tenure dependence" and "hetero—
                                     —3—



geneity   bias" are implied by the theory. We explore data sets which

contain mobility histories to ascertain the existence of these phenomena

and to correct for the predictable biases. Next we investigate corres-

ponding features of the wage structure. Labor mobility and tenure effects

are introduced and tested in a reformulated earnings function in which

specific   and general human capital accumulation can be distinguished.
     Part II presents a rigorous formulation of the structure of mobility
viewed   as a stochastic process.


2. Tenure, Working Age, and Mobility: Some Definitions and Facts

     We define labor mobility as change of employer, whether or not

unemployment intervenes. We exclude exits from and entries into the labor

force. This exclusion is a minor one for the male labor force which we

study.3    Consequently,   job separation is synonymous with job change in

our data. Except for one illustration of observed differences (in Table

2), we do not distinguish here between separations initiated by (or

reported as) quit or layoff. Geographic, industrial, and occupational

mobility are components of job mobility which are included in our concept

but not singled out for separate treatnient.4

     Two probabilistic relations, or time—profiles, are basic in our

discussion and measurement of labor mobility.      (1) The "tenure turnover

profile" S(T) is the relation between the probability of separating

from a job in period t and the time spent in that job prior to t (current

tenure T). In the language of renewal theory, S(T) is the "hazard

function". At the individual level this is a profile of "propensities

to move" conditional on tenure. Such a profile is not observable. In

large homogeneous groups, that is consisting of individuals with the
same propensities    S(T), we can observe estimates of   the   probabilities in

each   period in the form of relative frequencies or separation rates
conditional on tenure. (2) The relation between an individualts
propensity to move and working age, regardless of his current tenure,
is his "experience turnover profile" S(X).     Again this is observable

as    a relation between experience and separation rates.
       The most firmly established   fact about labor mobility of all kinds

is    that it declines with age. It declines much more sharply     with length

of    tenure. The declines in both S(X) and S(T) are strongest      initially

and   decelerate subsequently. Several tenure and age profiles of separ-
ation rates are shown in Tables 1—3.

       Table 1 shows the decline with age in the proportion of job changers

(number of job changers divided by number employed) in 1961. The decline

is similar when measured in terms of number of job changes rather than

job changers, since a similar fraction (35—40 percent) of job movers ih

each age group changed jobs more than once during the year.5

       Table 2 shows cross—classifications of separations, quits and lay-

offs by experience and tenure in the period 1971-73 in the two NLS

samples of men (young men, ages 19—29 and older men ages 50—64 in 1971).

The tenure profiles within working age (experience) classes are steeply

declining and decelerating (convex). Mobility does not decline with age

at given tenure levels within each of the cohort age ranges. The

decline between the young and old cohort is pronounced but it shows

mainly in quits.

       The separation equations in Table 3 summarize the nc1usion that

within the two age panels declines of mobility with age (experience),

shown by S(X) in Tables 1 and 2, are due to the effect of tenure which is

revealed in the regression S(X,T): For young men, experience effects

(coefficients of X, X2) vanish when tenure (T, T2) is included. No

experience effects are observed for older men with or without the tenure

variables.6 However, estimates of S(X) and S(X,T) in Michigan Income

Dynamics data which cover the complete age spectrum (Table 5, Panel C,

lines 1 and 2) show that net aging effects remain even after the inclusion

of tenure, although they are reduced in size and significance. In all

data sets the explanatory power resides mainly in the tenure variables;

mobility is convex both in tenure and in experience; and the tenure

profile is much steeper than the experience profile.


3. Wage and Mobility Structures: Some Theory

    We now turn to broad theoretical considerations with which we

may analyze the facts of labor mobility. Some aspects of skill ac-

quired in a particular firm are not transferable to other firms.   The

acquisition of such "specific" components of human capital by workers

and the consequent wage pattern suffice to produce the tenure effects

in the attachment to the firm which we observed in Tables 2 and 3. At

the same time individual differences in amounts of specific capital

investment imply a heterogeneity in mobility, or in attachment to the

firm (length of tenure) as well as in the strength of tenure effects

that is in slopes of the tenure-separation probability relation.

     The effects of acquiring job specific capital on mobility may be

described as follows: Successful job matches eventually result in

wage levels W which exceed expected alternative wages Wg. The higher

the wage W the less incentive to quit, given the usual fluctuations in

demand. Separations are high during the initial "probation" period and
drop to low levels. It is reasonable to assume that a successful match is

only a starting point for a continuing employment relation which often

involves investments of workers and firms in worker skills, and these

are partially nontransferable.7 Employer investments involve hiring,

screening, and training costs which are recouped by wage policy Wg < W

< VMP, where VMP is the workerts value of marginal product in the firm,

so   that both quits and layoffs are deterred.

       Define W =
                    Wg
                         +   W51   where Wg is the worker return on his general

(transferable) human capital and W is the difference between the

(higher) wage received in the firm and the opportunity wage elsewhere

(Wg)• Similarly, We is the employer's return on the costs of investing

in workers, the difference between the worker's productivity (VMP) and

the wage paid to him (W). Workers are deterred from quitting and

employers from dismissing workers, because of these returns. Total

separations are affected by            = (VMP -         =        + We that is by both
                                                  Wg)       W5

components of returns to specific capital. In this paper we do not

focus on the distinction between quit and layoff and do not consider

the question whether employers and workers engage in joint or in separate

optimizing behavior.8 Plausibly, W and We are expected to be positively

related: a good match and opportunity for joint investments are recog-

nized by both employee and employer.

      The distribution of returns to specific capital ()                 creates   indiv-

idual (and group) differences in tenure—turnover profiles. Tenure pro-

files are horizontal only when = 0, in which case tenure has no effect

on mobility or on wages. With > 0, tenure profiles of specific capital

does not emerge instantaneously as the worker joins the firm. It is

accumulated over time, given a successful match, and the returns grow over

time. Both the rate of growth of these returns and their ultimate level

affect mobility:
the "tenure effect" is steeper the bigger both. The convexity of the

tenure—mobility profiles, and concavity of the tenure-wage profiles are

due to the eventual completion of specific capital accumulation in the
     9
firm.

        Thus the economics of specific human capital formation predicts the

coexistence of heterogeneity and of "tenure dependence" in mobility.

The two aspects of behavior are related and re not to be viewed as

mutually exclusive hypotheses: Persons who favor large volumes of

specific capital investment exhibit relatively little mobilityl0 (except

f an initial period of repeated search and occasional later moves) and

strong tenure effects. Low levels of specific investment behavior, whether

intentional or due to inefficiency in job matching, imply high (persistent)

mobility levels independent of tenure (zero or small tenure effects).

If rates of decline of experience profiles of mobility reflect primarily

the slopes of tenure profiles, as appears to be the case, the flat and

high profiles of "movers" and the downward sloping profiles of "stayers"

imply a progressive divergence over the life-cycle in observed mobility

behavior of a heterogeneous population.

     The growing divergence of mobility rates over the working age parallels

the repeatedly observed divergence of individual life—cycle wage profiles.11

The human capital model can interpret both as lifetime outcomes of un-

changing individual differences in abilities and opportunities. This

view cautions against literal impressions that older cohorts are more

heterogeneous than younger ones, or against the notion that the experience

of longer tenure creates a "reinforcement effect" that is a desire to invest

in specific capital. This is not to say, however, that such views are not
valid. Habit formation and unexpected contingencies do modify lifetime

histories, but they need not be invoked in an initial analysis.

    The major implication of specific capital .heterogeneity for the

structure of mobility is the existence of differential tenure effects.

Levels of S(T) are higher and slopes flatter for individuals and groups

who acquire little specificity in their human capital, while steeper

slopes and eventually lower -levels characterize tenure functions of

large specific capital investors. Empirical observations should reveal

downward slopes in tenure—turnover profiles exaggerated by "hetero-

geneity bias", as well as "true" negative slopes after correction for bias.

     A related set of predictions applies to the wage structure: A

major one jS the existence of tenure effects on wages which are additional

to the effects of general human capital accumulation. This suggests a

reformulation of the earnings function to include a tenure term. The

experience and tenure coefficients should provide a decomposition of worker

returns to general (transferable) and specific (nontransferable) human

capital. As in the case of mobility it is also necessary to attempt

correction for potential upward biases in tenure effects which are posed

by the existence of heterogeneity.

     Other implications of the theory relate to age (experience) changes

in mobility and wages S(X) and W(X). An interesting conclusion is that

mobility declines and wages grow -   with   age even if there are no

"aging" effects, that is even if mobility depended only on levels of

tenure and not directly on age (given tenure). Similarly, wages would

grow (on average) over the life-cycle even if no general (experience)

capital were accumulated. Also W(X) would be concave if W(T) is concave,

and S(X) is convex because S(T) is. Indeed, without specific capital
phenomena the convex shape of the age patterns of mobility S(X) would be

difficult to understand.


4. Tenure Effects on Mobility in Homogeneous
    and in Heterogeneous Groups

        A simple heuristic model makes the notions intuitively clear:12

The propensity to move at the individual level, or the separation rate

in a homogeneous group is a function:


                                     s =   f(T,X)                          (1)



where s is the probability of separation in period t, T is length of

current employment in the firm up to time t, and X is total work exper-

ience (working age). The slope of the age (experience) profile is:


                                     —                                   (2)
                                dx         T         dx


Here          is the slope of the tenure profile,             is the growth of tenure

with working age, and         is the true age effect, if any. Note that

o   <        < 1. Tenure would grow by the same amount of time as age only
        dx
in the case of perfect immobility: It increases initially with age since

it is necessarily short at early stages of experience. At later stages

        approaches zero as T approaches the fixed value (. — 1) in the ease

of no-tenure depeidence, that is when               =   0.   In the case of job

specificity or tenure dependence, i.e., when .!< 0       remains positive
                                                                  ,
                                                     dx
at later ages as well.'3 A regression of T on X, not shown here, reveals

a positive slope and slight concavity.

        Decomposition (2) yields the following conclusions about the

observed decline of mobility with age:
     1. Even if there were no "age effects" (-   = 0),   mobility would

decline with age, because of job specificities, that   is   because mobility

declines with tenure   < 0. No decline would be observed if mobility

were independent of tenure.

     2. Again abstracting from age effects, since d.!< 1, the slope of
                                                  dx
the experience profile is less than that of the tenure profile.

     3. Convexity in the tenure profile would be reinforced or simply

reflected in the age profile if     decreases over time, or is constant.

Moreover, this could happen even if there is an age effect and even if

the latter were concave.

     4. Decline of mobility with age is faster the stronger the decline

of mobility with tenure, apart from the pure age effect.

    Up to this point the analysis applies to a homogeneous group,

defined by the identical S(X,T) function for each of its members.

Components of life-cycle mobility can be observed directly in such

groups by estimation of equation (1). Generally, it is not possible

to define homogeneous groups empirically, so that estimation of (1)

cannot be carried out directly. If in fact individual propensities to

move are not reduced by tenure yet they differ among workers, the ob-

served group tenure profile S(T) will have a downward slope and is

likely to be convex as well. In this case persons with high propen-

sities to move separate at early levels of tenure while those with

low propensities stay on a long time. The decline in the tenure pro-

file consequently reflects the degree of heterogeneity when measured

by the variance in propensities to move, while convexity would reflect

a decline in that variance, as only stayers remain in the long tenure

     Let us now define a heterogeneous population in consonance with

specific capital heterogeneity as a collection of. homogeneous subgroups

among which mobility rates differ at given levels of tenure, while

tenure curves S(T) decline in some or most of the subgroups. By the

preceding argument, any degree of heterogeneity will lend a downward

bias (steeper than average slope) to the observed group tenure curve.

We should note that heterogeneity biases can exist without any true

tenure effects, for reasons not involving specificity. But, if the

tenure effect ()    is   zero in each subgroup i, the observed population

experience profile S(X) will be horizontal, since its slope is an aver-

age of slopes in the subgroups. Conversely, if           <   0 in each or some

subgroups the observed experience profile must slope down. Thus, in the

absence of age effects, the age profile of mobility S(X) provides a clear

test of the presence or absence of tenure effects in the group, regard-

less of its degree of heterogeneity.
                                                16
    As an example, the popular "mover-stayer"        model which assumes

heterogeneity and neglects tenure effects must be rejected by the decline

in the age—mobility profile, insofar as the latter is not exclusively

due to pure age effects (i.< 0 in (1)).

    Although the decline in life—cycle mobility reflects the existence

and strength of tenure effects, it yields no information on the extent of

heterogeneity in the population. Assessment of heterogeneity is important,

however, both in its own right, as well as a basis for recognition and

correction of bias in the estimated tenure effects.
5. Empirical Mobility Functions

    An open-ended empirical procedure for estimating tenure effects in

the presence of heterogeneity is to enter a number of variables which

are likely to capture heterogeneous behavior in a regression of tenure

on mobility. The tenure slope estimate in the multiple regression is

reduced compared to its value when it is the only right-hand variable.

The reduction measures the extent of heterogeneity bias due to these

variables. This procedure was applied to the NLS data and the results

are shown in Table 4, including the list of heterogeneity factors. The

reduction in slope was about 20-30 percent for the young men, and larger

(relative to the flatter slope) for the older men.

    The heterogeneity factors in the regressions were, aside from

experience which was also included: education, health, hours of work,

family status variables, industry, and union membership. In terms of

contribution to    the last two factors were the most pronounced.

This procedure is clearly incomplete for our purposes here, although

of interest in the substantive studies of particular facthrs.

     A scheme that is more genera], in the sense that it does not require

an enumeration of heterogeneity factors derives from the definition: At

a given level of tenure members of a homogeneous group have equal prob-

abilities of moving during the next period regardless of their past

mobility, while in a heterogeneous group probabilities differ even at

fixed current tenure. Since frequency of past mobility is an indicator

of personal probability ("propensity to move") in the heterogeneous case,

its (partial) correlation with mobility in the next period, given tenure,

reveals the existence and estimates the degree of heterogeneity. And to

     Information   on prior mobility was available in the NLS data for young

men as the number of interfirm moves (NM) between 1966 and 1971. For t1

older men in NLS such information was not available, but we constructed

a variable (PM) on the number of (survey to survey) periods between 1965

and 1973 during which at least one move took place.1

     Table 5 presentsi in successive steps, regressions for young men

(Panel A) in which separations (job changes) in the period 1971-73 are

predicted by: years of work experience (X, X2) up to 1971, tenure (T, T2)

in 1971, and mobility prior to the current job (NM). The prior mobility

variable was also interacted with experience (XNN). The same regressions

(except that PM replaces NM) predict job changerates of NLS older men

in 1973—75 (Panel B), and of all MID men in 1975—76 (Panel C).

     Briefly, the findings are: Inclusion of tenure (line 2) shows it

to be the variable which is responsible for the gross age decline in

separations among young NLS men (line 1, Panel A). Looking at lines

1 and 2 of panel B, we find that the older NLS men show neither gross

nor net age (experience) effects. While net age effects are absent

withir the limited age ranges in the NLS data (young       29, old   50)

they are reduced (going from line 1 to 2 in panel C) but remain signif-

icant in the MID regressions which cover the whole age spectrum. The

absence of gross age effects (line 1, panel B) in the older cohort

reflects very small tenure effects (slopes) at this stage. This is

consistent with a strong convexity of tenure (and age) profiles over

the long run. The comparable tenure slopes are much steeper for the

young because they are dominated in regressions by early tenure levels.

Indeed, in a subsample of older men whose tenure does not exceed 8 years

(not shown here), the tenure slopes are quite as steep as those of young

men. Thus, the differences between the young and the old need not be

interpreted as a change in the mobility structure.

     The inclusion of prior mobility variables shows the existence of

heterogeneity in mobility behavior: The variable is a strong predictor

of mobility in the next period given experience and tenure at the

beginning of the period. Persons who moved more frequently prior to

the current job are more likely to leave the job earlier than others.

Prior mobility appears to be a stronger predictor at older than at

younger ages. This can be seen in the effect on R2 (i.e. in the partial

correlation), and in the regression slope. When converted into an

elasticity it is several times larger in the older group. Evidently,

repeated mobility at an advanced age represents persistent mobility

suggesting little stake in job tenure or lack of opportunity, while

repeated mobility at young ages does not have the same connotation.

We tried to test the proposition that prior mobility at older ages is

a better index of heterogeneity within each of the panels: The experience—

prior mobility interaction variable, shown in line 4 of each panel, was

positive and significant. Incidentally, the existence of this

interaction implies that age (experience) profiles of mobility are not

only higher but also flatter for movers (PM large) than for stayers

(PM small), as we theorized in section 3 (p.11).

     The introduction of the prior mobility variable was designed to

separate "movers" from "stayers". If effective, such "standardization"

should reduce the tenure slope in the regression. Tenure slopes are
indeed reduced in all three data panels in lines 3 and below.      The

reduction is small among the young and large among the old, as would be

expected since PM is a stronger indicator of persistent mobility at

older ages. The average reduction in the linear tenure term at mid-

experience levels (MID) is about one—third. That is, heterogeneity

biases the steepness of tenure-turnover profile upward by about 50 percent,

on average. As predicted,'inclusion of prior mobility which is an

attempt to, standardize for heterogeneity, reduces the tenure slope by

about a third (in the linear term) among the young and by close to two-
                                                                         -

thirds among the old. Incidentally, the education variable shown in

the last rows of Table 5 appears to predict some reductions in mobility
at given levels of initial mobility, but has no additional predictive

power among the old.


6. Net Age Effects in Mobily

    Although they do not appear in the NLS   regression   of Table 5, age

effects (coefficients of experience) on mobility are present in the

MID regressions in panel C and were seen in the decline of mobility rates

at fixed levels of tenure when the older cohort was compared to the younger

(Table 2). The economics of this downward shift in tenure curves may be

found in the more traditional aspects of labor mobility: Job change is

a response to higher wage levels beckoning elsewhere as well as a search

for specific investment opportunities.

    For a given wage gain, the supply response would diminish with working

age (at given levels of tenure) since the payoff period declines. Such

effects, however, would not become pronounced until late in the working

life, especially in view of positive and not negligible discounting.
Emphasis on finite life (working age) cannot produce a convex experience—

turnover profile, nor can it rationalize the fact that the observed net

age declines (!) occur relatively early in the working life. However,

the gain from mobility may decline over the life cycle not because of

the declining payoff period but because of rising costs: Costs of

geographic mobility are sizable and rise with family size and the presence
                               -
of school—age children.

       Age effects are, indeed, more important in migration than in local

job mobility. The decline in migration with age s(x) is steeper than

the decline in local job mobility: One-third of young compared to less

than   10 percent of older   job changers migrate. But the greater costs in

migration include also costs due to locational specificities which exist

in addition to job specificity, so stronger "pure aging" is not the only

reason for a sharper age decline in migration than in local job mobility:

Tenure effects which reflect both job and location specificities are

indeed, sharper for migrants.

       Another set of age factors, unrelated to location, may operate in

the early years of work experience: The range of quality of jobs and of

the job match cannot be ascertained by mere search, and some knowledge

must be acquired by actual experimentation. Also, job training and opport-

unities for investment in general human capital may present themselves

sequentially in different firms. Beyond the first decade of working life,

we may expect that human capital investors who eventually find a reasonably

compatible work place        develop a strong attachment to the job.


7.   Tenure   and Mobility Effects in the Wage Function

       Specific   capital investments imply tenure effects on wages which
cause the tenure effects in mobility. Wage heterogeneity due to differ-
                                    — 26       —




ential   specificities similarly produce some of the heterogeneity in

mobility. Consequently, we should observe tenure effects in addition

to general work experience effects in wage functions. Moreover, these

effects may be exaggerated in empirical estimates in view of interpersonal

diversity in specific investhient behavior.

       Information on job mobility can and should be built into the standard

earnings function. The inclusion of the tenure variable should capture

returns to specific (non-transferable) capital accumulation permitting

the   experience term to measure returns to general (transferable) capital
accumulation.    Information on prior mobility should also be useful in

correcting for heterogeneity bias. The explanatory power of the enriched

wage function ought to be enhanced.

      The coefficients of experience (X) in the standard wage function,

which includes only education in addition to the experience terms, reflect

a gross effect     which is a mixture of returns to general and specific

capital:


                           dw                      dT
                                =          .
                                                                              (2a)


      The standard wage function has an upward sloping and concave ex-

perience profile (the concavity is more pronounced when w =            log   wage)

in cross sections and in longitudinal data)8 Its slope has been derived

in human capital theory and in econometric studies. In view of (2a) it is

incorrect to interpret the coefficients of experience ! as measures of
                                                                dx
returns to general human capital stocks. Such returns are measured by

     that is by coefficients of experience, when tenure is included in

is of any importance. The experience coefficients in the earnings func-
tion which omits tenure is an upward biased measure of returns to gen—
era]. hiin capital accumulated on the job.
       It is interesting to note according to (2a), that even if no gen-
era]. capital were accumulated in the work career, wages would still rise
over the life—cycle and, as a group average, the wage profile would
tend to be concave so long as the tenure wage profile is concave.. and
dT
     does not increase over the life cycle.
      Wage functions with tenure variables w (XT) can be estimated in
hgeneous groups without bias (honegeneity defined as the same tenure
wage profile) ,but no such groups can be defined a priori: In the
presence of heterogeneity the tenure coefficient is likely to be exag-
gerated, as in the case of mobility, and corrections need to be de—
                                                 greater
vised. More precisely, the bias arises because A         specificity pro-
duces larger discrepancies between the marginal product in the firm
and the opportunity wage    -   V-     W    — W   +   W, where W is the spe-
cific return to the worker, and We to the employer, and           as well as
W differ among workers and firms •            affects the length of tenure.
It is plausible for W and We to be positively correlated, because a
fruitful match has to be recognized as such by both parties. There-
fore W is a. good index of t    and   the tenure-wage coefficient which
attempts to measure W5 is likely to be correlated with expected
tenure • 19 Heterogeneity in W5 is thus likely to produce an upward
bias in the estimates of tenure effects on wages, that is of returns
to specific worker invesents •        An   additional source of bias could
result from a positive correlation between general and specific
                               — 28 —




investments:   Here steeper tenure—wage curves would start at higher lev-

els.   To the extent that general returns to capital (Wa) are not fully
measured (standardized)   by regression variables, the bias will arise.

       Of course, positive tenure coefficients need not reflect wage growth

in the firm. Higher wage levels (not growing with tenure) for the same

labor in some firms create incentives to stay there longer. Although

transitional, this relation is likely to be widespread in a dynamic

economy as an equilbrating phenomenon. Such supply adjustments to

shifting demands are most likely to involve younger people whose mob-

ility is less costly especially in terms of specific capital losses.

Note, that in this case prior mobility is not a good index of wage

heterogeneity. Similar and more long—lasting effects can be created

by above equilibrium union wages and nepotism.

       Can information on prior mobility be used in the wage function as

an index of relevant heterogeneity, that is of individual differences in

W and consequently in the wage-tenure coefficient? The answer is less

clear in the wage equation than in the mobility equation. Positive

serial correlation in mobility makes the link between length of tenure

and mobility almost definitional whatever the urce of heterogeneity

in mobility. The problem for the wage equation is that bias in the tenure

coefficient is only in part due to heterogeneity in specific capital and

the latter is responsible for only a part of the heterogeneity in mob-

ility. Thus prior mobility may be a weak instrument for elimination

of heterogeneity bias. Its role in wage formation is nevertheless of

interest to our study.

                                                      and
    Table 6 presents wage functions of the younger ,' older NLS men, and      of
all men inMID. The independent variables are the same as in the mobility

functions in Table 5. The dependent variable is the logarithmic wage°

and row (1) is the "standard" wage function where the independent var-

iables are education and experience. In the next row the tenure terms

are added. In the third row we add the prior mobility variable and in

the last row we observe its interaction with experience.

     In the young men's panel the introduction of tenure reduces the

experience coefficient: At this stage (on average five years of exper-

ience), wages grow 6.6 percent per year of experience (1st row of Table

6); wages grow 4.3 percent as returns to general post-school human

capital accumulation (2nd row of Table 6) and 2.3 percent due to specific

capital accumulation. The tenure coefficients are large and significant.

Prior mobility is not related to current wages and does not affect the

tenure coefficits.     The coefficient of the interaction variable is

surprisingly positive but quite small, and its intr3duction raises the

tenure coefficient slightly. Apparently differences in early mobility

of young men are not indicative of future differences in specific capital

investments nor do they capture differences in wage levels which are

positively related to the length of current tenure.

     In the wage function for NLS   older   men the experience profile is a

plateau, but tenure slopes are positive (and concave) though much flatter

than for young men.21 Still, the observed tenure effect is biased up-

ward. Introduction of prior mobility cuts the linear term in half and

reduces its significance. We may conclude that repeated mobility at an

advanced stage of the life—cycle is an indicator of persistent turnover,,

denoting little investment in specific capital. The mobility variable

has a negative effect, showing that

            frequent     movers have lower wages than stayers,       given education,

 experience,   and current tenure •       This    is in contrast to the young whose
 past   mobility   did   not   imply a downward selection.      We may conclude   that
 intensive   early mobility—about a half of the first           decade   in our   NLS

 data—is    not   necessarily    an inverse    index   of longer—run tendencies to
 acquire   specific      capital or an index
                                        inability to acquire a good job
                                                 of

 match. It may even be a positive index of efficiency in wage ga.ins by
 moving aoss       fir
                    or of greater intensity of search for an optimal

career.
        Taken together the findings in both NLS panels         show that tenure effects
on wages are significant,        reflecting the firm—specific component of wage

progress on the job. This component accounts for about, one third of

wage growth per year in the early part of working life. At young ages,

past mobility does not clearly distinguish tendencies toward firm specific

human capital behavior. It does so, however, at older ages. At that

stage lesser specific investments also result in lower wages, apparently

as a result of slower growth over the past decades.22

     The wage function in the MID panel, which covers all working ages,

indicates that on average (and in mid—career) the firm specific component

accounts for 20-25 percent of wage growth per year (difference between the

X—coefficjents in lines 1 and 2, panel c). Prior mobility is negatively

related to wages. The interaction term is also negative suggesting that

men who continue to be frequent movers in the third decade of their

working lives have both lower wages and flatter experience profiles of

wages. The inclusion of prior mobility variables reduces the tenure

slope by close to 20 percent. Thus, heterogeneity biases the tenure—

wage slope coefficient upward by about 25 percent, half as much as it biased

the tenure-mobility slope (panel C of Table 5).

7. Tenure, Exuerience and Mobility: Additional Remarks
      We used. the generalized term "specific hian capital behavior" to
cover both the informational theory of job matching and the theory of
specific han capital invesent. The former is a necessary
condition for the latter, and both are required for cpleteness.
      There is another and popular view that the reality of tenure ef-
fects on mobility and on wages is largely institutional. The effects
we n1yzed are seen as "seniority rights" which include job security,
pension rights, vacations, and seniority based pay and prortion advan-
tages. But the distinction is superficial. The "rights" themselves
may well derive from htan capital specificities in the presence or
absence of formal, especially union, regulations. Indeed, recent re-
search shows that tenure turnover profiles decline and tenure wage
profiles grow as much and more U) in the non—union as in the union
sector.23                        -


      In the past, experience coefficients     were often crudely inter-
preted as on-the-job general investments. In the wage function which
includes tenure the experience coefficients     effectively segregate
returns to general hiznan capital investments, but they contain both
returns to on-the—job general investment and across jobs wage gains due
to mobility (but not to tenure). These across—jobs wage changes are
positive in purposive quits especially in migration, but are often
negative when job change results fr layoff, "exogenous" quit, and job
dissatisfaction •24

       Over the life—cycle the effects of mobility on wages become increas-

 ingly less favorable at least as measured by money wages. Quits, migration,

 and occupational upgrading predominate in mobility of the young, but they

 become relatively unimportant at older ages. Since the frequency of job

 change declines over the life cycle for reasons already spe'led out, the

 mobility component of wage growth          declines over the life cycle both

 as a result of declines in the size and in the frequency of wage gains

 across firms. This is another aspect of the well-known concavity of the

 experience profile of wages.

       Some models elevate the across—firm wage change to a single explan—

ation of the typical concave life—cycle wage profile: The worker is

envisaged as moving up a fixed wage offer distribution over his lifetime.

Successful on-the-job search results in off—the-job wage growth. With

a fixed wage offer distribution turnover declines with labor market

experience. Thus older workers have a higher wage and a smaller prob-

ability of future separation.25

       Although they produce concavity in the wage profiles, such models

are quite inadequate as major explanations of magnitudes of wage growth

over the life cycle ():
                        dx
                                In   a calculation based on the Coleman—

ssi data    Barte].   (1975) shows that no       more than 25 percent of personal.

wage growth can be attributed to across—fir wage changes during the
first 15 years of work experience, when mobility is most pronounced.
The modei.s, therefore,      neglect the bulk of the phenomenon       they   are try-
ing   to exol.ajn. Moreover, concavity in         the wage profile does not     re-

quire job mobility, in hin capital. theory, or in fact: Borj as (1975)
found the typically pronounced concavity i.n          wage   profiles of NLS workers
who spent all of their working        life in a   single firm.

                      - 'Although   crude,   our estimates   of tenure   and experi-
ence wage effects suggest that about              23 percent of life—cycle wage
growth,   which abstracts from economy-wide changes, is due to specific
capital    investment. Taken together, the         estimates   provide a convolete

though very rough decomposition of life-time wage growth: About                  25
percent of   it
              is due to interfi
                                                20—
                                          mobility, anotherA25 percent to fi
specific experience, and Over..           50 percent is due to general (trans-
ferable) experience.'

      Perhapsthe best way to s'mazize the Life—cycle relation between
mobility and wages is to recognize that initial (first decade ?) job
search    has two major purposes: to gain         experience, wages, and skills
by moving across fi, and to find, sooner or later, a suitable job 'in
                   and crow
which one can settleAf    a long time. The life-cycle decline in mobil-
ity is, in part, evidence of successful initial mobility, which is corrobo-
rated by corresponding life—cycle growth in wages.
       In both age grouns, stayers and successful
                                                             searchers grow   faster
than unsuccessful searchers or "non—investing" movers. However, a
                                                                    com-
parison of movers and stayers puts successful searchers in the category
of movers among the young, but in the category           of stayers   (they   moved
when younger)     among the old. As a result, comparisons of stayers and
 movers show that young movers do
                                  as well or better than stayers, but
tiltitnate stayers show
                           superior wage growth arid higher wage levels in the
later decades.

     71n his work, Jobanovic (1978) has shown that job matching pro-

cesses produce downward sloping tenure separation functions and up-

ward sloping tenure-wage functions. Investments of employers and

workers in their mutual association are a corollary. We use the language

of specific capital to cover the combined phenomena.


     8For a theoretical treatment of this distinction see Mortensen (1978)


     9We may note that even if returns to specific capital accumulation,

and in particular W did not decelerate with tenure, but grew in a linear

fashion, the resulting growth of acceptance wages would nevertheless

lead to decelerating declines in the probability of quit, given a

declining upper tail of the wage äffer distribution.

     10
       We must be careful, however, not to assert the converse: by

itself, inertia does not bring about specific investments.

in which we go from none to some tenure dependence. Let the mean tenure

in the group be T and the overall turnover rate s. Then after a passage

of a year the (l—s) stayers have increased tenure by one year, while

the s movers, without tenure dependence, lost, on average T years of

tenure. The net change        is therefore (1-s) - sT, which approaches

process become taure—dependent. In this case, the average thnure lost

by movers is       < T since proportionately more of them are drawn from

low tenure classes. Consequently the net gain in tenure           = (1 -   s) -

be inconsistent with a widening of differences in mobility rates.

       For those men whose current tenure started before the initial

year of reported prior mobility (1965 for the old NLS, 1966 for the young

NLS, and 1968 for MID), no information on PM is available (12% of young

NLS, 62% of the old NLS, and about 50% in MID). As a check on the results

in Table 5 which implicitly assigns values PM = 0 to those whose tenure

is too long, we used dummy variables on the complete samples, and we also

replicated the regressions of Table 5 on the subsamples which contained

information on prior mobility. The results were quite similar to those in

Table S with one interesting feature that was already mentioned: The

tenure coefficients for the old men in NLS (with short tenure in the sub-

sample) were as steep as for the young and the inclusion of PM reduc

the slope by a relatively small amount as it did for the young.

weaker predictive power.


    21This is true also in the sample with T < 8, in contrast to the

short-tenure mobility equation (see note 17).


    22Supporting evidence is shown in ti Bartel and Borjas paper in

this volume, as well as in previous research by Borjas.    Borjas (1975)
classified the older NLS men into movers and stayers. The latter were

defined by the fact that their current job was the longest ever. Educ-

ation and experience were only slightly different in the two groups.

The movers had lower wages (about 25 percent) and flatter experience

profiles.


    23Freeman (1978), Borjas (1978), and others. The flatter union

tenure slopes have been analyzed as effects of union policy. We

suggest that theyniay also reflect lesser heterogeneity in the union

compared to the non—union sector.

ation   of Burdett, which allows for on-the—job human capital   accumulation.

It is doubtful, however, that the assumption of a fixed wage offer

distribution can be maintained for workers whose skills are growing and

changing over the life-cycle.

                labor Mobility as a Stochastic Process




            In this part we treat labor mobility and wage growth
    over the life cycle as related stochastic processes.We first

    focus on th evolution of these processes for a given worker,
    and we interpret our formulation within the context of exis-

    ting theories of turnover and of wage growth and list some of
    the implications of these theories. Next we take up the

    question of unmeasured heterogeneity in the population,and the
    problem of sample selection over time,known as the 'mover -

    stayer"   problem. A remarkably simple result is proved in
    Theorem 3    which relates the behavior of a heterogeneous
    group to the behavior of the individual members of that
    group.In interpreting the result,we pay particular attention
/   to the on-the-job training hypothesis.Lastly,we describe an
    estimation method which may be applied to estime..te various
    parametrizations of the separations and wage equations.

         e purpose of this section is to draw some parallels betieen
wage rates and separation probabilities. Let w Ct, x, z) be the mathe-
matical expectation of the wage that worker z, with experience x + t,
and tenure t will receive. It may be noted that both w and s are mathe-
matical expectations conditional upon t, x, and z.
         Hereafter it is assumed that when a particular job episode
terminates, it is iediately followed by a new job episode. That is,
there are assumed to be no unemployment spells or spells of market non-
participation. Given this assumption, consider now the special case in
which /x       —
                   3F/x0
                           — 0.       Then each job episode is identically dis-
tributed. If, in addition, the job episodes are also assume to be
independently as well as identically distributed, then turnover becnes
a pure renewal process (see Feller (1966) Cli. II]. In what follows, we
study processes that are re general than the renewal process, and ucre
general than semi—Markov processes.
         Let a(x, z). be. the probability density that worker z will experi-
ence a job—separation at the point in time at which his market experi-
ence is equal to x. (For the special case where turnover is a renewal
process, a(x,z) is known as the renewal density.) A.lso let h(t)x, z)
be the probability density that a worker with market experience x will
have current job tenure equal to t. Note that for this statent to be

      There are several reasons for choosing this approach. First, the
deteninistic earnings—function approach (see, for exanple, Mincer
(1974)] is a special case of the above formulation. In the earnings func-
tion approach turnover is not considered explicitly so that job—tenure is
not included in the regressions. Such regression equations are here
interpreted as expectations conditional on x and on the measured compo-
nent of z, and the expression that characterize such conditional expec-
tations are provided in equations (8) and (U). A set of sufficient
conditions under which the conditional expectation of the wage is a
monotonicaUy increasing function of experience is provided below.
      Second, thà job—matching theory of turnover as developed in
Jovanovic (1978 )   is fully consistent            with the above         formulation when

the latter is restricted to s 'C—            w
                                             'C
                                                    0 for aU (x, t, z) so that the
turnover process is predicted by the theory to be one of pure renewal.
The key assumotions in generating such a result are a constant rate of
discount, and infinite horizon, and an assumption about the job—search
                              —6—



process that makes the latter "pure exterience search" in the terminology
of Nelson (1970). The model also implies w > 0 for all t, and       < 0

for large enough t and perhaps for all t.
      Two other search models that explicitly look at the implications
for life cycle mobility are those of Burdett (1973) and of Jovanovic
(l97$a). Both models involve the worker ving up a fixed wage—offer
distribution over their lifetime, with search of the "pure search" kind
(Nelson's terminology again). Both models imply that in the absence of
on-the—job training, s < 0 and w > 0 while s w — 0 for given x.
When firm—specific h"" capital investment is introduced (Jovanovic
(1978a) 3, the latter prediction changes to s < 0 and w > 0 for all
workers except the very old for whom s > 0 and w <   0   as they allow
their human capital to depreciate toward the end of their lifetime.
      General on—the—job training raises wages, implying w >   0   given
a monotonic increase in general training over time. Since general
training raises the worker1 a productivity in many firms, it is not ex-
pected to affect turnover, and therefore s - 0 is consistent with
     and with the presence of general training. A somewhat different
    > 0

argument asserts that the presence of general training is the cause of
 turnover at younger ages, because it may be optimal for the training
 to be acquired in several different firms and such turno'er is planned
 in advance. To the extent that such turnover is significant, (and
 little evidence is available to support its significance), it may pro-
 duce non—monotonic effects on s(t, x, z) for young workers as t and x
 increase.

so that H(o,       x, z) — 0    and H(x, x, ) — F(xfo,              z).      Then integrating

by parts in (7) and (8) one obtains

                                                    'C

Equations (10)      and     (11) should be cczipared for their identical structure.
        The following        results follow directly from equations (10)               and   (11),
and    are presented in Theorem 1:

             and   for     any x >   0,     a(x, z) > s(x,           x, z)     and

                                            y(x, z) < dx,            x, z)
                                              —8—



Proof: The assertions follow from the observation that

               H(t,   x, z) > 0       for any t >            0, and from H(o, o, z) — 0.


Next, consider the special case in which                       s   - 0, as wculd be true       if
turnover   was a pure renewal process •                   We   then have the folling
theorem:


Theorem 2: Let s Ct, x, z) be independent of                       x.   Then if s     c   0 for all
Cx, t, z) then a            <   0 for all     Cx, z).

Proof: Differentiating with respect to x in equation (10) and applying
the assmnption that     0, yields

                                                                           x
           ax Cx, z) — s Cx, x, z) (.
                                 t                   —    ?(x o, z)] —    f0   s   Ct, x, z)


                                H(t, x, z) dt

and since, by assumption,             s   <   0,   it   is   sufficient to prove that H         <   0

for all Ct, x, z). But since s does not depend on x, neither does F.
Therefore,     H(t, x, z) —          I    a(x      — y,   z) l — ?(yx      —
                                                                               y, z)] dy.
Therefore, H(t, x, z) < 0 if aCx — y, z) < 0 for all yc(0, x).
But then, a(x, z) < 0 for all x if there exists an c > 0 no matter
how n1l such that a(x, z) < 0 for xe(o, e). But such an c must
exist if a     Cx,    z)    is continuous      at zero, because by Theorem 1,
a(O,    z) —               o, z) +   °' o, z) < 0.
                                            (The last inecuality fol-
lows   by the assumptions of the theorem.) This completes the proof of
the theorem.

     Intuitively, one expects that Theorem 2 should extend to the case
where s < 0 and s < 0, that is, to the case where the separation pro—
pens ity declines with both tenure and market experience, and that the
 decline         in the separation propensity considered as a function of market
experience alone (a (x, z)], should, if anything, be reinforced. While
this conjecture may be tzie, an attet at proving it along the lines
of the proof of Theorem 2 fails, because      can not be signed.
         Theorem 2 asserts that the renewal density declines notcnically
if the inter—event waiting-time distribution possesses a znotonica.lly
decreasing hazard rate. Note that a parallel result for monotonically
increasing haza.rd rate distribution does not hold. That is,                              s>   0

everywhere does not imply that a                       >    0 for all x, and    an attempt at a
proof along the lines of the proof of Theorem 2 is                            quickly   seen to fail
(and a counterexaxnple is given in Br.m (1940)]
         It should be           noted      that y(x,       z)   is the wage—experience profile for
a   homogeneous group               of   type   z. By differentiating in equation (8),
conditions may be derived under which the wage exper ence profile will
be increasing and concave (y > 0, y                             < 0)   for each homogeneous group.
These conditions involve restrictions on both w(t, x, z) and on
s(t,    x, z). For example, one set of sufficient conditions for a
monotonically increasing wage—experience profile Cy >                            0)   is: 5    0,
    <   0,   w>        0,   w   > 0      and w >    0, as may be verified        by direct differ-
entiation        in (8) (and by applying the result of Theorem 2 which states
that         <    0   and    jointly imply a < 0 everywhere). Assuming, that
                                —   0

    —
        0,   is theoretically consistent with assuming that > a—the
accumulation of purely general on-the—job training raises the worker's

Productivity      in all firm by          an   equal aunt, and it raises                  his wage
(hence w > 0) but is not expected to have any effect on his separation
propensity    (hence s 0). Sufficient conditions for concavity of the
wage—experience profile may also be derived but turn out to be much more
complicated.
       Let T(x, a) be the mathematical expectation of current tenure.
The latter is distributed according to (4), and therefore,

                                                       x                               x

                                                                     z)dt —   x   —   /
                                                                                      0
                                                                                          H(t, a, z)dt



The second equality follows after integration by parts. Since H > 0,
T(x, a) can not exceed x. Differentiating with respect to x,



                                                           x
(13)        T (x, a) —
              x             1   —
                                    F(xlo, z) —        0I X
                                                          H Ct, x, z)dt


so that 1(0, a) —      1.       If turnover is a pure renewal process with                     s<0
everywhere,    then from Theorem 2, H>                 0, and         > 0 for all x, in other
words, the average current job tenure will always be increasing for a
cohort of workers as their market experience increases under these
assumptions.

       Let t1, t2, ...      be      the   sequence     of          job durations. Then

the distribution     function for          the    length of the th job episode is

tically    distributed random variables so long as the aging effect,                                 s

is not zero. If there is no aging effect, then each job—episode has
                                                  — 11   —




the    sa distribution, and if, in addition, one assumes that the job-
episode durations are independently distributed, then turnover is a
pure renewal process. Let n(x, z) be the nber of job changes (the
nmther of completed episodes or the number of "prior ves") on the
experience interval (0, x).                  Then

                      -

                                    0

To see this, note that a(x, z) Ax + 0 ((Ax) 23 is the probability that
exactly one job change will occur on the interval Cx,                            x +   Ax). The
expression in equation (25) is the s of these probabilities over such
disjoint intervals as At tends to zero. Dividing both sides of (14)
through by x, taking the limit as x tends to infinity and applying
L'Hopital's rule, one obtains


               x.
               urn        a(x, z) —              urn      E   n(x, z)


Of   course,      X       (E   n(x, z}] — a(x,            z), and
                                                                        a2
                                                                        ax
                                                                             [   n(x, z)]    a Cx, z).
                                                                                              X


Therefore, a notonica1ly decreasing experience profile of turnover im-
plies concavity of the expected number of ves treated as a function
of experience.

 bution. The latter statement is false.)
            The objective now is to characterize the distribution of z condj-.
 tional upon x and t. Let p (z x)              be the distribution of z which applies
 to workers who are just          starting     a new job at experience level x.
 Applying Bayes' Theorem,

                                      a(x, z) p(z)

                                            p(z)                   x—     0



p (z   x)    is a continuous function of x except at x               0.       (The   continuity
of p(z Ix)      at   x>   0 follows   if   a(x,   z) is continuous.)
            Now let (z x, t) be the probabiLity density that the worker is
of type z given job tenure t and experience x + t. At the time he
joined his current fi the worker was drawn from the popu.ttio
p(zlx). Applying Bayes' Theorem again,

                                   [1. —   F(tlx    ,   z)]p(zjx

Equation (16) follows          because 1. —   F(tx, z) is just the probability
that the worker of type z will, attain tenure t                in   a job which he started
at experience1ev x.
       Writing       '(tIx0,z) instead of (t,x0,z) (thereby emphasizing
the nature of the conditioning), let

 be the probability that the worker will experience a separation at tenure
 t given x0and t. We then have                          -

 proving this theorem, we elaborate on the meaning of its asser-
 tions.When t is increased by one unit while x0 is held constant,

 tenure and experience both increase by one unit. Therefore,
                                                             St
 is the sum of the tenure effect and of the
                                            pure age effect, and
 similarly for wt •                 In words, the first assertion of
the theorem may be expressed as                                               •the slope of
the average separation rate is equal to the average of the individual

slopes, minus the variance of the separation rates in the current popu-
lation (zJx, t).               This   result is     an extension of an earlier result
due to Barlow, Marshall and Proschan                 (1963).   Their result states that
mixtures of decreasing hazard—rate distributions                   also   possess decreasing
hazard rates.

            Suppose that there are no true age or tenure effects on
separations so that t(tIx0,z) = 0
                                  everywhere. Then,

st(t,x0)   =   — -(sIx0,t)     so that the group separation rate declines

although the individual separation rates are constant.Further-
more, (t,x0) would in this special case be convex in t (which
would be consistent with the evidence presented in Table 2) if

O(x0,t) declines monotonically with t. For a wide class of dist-
ributions p(zx0) one would expect such a monotonic decline be-
cause the selection out of the sample as t increases is such that
"movers" are (on avrrage) selected out leaving behind only the
"stayers" so that the sample of those left behind becomes increa-

singly more homogeneous.But               need not decline monotonically

as is demonstrated by the following example0Assume that at any x0,
p(zx0) is such that z takes on only two values, say I and 0,
and that the z = 1 workers have .a higher separation propensity
than do the z = 0 workers.Assuine that the initial ( t = 0 ) sample
is such that nine-tenths of the workers are z = 1 types and that
the remaining one-tenth are z = 0 types.Then the initial variance

of z is (1 —      .9).9   =   .09.   As tenure increases, the population pro-
portions shift towards the stayers, and the variance of z increases

steadily up to .25, at which point the population proportions are
equal.Thereafter, the variance declines monotonically to zero.Of
course,a monotonic decline would occur even in this example if

the initial proportions happened to be equal,or were weighted in
favor of stayers.
      Acoording to the first part of equation (18), the change in

the group separation rate is always an overstatement (in the nega-

tive direction) of the average of the individual chariges.However,

the same is not true of the group wage-change because the covariance

term in the second part of equation (18) may be either positive
                         — 18 —




or negative. The relevant question is whether a "mover"
(for whom (t,x) -   (tx0,z)       is negative) would expect to

receive higher or lower wages than a "stayer" at a certain te-
nure- level given that it was optimal for both to remain in the

firm up to that time. A theory which predicts that a worker
will separate from a job on which wages paid to him were low

relative to his prior expectations implies nothing about this

question.
      The implications of human capital theory for the sign

and magnitude of Cov(,Jx0,t) are ambiguous.In part I we empha-
sized the role of firm-specific human capital in generating a
wedge between the worker's productivity in his current firm
and his productivity elsewhere.Consider the polar case in which
the ratio of general to firm-specific training is fixed and
constant across workers,but that workers differ in the total
amount of training that they undertake.Suppose that z is an
index inversely related to the worker's propensity to invest in

on-the-job training.Under these assumptions, a higher propen-
sity to invest also implies a higher investment in specific
training, s,o that (tx0,z) > 0. Assume that z is not core-
lated with unmeasured ability components.Then, since invest-

ment in training involves foregone earnings early on in return

for higher earnings later,this implies that w(tIx,z) > 0 for
young workers (for whom x0 and t are small), and w(tlx0,z) < 0
for older workers0Therefore Cov(,x,t) is positive for
the young and negative for the old workers.

      Suppose instead, however, that the total amount of training

across individuals (with given x0 and t and other observable cha-
                           — 19 —

racteristics)   is cènstant while only the ratio of general to

specific training varies positively with z.Now, high-z workers
have higher separation propensities because their training is
general in nature rather than firm-specific.In view of the

well-known argument (see Becker (1975)) that general training is
financed by the workers, such workers earn lower wages initially,

and higher wages later on, than do "stayers" whose training is

more firm-specific in nature.(Again,this conclusion depends
on the assumption that the preference for the type of training
is not related to unmeasured ability differences).The implication
now is that Cov(,x0,t) is negative for the young, and
positive for the old workers.

        Neither polar case is expected to obtain in practice.Bo-th

the total amount and the composition of the training may be ex-

pected to vary systematically with z.But which doninates ? The

wage-function estimates reported in Table 6 strongly suggest
that the dominant variation is in the total amount of training.
In both parts of this table,this inference in made by comparing
the second line with the forth line in part A of Table 6,and the se-
cond line with the third in part B. The variables PM and NIM are indexe:

of past mobility and are corelated with (ttx,z).By definition,
z is the unmeasured component of heterogeneity,and the inclusion
of PM and NIM therefore has the effect of reducing the absolute

value of Cov(,sIx0,t).In both parts of Table 6 there appears
to be an effect of this reduction.The wage growth, measured as the
sum of the coefficients on X and T, increases for the young men

when NIM is included, and decreases for the older men when PM is

included in the regression, and these changes are consistent with

the first polar case,but not the second,as is clear from equation

(18).

An Estimation Procedure2
       The following estimation procedure exploits the property of
p(zx) (defined in (15)) of having two different functional forms,

implying, in turn, two    different          functional forms for '(t,x0) in

(17).We demonstrate below how identification of the parameters may
be secured by subdividing the sample of all workers into two subsamples:

one for which x0 = 0 (workers on their first job ever) ,and the other
for which x0>0. In fact,in the following illustration for an additive
fixed-effect parametrization àf s(t,x,z),the parameters are overiden-
tified,which suggests that identification may be secured for more
complex functional forms which we hope to consider in future work.

The following additive fixed-effect formulation is perhaps inade-
quate in captring the individual differences,but it is adequate as
an illustration of the estimation method.Let


(22)                s(t, x, z) —       z +   S(t,   x)



where, without loss of generality S(o, o)           0. One   possible     way to pro-

ceed is to take first differences in equation (22) and eliminate z,
thereby also eliminating the selection bias. There are two proble
with this approach. First, using differences in separation probabil-
ities as the dependent variable leads to coefficients that are not
                                         — 22   —




significant. Secondly, there is then no possibility of estimating
the variance of z • We have therefore chosen a different procedure,
which is based on deriving two separate relationships associatd with
equation (22).
         Let z Ct, x)    be   conditional expectation of z and s Ct, x)            the cor4—

ditional    expectation of the separation rate given t and x. Then,
taking conditional expectations in equation (22),

(23)                      s(t, x) — z(t,            x) + S(t,    x)


where

                          z(t,   x)         I z(zfx — t, t)dz
Then since
                                                                        t
                          F(tjx—t, z) —        1   —
                                                       exp {   zt —   f SCy,
                                                                      0
                                                                               x-t +   y) dy   }.

(Workers with x -        t are on their first job.)            Assume   now that p(z) is
the    normal   distribution. Then         a   straightforward calculation yields

                          z(x, x) —            — a2 x


where u and a2       are the   mean     and variance of z.

        The   separation propensity is of course      unobservable.    ALl that is
observed is whether or not an individual, has changed jobs within a par-
ticular period. Let y — 1 if the worker has changed jobs within the
period (x, x + x), and zero otherwise.

where u is a disturbance with zero mean. In the data Ax was equal to

two years.       The regressions for the separation equations are reported
in the first two columns of Table II —               1.(Separate      regressions were
also run for quits and for layoffs and they are reported in the table,

    although they do not have an interpretation within the mathematical

    structure presented above).The three linear coefficients and the
two constant terms provide five restrictions on the four parameters
    so that the parameters     are overidentified.However,             the relative mag-
nitude    of   the two constant terms is reverse from that implied by the

theory,   leading to an estimate of       which is negative, which may

mean that the additive fixed-effect formulation is inadequate.In future
work, we intend to experiment with different functional forms for the

separations and wage equations, focusing on the question concerning
the best way to model the individual differences, and to organize the

data so that the time interval, Lxx, is shortened to one year rather

than two.
