                                         ABSTRACT

Cloud computing—computing done on an off-site network of resources accessed through the
Internet—is revolutionizing how computing services are used. However, because cloud is so new
and it largely is an intermediate input to other industries, it is difficult to track in the U.S.
statistical system. Moreover, there is a paucity of systematic information on the prices of cloud
services. To begin filling this gap, this paper does three things. First, we define the different
segments of cloud computing and document its explosive expansion. Second, we develop new
hedonic prices indexes for cloud services based on quarterly data for compute, database, and
storage services offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) from 2009 to 2016. These indexes fall
rapidly over the sample period, with quickening (and double digit) rates of decline for all three
products starting at the beginning of 2014. Finally, we highlight the puzzle of why investment in
IT equipment in the NIPAs has been so weak while capital expenditures have exploded for IT
equipment associated with cloud infrastructure. We suggest that cloud service providers are
undertaking large amounts of own-account investment in IT equipment and that some of this
investment may not be captured in GDP.

1. Introduction

A transformation is underway that is revolutionizing the way computing services are

provided to businesses, households, and the government. This new way of accessing

computing services—typically referred to as “the cloud” or “cloud computing”—

represents the latest transition to a new computing platform—one in which computing is

done on a network of off-site computing resources accessed through the Internet.1 As

this paper shows, the changes are extraordinary and likely will have important

consequences for the structure of the economy, productivity growth, and economic

measurement. Yet, because the advent of these services is relatively recent, and because

they largely are intermediate business inputs rather than final demand, their imprint on

the economy is difficult to identify in official statistics.

         Byrne and Corrado (2017a) assessed the macroeconomic impact of the shift to

cloud computing and concluded that the productivity-enhancing impacts of the shift to

cloud computing were not yet particularly evident in macroeconomic data—even after

taking major steps to improve the measurement of ICT asset prices (Byrne and Corrado,

2017b) whose prices should be indicative of cloud services prices.2 This paper builds on

their work by developing measures to quantify the service prices and quantities and the

capital investment relevant for understanding the U.S. cloud services industry —the Ps,

Qs, and K’s of the title.




1
  The notion of technological change in computing as a platform shift was introduced by Bresnahan and
Greenstein (1999), who analyzed the disruptive effects of the introduction of PC/client-server platform on
the computer industry.
2
  Other first order macroeconomic impacts of the shift to cloud computing include (1) a weakening in the
demand for IT equipment for a given volume of ICT services, (2) a lowering of the cost of supplying a
given volume of ICT services (e.g., power consumption costs), and (3) an increase in the productivity of
software development.


                                                                                                             1
        Our basic finding is that prices for cloud services have fallen rapidly and that the

use of the cloud has grown tremendously as has investment in the related infrastructure of

IT equipment and software. For our analysis of prices, we assembled a unique data set

with quarterly data on prices and characteristics for cloud services offered by the largest

provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS), since the first quarter of 2009 when AWS

began posting prices on the Internet. The data cover AWS’ basic compute, database, and

storage products.3

        For AWS, the price for their compute product fell at an average rate of about 7

percent during 2000-2016. Price declines were slower before 2014 and more rapid

starting in the beginning of 2014. Interestingly, 2014 is the year when Microsoft and

Google began posting prices for their cloud offerings on the Internet. We suspect that

AWS’ large price declines were a response to that change in the competitive

environment. For AWS’ database product, prices fell at an average rate of more than 11

percent during 2009-16. Here too, prices fell relatively modestly until the beginning of

2014, after which they fell at an average rate of more that 22 percent through the end of

2016. AWS’ storage product followed a similar pattern, with prices falling at an average

annual rate of about 17 percent during 2009-2016 and even faster declines starting in

2014.

        We also use a variety of metrics to highlight the extremely rapid growth of the

cloud and of capital expenditures by large providers of cloud services. The extremely

rapid growth of these capital expenditures raises a puzzle. Why has investment in IT

equipment in the NIPAs been so weak if large and important firms are rapidly expanding


3
  We also collected data for Microsoft’s and Google’s basic compute, storage, and database services. We
intend to develop price indexes for those in future work.


                                                                                                          2
their capital expenditures for this equipment? In part, this tension could reflect, as noted

in Byrne and Corrado (2017a), higher utilization of this equipment at cloud providers

than at individual businesses that had deployed this equipment previously. That higher

utilization would imply less demand for IT equipment for a given demand for computing

services. But, there is another possibility: cloud providers appear to be designing and

assembling IT equipment on an own-account basis. We believe that this own-account

investment should be included in the figures for business investment in IT, and we

present some back-of-the-envelope numbers suggesting that this own-account investment

is large. Our calculation suggests that, if this own-account investment were included in

business IT investment, then the growth rate of nominal investment in IT equipment

during 2007-2015 would have averaged a little more than 2 percentage points higher, and

real GDP average annual growth would have been a touch higher as well.4

        The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines cloud computing and

provides nomenclature for describing different cloud service products. This section also

discusses the key technologies underlying cloud infrastructure. Section 3 describes our

new price indexes for cloud computing services, including the data, methodology, and

results. Section 4 uses several different metrics to demonstrate the exceptionally rapid

growth of cloud computing and the associated infrastructure. We also highlight the

puzzle described above concerning IT capital investment. Section 5 concludes.




4
  The level of nominal GDP in 2015 would have been $117 billion higher if our estimate of own-account
investment in IT equipment were included.


                                                                                                        3
2. What is cloud computing?

        Because cloud computing is so new and has not been studied extensively by

economists, we begin with some basic definitions and nomenclature. In particular, we

start with the definition developed by the National Institute of Standards (NIST) and

generally affirmed in the literature (e.g., Kushida, Murray, and Zysman 2011), then

discuss the range of cloud services available, and finally turn to a brief review of key

technologies underlying the development of cloud computing.

2.1 The NIST Definition of Cloud computing

        A definition of cloud computing was created by the National Institute of

Standards and Technology (NIST) in November 2009 and, after consultations with many

industry and government experts and stakeholders, published in final form in September

2011 (Mell and Grance, 2011). Their definition remains relevant and makes more

concrete and complete the brief definition given above. After noting that cloud

computing is an evolving paradigm, NIST states:

        Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand
        network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be
        rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort of service
        provider interaction.


NIST describes the following types of clouds:

    •   Private cloud (a cloud infrastructure provisioned for a single organization or
        specific community of organizations; it may exist on or off premises)5

    •   Public cloud (a cloud infrastructure provisioned for open use by the public; it
        exists on the premises of the cloud provider)

    •   Hybrid cloud (a combination of the above bound together by standardized or
        proprietary technology that enables data and application portability).
5
 The NIST “community cloud” deployment model is grouped with the “private cloud” model for ease of
exposition.


                                                                                                     4
Finally, NIST provides a concise description of the infrastructure that underlies the cloud

as:

          the collection of hardware and software that enables the five essential
          characteristics of cloud computing. The cloud infrastructure can be viewed
          as containing both a physical layer and an abstraction layer. The physical
          layer consists of the hardware resources that are necessary to support the
          cloud services being provided, and typically includes server, storage and
          network components. The abstraction layer consists of the software
          deployed across the physical layer, which manifests the essential cloud
          characteristics. Conceptually the abstraction layer sits above the physical
          layer. [Italics our own, Mell and Grance (2011, page 2.)]


2.3 Cloud products

The NIST cloud computing definition also includes a description of service models, or

service offerings. In measurement nomenclature, these services correspond to “product

types” or product classes. These product classes include:

      •    Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

      •    Platform as a service (PaaS)

      •    Software as a service (SaaS)

with each described more fully in the box. As discussed below and in the box, we would

add “Serverless” or Function as a Service (FaaS) to NIST’s list.




                                                                                          5
                          Definition of Cloud Service Products

 IaaS (infrastructure as a service)—provides computer processing, storage, networks, and other
 fundamental computing resources, where the consumer can deploy and run arbitrary software,
 including operating systems as well as applications. The consumer neither manages nor
 controls the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage,
 and deployed applications, and possibly some control of select networking components.

 PaaS (platform as a service)—provides ability to deploy consumer-created applications
 created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools. The consumer neither
 manages nor controls the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers,
 operating systems, or storage but has control over the deployed applications.

 Serverless also known as FaaS or Function as a Service—provides the capability of deploying
 functions (code) on a cloud infrastructure. The consumer (who would be a software
 developer) no longer manages nor controls the underlying cloud infrastructure including
 network, servers, operating systems, storage, or the computing program. An Application
 Program Interface (API) gateway controls all aspects of execution.

 SaaS (software as a service)—provides the capability of running providers’ applications on a
 cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through
 either a thin-client interface (e.g., web browser) or a program interface. The consumer neither
 manages nor controls the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers,
 operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, apart from limited
 user-specific application configuration settings.

This collection of product types often is referred to as the cloud “stack,” and the earlier

point about a layer of abstraction lying across the physical layer becomes important for

understanding the relationship among these products. As one moves up the stack from

IaaS to PaaS and so on, the level of abstraction increases, in the sense that the final user

can abstract from (or ignore) more and more of the underlying infrastructure. As

highlighted by the italicized sentences in the box, for IaaS, the user still needs to think

about operating systems, storage, and other computing resources. For PaaS, the final user



                                                                                                   6
needs to think only about the deployed application and can abstract from (or largely

ignore) other aspects of the infrastructure.

       Since the NIST definition was published, the industry has introduced a new layer

of abstraction, called “serverless” or Function as a Service. At this level of abstraction,

the final user only needs to think about functions or code that are to be performed and the

cloud services provider manages all other aspects of the infrastructure. Serverless can be

regarded as sitting above PaaS in the NIST stack (as in the box), although it may also be

regarded as a refined PaaS service.

       As a final point about nomenclature for cloud service products, we connect this

discussion to the state of computing pre-cloud by noting the role of traditional data

centers. By using a data center, the final user could abstract from the physical hosting

environment, a lower level of abstraction than in any of the cloud services described in

the box. The growth of cloud computing thus has its roots, at least in part, in the

competitive advantage the cloud offers customers in terms of cost, flexibility, and

scalability. At the same time, the growth and popularity of the technology also reflects

how the layers of abstraction in its products (especially the distinction between PaaS and

SaaS) serve distinct classes of customers. With abundant computing resources, value in

the stack moves up toward applications and platform, and the lower infrastructure layers

become commoditized (Kushida, Murray and Zysman, 2015).

       Recent developments in the cloud that facilitate the work of software developers

could be particularly significant and could, in time, have important macroeconomic

consequences. As cloud vendors adapt technologies that enable them to develop products

“higher up the stack” and offer services with greater abstractions, the work of software




                                                                                              7
development is simplified. Thus, although all classes of customers benefit from the move

to greater abstraction in the technologies deployed, the benefits enjoyed by software

product developers are especially significant (Cohen 2017). As a specific example, the

movement to serverless services with Amazon’s 2014 release of the Lambda computing

platform has enabled developers to focus only on code and its rapid deployment. This

has lowered costs of new software product development among providers of software

products for final sale (via SaaS or regular licensing) as well as for applications

developed for use within a developer’s own firm (or custom-developed for use within a

given firm).6

         Thus far, we have barely discussed Software as a Service (SaaS). In the usual

nomenclature SaaS products sit on the top of the stack. However, we believe that SaaS is

best understood as a category of software product services (albeit complex) rather than

cloud services per se. SaaS products are usually supplied with transactional metering—

that is, not as a collection of elastically provisioned services per the NIST definition.

Thus, SaaS products may thus be equally regarded as software products sold via an on-

line subscription business model—a business model whose use has grown in the digital

economy.7 8 Accordingly, the prices and quantities we study as cloud computing in the

remainder of this paper exclude SaaS products.



6
  Managed services featured at Amazon’s 2017 developers conference, for example, included tools for
business to leverage sophisticated deep-learning models and data without having to deal with complex
infrastructure issues (Murray 2017).

“The Digital Economy, New Business Models and Key Features.”
8
  As reported by Rackspace, a respected IaaS provider, “In recent years there has been a move by
traditional software vendors to market solutions as Cloud Computing which are generally accepted to not
fall within the definition of true Cloud Computing.” Rackspace goes on to describe SaaS as “software
delivered over the web,” which is precisely our point. Technically, some SaaS products satisfy the NIST
definition of cloud, e.g., the Salesforce Customer Relationship Management (CRM) product, but many


                                                                                                             8
2.3 Cloud technologies

        The cloud platform relies on a suite of technologies—mainly virtualization, grid

computing, and micro-services architectures—but also everything that makes high-speed

broadband possible. Arguably, IT history is at the point where the tagline Sun

Microsystems coined in the early 1990s, “The Network is the Computer,” is finally right.9

The network is no longer a mere bridge between autonomous nodes on independent

missions and prone to choke points (as in provision of transport). The continuous

increase in network capacity, along with a near disappearance of limitations that could

choke traffic in an earlier era (hardline security policies, storage performance issues, last-

mile WAN hindrances), are the foundation of this latest platform shift in computing.

        Behind a virtual machine host on a network of today, computing resources—

storage, memory, networking, and CPUs—are physically distributed and managed via

processing queues. Long before enterprises began moving onto the cloud, mainframes

and servers were virtualized, and an essential element of computing focused on the

function of processing queues. With cloud computing, some resource queue end-points

are moved offsite, and more than ever, computing resource acquisition and allocation

becomes the central task of cloud providers. One can be far more technical about the

transformation of computing as it has undergone virtualization and moved to a cloud

platform, but it is hard to be more prosaic than the old Sun tagline.

        Cloud vendors have made increasing use of virtualization and grid computing to

elastically supply information-processing services since the advent of the millennium,


others, including other CRM products, do not. See https://support.rackspace.com/white-
paper/understanding-the-cloud-computing-stack-saas-paas-iaas/ (accessed February 25, 2017).
9
  The Sun Microsystems tagline is attributed to John Gage (Reiss, 1996). The discussion in this paragraph
draws from Hubbard (2014).


                                                                                                        9
with the growth in capacity especially rapid since 2006 when Amazon Web Services

opened its doors. The virtualization technology that is the primary enabler of cloud

computing has been in commercial use since the 1970s via IBM mainframes. Modern

IBM mainframes (circa the System/390 introduced in 1990 and renamed zSeries in 2000)

are exceptionally adept at handling large, diverse and varying workloads and remain in

use today, though they have lost much force in the large datacenter market with the rise

in cloud computing (Byrne and Corrado, 2017b). Grid computing is applying the

resources of many computers in a network to a single problem at the same time; the

technology was first used in 1989 to link supercomputers and thereafter grew and

evolved along with the Internet (De Roure et al., 2003).

         “Containers” are another new cloud technology. Containers—a scalable form of

virtualization technology—allow users to run and deploy applications without launching

a new virtual machine for each application, increasing the speed of software application

development, deployment, and scalability. In terms of enterprise applications outside of

Silicon Valley, it is still early in the application of containers. Indeed, the technology

generally was not widely understood outside cloud vendors until the release of open

source LINUX formats (Docker 1.0) in March 2013. Docker transformed container

technology to a product for enterprise use. The consultancy IDC estimated that in 2014

only 1 percent of enterprise applications are running on containers that can readily be

scaled, but reportedly growth in Docker adoption has been very rapid since then.10

                                                                                                     10
        One final point of history connects this discussion to the earlier use of commercial

time-sharing services. These services were an important part of the computing

environment in its earliest days. There was a period of frantic growth (1955-1965), after

which the industry flourished for another 20 years due to a competitive advantage that

“arose from the nonlinear relationship between total operating costs and performance—

the larger the time-sharing system, the lower the per-user cost” (Campbell-Kelly and

Garcia-Swartz, 2008, page 27). Commercial time-sharing services underwent a complete

industrial boom-to-bust cycle, i.e., like typewriters and punched card machines, after the

advent of the PC.11



3. Prices of Cloud Computing Services

Outside of sporadic media reports and research by some private consultants relatively

little is known about the prices of cloud computing services. This paper develops new

price indexes for three basic products provided by one of the leading providers of cloud

services.

Data

        We collected prices on a quarterly basis from Amazon Web Services (AWS), the

earliest and largest provider. We collected prices from when AWS began posting prices

on the internet, with the earliest prices from 2009. To collect historical prices, we used

the Internet Archive (also known as the Wayback Machine) to pull posted prices from

web pages as they appeared in prior periods. We collected prices for a compute product


11
  According to Campbell-Kelly and Garcia-Swartz (2008), the market for time-sharing existed because it
was the only means at that time of providing a personal computing experience at a reasonable cost. They
also present econometric evidence showing that the growth of time-sharing services in its hey-day slowed
down the growth of mainframe computer shipments; see their online appendix.


                                                                                                      11
(renting virtual machines), a selection of database products that offer SQL as well as

other database software, and a range of disk storage products.

       Of course, the services for which we gathered prices are just a subset of the wide

array of services available, and they are at the lower end of the “stack” of cloud products

described above. In particular, we place the compute and storage products in the IaaS

category, and we place the database products in PaaS. That said, these compute,

database, and storage services are key foundational elements on which many of the

services that are higher in the stack are based. Accordingly, we believe that the compute,

database, and storage products considered in this paper provide a very useful and broadly

representative sample of available cloud services.

       AWS has been the market leader and has posted prices on the Internet since 2009.

Microsoft began posting prices in early 2014 and Google began posting prices in late

2014. We believe that AWS is broadly representative of the market, though future work

on prices of other providers is needed to confirm that.

       We note one important limitation of our data. We obtained data on prices and

product characteristics but not on quantities because cloud service providers do not make

product-level sales information readily available. We also were unable to obtain private

data on quantities.

Amazon Web Services (AWS)

       AWS offers an amazing array of products. One common feature across all

products is that customers choose among regions; that is, where the servers are located on

which they are running applications and storing data. Currently, AWS offers four regions

in the U.S., including Virginia, California, Oregon, and Ohio. (Amazon also offers many




                                                                                         12
regions outside the United States.) For this paper we collected prices for Virginia,

California, and Oregon. (The Ohio region was only introduced in October 2016.) For an

AWS customer, choosing a region that is geographically closer reduces latency, and some

customers will store data in multiple regions for redundancy. Prices differ across regions,

with prices in California generally higher than those in Virginia or Oregon. In general,

the differences in prices across regions are in levels, while changes in prices tend to be

very similar across regions.

       Compute Product (EC2 – Elastic Compute Cloud). Using this product amounts to

renting a virtual machine (PC or server) from AWS, and this product is priced in terms of

dollars per hour. In cloud computing nomenclature, the use of a virtual machine is

known as an “instance,” and AWS offers instances in a wide range of configurations.

During the span of our data from 2009 to 2016, AWS offered 55 different configurations

of virtual machines. Each configuration has specified characteristics in terms of the

power of the processor, the amount of RAM, and the amount of disk space allocated. In

addition, customers can choose between Linux and Windows operating systems. For

every available configuration, we collected prices as well as characteristics, and we have

a total of 4,079 observations for EC2 prices. The characteristics are important, and we

will use them to construct hedonic price indexes.

       AWS offers several different pricing schemes for instances. For EC2, we

collected data for only “on-demand” instances, which can be purchased at any time with

no commitment. AWS also offers “reserved” instances, for which a customer pays in

advance for a set volume of instances whether or not the instances are used. Prices of

reserved instances are lower than those of on-demand instances. In addition, AWS runs a




                                                                                             13
spot market for instances. Customers can bid for instances at a price of the customers’

choosing. The customer will receive the instances if they are available, but will not

receive them if some other customer offered to pay a higher price for available instances.

Prices of spot instances also tend be below those of on-demand instances. Finally, AWS

offers quantity discounts to heavier users.

       Tracking prices for all of these different types of instances was beyond the scope

of this paper. For the purpose of constructing price indexes, a key question is whether the

price trends for on-demand instances differ in systematic ways from those of other types

of instances. Our sense is that prices within these different pricing schemes tend to move

together, but that remains an open question. That said, we suspect that individual

customers experience price declines that are more rapid for a time than are the trends we

estimate. In particular, as customers gain experience with AWS and migrate more

applications to the cloud, we suspect that they increasingly shift toward reserved

instances and avail themselves of quantity discounts. This shift toward lower-priced

instances generates faster price declines during the shift than we estimate from tracking

prices of on-demand instances. Of course, once a customer has finished the shift toward

lower-priced instance types, the trend in prices experienced by that customer likely would

be in line with the price trends that we estimate.

       Our raw data for EC2 prices are plotted in figure 1. This figure plots AWS’

posted prices for each instance type for the full time it is in the market, with a different

colored line capturing each different instance type. In the figure, we show separate plots

for each region and operating system pair with each column of graphs covering a region

and each row covering an operating system. The graphs, plotted with a log scale, indicate




                                                                                               14
that prices tend to follow downward step functions, with longish periods of no price

change. It also is evident that AWS revamped its offering of instance types around the

beginning of 2014, dropping most extant instance types and introducing new ones. Of

course the graphs reflect no controls for characteristics or quality of the instances, and as

shown below, it turns out that this revamping was associated with a large drop in quality-

adjusted prices.

        Database Product (RDS – Relational Database Service). Using this product

amounts to renting database software along with a virtual machine (called an instance

class) to run the software. It is priced in terms of dollars per hour. AWS offers several

different database engines, including MySQL, SQL, SQL Standard, SQL Express, SQL

Web, SQL Enterprise, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Aurora, and MariaDB. Some of these are

open source while others are proprietary and require a license. For those requiring a

license, AWS offers instances for which customers use their own license as well as

instances for which AWS provides the license (for a higher price). AWS also offers

several different instance classes with differences in the CPU power of the virtual

machine, the amount of RAM, network performance, and whether the instance class is

optimized for input-output to storage. For every available configuration, we collected

prices as well as characteristics for on-demand instances. (AWS also offers reserved

instances for its database product.) In total, we have 5,340 observations on RDS prices.

        Our raw data for a selection of RDS prices are plotted in figure 2. This figure

plots AWS’ posted prices for each RDS instance type for the MySQL database software

for the Virginia, California, and Oregon regions. Because of the multiplicity of types of

database software, it is not feasible to plot all our data in a single figure. That said, the




                                                                                                15
data in this figure are broadly representative of those for other regions and database

software. The graphs are plotted with a log scale and show the same overall pattern as

the EC2 price plots. Prices tend to follow downward step functions, with longish periods

of no price change. As with EC2, AWS revamped its offerings around the beginning of

2014, dropping most extant instance types and introducing new ones.

         Storage Product (S3 – Simple Storage Solution). Using this product amounts to

renting hard disk space. It is priced in terms of $ per terabyte (TB) per month.12 The

pricing scheme for S3 builds in volume discounts directly with pricing tiers. For

example, customers pay one price for the first TB used, a lower price for the next 49 TB

used, a still lower price for the next 50 TB used, and so on.13 AWS also offers three

different types of storage: “standard” allows immediate access to stored data;

“infrequent” access is for longer-term storage and data can be retrieved only with a delay;

and “glacier” storage has an even longer delay for retrieval. As with other AWS

products, customers can choose among regions. We collected prices for all pricing tiers,

all three types of storage, and the Virginia, California, and Oregon regions. In total, we

have 445 observations on S3 prices.

         Our raw data for S3 prices are plotted in figure 3. This figure plots AWS’ posted

prices for each price tier for the full time it is in the market for each region and type of

storage pair. (Each different price tier is represented by a different colored line.) In the

figure, each column is for a region, and each row is for a different type of storage

(standard, infrequent, and glacier).


12
  A Terabyte of data is 1,014 Gigabytes. The prefix “tera” is from the Greek work for monster.
13
  The pricing tiers have changed over time. For example, early on prices dropped after the first TB of data,
while now pricing does not drop until after the first 50 TB of data. This change reflects the on-going
decline in the price of storage.


                                                                                                        16
Results

        The new quality-adjusted price indexes presented here for EC2 (compute) and

RDS (database) control for quality change are based on adjacent-quarter regressions. For

S3 (storage), quality does not change appreciably because the product is just a TB of

storage so we rely on matched-model indexes.

        To explain our rationale for using adjacent-quarter regressions, we first describe a

dummy-variable hedonic specification:14

        ln !!,! = ! +        ! !! !!,!,!    + !! !!,! + !!,!          (1)

where Pi,t is the price of a product in period t, Xk,i,t is the value of characteristic k for that

product in period t (measured in logs or levels, as appropriate), Di,t is a time dummy

variable (fixed effect) that equals 1 if the price i is observed in period t and zero

otherwise, and εi,t is an error term.

        A potential shortcoming of equation 1, highlighted by Pakes (2003) and Erickson

and Pakes (2011), is that the coefficients on the characteristic are constrained to remain

constant over the full sample period. Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel’s (forthcoming) study on

microprocessors used adjacent-year regression; here, we follow their setup but use

adjacent-quarter regressions.

          To make things precise, we describe our adjacent-quarter procedure for EC2; the

procedure for RDS is parallel. For EC2, we estimate the following regression for each

two-quarter overlapping period:

        ln !!,! = ! +         ! !! !!,!,!   + !!!! + !!,!                              (2)




14
  The language used here to describe adjacent-quarter regressions draws heavily from Byrne, Oliner, and
Sichel (forthcoming).


                                                                                                      17
where Pi,t is the price of EC2 instance of type i in quarter t and !!,!,! is kth characteristic

of instance i in quarter t. The dummy variable D2t equals 1 if the price observation is for

the second quarter of the two-quarter overlapping period and 0 otherwise.

         To construct a price index from these sequences of regressions, we spliced

together the percent changes implied by the estimated coefficients on the D2t variables.

All of the reported results are bias-adjusted to account for the transformation from log

prices to a non-log price index.15

         Because we do not have quantity data, the adjacent-quarter regressions are

unweighted so that each observation receives an equal weight in the regression. This

approach is an unfortunate limitation of not having quantity data.

         EC2. For the adjacent-quarter regressions for EC2, the following characteristics

entered as natural logs: ECU (AWS’ designation of the power of the processor), Mem

(the amount of memory in GB), and Storage (the amount of disk storage in GB).16 The

regressions also include the following fixed effects: storSSD (=1 if the disk storage is

solid state), pltfrm (=1 if the processor is 64 bit, =0 if the processor is 32 bit), System (=1

if the system is Linux, =0 for Windows), inO (=1 if the price is for the Oregon region),

and inC (=1 if the price is for the California region).

         Results of these regressions are summarized in Table 1. Because of the number

of adjacent-quarter regressions, the table summarizes the regression results, showing the




15
   Because the exponential function is nonlinear, the translation from the natural log of prices to price levels
requires an adjustment in order to be unbiased. We apply the standard adjustment based on the estimated
variance of the coefficient δ, as described in van Dalen and Bode (2004).
16
   In later periods, AWS began charging separately for disk storage for some instances. For these
observations, Storage is set equal to zero.


                                                                                                            18
minimum, maximum and median values of coefficient estimates across the regressions.17

In addition, of the 31 adjacent-quarter regressions, the table shows the fraction of the

estimates for each coefficient that are significant at the 5 and 10 percent significance

levels.

          The coefficient on the dummy variable capturing quality-adjusted price change,

D2, has a median value of zero, reflecting that prices are not changing in most quarters.

The coefficient for the variable for processor power, ECU generally is positive and highly

significant, as prices are higher for instances providing more processor power. The same

pattern holds for the memory variable, Mem. The variable for disk storage is almost

always significant though its sign often is negative. Among the fixed effects, solid-state

disk storage, StorSSD, has relatively little effect on prices, while instances running with

Linux, the System variable, are priced at a hefty discount to instances running with

Windows (for which AWS would be paying a license fee). The coefficient on the fixed

effect distinguishing between 32 and 64 bit processors (pltfrm) is quite variable across

regressions and significant in about a third of the regressions. Prices in the Oregon

region, captured by the inO variable, are little different from those in Virginia, while

prices in the California region, the inC variable typically are more than 10 percent higher

than prices in Virginia.

          Table 2 reports the price indexes generated by these regressions, as well as the

number of observations and adjusted-R2 for each adjacent-quarter regression.18 The


17
   As is evident in the table (as well as in our adjacent-quarter estimates for other cloud services), some
parameters exhibit considerable variation across the adjacent-quarter regressions. Running adjacent-year
regressions likely would damp this variation. We chose not to consider adjacent-year regressions for two
reasons. First, because prices of these services change infrequently and by large amounts and because new
products are introduced infrequently, we wanted to be able to isolate these periods of change. Second, our
quarterly frequency coincides with that in the National Accounts.
18
   The price trends for EC2 are similar to those reported by Zhang (2016).


                                                                                                        19
adjusted-R2s are quite high, indicating that the right-hand-side variables are capturing

most of the sources of variation in prices. The price index is shown in the first column

and percent changes at quarterly rates are reported in the second column. These figures

highlight that prices do not change in most quarters. Price declines are large in some

quarters, with the biggest drop in the first quarter of 2014, when AWS revamped its

offerings of EC2 instances. Although not evident in the plots of posted prices in figure 1,

the newly offered instances provided much higher quality at prices that were, on their

face, roughly comparable to the posted prices of the old offerings of instances.

Accordingly, the hedonic regressions identify a very large quality-adjusted price decline

in that period.

        All told, quality-adjusted prices for EC2 instances fall at an average annual rate of

about 7 percent over the full sample. Interestingly, prices fell at an annual average rate of

about 5 percent from the beginning of 2009 to the end of 2013. Then, in early 2014, just

as Microsoft had entered the market to sufficient degree that they were posting their

cloud prices on the Internet (and shortly before Google started doing the same), AWS

began cutting prices more rapidly. That started with the big price drop in early 2014, and

over the period from the start of 2014 to the end of 2016, EC2 prices fell at an average

annual rate of 10.5 percent.

        RDS. For the adjacent-quarter regressions for RDS, the following characteristics

entered as natural logs: Vcpu (AWS’ designation of the power of the processor) and

Memory (the amount of memory in GB). The regressions also include the variable

IOPerformance which is a qualitative variable indicating whether the network

performance is low, moderate, high, or very high. In addition, the regressions include the




                                                                                           20
following fixed effects: Provisioned IOPS optimized (=1 if instance is optimized for

input to and output from storage), inO (=1 if the price is for the Oregon region), inC (=1

if the price is for the California region), a set of fixed effects for each type of database

software offered (the omitted category is SQL standard).

        Results of these regressions are summarized in Table 3. As for the EC2 results,

the table summarizes the regression results, showing the minimum, maximum and

median values of coefficient estimates across the regressions. In addition, of the 25

adjacent-quarter regressions, the table shows the fraction of the estimates for each

coefficient that are significant at the 5 and 10 percent significance levels.

        The coefficient on the dummy variable capturing quality-adjusted price change,

D2, has a median value of zero, reflecting that prices are not changing in most quarters.

The coefficient for the variable for processor power, Vcpu generally is positive and

relatively significant, as prices are higher for instances providing more processor power.

The same pattern holds for the memory variable, Memory. The variable for

IOPerformance also is always positive and almost always significant. Among the fixed

effects, the variable Provisioned IOPS optimized (indicating optimization of storage

input/output) is always positive and significant. Just as for EC2, prices in the Oregon

region, captured by the inO variable, are little different from those in Virginia, while

prices in the California region, the inC variable typically are more than 10 percent higher

than prices in Virginia. Among the fixed effects for different database software, most are

priced at significant discounts relative to SQL standard. Oracle is the big exception; if

AWS provides the license, Oracle is priced significantly above SQL standard.




                                                                                               21
       Table 4 reports the price indexes generated by these regressions. The adjusted-

R2s are quite high, indicating again that the right-hand-side variables are capturing most

of the sources of variation in prices. The price index is shown in the first column and

percent changes at quarterly rates are reported in the second column. As for EC2, these

figures highlight that prices do not change in most quarters. Price declines are large in

some quarters, with the biggest drop at the beginning of 2014, when AWS revamped its

offerings.

       All told, quality-adjusted prices for RDS instances fall at an average annual rate

of more than 11 percent over the full sample. Over sub-periods, the pattern is that same

as that for EC2 prices. Prices fell at an annual average rate of about 3 percent from the

beginning of 2009 to the end of 2013. Then, in early 2014, just as Microsoft had entered

the market to sufficient degree that they were posting their cloud prices on the Internet,

AWS began cutting prices more rapidly. That started with the big price drop in early

2014, and over the period from the start of 2014 to the end of 2016, RDS prices fell at an

average annual rate of more than 22 percent.

       S3. As noted, quality does not change appreciably over time for S3, the AWS

storage product. Accordingly, we construct matched-model indexes by tracking price

changes over time for each price tier. Table 5 reports the resulting price indexes for each

price tier. As for EC2 and RDS, these figures indicate that prices do not change in most

quarters. Price declines are large in some quarters, with the biggest drop at the beginning

of 2014, as AWS appeared to be responding to a competitive threat from Microsoft (and

Google later in the year).




                                                                                             22
        The bottom three lines of the table provide summary figures that are an

unweighted average of price change across all of the price tiers. All told, prices for S3

storage fall at an average annual rate of more than 17 percent over the full sample. Over

sub-periods, the pattern is that same as that for EC2 prices. Prices fell at an annual

average rate of about 12 percent from the beginning of 2009 to the end of 2013. Then, in

early 2014, just as Microsoft had entered the market to sufficient degree that they were

posting their cloud prices on the Internet, AWS began cutting prices more rapidly. That

started with the big price drop in early 2014, and over the period from the start of 2014 to

the end of 2016, S3 prices fell at an average annual rate of about 25 percent.



4. How Big is the Cloud?

        Official revenue data for the cloud services industry and its main products

according to nomenclature used in this paper are not available. Nonetheless, a natural

starting point is BEA’s data on the closest intermediate use category in the input-output

account, 514 (Data Processing, Internet Publishing, and other Information Services).

This category includes data for NAICS industry 518200 (Data processing, hosting, and

related services), which subsumes much of the relevant core cloud services activity but

includes other information services as well.19 These data suggest the intensity of business

use of purchased cloud services has been rising steadily (figure 4a). Because this

category of spending is very coarse, it does not highlight the dynamism and explosive

growth of cloud services, however. For example, the latest Census revenue data for data

19
   The structure of NAPCS (North American Product Classification System), introduced in 2017, usefully
distinguishes between web site hosting, data storage services, and so forth, but does not distinguish
between services provided by traditional data centers and cloud vendors. See the industry description at
https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/index.html and the NAPCS structure at
https://www.census.gov/eos/www/napcs/ (accessed March 5, 2017).


                                                                                                      23
processing, hosting, and related services (NAICSs 518200) grew 8 and 10 percent in

2015 and 2016, respectively. While these rates of change are rapid relative to the overall

economy, according to Amazon’s company reports, AWS revenues grew 70 and 55

percent, respectively, in these calendar years.20

           Using a broader definition of the cloud, Cisco Systems estimates that since

emerging in the mid-2000s the cloud model has rapidly dominated the data center market.

Cloud data centers currently account for 90 percent of data center traffic and have

accounted for essentially all growth since 2010 (figure 5). Indeed, traffic at cloud data

centers rose at a 62 percent average annual rate between 2010 and 2016. This concept of

cloud data centers, however, also does not correspond directly to the purchased services

discussed in the previous paragraph for at least three reasons. First, it includes traffic

related to the massive core centers used for “free services”, e.g., Google’s centers for its

gmail service. Second, Cisco’s measure of cloud activity includes traffic at dedicated

centers designed but not owned by IT services companies (e.g., IBM Cloud Services).

Payments for these services likely are included in the NAICS 541512 (Computer and

network design services) industry. Revenues in this industry have grown especially

rapidly relative to GDP (figure 4b).

           Third, the Cisco measures reflect the rise of the “edge” cloud, which has a

restraining effect on both traffic and underlying business IT costs. A host of new

technologies—including the Internet of Things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality,

autonomous cars, drones and smart cities—has led to an explosion in the volume of data

that, given current bandwidth, can not feasibly be transmitted to and from the cloud for

processing in real time. Accordingly, this development has led business and governments

                                                                                             24
to locate the processing and storage of its massive data collections locally or near the

perimeter (that is, near the “edge”) of internet providers networks. Without going into

details (but see AT&T, 2017), edge computing streamlines the flow of data, transmitting

only higher-value data (for example., data from multiple IoT sources) to a shared central

cloud center for further processing and analytic use.

         Concurrently, capital expenditures at hyperscale cloud service providers have

surged in recent years, rising at an annual rate of 21 percent during 2010 to 2015.

Moreover, these expenditures now have reached roughly $50 billion per year, similar in

magnitude to capital expenditures at telecom service providers (figure 6).21

         Figure 7 shows the importance and rapid growth of the cloud from a different

perspective: the share of the world’s most powerful computers operated by IT service

firms leapt from under 10 percent in 2006 to more than 40 percent in 2009 and has

persisted at that level since.22

         And, tying back to the discussion of virtualization, IT consultancies commented

in 2008 that server virtualization had become the “killer app” for the business datacenter.

Subsequently, IDC estimated that the number of virtual machines (VM) per server in the

United States—an indicator of the application workload of an enterprise server—

advanced nearly 12 percent per year from 2007 to 2013 (Byrne and Corrado, 2017a).




21
   Cisco classifies a data center operator as hyperscale if they have revenue of $1B in Iaas/Paas, $2B in
SaaS, $4B from internet/search/social networking, or $8B from e-commerce/payment processing. Figure 6
includes the companies meeting this definition that provide cloud services.
22
   The IT services category is necessarily broader than cloud services because the descriptions of individual
supercomputing sites vary in specificity. That being said, some sites are identified as Microsoft Azure and
AWS.


                                                                                                          25
Where has all this Investment Gone?

        How well does this financial data align with official measures? Mapping

company reports to official industry statistics is challenging. Companies providing cloud

services provide a host of other IT services as well. Consequently, their establishments

undoubtedly are classified to a variety of industries, most notably the industries in

NAICS subsectors 511 (Publishing Industries, except Internet (includes Software)), 513

(Broadcasting and Telecommunications), and 519 (Other Information Services).

        In light of this wave of investment by cloud service providers, the continuing shift

away from IT equipment in business fixed investment in equipment and intangibles may

be seen as puzzling. Figure 8 plots NIPA nominal IT investment and the capital

expenditures figure for cloud service providers from figure 6. As shown, these two series

tracked fairly closely from the mid 1990s through about 2009 as IT investment tailed off

as a share of GDP. But, after 2009, these series diverged sharply as capital expenditures

surged while the series for NIPA IT investment remained sluggish. One possible

explanation is the higher utilization that follows as firms outsource IT functions to the

cloud. Such an increase in utilization could translate into weaker investment in the short

run. Indeed, IDC Inc. reports that the nominal value of sales of servers to U.S. firms fell

at an annual average rate of 11 percent from 2004 to 2016 and the decline accelerated

since 2008.

        That being said, we also consider another possibility: that cloud services firms

have been building their own IT equipment, at least in part.23 If so, then a portion of the

capital expenditures reported above may be for components that have gone into IT

  A parallel presentation of own-account investment by cloud service providers appears in Byrne, Corrado,
and Sichel (2017).

equipment built on an own-account basis rather than for already assembled IT equipment.

Google, for example, is reported to have built both computing and network equipment

from purchased components.24 Consistent with this possibility, the “use tables”

published by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis indicate that the output of the

Computer and Electronics Manufacturing sector (NAICS 334) used by IT services sectors

is substantial—$58.6 billion in 2015.25 At the same time, the “make tables” indicate that

these electronic intermediates are not made into final electronics sold by the IT services

sector. This suggests that these components are used for own-account production of IT

equipment used within the firms.

         If this story is correct, this own-account investment should be (but we believe

likely is not) counted in the NIPAs as business investment in IT equipment, albeit own-

account investment. How much might this own-account investment add up to? For the

sake of argument, we assume that the omitted investment value of the own-account

production of final electronics is equal to the value of the electronic intermediates used.26

With this valuation, the story for business investment in IT equipment changes markedly.

As seen in figure 9, nominal IT equipment and software investment including our

estimate of own-account would be $58 billion higher in 2015 than in the official

estimates, amounting to 0.32 percent of GDP. For nominal investment in IT equipment,

adding this own-account investment would boost the average annual growth rate during

2007-2015 by roughly 2 percentage points compared with official estimates. For nominal

   We treat BEA categories 511, 512, 514 and 5415 as IT services. This group includes industry 518210
mentioned above (in category 514) as well as software publishing, telecom services, and computer design
services.

   We believe this assumption is conservative; although the details of data center server inputs are not
available, Gartner, Inc. reports that the market value of personal computers is roughly four times the value
of electronic inputs.

GDP growth, including this own-account investment would add three basis points per

year to the growth rate during this period.



5. Conclusion

       We find that cloud computing has exploded. By available measures, the quantity

of cloud activity has grown extremely rapidly as has associated capital investment. At

the same time, prices of basic cloud services have fallen rapidly since 2009, based on a

unique dataset we assembled. However, because cloud is so new and so much of it is

intermediate input, it is challenging to track in the statistical system, and the available

data do not distinguish between cloud-based and traditional services, whether services are

purchased or produced internally, or generated at the “edge.” We highlight one area

where real GDP may be understated by a noticeable amount as a result of changes in the

economy related to the rise of cloud computing.

Note: Based on adjacent-quarter hedonic regression as described in the text. All estimates are bias
adjusted to account for the translation from log price to a price index. The last two columns show the
number of observations and adjusted R2s from the adjacent-quarter regressions. No observations are
available for 2015:Q4; we assumed no price change in that quarter.
