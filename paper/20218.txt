Seasonal Credit Constraints and Agricultural Labor Supply: Evidence from Zambia

                                             ABSTRACT

Small-scale farming remains the primary source of income for a majority of the population in developing
countries. While most farmers primarily work on their own fields, off-farm labor is common among
small-scale farmers. A growing literature suggests that off-farm labor is not the result of optimal labor
allocation, but is instead driven by households’ inability to cover short-term consumption needs with
savings or credit. We conduct a field experiment in rural Zambia to investigate the relationship between
credit availability and rural labor supply. We find that providing households with access to credit during
the growing season substantially alters the allocation of household labor, with households in villages
randomly selected for a loan program selling on average 25 percent less off-farm labor. We also find
that increased credit availability is associated with higher consumption and increases in local farming
wages. Our results suggest that a substantial fraction of rural labor supply is driven by short-term
constraints, and that access to credit markets may improve the efficiency of labor allocation overall.

1     Introduction
In Zambia, like in much of Sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture employs the vast majority of the
rural population, with generally low levels of productivity and farming income.1 A lack of
irrigation infrastructure combined with a long dry season mean that harvest income arrives
only once per year, and must cover household needs for the subsequent 10-12 months. If
available resources are insuﬃcient to cover consumption needs, households can either finance
consumption gaps through credit or engage in alternative consumption smoothing strategies
including oﬀ-farm labor.2 From a household production perspective, selling family labor
oﬀ-farm can be optimal as long as the marginal product of labor oﬀ-farm is higher than the
marginal product of labor on the farm. However, a growing literature suggests that oﬀ-farm
labor reflects a coping strategy rather than income maximization (Kerr 2005; Bryceson 2006;
Orr et al. 2009; Michaelowa et al. 2010; Cole and Hoon 2013). The logic of the underlying
argument is simple: since most small scale farmers have limited ownership of liquid assets
and virtually no access to short-term credit, the least costly (or only possible) way to finance
short-term consumption may be to generate wage income from local labor markets.
   Conceptually, frictions in the credit market may thus lead to two ineﬃciencies in the
farm’s production schedule. First, the farm may alter the the total quantity of land used and
crop mix chosen to ensure that the available family labor, net of anticipated work required
oﬀ-farm, is suﬃcient to maximize yields. In most settings, the production plan chosen in
the constrained environment will not be the same as the optimal choice in an unconstrained
environment (Fafchamps 1993; Rosenzweig and Binswanger 1993), which may lower the
farm’s net income. Second, these extensive margin or ex ante ineﬃciencies can be further
compounded by intensive margin ineﬃciencies if households experience unanticipated income
or expenditure shocks during the farming season. To cover short-term consumption and
liquidity needs, farming households may deviate from their original (adjusted) production
plan by reallocating labor to earn oﬀ-farm wages (Kochar 1995, 1999; Rose 2001; Ito and
Kurosaki 2009).3
   1
     A recent study in the region of proposed research shows average gross production value of USD 500 for
a family of six (Fink and Masiye 2012). Once capital input, land and labor costs are considered, net profits
for many of these families may be negative.
   2
     Most rural households own some assets such as livestock, agricultural livestock or cooking ware which
they could theoretically liquidate; in practice, finding a buyer for such assets during the most constrained
periods may be diﬃcult, and the transaction cost of liquidating assets may be prohibitive.
   3
     Common income shocks in the area are the loss of stored food reserves due to pests or theft; expenditure
shocks include funerals, school uniforms and medical costs.



                                                     2
       To investigate the relationship between credit availability and agricultural labor supply,
we conducted a cluster-randomized experiment with small-scale farmers from selected villages
in rural Zambia. As shown by the descriptive plots in in Figures 1 and 2 food shortages and
oﬀ-farm labor (locally referred to as ganyu) are common in the study area, with pronounced
seasonal patterns.4 Zambia’s agricultural cycle is centered around the rainy season from
November to April. Harvest takes place in May and June, and generates income that must
cover all consumption and investment needs until the following year’s harvest. Household
reserves are diminished by the beginning of the rainy season (six months after harvest), and
are most scarce from January to March before early crops become available for consumption.
The January to March period is generally referred to as the “hungry season” by farmers, and
is the period we directly targeted with the intervention. The intervention oﬀered selected
small-scale farming households access to interest-free maize loans to be repaid in kind after
harvest, approximately 3 months after the last loan installment was received. The maximum
loan size was 3 bags of ground maize, a quantity large enough to cover the consumption needs
of an average household over a three-month period.5 Treatment intensity was varied at the
village level, with a smaller fraction of households receiving loans in partial (as opposed to
full) treatment villages.
    Both the demand for and the willingness to repay loans was high, with over 90 percent
take up among eligible households and close to 95 percent repayment. To assess the impact of
loans on local labor markets and labor allocation decisions, we develop a series of predictions
through a simple agricultural labor market model, and test them empirically using our
experimental data. Consistent with the model, we find relatively large eﬀects of the loans
on oﬀ-farm labor supply. In villages where all farmers were eligible for the maize loan,
the probability that a household reported oﬀ-farm labor over a two week period during the
hungry season fell by around 25 percent (11.8 percentage points). In the same villages, the
total number of days of ganyu reported fell by around one-third, with a corresponding (but
statistically imprecise) increase in the number of days worked on-farm. We also test whether
the reduction in oﬀ-farm labor during the hungry season is oﬀset by an increase in oﬀ-farm
   4
     Seasonality in food consumption may reflect an optimal response to seasonal price variation. As shown
in Appendix figure A.1, seasonal fluctuations in maize prices are less pronounced in Zambia than in other
nearby countries (see, for example, Burke (2014)).
   5
     Households could receive up to 75 kilograms (in 25 kg bags) of ground “breakfast meal” maize, which
they had to repay with 150 kilograms harvested (ungrounded) maize. A 50 kilogram bag of unground maize
yields approximately 25 kilograms of ground maize; the market value of the ground maize received and the
harvested maize paid back is very similar. Households in the program therefore receive a transfer equal to
the value of the interest on the loan. In Section 3, we calibrate the size of the transfer.



                                                    3
labor to generate resources to repay the loan. In the two months preceding loan repayment,
reported oﬀ-farm casual labor was significantly lower in treated villages, and the overall
probability of doing any casual labor at any point during the entire agricultural season was
9.1 percentage points lower in the fully treated villages than in the control villages.
   Consistent with the observed reductions in farmers’ willingness (or need) to engage in
oﬀ-farm labor, we find sizable increases in average wages paid locally for oﬀ-farm labor. In
fully treated villages, the average wage reported among (the smaller number of) workers
engaging in ganyu increased by almost 50 percent immediately following the loan transfers
and by 25 to 35 percent over the treatment period. The wage eﬀects were smaller but
remain positive in partial treatment villages, where only 50 percent of farmers were eligible
for the loan program. We also find substantial declines in reported hunger in treated villages.
Specifically, the intention-to-treat (ITT) estimates show that in villages where all households
were eligible for the loan, the number of meals consumed by the respondent in the 24 hours
preceding the survey increased by 11 percent (0.2 more meals) and household members were
almost 50 percent (16.5 percentage points) less likely to miss meals due to food shortages in
the week before the survey.
   For both the consumption and the labor allocation results, the observed eﬀect sizes
are smaller in partial treatment villages, with relatively large - but imprecisely estimated -
spillovers for households whose neighbors receive loans. All of the data collected suggests
that these spillovers are not the result of within community sharing or redistribution of
resources: we observe no eﬀect of treatment on reported gifts, loans or transfers among
eligible or ineligible households. Given the large wage response, some positive spillovers
through the labor market seem likely, since higher local wages allow ineligible households
to meet their consumption needs with fewer hours of oﬀ-farm labor. The relatively small
sample size of the study does not allow us to precisely pin down the magnitude of the labor
supply elasticity. Larger studies in this area would help to isolate the channels underlying
the observed spillover and general equilibrium eﬀects.
    The results presented in this paper are linked to a large literature in development eco-
nomics documenting the often complex and seasonal nature of rural labor supply (for a
review, see Rosenzweig 1988). A number of previous studies have investigated households’
use of oﬀ-farm labor to smooth consumption in response to, or anticipation of, productivity
shocks (Kochar 1995, 1999; Rose 2001; Ito and Kurosaki 2009), suggesting that productivity
shocks may alter labor supply and aﬀect rural wages. Consistent with the findings in this
paper, Jayachandran (2006) shows that incomplete credit markets lower the elasticity of


                                               4
labor supply, further increasing wage volatility. Mobarak and Rosenzweig (2014) show that
wage volatility is reduced and sizable welfare improvements are possible when workers can
be insured against aggregate shocks. More recently, a growing number of field experiments
examine labor supply determinants in developing country settings, some of which shed light
on questions of seasonality and consumption constraints. For example, Goldberg (2013) finds
very low labor supply elasticities following the harvest period in Malawi. Also in Malawi,
Guiteras and Jack (2014) examine labor supply during the hungry season and after harvest
and note the seasonal coincidence of high labor demand and liquidity constraints.6
   The results in this paper are also linked to a larger literature on consumption smooth-
ing. In the face of missing credit markets, households may resort to a range of consumption
smoothing strategies, ranging from livestock and asset sales to migration (for summaries
of the literature, see Morduch (1995) and Besley (1995)). The substantial increase in con-
sumption that we observe among treated households during the hungry season suggests that
farming households in the study adjust to resource scarcity not only through oﬀ-farm la-
bor, but also by reducing consumption during the growing season, where caloric needs are
likely highest. These reductions in calorie intake during the peak labor season are also con-
sistent with a related nutrition-focused literature which suggests that farmers’ constrained
nutritional intake leads to suboptimal production (Pitt and Rosenzweig 1986; Strauss 1986;
Behrman et al. 1997), an idea also supported by recent evidence from India (Schofield 2013).
   The general relationship between income seasonality and consumption smoothing is not
well established in the literature. While some studies suggest that precautionary savings are
suﬃcient to smooth consumption even if income is highly seasonal (Paxson 1993; Chaudhuri
and Paxson 2002), others have highlighted the pronounced consumption diﬀerences between
lean or hungry season (Dercon and Krishnan 2000; Khandker 2012), consistent with the
patterns shown in Figure 2.
    Few studies have examined the impact of explicitly seasonal transfer or loan programs.
Burke (2014) oﬀered farmers in Kenya a loan product that allowed them to exploit seasonal
variation in maize prices and finds significant eﬀects on total maize revenues and household
expenditures. Bryan, Chowdhury and Mobarak (2013) provide credit and grants for short
run seasonal labor migration in Bangladesh and argue that credit market failures and highly
uncertain returns likely keep long-distance labor supply below welfare-maximizing levels.
   6
     Ineﬃcient labor supply does not, however, imply credit or liquidity constraints. In a nonagricultural
setting, Dupas and Robinson (2014) rule out consumption constraints as a driver of decisions in their study
of reference dependent labor supply among bicycle taxis in Kenya.



                                                    5
Most similar to our study, Basu and Wong (2012) study a seasonal food credit program
in Indonesia and find that food loans increase consumption during the lean season, but do
not analyze labor supply impacts. Our findings contribute to that literature by providing
the first direct evidence that seasonal food shortages drive oﬀ-farm labor supply and local
wages. We also show that relaxing credit constraints leads to an adjustment of household
labor supply and an equilibrium increase in local wages. Both the labor supply and the wage
results are the product of multiple diﬀerent margins adjusting as credit markets are relaxed,
including better nutrition, a lower number of credit-constrained households and diﬀerential
selection into the oﬀ-farm labor market. In terms of final labor allocation, the relaxation
of credit constraints reallocated labor from relatively better-oﬀ farms able to hire ganyu to
smaller farms generally dependent on doing ganyu as a coping mechanism.
   The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we present a simple model of agri-
cultural labor decisions in the presence of credit constraints. Section 3 describes the study
context, experimental design and implementation. Section 4 sets up the identification strat-
egy. Section 5 presents the results, and Section 6 concludes.


2    Conceptual framework
Consider a simple two-period model of agricultural production, where rational farming house-
holds maximize their utility over consumption and leisure. In the first period (the growing
season), households make their labor and consumption decision. In the second period (the
harvesting season), households collect the harvest outcomes and get utility from consuming
the harvest outcomes. Land endowments are fixed. There are two types of farms: those
with relatively large capital endowments that are net buyers of labor, and small-scale farms,
which divide their labor between their own farm and oﬀ-farm work at a locally determined
wage rate w. For ease of exposition, we refer to the former as large and the latter small,
though land size need not diﬀer between the farm types. Large farms, indexed by b, choose
their labor inputs optimally to maximize profits such that

                                           �
                                         Yb (lb∗ ) = w                                    (1)
        �                                                             �              ��
where Yb (l) is the marginal product of labor on the large farm, with Y (l) > 0 and Y (l) < 0,
and w is the local wage rate. Small-scale farmers have their own land, and maximize their
utility u(.), which is an increasing and concave function of consumption c and leisure time


                                               6
f. We assume that small farmers have a fixed time endowment T , which they can allocate
to selling labor oﬀ-farm to the large farms (lo ), to work on their own farm (ls ), or for leisure
f , so that the time budget constraint is given by

                                          lo + ls + f ≤ T.                                    (2)

In the first period, crops are not available yet, so that the farm’s consumption constraint is
given by

                                            c1 ≤ l o w + k                                    (3)

where lo w is oﬀ-farm labor income of households and k ≥ 0 are savings or other reserves
that the farm can consume. Small farms maximize their total utility over the two periods,
which is given by

                                       u(c1 , f1 ) + ρu(c2 , f2 ),                            (4)

where 0 < ρ ≤ 1 is the discount rate applied to second period utility.


Unconstrained Equilibrium
In the absence of credit constraints, small farmers choose their on-farm labor inputs such
that the marginal product of on-farm inputs equals the market wage

                                              �
                                            Ys (ls∗ ) = rw,                                   (5)
        �
where Ys is the marginal product (harvest) generated by the labor input, and r is the market
interest rate paid on capital (k). Given that utility is strictly increasing in consumption, the
optimal amount of labor provided oﬀ-farm is lo∗ = L − ls∗ − f ∗ .
    The equilibrium wage w∗ will simply be determined by the intersection of the aggregate
labor demand and supply function, i.e. w∗ is such that
                                   ˆ                     ˆ
                                       lo∗ (w∗ )db   =       ls∗ (w∗ )ds,                     (6)

where the left-hand side of equation (6) integrates over all large farms b and the right hand
side integrates over all small farms s.



                                                     7
Constrained Equilibrium
Let us define a farm as credit constrained if the farm is not able to cover optimal consumption
in the unconstrained equilibrium with the first-best (unconstrained) labor allocation choice,
i.e.

                                          c∗ > lo∗ w + k                                       (7)

Then, we can state the following propositions:

Proposition 1 a: The total amount of oﬀ-farm labor provided in equilibrium increases with
the fraction of small farms that are credit constrained.
Proposition 1 b: Average consumption levels decrease with the fraction of small farms that
are credit constrained.
Proposition 1 c: The wages observed in equilibrium decline with the fraction of small farms
that are credit constrained.

   The intuition behind the propositions is straightforward. In the absence of financing
through savings or borrowing, consumption in the lean season can only be financed through
an increase in ganyu labor supply (lo > lo∗ ). This increase in ganyu (beyond the optimal
point) mechanically leads to a decrease in leisure and/or a decrease in consumption, because
the total resources available are lower than in the unconstrained equilibrium. This implies
a shift in the supply curve to the right; given that the demand curve will stay the same, a
higher fraction of credit constrained farmers will lower equilibrium wages and increase the
total amount of ganyu labor hired.
    The stylized model has several implications in terms of increases in credit availability.
First, for any credit constrained farmer, as k increases, lo falls as long as the interest rate on
borrowing is suﬃciently low, which means that farmers will shift their labor allocation from
oﬀ-farm to on-farm labor. Second, increasing credit availability will increase consumption.
As farmers get closer to their optimal on-farm labor allocation ls∗ , they will be able to increase
the net present value of available resources, and thus to increase consumption (and leisure)
in both periods. Last, according to Proposition 1c, an increase in credit availability will
increase wages.
    This stylized model clearly abstracts from a variety of other relevant mechanisms, includ-
ing the eﬀect of relaxing consumption constraints on labor productivity (Strauss 1986; Pitt


                                                8
et al. 1990; Subramanian and Deaton 1996; Strauss and Thomas 1998). These additional
margins would add complexity without substantially aﬀecting the predictions outlined above,
which we explore in our empirical analysis. Our model derives equilibrium predictions at
the market level, which, in a friction-free labor market, should be observable at the regional
or national level. In the local study context, however, mobility is severely limited by poor
road infrastructure and a lack of transportation options. As we will show in the empirical
analysis below, most ganyu labor is provided locally; accordingly, we consider each village
as a separate labor market.


3       Context and experimental design
The study was implemented over the course of a year in Chipata District in Eastern Zambia.
Chipata District is located at the southeastern border of Zambia, with an estimated popu-
lation of 456,000 in 2010 (CSO 2010). Approximately 100,000 people live in Chipata town,
the district capital; the remaining population lives in rural areas, with small-scale farming
as primary source of income. According to the 2010 Living Conditions and Measurement
Survey, rural households in Chipata are on average poorer than in the rest of the country,
with 47 percent of household classified as “very poor” in the district overall, and 63 percent of
households classified as very poor in the rural parts of Chipata. Average monthly expenditure
of rural households is about one third of the national average, and access to electricity and
piped water close to zero in rural areas (see Appendix table A.1 for a summary of diﬀerences
between Chipata and the rest of Zambia).


3.1     Study sample
The study sample is drawn from a complete listing of villages in Chipata District obtained
from the Zambian Ministry of Agriculture’s registry of farmers for 2011. Using the Zambian
Ministry of Agriculture definition, we classified farms as small-scale if they farmed on fewer
than five hectares of land.7 Sampling was restricted to communities with 15-25 small-scale
farmers; we excluded peri-urban villages as well as a few villages which could not be reached
with one day’s drive from Chipata town. All remaining eligible villages were visited by study
enumerators who conducted a listing of farming households. Based on the listing visits,
    7
     We restricted our sample to households with at least one hectare of land to distinguish households
with very small scale home gardens from households engaged in crop production, and also to increase the
likelihood of suﬃcient harvest to repay the loan.


                                                  9
further villages were eliminated if they could not be reached during the rainy season or if
the number of households or the size of landholdings contradicted the Ministry’s records.8


3.2     Experimental design and implementation
We study the eﬀects of a short run loan on household labor allocation. The loan was oﬀered
to households in January 2013. Under the loan program, eligible households could obtain
one 25 kilogram bag of ground maize flour in each of three months during the hungry season
(January, February and March), which they were instructed to repay at harvest (June) in
the form of (unground) maize. The typical sales price in Zambian Kwacha (KR) of one 25kg
bag of ground maize in February was KR 45 (USD 9), while the price of one 50kg bag of
unground maize was between KR 50 (USD 10) and KR 65 (USD 13) in June depending on
whether maize was sold locally or sold to the government.9 This means that the implicit
interest rate over the 4-6 month loan period was between 11 and 44 percent, which translates
to an annual interest rate between 27 and 107 percent. At the same time, the loan saved the
farmers the cost of transporting maize to the miller and the cost of grinding, and the cost
of transporting harvested maize for sale.
    We varied the treatment intensity of the loan program at the village level. In 25 percent
of the 40 study villages, all eligible households were oﬀered the chance to take up the loan.
In half of the study villages, households that expressed interest in the loan entered in a
lottery, through which half were selected for the loan program, resulting in approximately
equal numbers of households with access to the loan program in full and in partial treatment
villages. The final 25 percent of villages served as the control and received no intervention.
    The loan oﬀer and within-village lottery were implemented through a village meeting to
which all small-scale farming households were invited in advance. At the meeting, study
enumerators explained the loan to the assembled participants. Households were given loan
forms and told to return them to their village head person the following day. If the village
was assigned to the partial eligibility treatment, households attending the meeting were
   8
      By dropping households more than one day’s drive from the main town and those inaccessible during
the rainy season, we potentially eliminate some of the more vulnerable households. While this potentially
detracts from the external validity of the results, randomization is conditional on eligibility so sample selection
is orthogonal to treatment assignment.

      Zambia has a heavily controlled maize sector, with government intervention through a fixed (above local
rate) price for harvested maize (KR 65 in 2013) and a price ceiling on ground maize at the retail level (KR 45
in 2013). Though maize prices tend to be lower at harvest, the government intervention limits the seasonal
fluctuations in maize prices that are observed in neighboring countries, though year-to-year variation remains
substantial (see Appendix figure A.1).


                                                        10
entered into a lottery during which names of participants were drawn from a basket by a
child unaﬃliated with the study. Half of the names were drawn, resulting in 50 percent
treatment relative to the full eligibility treatment arm.10 Households drawn in the lottery
made their participation decisions by returning their loan form to the head person, as in the
full eligibility arm.
    Maize flour was delivered to ten diﬀerent distribution centers to cover the 30 treatment
villages during the second half of each of January, February and March. Villages were
informed in advance about the time and place of the maize flour delivery and households
that had turned in their loan forms to their head person were eligible to borrow during each of
the three delivery dates. Because households might have diﬃculty transporting maize flour,
some flexibility was allowed in the pick up procedures. Specifically, the national registration
(NRC) card for the eligible borrower was needed to obtain the flour, but the borrower did
not have to come in person.11 In late June and early July, loan repayment was due. Village
heads were involved in reminding households to bring their maize for repayment to a central
point in the village, and were rewarded with a bag of maize for full repayment. Unlike the
distribution of maize flour, collection of maize was done at each village. In a couple of cases,
loans were repaid late. Further summary statistics on repayment patterns are described in
Section 5.
    Households were sampled and village-level treatments were assigned using min-max T
randomization (Bruhn and McKenzie 2009). The approach relies on repeated village-level
assignment to treatment and selects the draw that results in the smallest maximum t-statistic
for any pairwise comparison across treatment arms. Balance was tested for 13 village and
household level variables, as well as geographic blocks, with results described in Section 4.


3.3     Data
We rely on both survey and administrative data in our analysis. Survey data comes from
three sources: (i) a baseline survey conducted before the start of the agricultural season in
October 2012, (ii) a midline survey conducted between the second and third maize deliv-
ery in February and March 2013, and (iii) an endline survey conducted after harvest but
before repayment in June 2013. We collect data on a host of household and farm character-
  10
      If an odd number of farmers participated in the lottery, the number of eligible farmers was rounded up,
i.e. n/2 + 0.5 farmers selected into the program.
   11
      In a small number of cases, households were allowed to use a note from the village head person in lieu
of a missing NRC card. While no instances of fraud were reported, any fraud in the loan collection process
will bias us against seeing a result.


                                                     11
istics at baseline and endline, and focus the midline survey on labor allocation in the two
weeks preceding the survey. An eﬀort was made to keep data collection independent of the
intervention, to minimize the role of experimenter demand in influencing survey responses.


3.4    Local credit and labor markets
The conceptual framework builds on several contextual features, namely local labor and
credit markets. We provide additional qualitative background on these features of the study
setting. As described above, the study sample was limited to small farmers – those with land
holdings of 5 hectares (12 acres) or less. The attribute of “small-scale” is somewhat misleading
since it suggests that these farmers are unusually small; in fact, small-scale farmers represent
the overwhelming majority of households in rural villages in Zambia. In our study villages,
over 90 percent of listed households fall into this category.

Credit markets In terms of borrowing opportunities, the study setting is also fairly repre-
sentative of rural areas in developing countries, where credit markets are typically incomplete.
In the baseline survey, 4.5 percent of household respondents report accessing formal loans
for cash. Informal borrowing channels are slightly more common: 8.6 percent report taking
high interest loans, locally referred to as kaloba, with interest rates over 100 percent. Loans
between friends and family are most common, with 13.2 percent of baseline respondents re-
porting borrowing food or cash in the previous year. Some in-kind input loans are available
from agricultural companies in the area.

Ganyu labor Local wage earning opportunities for study households are defined largely
by casual labor or ganyu. In focus groups, small-scale farmers in Chipata described ganyu
labor as a coping strategy that households would prefer to avoid. Figure 3 shows the age and
gender profile of ganyu among adults at baseline; on average, men are more likely to engage
in ganyu than women; the highest ganyu rates at baseline were observed for men 25-34, 60
percent of whom reported ganyu activity in the prior season. In the baseline survey, the most
common response to why an individual in the household worked ganyu during the previous
agricultural season was hunger. The second most common reason was to access cash for a
personal purchase, and the third was to deal with an emergency. Households appear only
moderately accurate in their forecast of whether they will have to engage in ganyu in a given
year. Among control group households that predicted at baseline that they would have to



                                              12
do ganyu in the coming year, around 70 percent did; among those that predicted not doing
ganyu, around 40 percent ended up working oﬀ-farm.
   The model that we present in Section 2 simplifies a complex rural labor market. In the
study setting, road infrastructure is extremely bad, there is no motorized public transport
and distances between villages are substantial. Most casual labor takes place in or near the
worker’s own village. At baseline, around half of individuals who did ganyu worked at least
some of the time for other farms in the same village. While the conceptual framework distin-
guishes between larger farms that are buyers of ganyu and small farms that are sellers, the
distinction is not always as clear in practice. Over 50 percent of respondents report working
on other small farms (less than 12 acres) at baseline, and about one third of households sell-
ing ganyu also report occasional ganyu hiring. None of these patterns are inconsistent with
our model, which predicts that the (net) oﬀ-farm labor supply can be positive or negative,
depending on local wages and the relative marginal product of labor; they do, however mean
that the boundaries between ganyu buyers and sellers are more fluid, and the same farm
may sell ganyu at one point in the year, and purchase labor at another when more resources
are available.
    Wages are also seasonal, with highest wages reported during planting (October to early
December) and at harvest (May to June), as shown in Appendix figure A.2. In the absence
of private vehicles as well as public transportation, wages are mostly determined locally,
which either means within a village, or within a small group of villages. Ganyu wage rates
are typically negotiated on a case-by-case basis, and anecdotally are highly responsive both
to demand and supply shocks. In the hungry season (when resources are most constrained),
wages are likely to be suppressed both by increased supply from credit-constrained farms
and by reduced local demand (inability to hire). As a result, farms with suﬃcient resources
to hire ganyu may be able to hire labor at rates below the marginal product of ganyu on
their land; as such, ganyu contracts may constitute a within-village or within-community
transfer from smaller or more constrained to larger or less constrained households. Relaxing
credit constraints therefore should lead to a reallocation in the opposite direction.


4    Identification
To evaluate the eﬀect of the maize loan we estimate:

                     yivt = α + β1 f ullv + β2 partialv + Xiv φ + δt + uivt                (8)

                                              13
where yivt is an outcome of interest for household i located in village v and month t, f ullv
indicates that the village was assigned to the full eligibility treatment, partialv indicates
that the village was assigned to the partial eligibility treatment, Xiv is a vector of controls
measured at baseline and δt are month dummies to capture seasonal eﬀects. Errors are
clustered at the level of the randomization unit, the village v. We include all households in
our estimation of equation (8), regardless of whether the household took up the loan or loan
size. The coeﬃcient β1 therefore captures the eﬀect of being a small-scale farmer in a village
assigned to the full eligibility treatment, for both takers and non-takers. The coeﬃcient
β2 captures the average eﬀect of being in a partial eligibility village, regardless of lottery
outcome and take up decision. In much of the analysis, we pool across months or analyze
self-reported behavior in the month of the midline survey only.
   Since a household’s eligibility in the partial treatment villages depends on the lottery
outcome, which was randomly assigned, we can also estimate the reduced form eﬀect of
being eligible for a loan on outcomes of interest.12 We estimate:

                                   yiv = α + δeligiblei + φXiv + uiv                                     (9)

where the coeﬃcient δ represents the average eﬀect of eligibility for the loan across treatment
intensities. This specification may be invalid in partial eligibility villages if there are spillovers
across households. To empirically test the relevance of spillovers, both as an outcome of
interest and as a test of the identifying assumptions for equation (9), we interact the eligiblei
indicator variable with an indicator for being in a partial treatment village.



4.1     Balance and summary statistics
The coeﬃcients presented in the subsequent analysis identify the causal eﬀect of the loan
under the identifying assumption that treatment assignment is orthogonal to uiv . Table 1
presents the means and standard deviations of baseline survey characteristics among study
households. Column 1 shows averages for control villages and columns 2 and 3 report the
coeﬃcients from a regression of each household characteristic on treatment dummies, with
standard errors clustered at the village level. The significance of the coeﬃcient represents the
test of the characteristic mean in each treatment against that in the control, while column
  12
    For consistency, we define eligibility in both the full and the partial treatment villages conditional on
attending the informational meeting.


                                                     14
4 shows the p-values from a test that the treatment coeﬃcients are equal.
   A few of the summary statistics in Table 1 are worth noting. Household heads are around
46 years old and just under 25 percent are female. Households contain around 5.5 members,
with around one child under 5. In the previous season, households produced 1.3 acres of
local maize, 0.97 acres of hybrid maize and 1.7 acres of cotton on average, and used a total
of 4.8 acres for agricultural production. Households on average engaged in 12 days of casual
labor (ganyu) in the last season and hired around 4 days of ganyu. The average household
stored 25 bags of maize after the previous harvest and had a baseline harvest value of around
USD 484. With an average household size of more than 5 members and very limited income
beyond agriculture, this means that virtually all households in our sample were well below
the USD 1.25 per day per capita poverty threshold. In general, household characteristics
are well balanced, with 5 out of 39 pairwise tests significant at p < 0.10, which is just above
what we would expect from normal sampling with a 10 percent significance threshold. Most
notably for our analysis, households in the full treatment villages engaged in marginally
significantly fewer days of casual labor in the previous season than did households in the
partial treatment villages. Given the relatively small sample size and small imbalances, we
control for a full set of baseline characteristics throughout our analysis.


4.2    Attrition and selection
The main identifying assumption of our empirical analysis could be violated if households
select into eligibility status or drop out of the loan program diﬀerentially across treatments.
Households could exit the study both during the midline survey and the endline survey.
Overall attrition rates are low as shown in Table 2. The table reports means and standard
deviations at baseline in column 1 and the coeﬃcients from a univariate regression of the
binary attrition or selection outcome on each explanatory variable with standard errors
clustered at the village level. Each coeﬃcient therefore reflects a separate regression. A
total of 439 households were enrolled into the study at baseline, 98 percent of whom were in
the midline and endline surveys. The probability of being in the midline and endline surveys
is not aﬀected by treatment status (columns 2 and 4).
    Among households assigned to treatment, attrition could also occur at the stage of the
loan meeting, which took place in each partial and full treatment village. Column 3 of Ta-
ble 2 shows the probability of of attending the loan meeting as a function of each household
characteristic (again, each coeﬃcient is its own regression), conditional on residing in a treat-


                                               15
ment village and being in the baseline sample. Among eligible households, the probability
of attending the loan meeting is increasing in the age of the household head and land size,
but is not significantly aﬀected by treatment intensity.


5        Results
We begin with descriptive statistics associated with take up and repayment of the loan, and
a general manipulation test for changes in consumption, then move on to the analysis of
impacts on labor supply. Then we investigate the equilibrium eﬀect on wages, as described
in the conceptual framework (Section 2). We conclude our analysis with suggestive results
on within-village treatment spillovers.


5.1      Take up and repayment
Table 3 summarizes take up rates by treatment intensity. In the partial treatment villages,
a total of 221 households were surveyed at baseline. 208 households participated in the
information session, and 104 households were selected for participation in the loan program
through the public lottery. All of the selected households decided to enroll in the loan pro-
gram. Out of 104 households in the fully treated villages, 99 households came to the loan
information session, and 90 households (91 percent) decided to sign up for the loan program.
On average, households picked up 2.79 bags of maize flour in the partial treatment group
(among eligible households), and 2.62 bags of maize flour in the full treatment group. The
high take up rate across treatments means that, in practice, our ITT estimates are close
approximations of the average treatment eﬀect on the treated. Though take up rates vary
slightly with treatment intensity, they are not predicted by any of the household characteris-
tics presented in Table 1 and the intention to treat estimation strategy mitigates remaining
concerns about selection into the loan.13
    The bottom of Table 3 shows repayment rates, which were very high in both groups.
Ninety-eight percent of participants repaid at least a part of the loan, and 95.2 and 97.7
percent fully repaid their loans in the partial and full treatment villages, respectively. No
diﬀerences in repayment rates were found with respect to household size or financial resources
(results not shown).
    13
    The lottery itself may have aﬀected take up rates by increasing the perceived value of the program by
introducing scarcity.



                                                   16
5.2    Consumption
As a first step toward identifying the impact of the loan program, we analyze food consump-
tion. As described above, we conducted a midline survey in the middle of the hungry season,
during which detailed information on food intake was collected. Maize is the most commonly
grown crop in Chipata District, and also the staple food in Zambia; well-oﬀ households con-
sume maize in the form of a porridge (nshima) three times per day. To assess changes in
nutrition, we examine two summary measures of food consumption: the number of times
the respondent reported eating nshima during the 24 hours preceding the interview, and
whether any family member had to skip a meal in the week preceding the interview because
of food shortages. In the control group, the average respondent consumed nshima 1.74 times
in the 24 hours preceding the interview, and 36 percent report that a family member had to
miss a meal.
    Table 4 shows the corresponding treatment eﬀects. In full treatment villages, respon-
dents consumed 0.2 more meals, an increase of 11 percent in eating frequency over the
control group. The increase in the partial treatment villages was smaller and not statisti-
cally diﬀerent from consumption in the control group. When we analyze the impact of loan
eligibility at the household level in column 2, the overall eﬀects appear smaller than the full
village treatment eﬀect, but larger than the shifts observed in the partial treatment villages.
We find similar impacts for the missed meals among family members. The probability of
missing a meal was 16.5 percentage points lower in full treatment villages (a 45 percent re-
duction relative to the control group); the average treatment eﬀect was 6 percentage points
in the partial treatment villages, but not statistically diﬀerent from the control villages. The
individual ITT is once again in between the partial and full treatment village impact.


5.3    Labor supply
We begin our analysis of labor supply eﬀects with the midline survey. The main advantage
of the midline survey is that recall was restricted to a two-week period preceding the survey
(limiting recall issues), and that the timing of the survey (conducted in the last week of
February and first week of March 2013) allows us to directly investigate labor shifts in the
middle of the hungry season, i.e. the most constrained part of the agricultural season.
    Panel A of Table 5 shows the village level intention-to-treat results for household labor
supply at midline. In column (1) we analyze a binary indicator for whether the household
engaged in any oﬀ-farm ganyu labor activities. In the two-week period preceding the survey,


                                              17
46 percent of households in the control group indicated that they provided ganyu labor on
other farms.14 In full treatment villages, this proportion was reduced by 11.8 percentage
points (25 percent), while the reduction in partial treatment villages was 7.6 percentage
points (16.5 percent) and imprecisely estimated. Days of ganyu also decreased following a
similar pattern, though the treatment eﬀect in the partial treatment villages is close to zero.
While we find positive point estimates for labor supply on the the household farm in both
groups (column 3), the confidence intervals are large and the eﬀects are not statistically
significant. Finally, we observe no detectable change in hiring of outside labor (column 4).
    In Panel B, we show the intention-to-treat results at the household level. The results
look similar to Panel A: the estimated coeﬃcient on ganyu provision (column 1) suggests
an average reduction in ganyu labor of 8 percentage points. Since we now also include non-
eligible households in partial treatment areas (who may have benefited from the intervention)
in the comparison category, the slightly smaller coeﬃcient could in theory be evidence for
spillover eﬀects in these villages. At the household level, neither days of ganyu nor days on
farm (columns 2 and 3) are precisely estimated.
    The main advantage of the midline data is its relatively short recall period with a pre-
sumably more limited scope for recall bias. The longer recall period at endline allows us
to investigate whether households compensated for lower rates of ganyu during the hungry
season with an increase before loan repayments were due. Table 6 shows results from the
endline data, covering the full agricultural calendar, that are qualitatively similar to the
midline results in Table 5. The probability of any oﬀ-farm labor at any point during the
agricultural season falls by 9 percentage points in the fully treated villages relative to the
control. Days of ganyu fall, days of on-farm labor increase and days of hired labor increase in
full treatment villages, all with coeﬃcients that are large in magnitude (39 percent, 7 percent
and 46 percent, respectively) but imprecisely estimated. Panel B shows the individual level
ITT results, which is consistent with the midline outcomes. Because these measures also
include the months preceding the loan oﬀer, we also repeat the analysis in Appendix table
A.2, restricting outcomes to the months during which households had loans. This narrower
analysis requires that households accurately recall the timing of their labor decisions; per-
  14
    The share of households in the control villages who report doing ganyu in the two weeks prior to the
midline survey is substantially higher than the average ganyu rates reported for the previous February during
the baseline survey. This can be attributed to two factors. First, the midline and baseline measures refer to
diﬀerent years, and ganyu rates may vary substantially from year to year. Second, the short recall period
in the midline survey may allow respondents to remember ganyu activities that they had forgotten in the
intervening 8 months when asked at baseline about the previous February.



                                                     18
haps due to measurement error, estimates are consistent with but less precise than in Table
6.
          In our final set of results on labor supply, we focus on the period immediately preceding
loan repayment and the endline survey. Column 4 of Table 6 shows the probability that a
household did any ganyu in the two months preceding loan repayment. Because the recall
period in these questions is only two months, we expect the reports to be reasonably accurate.
On average, in control village households, 29 percent of respondents report some ganyu in
their household in the two months prior to loan repayment. In full treatment villages, that
drops by 13.8 percentage points (47.6 percent). The average eﬀect on eligible households is
a decrease of 8 percentage points.15
    Additional analysis by gender using endline data suggests that treatment eﬀects are larger
for female household members who have a lower baseline rate of ganyu (recall Figure 3). In
full treatment villages, the probability that a household supplies female ganyu fell by 6.8
percentage points (p-value of 0.052) or by 29.3 percent, while the probability that a household
supplies male ganyu fell by 3.7 percentage points (p-value of 0.50) or 7.8 percent. Note that
these estimates assume equal probabilities of adult males and females able to supply labor
across treatment and control households.


5.4          Wages
As outlined in our theoretical framework, individual (or community) changes in ganyu labor
participation should have only marginal eﬀects on equilibrium wages if labor markets were
national or frictionless. As we have argued and shown above, workers’ ability to engage in
short-term labor opportunities beyond walking distance is somewhat limited, which means
that large diﬀerentials between local labor market outcomes are likely.
    To evaluate the wage impact of the loan programs, we start by analyzing wages reported
by households in the midline survey. As part of the midline survey, households were first
asked to report the total number of person-days of ganyu provided in the 2 weeks prior
to the survey, and then asked to report total ganyu income for the household in total, as
well the days of ganyu worked and income earned by each household member. We start
     15
    The lack of reported oﬀ-farm labor in the treatment villages preceding repayment are unlikely due to
a lack of oﬀ-farm work opportunities. As shown in Appendix figure A.2, wages are high at harvest relative
to other times of the year. Labor supply is scarce, however, because most households are engaged on their
own land. At baseline, households reported a total of 64 person-days of ganyu during the harvest. For
comparison, 232 person-days of ganyu were reported during weeding, 57 during planting and 199 during field
preparation.


                                                   19
our analysis by looking at the average wage reported at the household level: the total
ganyu income divided by the total number of person-days reported. Two things are worth
highlighting. First, the duration of a typical ganyu work day varies substantially; the wage
number calculated should thus be interpreted as the wage income a worker receives for a
typical day of ganyu. Second, a substantial fraction of households do not do any ganyu, for
which this variable is not defined; wages thus do not represent wage oﬀers, but only wage
oﬀers accepted.
   Panel A of Table 7 shows that average wage rates reported at midline were around KR
9.65, which corresponds to slightly less than USD 2 at 2013 exchange rates. In column 1
we regress reported wages on the two treatment arms; in column 2 we use the fraction of
farmers eligible for the program at the village level. Independent of the chosen specification,
the magnitude of the observed eﬀect is large, suggesting an increase of local wages of up to
49 percent. The analysis is repeated in columns 3 and 4, using reported wages (total ganyu
income divided by total days worked) for each individual in the household who did ganyu.
The individual-level wage is lower, on average, and the treatment eﬀects are less precisely
estimated. We show the full distribution of reported wages at midline, by treatment arm, in
Appendix figure A.3.
   In the baseline and endline surveys, households were also asked to indicate the total
number of person-days worked oﬀ-farm over the agricultural season. For this longer-term
recall module, households were asked to separately report oﬀ-farm labor activities for each
of the four main parts of the agricultural season: field preparation, planting, weeding, and
harvesting. Respondents indicated the total number of (full-time) person-days for each
activity, as well as the total remuneration earned by the household, including food as well as
other in-kind services. As Panel B of Table 7 shows, the average wage of KR 18 (USD 3.5)
was substantially higher at endline than at midline. The higher rates observed in the endline
survey reflect seasonal variation in wages, as well as potentially longer working hours.
    In Panel B of Table 7, we show the results of a basic household-level panel model, where
each observation corresponds to a wage reported in a given season (2011/12 in baseline,
2012/12 in endline) and for a given activity. A total of 1025 ganyu wages were reported
across the two seasons. In Panel B of Table 7, we show the results from a basic diﬀerence-in-
diﬀerence estimator with village fixed eﬀects, where all activities in the year of the interven-
tion are considered treated in villages with loan programs (columns 1 and 2). In columns 3
and 4, we report the results of an alternative specification, where we only consider weeding
and harvesting related activities in the second year as treated. Given that the vast majority


                                              20
of ganyu activities fall in this category, the results from the two models are relatively simi-
lar. All of the estimated coeﬃcients go in the expected (positive) direction, but the standard
errors are large and coeﬃcients are statistically insignificant. While the magnitudes of the
wage treatment eﬀects are (insignificantly) larger at endline than at midline, relative to the
respective control group means, they are smaller (27-35 percent versus 49 percent). This
diﬀerence in the relative shift is due in part to the higher control group average observed at
endline, but also perhaps to a dissipation of the treatment eﬀect. Finally, as in the labor
analysis, we expect measurement error to be larger at endline than at midline.
   The observed wage eﬀects may be driven by adjustment on multiple margins. First, the
number of households supplying labor to the market falls as a result of the intervention, as
shown above. Second, the composition of individuals in the market also adjusts; in particular,
as described in Section 5.3 above, female labor supply falls disproportionately. Finally, to the
extent that the consumption gains shown above translate into better nutrition, productivity
may also increase, conditional on working in the labor market. We cannot disentangle these
diﬀerent channels, but the presence of all three helps explain the magnitudes of the wage
eﬀects that we observe. In addition, our focus on small villages means that a relatively large
fraction of the total village population is treated, producing a substantial shock to aggregate
labor supply.


5.5    Within-village spillovers
The results shown in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 suggest that ITT eﬀects are smaller in partial
treatment villages than in the full treatment villages. To investigate the spillovers associated
with the loan program, we separately estimate treatment eﬀects for eligible and ineligible
households in partial treatment villages. We investigate three possible spillover channels:
first, eligible households may share some of the additional resources by transferring food
to ineligible households or family members as gifts or on a loan basis. Second, eligible
households may hire more ineligible households to do ganyu. Third, general equilibrium wage
eﬀects may impact labor allocation decisions of ineligible households in partial treatment
villages, as described in Section 2.
    Figure 4 and Appendix table A.3 show spillover eﬀects on labor and consumption out-
comes and on inter-household transfers, respectively. First, transfers from eligible to in-
eligible households did not increase (Appendix table A.3). Interestingly, the likelihood of
households reporting incoming gifts and loans is substantially higher among eligible house-


                                              21
holds, which is likely a reflection of eligible households reporting the maize loan program
under this category. Second, ganyu by ineligible households did not increase (Panels c and
d of Figure 4), which is consistent with the observations that eligible households in par-
tial treatment villages did not increase hiring (not shown). While we lack the precision to
detect spillover eﬀects at conventional levels of significance, Figure 4 shows that ineligible
households experience outcomes that move toward the treatment eﬀects and away from the
controls for consumption and labor impact. The graphs plot marginal eﬀects from the inter-
action of household-level eligibility and village-level treatment interactions. A comparison
across ineligible households in pure control and partial villages shows the spillover eﬀect on
ineligible households of being in a village where some households receive loans. A comparison
across eligible households in partial and full treatment households shows the spillover impact
on eligible households. In all panels of the figure, the eﬀects are statistically indistinguish-
able for eligible and ineligible in partial treatment villages. Conceptually, and based on the
model developed in Section 2, these results are consistent with income eﬀects: for a given
amount of oﬀ farm labor, higher wages relax the consumption constraint of even ineligible
households. Given the very small number of clusters, all of these estimates are imprecise;
larger studies will be needed to more closely identify local labor market spillovers.


6    Discussion and Conclusions
We implemented a simple and potentially scalable maize loan program in rural Zambia to
identify the eﬀect of increased access to seasonal credit on oﬀ-farm labor supply. The results
of the experiment suggest that additional access to short-term credit increases food con-
sumption, decreases oﬀ-farm labor and increases local wages in targeted communities. Even
though the intervention was relatively simple in its design, increased resource availability
during the growing season can potentially aﬀect labor market outcomes through multiple
mechanisms. First, short-term credit lowers the degree to which consumption-constrained
farmers depend on short-term labor income, reducing local labor supply from particularly
resource-limited households. Second, improved nutrition potentially allows household mem-
bers to work longer and harder (as in Strauss 1986), which may positively aﬀect productivity
on their own farm as well as for external labor activities. Both eﬀects will be associated with
increases in local wages, which will in return also change the composition of the ganyu work-
force from individuals engaging in ganyu primarily to smooth consumption to individuals
engaging in ganyu activities to maximize the household’s net income.

                                              22
   Even though the credit program was designed to be broadly consistent with local credit
market conditions, the extremely high uptake and repayment rates could be seen as evidence
that the loan program was considered financially beneficial, and thus provided a net transfer
to households. Given the high variability of local short-term lending rates reported, it is
hard to quantify how large of a net transfer the loan program oﬀered. With a maximum
loan size of USD 27 and a market value of the repaid maize between USD 30 and USD 45
(depending on the buyer), large net transfers seem unlikely. At an annual interest rate of
100 percent, and assuming that the maize would have been sold cheaply in the absence of
the program ($30), the estimated net transfer over the four-months loan period would be
approximately USD 3, which corresponds to about one day of ganyu income. In comparison,
the labor responses seem rather large. At the mean, our results suggest that households are
forgoing around KR 72 (~ USD 14) of ganyu income as a result of their reallocation away
from oﬀ-farm labor, which makes it seem unlikely that income eﬀects would have driven the
observed shifts in labor allocation. In our view, the empirical patterns observed are most
consistent with loan programs easing consumption-constraints for the households with the
smallest food or financial reserves. This fits well with the positive correlation between missed
meals and ganyu labor at midline, in both treatment and control villages.
   Overall, our findings suggest that credit constraints aﬀect consumption choices made by
farming households, and also distort farming households’ labor allocation decisions. This
implies that expanding seasonal credit to small farmers may allow them to optimize their
labor allocation and to benefit from increased local wages. The rise in wages generated by
increased access to credit would lead to a redistribution of income from net buyers to net
sellers of ganyu.
    From a policy perspective, short-term loans may potentially be able to improve aggregate
productivity; our results suggest that repayment rates can be high enough to make such
programs possible and sustainable in good years; in bad years - with large aggregate weather
or pest shocks - large drops in repayment rates seem likely; the addition of higher level
insurance mechanisms may be necessary to ensure the financial stability and viability of
such programs over time. Ongoing data collection at a substantially larger scale will allow
us to examine the extent to which the reallocation of labor resources to farmers’ own land can
increase the productivity of small-scale farmers and will track both sides of the labor market
to generate a more complete picture of the overall welfare implications of the intervention.

Notes: Panel A shows the results for average ganyu wages reported at the household level
(columns 1 and 2) and individual level (columns 3 and 4). The dependent variable in Panel A
is the average wage received per day of ganyu in the two weeks preceding the midline survey.
Panel B shows difference in difference estimates for ganyu wages reported at baseline and
endline, with village fixed effects. Columns 1 and 2 include activity fixed effects for field
preparation, planting, weeding and harvesting. Columns 3 and 4 include season fixed effects
and restricts treatment effects to the time period after which loans were announced. All
specifications include the household level controls shown in Table 1 and cluster standard
errors at the village level. * p < 0.10 ** p < 0.05.

individual level intention to treat OLS regressions. All columns control for covariates shown in Table 1
and cluster standard errors at the village level. The outcome variable in column 1 is a binary variable
that equals one if the family reported any ganyu at endline. Column 2 reports the corresponding
person-days of ganyu reported. Column 3 is the person-days of on-farm work and Column 4 is the
person-days of hired ganyu. For all questions, the recall period is the months covered by the loan (Jan-
June). * p < 0.10 ** p < 0.05.
