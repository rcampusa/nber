                         THE EXCESS SMOOTHNESS OF CONSUMPTION:
                           IDENTIFICATION AND INTERPRETATION


                                        ABSTRACT



     The   paper investigates the implications of the omitted information

problem    — that   is, the econometric problem which arises because an

econometrician cannot explicitly include the complete set of variables

potentially used by agents
                               — in the context    of the "excess smoothness"

phenomenon posed by Deaton 11987].     The paper shows that an econometricianwho

fails to take into account the effects of omitted informationwill incorrectly

conclude that an empirical finding of excess smoothness of consumption implies

that the income process is nonstationary.     By contrast, with a more thorough

understanding of the omitted information problem, the finding of excess

smoothness of consumption is easily explained with two assumptions:         a) the


consumption data is generated by the excess sensitivity       alternative


hypothesis,   in which consumption is a weighted average of current income and

permanent income, and b) agents are forecasting on the basis of a larger

information   set than the econometrician.    Further, excess smoothness is

revealed to be consistent with a wide range of stationary income processes as

well as nonstationary income processes.      Thus the common presumption that the

excess smoothness phenomenon is linked in an essential way to the stationarity

or nonstationarity of the income process evaporates when omitted information

is taken into consideration.

     In a provocative paper, Deaton [1987] purauaa a line of reasoning which

has subsequentlybeen dubbed the "Deaton paradox":            If one abandons the

conventionalview that income is a stationaryprocess around a deterministic

trend for the newer view, promoted by Nelson and Plosser [1982] and Campbell

and flankiw [l987a1, rhat income is nonatationary,      then the conventional

characterization   of   permanent   income as a "smoothed"version of current income

is fundamentally   undermined.      If the intuition is based on a univariatemodel

of the income process, as in Deaton's original paper, the logic of the

argument   ia that the income series can be reasonably modeled as positively

autocorrelatedin first differences (or growth rates), implying that a $1

innovation in current income induces a revision in permanent income of more

than $1.    If the variance of revisions in permanent income exceeds the

variance of income forecast errors, as this view suggests, then the

consumptiondata should, under the permanent income hypothesis,           follow a

random walk with innovationvariance larger than the innovationvariance of

the income series.      Empirically, however,   the variance    of the first difference

of consumption, t1c, is smaller than, or approximatelyequal to, the variance

of innovations in income.        Thus Deaton characterizes    the permanent   income

                                                       "too smooth", a view
hypothesis as failing in a way which makes consumption

which turns inside-out the conventionalnotion that a failure of the permanent

 income hypothesis causes consumption to be more variable,         or less smooth, than

 predictedby the hypothesis.

     While the intuition based on the univariatemodel of income has

 considerable appeal, the intuition cannot be made rigorous within the confines

 of a univariate time    series model   of income.   It has long been recognized (see
                                         —2—
Flavin   [1981]) that the residuals   of a univariate   income process,   while

correlatedwith revisions in permanent income, will not be proportional            to the


contemporaneous    revisions   in permanent income if variables other than lagged

income are useful in predicting future income.       In response to Deaton [1987],

West [1988] showed that if income is generated by a multivariare process,           the

associated revisions in permanent income will generally have smaller variance

than the error—riddenseries of permanent income revisions calculated from a

univariate income model.       In other words, if agents forecast income on the

basis of variables    other than lagged income, the variance of revisions      in

permanent income cannot be identifiedon the basis of a univariate time series

model of income.

     Because an econometrician      attemptingto estimate rational expectations

models will be unable to explicitly include all of the informational variables

available to agents, either because of the absence of data or because of

degrees of freedom constraints,      a whole class of empirical rational

expectationsmodels will be characterizedby the property that the information

set used by the econometriciancontains only a subset of the information set

used by agents.     This discrepancybetween the econometrician's      and the agent's

information sets —which has variously been described as the "omitted

information" issue (from the point of view of the econometrician)         or the

"superior   information" issue (from the point    of view of the agent)    — was
first raised by Shiller [1972] in the context of the expectations hypothesis

of the term structure.1

     For the reasons indicated above, it seems futile to respond to the

omitted informationproblem by simply adding more and more variables           to the

information set in the econometricmodel.        Instead,   several authors,   including

Hansen and Sargent [1981], West [1988], and Campbell and Deaton [1988], have

used projection arguments to finesse the omitted informationproblem.              These

                                                                    of agents,
projection arguments exploit the property that the optimal behavior
as postulated by the null hypothesis,        will cause an observable endogenous

variable to encapsulate the information used by agents but unobserved by the

econometrician.       Undar this projection argument, the econometricianneed not

observe all the variables        in the agent's information set individually,      since

the agent's behavior reveals the appropriate          summary measure of the omitted

variables    in an endogenous "signaling" variable.        In the context of the term

structure    of interest rates, ihe crucial signaling variable would be the long

rate;    in a stock market model, the signaling variable would be the stock

price;    in the   permanent   income consumptionmodel, the signal would he the

consumption series.

        Virtually sll of the discussion of the use of this projection argument to

finesse the omitted informationproblem has been conducted by first taking as

a premise the validity of the null hypothesis under consideration.           The result

that the omitted informationproblem can be completely end simply eliminated

when the null hypothesis holds is extremely useful for constructing

statistical tests of the null hypothesis.            That is, the resulring statistical

tests are valid even though the econometricisndid not explicitly include              in

the specification all      of the variables potentiallyused by      agents for

forecasting.

        While the projection arguments employed by Hansen and Sargent [1981],

West [1988]. and Campbell and Deston (1988] are indeed robust to the exclusion

of relevant forecastingvariables from the econometricisn's           informationset,

they are not robust to arbitrary departures from the null hypothesis. That

is, if the null hypothesis        — for   example,   the expectationshypothesis of the

term structure,      or the permanent income hypothesis     — fails in an arbitrary
way, the signaling variable (the long rate in the term structure          model,    or the

consumption series in the permanent income model) will not fulfill its crucial

role of fully encapsulatingall informationavailable to agents, with the


consequence that the "omitted information" problem remains a problem.
                                        —4.-

Focusing   on the permanent income application, consider the following

alternativea to the permanent income hypotheaia:



     1) Agents spend 95%, or some other fixed fraction, of their current
     income each month.

     2)  Agents save a fixed dollar amount of income each month as a resetve
     against contingencies.

     3)  Agents crc "completely Keynesian", with a marginal propensity to
     consume out of current income of unity.


     Under any of these three alternativehypotheses,        the data series on

consumption (or, equivalently,    the series on saving) would have no information

content which would improve on a univariate income process in predicting

future income.    If the consumption data are   generated   by any of   these

alternativehypotheses, the projectionarguments employed by West [1988] and

Campbell   and I3eaton [1988] will not successfullyfinesse the omitted

informationproblem.

     This paper pursues the following main objectives:



1)   gxplanation of excess smoothness

     A simple explanation of     the Deaton paradox,   i.e. the apparent   "excess

smoothness" of consumption,   is proposed.     The explanation of excess smoothness

entails two elements:    stipulationof a specific alternative structuralmodel

of consumption, and considerationof the effects of omitted informationunder

the alternative hypothesis. Since the alternative model of consumption

invoked in the explanation of the Daaton paradox is the "excess sensitivity"

model used in Flavin [1981], the discussionautomaticallygenerates an

explanation of the relationship between the concept of "excess smoothness" and

the concept of "excess sensitivity."      This section of the paper also shows

that the phenomenon of excess smoothness     is not as closely linked to the

presence   of a unit root in the income process as is commonly believed.

2)   Analysis     of oaitted informationunder alternatives to null hyoothests

       As mentioned above, virtually all of the previous diacussion of the use

of projection arguments to solva the omitted information problem has been

premised on the assumption that the null hypothesis holds.         This paper extends

previous    results   on identificationof   rational   expectationamodels subject to

the omitted informationproblem by asking whether,         and under what conditions,

the projection arguments will fully avoid the omitted informationproblem when

the data is generated      by some model other than the null hypothesis.       While

this discussion is conducted in the context       of   the consumptionmodel,    the

results to some extent carry over to other applications.          In the context of

the permanent income application,       the analysis shows that   if the consumption

data are generated     by the   "excess sensitivity"   model used in Flavin [19811

(within which the permanent       income model is nested),   the basic projection

argument    successfullyeliminates the omitted informationproblem.         The

discussion also confirms and amplifies a point made in Hansen and Sargent

[1981] that the introduction of a stochaatit       disturbance into the model     —
i.e.    the introductionof    a transitoryconsumptionterm, or a preference shock
— fundsmentslly       undermines the usefulnessof the projection argument in

avoiding the omitted informationproblem.



3)     Critique   of West 119881 snd Campbell and Deston Fl9881

        The paper offers a critique of the methodologysnd conclusions of the

recent pspers by West [1988] and Csmpbell       snd Deston [1988].    Roth of these


papers recognize that Deston's       [1987) original finding of excess smoothness,

bssed on a univariate model of the income process, was potentially a spurious

finding crested by the effects of omitted information.         While West [1988] and

Campbell    and Deaton [1988] use somewhat different applications of the

projection argument, their analysis is similar in the sense that both papers

first establish that if the null hypothesis is assumed to hold, a projection
                                          —6—
argument   can be employed to completely avoid the omitted information problem.

Both papets then use the projectionargument to calculate estimates of the

           of revisions in permanent income,
                                             var(Ay), and conclude
variance                                                                   that even

after having taken the omitted information issue into account, the results

confirm Deaton's original empirical finding that consumption is "too smooth".

I   argue that while the result provided    by West [1988] and Campbell and Deaton

[1988] that   var(Ay) can be      identified under the null hypothesis may be of

interest for some purposes       (such as constructionof   a statistical test of   the

null hypothesis),     it is not sufficient for establishing excess smoothness,

since excess smoothness could only be generated by some type of departure          from

the null hypothesis. In my view,       both the West mnd the Campbell   and Deaton

papers ultimately are unsuccessful in establishing that consumption is 'too

smooth' relative     to permanent income; to establish excess smoothness,     they

would need to provide at least one alternative hypothesis under which

var(y)      is identified.     Neither of the previous analyses provides    this; the

papers by West and    by Cmmpbell and                                varCAy) can be
                                        Deaton only establish that

identified if the permanent income hypothesis      is true.



4)    Empirical   evidence   on the extent of the omitted informationproblem

        Having identified a fortuitous case in which the omitted information

problem can be finessed       even though the null hypothesis fails to hold, the

analysis    naturally raises the empirical question of whether the assumptions

embodied. in the fortuitouscase are consistentwith the data.         The empirical

section of the paper provides a statistical test of the assumptions embodied

in the fortuitouscase, and finds that these assumptions are violated by the

data.     Even after establishing that the omitted informationproblem cannot be

completely avoided, one would like to know whether a model suffering from

miaspecificationdue to omitted information generates inferences which are a)

nevertheless fairly accurate, or are b) grossly inaccurate.         To this end, the
                                                 —7—

empirical     section offers some limited evidence          on the magnitude of the

discrepancybetween the econometrician's             estimate    of a parameter based on a

low dimension VAR which is subject to the omitted informationproblem and the

true parameter based on the full information set.



Section 1;      The omitted informationproblem

      The analysis is conducted by working through the effects of omitted

information in the context of a particular specificetion                  of the time series

process generating income.          Some of the points made by the paper          — in
psrticulsr,     the basic point that under the exact excess sensitivity

hypothesis,     vsrOy) is       still identified       — can   easily   be generalized beyond

the assumed specificationof the income process.                 While the quantitative

results will, or course, be dependent on the essumed specificationfor the

income process,       I have chosen to work in the context of the example rather

than seek maximum generality. As an expositionalstrategy, I believe that the
                                                                      some of
simplicity and concreteness of the illustrative example helps clarify

the issues, as well as permitting the analytical solution of a wider range of

results   -




      The exogenous specification of the            time series process on labor income is

assumed to be:

(1)                  —
                         P1Y_i +   P2Yt_2
                                            +
                                                xtl + lt
                     —
                xt
      In this example,        the variable
                                                x1 representsa composite        of all the

information available to agents but not directly observed by the

econometricimn.          To take the simplest specification,        x is assumed
uncorrelated with lmgged labor income                      i—l,2,3...),    its own lagged


values               i—l,2,3...), and   tlt Thus  x is correlatedwith       but

uncorrelated with              Since the variable x1 is assumed  to represent the

 composite     of all information available to agents aside from lagged labor

income, the disturbance                is the true income forecastingerror perceived            by

agents in period       t;   thst is:

                   —

                                 E(ytI1)
where       represents the complete information set available to agents.                     Given
        I

disturbance,    or forecast error, would be an estimate not of                   but instead

of the sum    x1 + C1.
      As originally stated by           Deaton, the proposition that consumption is too

smooth compared to permanent income is closely tied to the proposition that

income is nonstationary.            Equation (1) was chosen as the exogenous

specificationof labor income because it encompassesboth the stationary and

nonstationary views of income.             For the *conventionalw view that income is a

stationaryprocess around an exponentialtrend, interpret                    as labor income

expressed    in deviations from trend and assume that the largest root of the

process is strictly less than one.             For the Nelson and Plosser [1982) and

Campbell and Mankiw [l987a] view that income is nonstationary,                 interpret         as

labor income     (not detrended) and assume that the autoregressive             process has a

unit root.

      The permanent income model used by Campbell and Deaton [1988] and West

[1988) follows the basic simplifyingassumptions            used in Flavin [1981]         .    These

assumptions    include:          a) labor income,     is exogenouslydetermined,          and

b) the reel rate of return, denoted r, is constant.

      As is well known, the permanent income hypothesis as formulated above is

only literally true under strong restrictions on tastes and technology;

Christimno,    Eichenbaum,         and Marshall [1987] detail one set of assumptions

under which the petmanent income hypothesis holds in general equilibrium.

However,    relaxing these assusiptions about tastes and technologyhas yet to

       Also   following       Flavin [198l[, permanent income is defined as the annuity

value of the agent's net worth, where net worth includes the present

      Following   Hall [1978), the permanent            income hypothesis is specified      as:

(5)          c—y
Note that this version of the hypothesis, in which agents consume exactly

their petmanent income each period, is mote restrictive than Friedman's                  [1957]

version of the PIN.        Friedman [1957] viewed consumptionas containingboth a

permanent component and a transitorycomponent,                 and merely assumed that

transitory consumptionwas uncorrelatedwith permanent consumption.                    Hall

[1978] sharpened the hypothesis hy assuming that transitoty consumptionwas

identically zero.

      If agents   consume exactly their permanent             income each period,   as assumed

in equation (5), it's easy to show that permanent income is a martingale,                   with

the implication that

endogenoua in this model.        While the level of permanent income depends on the

level of assets, the change in permanent income over time depends only on the

revision in expectations of future labor income because labor income is the

only component of total income subject to exogenous shocks:

the econometricienestimating the forecastingmodel as a univariate income

income one period ahead does not, of course, imply that agents have perfect

foresight over the whole path of labor income, since agents do not have

perfect foresight with respect to the future realizations of xt.

values   of        and cr, the ratio is bounded between                   2   and 1.   Thus, if the

Section 2:    Explanationof Excess Smoothness

       Thia aection of the paper provides a simple explanationof the excess

smoothnessphenomenon.2 The essential components of the explanation are:                             1)

stipulation of a structural alternativehypothesis to the permanent income

hypothesis (PIN), and 2) consideration of the effects of the omitted

informationproblem.

       Under the PIN, consumption should follow a martingale process, with

innovations   equal to the innovations in permanent income, hence,

also fails to hold.       Further,      since permanent income, as defined in equation

                    var())        generally     will not hold under alternative consumption

hyporheses.          In defining     the concept of "excess smoothness" one needs to

choose between                     and
                         var(c)          var(Ac) as a      measure of consumptionvariability,

                              var(Ay)           var(C) as     a measure of variability of

permanent Income.             In this paper consumptionwill be described as "excessively

smooth" if

(18)                var(f) <      var(c),
which is a definitionof excess smoothnessconsisteotwith Campbell and

11_eaton   [l988].

       The explanationof excess smoothness relies on the specificationof a

specific        alternative     hypothesis, rather than thinking of the alternative as

the completely general alternative "any behavior other than the behavior

predicted       by   the PIH".     The alternativehypothesis       is the model used in Flavin

[1981] which posits that consumption exhibits excess sensitivity to curcent

income:

                         —
                             fiy + y.
In this alternativehypothesis, consumptionis assumed to increase by $1 in

response        to a $1 increase in permanent income.           In addition, the hypothesis

entertains the possibility that consumptionwill increase by                  $/3   in response

to a $1 increase in transitory income,                      In this Keynesian—typealternative

model,     j3   can be thought of as the marginal propensity to consume out of

transitory income, where transitory income is defined as the residual,
   —            + (i—)At) —y.            (Remember that      denotes labor income, noc total

income.)        Using the definition of permanent income given in equation (3), the

excess sensitivity alternativehypothesis can be stated as:

       Note that even though transitory income and              permanent       income were defined

as the transitory and permanent components of total income, inclusive of asset

income,     in the statement of the excess sensitivity hypothesis (equation (20)),

the terms involving asset income cancel out, with the result that the first

difference of consumption is a weighted average of the first difference of

labor income,             and the expectational         revision   of the      annuity value of

future labor incoae.        To simplify the notation, note that the expectational

revision of the annuity value of future labor income is equal to the first

difference of the permanent income series which would be generated under the

null hypothesis (equation (7)).              Thus the excess sensitivityhypothesis can              be

        To avoid confusion, it is important to atress that                     in equation (26)

and subsequently throughout the paper refers to the first difference of the

permanent       income series which would be generated under the null hypothesis,

not the first differenceof the actual permanent income series generated under

the alternative hypothesis;             the former is a martingale while the latter is

not,     If notationalpurity were the only consideration,                 it would be preferable

to state the alternative hypothesis as                 Ac —   f3Ay   +(l_/i)ypt•

simplicity of thinking about the alternative hypothesis as modeling the change

in consumption as a weighted average of the change in labor income and the

change in permanent             income seemed sufficiently valuable to justify a slight

abuse of notation.              The derivation above (equations       (20) through    (26)); shows

that the intuitivelyappealing               statement of the alternativehypothesis in


equation    (26) is rigorouslygrounded in the assumptions                 of the model, provided

                                              the first difference in the permanent             income
that
        Ay is understood to denote
series which would be generated under the null hypothesis.

        Equation      (26) can then be rewritten as:

(27)              Ac -         Ø[E(aytIQ1)]
                                                  +   +

         t—l is       an      information set which is a subset of the agent's complete

Thus, under the excess sensitivityalternativehypothesis, the disturbance to

which further implies that the incoae innovation,                      C     ,   and the revision in

permanent income,                are perfectly correlated.                 Thus for the special case

in which income is a univariateprocess, the excess smoothness condition takes

the form:

                        —                                              +                          < var(Ay)

which in turn can be simplified to the condition

(33)                         —
                                 ($r       +                       <
                var(Cct)                        (l13)CyP)2

        The maasage of aquation (33) is as follows:                    If the consumption data is

generatedby the excess sensitivityalternativehypothesis,                               and if labor

income is a univariate process                 (i.e., there is no omitted information

problem),     an empirical finding of excess smoothness of consumption

             C vsr(Ay)) would imply that
(var(Cct)

(34)                <
                 yt °Ayr't
i.e.,    a finding of excess smoothnesswould                    imply that a $1 innovation to labor

income induces s revision in permanent                    income   of more than       $1.     Thus one way

to interpret the apparent excess smoothness                      of consumption is to view the

consumption data as being generated by three assumptions: I)                                 labor   income is

a univariste process, 2)              55 a structuralhypothesis, consumption is

excessively sensitive to current income, and 3)                        labor income is
                                                   —    19 —


nonstationary.           Note that if one views income as a univariateprocess there

is a close relationship between the inequality                     relating var((t) and          var(Ay)
and the stationarity of the income process.

       However,     the interpretation          of an empirical finding of excess smoothness

of consumption changes dramatically if we drop the assumption that labor

income is a univariate process and allow for omitted information.                             Returning

to equation (29), consider the extreme but nonetheless interesting case in

which agents can forecast their labor income one period in advance without

error (i.e., the special case in which o—O).                       In this case the covariance

between the revision in permanent income, Liy, and the forecast error in a

univariate income autoregression,                       would be zero.       For this limiting      case,
                                                  yt'
the excess smoothness condition becomes

                                    — f32var(                                  <

where       —
                ct        —
                              E(L\ctIyt,y   l'•
                                                            For values of the excess sensitivity

parameter between zero and one, Oçlkl, the weights on                        var(C) and var(1y)
will sum to less thanunity; for example,                       for a   plausible value of /3 — .5,

     — (l_13)2 —        .25.     Thus if we assume that the consumptiondata is generated

by the excess sensitivity alternativehypothesis and further assume that

agents have perfect one-.period-6head forecastability                      of labor income, excess

smoothness of consumptionwould arise as long as                                    <
                                                                        var()          { _)var(Ay).
That is, for       /3
                        — .5, the inequalityvar(C) < var(LXy) would                       obtain as long

as              < 3var(Ly). Thus               while a nonstationary        process      for labor income
     var()
would generate excess smoothness, a wide range of stationaryprocesses would

also generate           excess   smoothness.

       The important lesson which emerges from this analysis is as follows:                           If

we model the labor income series as a univariateprocess, as in Deaton 1l987J,

the correlation between the inferred                         and        is artificiallyconstrained

to equal unity, with the implicationthat a nonstationary income process will

generate    excess smoothness and a stationary income process will generate

"insufficient"      smoothness.     However,   in the general case in which the agent's

inference      of       is based on an informationset strictly       larger than the

                                                                           and
econometrician's        information set, the correlation between      Ay            yt   may

plausibly     be much less than unity — in the extreme          case of perfect

one-period-aheadforecastabilityof labor income, the correlation is zero.

an empirical finding of excess smoothness of consumptioncan be interpretedas

a result of a)         consumption exhibitingexcess sensitivity to transitory income

(/1   > 0),   and b)    agents forecastingon the basis of a more complete

informationmet than the econometrfcian.               In the general case which allows for

omitted information, excess smoothness of consumption is consistentwith

nonstationsry income processes as well as a wide range of stationary income

processes.



Section 3:       Critioue of Campbell and Deaton 119881 and West 119881

        Papers by both West [1988] and Campbell and Deaton [1988] recognized that

the original finding of excess smoothness by Deacon [1987] may have heen an

artifact      attributableto the assumptionthat income was a univariate process.

Both papers use a projection argument along the lines of Hansen and Sargent

[1981] in an attempt to finesse the omitted information issue; both papers

conclude that, even when omitted information is taken into account, Deacon's

original finding of excess smoothnessof consumption is confirmed.                    While

there are important differences in the way in which the two papers                  implement

the projection argument         for dealing with omitted information, both West [1988]

and Campbell and Deaton [1988] base their empirical conclusion that

consumptionto excessively smooth on a discussionwhich establishes                    that the

upper bound, var(Ay), can be econometrically               identifiedif the null

hypothesis (the PIH) is true.

        In this section     I   argue that establishingthat                is identified
                                                                var(y)
                                           —   21 —

under rhe null    hypothesis    is nor germane for establishing an empirical            finding

of excess    — or   insufficienr   — smoerhness       since excess smoorhness could only

be generated by some sort of failure of the PIH.              An attempt to characterize

the way in which consumption departs from the behavior predicted by the

permanent    income hypothesis in terms of excess smoothness           can only succeed if

the relevant upper bound, var(Ay), can be identifiedunder some alternative

hypothesis. For an arbitrary alternativehypothesis (e.g.               ,   for   the list of


simple alternativehypotheses mentioned           in the introduction)                  will
                                                                            var(Lty)

not be identified in the presence of omitted information.

     Thus,    my primary criticism of     the analysis      in both West [1988] and

Campbell    and Deaton [1988] is as follows:            if their objective is to establish

that consumption is "too smooth" relative to permanent income, it is necessary

to show that there is at least one alternativehypothesis,                  consistentwith the

observation that aggregate consumptionviolates               the orthogonality     condition,

for which var(Ay) is identified.          Their analysis does not provide this; it

only establishes the identifiability        of var(Ay) under the null hypothesis.

      This paper supplies the required alternativehypothesis:                    if consumption

is generated by the excess sensitivitymodel               (equation (20)) used in Flavin

                        is identified.   In the Campbell and Deaton paper, the
[1981],    var(y)
univariate income model is replaced by a bivariate autoregressionof income

and saving.      In the bivariate autoregression,          it is important that the second

forecastingvariable is the saving series rather than an arbitrary additional

variable;    Campbell    and Deston use a projection argument to establish that if

the permanent     income hypothesisholds,        the saving series will fully


encapsulate all the information contained in the agent's information set but

not observed by the econoaetrician.            Hence,    if one assumes that the permanent

income hypothesis is true, a bivariate           autoregressionof income and saving

will generate valid inferences about the variance of revisions in permanent

income.      The fortuitous result that generalizing the consumptionhypothesis to

permitm non—zero marginal            propensity     to consume out   ofT   transitory     income does

not destroy the identificationof                           will be recognizedas intuitively
                                             var(Ay)
plausible    if one observes from the savings equation (equation (36)) that under

the alternativehypothesis of excess sensitivity the saving series                         is simply a

resealed version of the saving series which would have been generated under

the null hypothesis:


                      —              —
(36)
                 at       (1-fl)         (i)Etr—O
                                               X 5ry


This property holds for a general process generatinglabor income and is not

specific    to the particular income process used as an example.                     Since allowing

the excess sensitivityparameter to differ from zero merely rescales                         the

saving series, the informationcontent of the saving series is not destroyed

or diluted by this particular generalization of the hypothesis.

       Below,    I work through the Campbell and Deaton algorithm for exploiting a

bivariate autoregressionof income and saving in order to infer var(Ay).

The crucial feature which distinguishes               the analysis below from the original

analysis    presented in Campbell and Deaton is that consumption (and therefore

saving)    is assumed to       be   generated by the excess sensitivityalternative

hypothesis,      while Campbell and Deaton assumed that consumptionwas generated

by the    PIH.     To save space the remainder of the section concentrates on the

analysis of Campbell and Deaton [1988] and does not explicitlywork through

the argument      a second time in the context of West's [1988] formulation of the

proj ection argument.

       Using the income process specified In Section 1, the "structural" model

for income and saving, under the alternative                 hypothesis    (0   /3   C   1), is given

        In Campbell        and Deaton's analysis, the saving variable is exploited to

convey    the   information in the variables not directly observed by the

                           in this example,            Thus we need to solve equation       (39) for

to eliminate current                  from the RES of the saving equation, the bivariate

         Since income, consumption, and saving                  are related    by an accounting

The    consuaption equation implied by the bivariate               autoregressionof income and

saving    has the property that under the null hypothesis                (/3—0),         is

orthogonal    to lagged         and lagged
                                           s.        This, of course, is the famous Hall

[1978] orthogonality condition          for consumption.

        Denote the values of the autoregressive parameters under the null

hypothesis (/3—0) as A(0).        Campbell      and Deaton state that under the permanent

income hypothesis,       the parameters of the bivariate autoregressionwill satisfy

the constraint:

(43)            rS[l 0][I   —5A(o)]      — [1 —1]

Campbell    and Deaton refer to equation (43) as the orthogonality conditinn

because if the income/savingautoregressionsatisfies equation (43), the

implied process for      Ac will be orthognnal to lagged                  and lagged
                                                                                          5      Thus

a statistical teat of the permanent income hypothesis,                   that is, a probability

statement as to whether the data was nr was not generated by the hypothesis,

can be obtained by testing the restriction (43) on the autoregressiveparame-

ters.     Since the parameter restrictions           in equation    (43) simply translate         the

exclusion restrictions in a regressinn of                     nn

equivalentparameter restrictions on the income/saving autoregression,                         the

statistical     test of the null hypothesis provided by Campbell and Deaton is

equivalentto Hall's original test of the nrthogonalitycondition in all

essential    respects:    both rely on the same set of identifying asaumptinns

(notably    the absence        of any   transitory        consumption    disturbance,      or preference

shocks); both are based          on estimationof            reduced form,         rather than structural,


parameters;    both test the implications of the permanent income hypothesis for

the autocovariance      structure         of aggregate income and consumption.

        In addition to the orthogonslity                 condition,    Campbell      and Deaton specify


the "smoothness condition,"               The smoothness condition compares the actual

variance of disturbances to the reduced form consumption equation to the

predicted variance of disturbances to the reduced form consumption equation.

By the accounting identity, the disturbance to a reduced form consumption

equation is just the differencebetween the reduced form disturbances to

income and saving.         The predicted variance of reduced form disturbances to

consumption,    under the null hypothesis, is just the variance of                                     as


generated by the bivariste autoregression.                      Thus to check the smoothness

condition,    Campbell and Deaton compare two quadratic forms in                         fl,   the 2 x 2


covariancematrix of the innovations to the income/saving                             autoregression:

                                          -   rS[l           — SA(O)]         n                —

In equation (44) the left hand side represents the actual variance of

innnvations in consumption and the right hand side represents the predicted

variance,     Ce.,   the variance of changes in permanent                     income.    In implementing

the smoothness condition, Campbell and Deston use the estimated covariance

matrix from the unrestrictedbivsriste sutoregression as an estimate of                                      11,


and the unrestrictedestimates of the autoregressive psrameters,                                A(fl)   to

construct     the inferred variance           of            i.e., the predicted variance               of the

consumptiondisturbances.                Thus their conclusionthat consumption is too

smooth is based on the inequality:

        Note that in constructing the two quadratic                     forms which represent the

 "actual" variance of reduced form disturbances                       to consumption (on the left

hand side) and the "predicted" variance of reduced form disturbances to

consumption,                  also interpreted as an estimate         of the variance of
                                                                                               Ly
 (on   the right hand side), both quadratic forms are constructed
                                                                 using exactly
the same estimmted covariance matrix of reduced form disturbances,                    Il.    Thus

the smoothness condition will be satisfied if the orthogonality condition

(equation     (43)) is satisfied.        Further, as long as the data satisfy the

orthogonality condition, the smoothness condition will hold by construction
for any value of      1).    Thus as a statistical test of the permanent income

hypothesis, a test based on the smoothness condition is just another,                       less

direct, way       of testing   the orthogonality       condition.    Campbell and Deston

recognize and emphasize         this point, stating, "the orthogonalitycondition and

the condition      for smoothness are identical" (page 19).

       If the objective of the Campbell and Deaton paper were
                                                              simply to provide
a statistical test of the hypothesis, their analysis succeeds on this
                                                                      level;
the orthogonalitycondition (equation (43)) and the smoothness condition

(equation (44)) each provide the basis for                 a statisticaltest of the permanent
income hypothesis.          However,   I have argued above that each of the two tests

proposed by Campbell and Deaton are basically transformations                 of the    original

orthogonalitycondition proposed by Hall.                   Further, much of the beauty of

Hall's original formulation of the orthogonslity                condition —   in   terms of the
directnessof the intuition motivating the test, and its ease of execution —

has been lost in the transformations          introduced       by Campbell and     Deaton.

       However,    Campbell and Destort interpret their empirical results as going

beyond the documentation of a statistical rejection of the permanent income

hypothesis to characterize the way in which actual consumptionbehavior

differs froa the behavior predicted by the permanent                income hypothesis.

Concretely,    Campbell and Deaton conclude Section 2 of their paper with the

following   summary of their empirical results:
              In every case, the theoretical innovationvariance is larger than
              the actual innovation variance, and in all but one case, is more
              than twice as large. Consumption is markedly smoother than it
              ought to be if the permanent income theory were correct." (page 21)

my knowledge, the only context in which one can sensibly test for excess

smoothness.    Unlike the permanent income hypothesis, the excess
                                                                  sensitivity
model is consistent with the violation of the
                                              orthogonality restrictions;
unlike arbitrary alternativehypotheses,                 the

excess sensitivity.


     Having established that the Campbell end Deaton method requires, as en

identifying assumption,        that the exact excess sensitivitymodel holds, it

becomes clear that there is an easier and more intuitive method                        of estimsting

var(Ay). In the       exact excess sensitivitymodel (equation                     (26)), the
disturbance term is simply a rescaled version of the series of revisions in

permanent income, LXy, where the scale factor depends only on the excess

sensitivityparameter. /3.            Thus               can be estimated by first obtaining
                                            var(1Xy)
a consistent estimate of        /3   by instrumentalvariables or generalizedmethod of
moments,   then using the estimated parameter,                /3,   to rescale the standard error

of estimate of the    equation.         Obtaining     instrumental       variables    estimates        of
the excess sensitivityparameter was a
                                      primary purpose of Flavin 1198)1 and
11983J, although those papers did not go on to use the estimate of                                to
                                                                                             /3


generate   the corresponding         estimates   of var(ay).°


Section 4; The effect of tyansitoryconsumotion (oreference shocks) on
identification
     The analysis in Section 3 established that if the consumption data is

generated by the excess sensitivityhypothesis,                      as stated in equation (20),

        is identified.          For emphasis, I will henceforth refer to equation
var(ay)
(20) as the "exact excess sensitivity"               model,    since the hypothesis posits that
                                              —   29 —


consumption is an        exact linear combinatien       of transitory income and permanent

income.15       The purpose of this section is to explore the consequences for

identificationof
                         var(Ay) of    generalization        of the excess sensitivitymodel

to allow some sort of disturbance.            One aspect of the results            — the result
that the validity of the projectionargument                  depends criticallyon tha absence

of a preference shock        —was   emphasized by Hansen and Sargent               [1981].     They

state (page 12), "The applicability of both Hall's testing procedures and the

statisticalmodel of the present paper depend criticallyon the consumption

function being       an exact equation,    or equivalently,           on 'transitory consumption'

being identically zero".

       For concreteness,      the disturbance will be labelled               "transitory

consumption".        Oisturbanceswhich break the exact linear relationshipbetween

consumption,      transitory income, and permanent income could arise from sources

other than transitory consumption          — for      example,       measurement error in

consumption,      or complicated dynamics induced by adjustment costs.                     However,   I

find it more convenient to view the disturbance as purely a transitory

consumption tens, rather than attempt to treat the disturbance more generally

as a composite error reflectingdisturbances from several sources.

       With the transitory consumption disturbance added, the excess sensitivity

hypothesis becomes:

                 —           + th' +                                    +

       Transitory consumption,            is assumed to be serially uncorrelated,                and
                                    O,
uncorrelated with current and lagged values of labor income and asset stocks.

Using the accounting identity (22), the structural saving equation is now:

substantially      simplifies the problem and permits an analytical solution.

sdded to a bivariate autoregressionof income and savings               — can be      rejected

at the 5% level.       In half of the specification tests, it can be rejected at

the 1% level as well.          The results of the exclusion tests provide uniform and

clear-cut evidence that the identifyingassumptionsunderlying the exact

excess sensitivitymodel are inconsistent             with the data.

     While the additionalforecastingvariables proved to be statistically

significantpredictors of future income, it is conceivable that they improve

the forecastingability of the bivariate            autoregressionby a margin which is

quantitatively      trivial.     As a check on the effect of the inclusion of

additionalvariables on the forecasting performance of the income

autoregression,    Table 2 reports two goodness—of—fit measures, the R2 and the

Standard Error of Estimate for a univariate income autoregression,                    a bivariate

autoregrasstonof income and saving, and two VARs contsinng variables in

addition to lagged income and saving.              If the exact excess sensitivity

hypothesis were true, the hivariate autoregression of income and saving should

have a higher     2   and lower S.E.E. than a univariate income autoregression,                  but

the two goodness-of—fit      measures should not continue to improve as lagged

values of additional variables, beyond income and saving, are added to the

income equation.       However,   consistent with the         rssults of    the excluaion tests,

the goodness-of-fitmeasures continue to imprevv as the additional forecaating
variables are added to the autoregression. For example, if 4 lags of each
variable are included, the        2
                              rises from a value of 16% for the univsriate

income   autoregression     to 19% for the bivariete          income/saving    autoregression,

2d% for    a 5eariable VAR, and         39% for   a 9-variable     VAR.


      Although var(Ay)       is not identified, strictly speaking, the analytical

discussionof the       consequences of omItted information suggested the
possibility    that even when     an unresolvedomitted informationproblem precludes

the econometrican from observing or inferring the series                    a9,    the

econometrician's      inference    of   var()          might nevertheless   be a   fairly

accurate    approximation to      the true var(Esy). Intuitively, the
econometrcian's       inference    on
                                      var(Ly) turned out to be a fairly robust
estimate of the true      var(y) bscause the economstrician's                 inability     to

observe parts of the agent's information set primarily meant that a shock to

permanent income which agents observed in period                 t,   based on a non—income

variable,    was not registeredby the econometrician until a period or two latet

when the    effect of the   actually showed up in current income. Thus while

though the conditions necessary to establish the identifiability                  of
                                                                                       var(y)
are clearly violated by the data, the inference on               var(y)     based on the

bivariate autoregression     of income and saving may be a serviceable

approximation to the true     var(y).
     As a check on the robustnessof the econometrician's                  inference    on

             as an estimate of                 a range of VAR's incorporating
var(LX)                          var(Ay),
different    information sets was estimated, and the implied series on                      was

calculated for each.      Included    in the set   of VAR's was a univariate

autoregression,     a bivariate autoregression of income and saving, a 5—variable

VAR, and a 9-variableVAR.        Table 3 reports the standard deviation of the

series on         obtained from each VAR.       The estimates of the standard devation

of         are expressed as annualizedquarterly growth rates.

     Since the exclusion tests indicated that the savings variable in the

bivariate autoregression was not successfully encapsulating all of the agent's

information set, the 5-variableVAR and the 9-variableVAR represent strictly

larger effective     informationsets than either the univariate autoregressionor

the bivariate autorgression      of income and        saving.    However,   despite the result

reported earlier that the forecasting performance of the VAR improves

significantly as additionalvariables are included, the associatedestimate                         of

             appears to be fairly insensitive         to the specificationof the
var(á)
information set.      I interpret the apparent robustness of the inferred

             with respect to the specificationof the econometrician's
var(A)
informationset as limited empirical evidence              in support of the conjecture,

made on the basis of the analytical example of the omitted information

problem,     that the econometrician's    inferred      var(y1) may be a reasonable
approximationto the true               var(y)    even though the econometricianhas access

to only a limited subset of the sgentts information                   set.    The evidence of the

rcbustness      of   var() is described            as "lImited" because it is always


possible     that    there    is s VAR   based   on a larger or different set of variables

for which tha implied                       would be substantially                      from the
                                  var()                                    different

estiaates    reported        in Table 3.

       Table 3 also         reports the estimated stsndard deviation of the consuapcion

jur,ovation, ct ,          associated with each VAR.          In no case   does the addition of

additional forecsstingvariables reverse the finding of excess smoothness;                          for

each   of the   VARs       estimated the standard deviation of      exceeds the standard
daviation of     f.          in fact, the disparity betweun V50(fct) snd           vsr()

to widen, if snything, as additional variables are included. This tendency is
a result of the apparent robustness of vsr(Iy) in combination with the fact

that   the measure of consumption smoothness                  (var(Cct)) depends on the

tnforrstion      set; as additional variables arm added to the VAR,                    var(e) must
tither remain constant, or dacline.                From   a   different perspective,        note that

ccccrding    to the propcsed explanation of               excess smoothness,     f     is   a weighted

Conclusions

     The omitted informationproblem        — that     is, the econometric problem which

arises because an econometrician      cannot explicitly     include in an econometric

specification    the complete   set of variables potentially used by agents

complicates    the estimationand interpretation of virtually all empirical

rational    expectations models.    This paper has investigated the implications of

the omitted informationproblem in the context of the empirical phenomenon of

the excess smoothness of consumption proposed by Deacon [1981].

     Ocher authors have shown that, if the null hypothesis is true, in mauy

cases the omitted informationproblem can be completely finessed by using a

projection argument.      Under this projection argument, the econometricianneed

not observe the agent's complete information set, since the agent's behavior

reveals the appropriate     summary measure of the omitted variables in an

endogenous signaling variable      — in    the consumptioncase,     the signaling

7ariable uculd be consumption,      or, equivalently,     saving.   While the result

that the omitted informationproblem can be completely avoided when the null

hypothesis     is true is an extremely    useful result for some purposes     — such as
                                                     or for forecastingwhen the null
constructingtests of the null hypothesis,

hypothesis is not rejected by the data         — these   results are not immediately

useful for characterizing       the way in which observed    consumption behavior

differs from the behavior predicted by the PIH.           A substantial part of the

analysis,     both analytical and empirical,     is devoted to studying the

implications     of the omitted information problem under several different         types

of departures from the null hypothesis.

      In the context of the consumptioncase, the paper does identify an

alternativehypothesis      — the exact     excess sensitivity hypothesis    — for which
the signaling variable     (ia.     the consumption    or saving series) correctly
                                             —   41 —

          the agent's
encapsulates                     information set, despite the non-optimalbehavior of


agents.     However,   rhis airerative hypothesis is a highly restrittivecase; for

an arbitrary alternativehypothesis,           the omitted information problem cannot       be

avoided.     In   particular,    the mere addition of a stochastic error term, such as

a preference shock, in the behavioralmodel is sufficient to contaminate the

informationdontent of the signaling variable, with the result that the

                  of omitted information are nor fully eliminated.          Since the
consequences

effect of the disturbance is to weaken but not fully eradicate the information

content of the signal,          the applicationof the projection arguaent      in the

presence of a stochasticdisturbancein some cases will partially eliminate

the consequences       of the    omitted information.

     These additional results on the consequences of omitted informationunder

alternatives      to the null hypothesis do not reverse the finding reported

earlier    by Deaton    [1987], West [1988], and Campbell        and Deaton [1988], that

consumption is "too smooth" in the sense that the variance of reduced form

disturbances      to consumption is exceeded by the variance of revisions in

permanent    income.    Although the paper tentativelyconcurs with the conclusion

of previous authors that the "excess smoothness"              of consumption is a valid

characterization       of the data, this endorsement is a qualified one and is based

on a logically distinct line of reasoning.

     While the analytical and empirical investigation of the omitted

informationproblem under various departures from the null hypothesisdoes not

reverse the direction of the inequality,            it does dramatically change the

economic    interpretationof the finding.           The paper shows that the naive

econometricianwho fails to fully take into account the effects of omitted

information will incorrectly conclude that the empirical              finding of excess

smoothness of consumption implies that the income process is nonatationary.

By contrast, with a more thorough understandingof the omitted information

problem,     the finding of excess smoothness           of consumption is very easily

     For conformitywith the empirical work in Campbell and Deaton [1988], the
labor income and saving data were the same series used in that paper. These
series were:

          — disposablelabor             income, seasonally adjusted,      real, per capita


     yt —     disposable         total income, seasonally adjusted, real, per capita

[1988], were originallyconstructed for use in Blinder and Deaton [1985], and
incorporate several adjustments to the standard NIPA concepts. As described
by Campbell [1987] , these adjustments include:
     1) The 1975 tax cut is removed from the disposable income series.
     2) Interest payment flows from consumers to business are subtracted from
the NIPA disposable income series.
      3) Personal non—tax payments to state and local governments are
                                                                      added to
both disposable income and consumption, on the grounds that they resemble
payment for goods and services more than taxes (e.g. , state college tuition,
etc.).
     4) All series are deflated by total population and by a consumer spending
deflator.
      5) Disposable total income is broken down into disposable labor income
and disposable capital income. In addition to using any allocations of tax
payments to capital or labor income which are explicit in the NIPA accounts,
                                                                     to labor
proprietor's income and personal income tax payments are attributed
and capital income according to their factor shares; social insurance payments
are attributed to labor income. For wore documentation on the construction of
these three variables, the reader is referred to Blinder and Deaton [1985].

     Dther variables used in the empirical work were constructed as:

'Shiller [1972] showed thet, under the null hypothesis, if the econometrician
is forecastingshort rates on the basis of an incomplete informationset
                                                       —                   —
for example, on the basis of lagged short rates only    the implied restric-
tion between the parameters of the short rate autoregressionand the distrib-
uted lag of the long rate on lagged short rates was not invalidatedby the
fact that agents are forecasting on the basia of a larger informationset than
the econometrician.  In fact, the discrepancybetween the agent's and econo—
metrician's informationsets was a solution rather than a problem, since the
discrepancyprovided an explanationfor the unavoidable finding that a regres-
sion of the long rate on lagged short rates does not generate an R2 of 1.
2For an alternativeexplanationof the excess smoothness phenomenon, see
Christiano [1987]. In that paper, Christiano relaxes the constant interest
rate assumption and shows that relativelymodest interest rate variability may
explain a quantitatively important degree of consumptionsmoothing.

consumption variability probably makes little difference in practice; even
though the hypothesis that consumptionis a random walk can be statistically
rejected, the variance of the disturbances to a VAR consumption equation and
the variance of the first difference of consumptionare not grossly different
in magnitude.
41n the context of the permanent income hypothesis (i.e. , for the special rase
in which the excess sensitivity parameter, /3, is set to zero), Campbell
[1987] has referred to equation (23) as the "saving for a rainy day" equation.
5For empirical estimates of /3 in this ballpark, see Flavin [1981], Hayashi
[1982], Flavin [1983]. or Campbell and Mankiw [l987b].
t1'heanalysis in this paper does not appear 100% compatiblewith the
derivations in Campbell and Deaton [1988] because they derive, and work with,
a log—linearapproximation to the linear permanent income model used in Flavin
[1981]. The justification given by Campbell and Deaton for using the log
linearization is that a) they perceive a time trend in the variance of
innovations to                     and b) they favor, on a priori grounds,
               Aye. empirically,
proportional rather than linear growth. However, in order to state the model
in terms of log differences, various approximations need to be made, including
not only an assumption that the real interest rate exceeds the mean growth

rate of labor income, r > /4, but further, that _!__2— 1. If, in order to state

the consumption model in log  linear form it is necessary to approximate the
growth rate of income as zero, this seriously undermines the original
justification  for the log linear model, in my view.   For this reason, I have
not followed Campbell and Deaton in using their log linearization, and have
instead retained the linear version of the model.    The choice of linear versus
log linear modeling does noi affect any of the basic issues.
TUnder complete Keynesian behavior (/3—1), the saving series would be
identicallyzero,       0, with the result that data on saving provides no
informationconcerning variables available to agents but unobserved by the

consistentwith their view of income as containinga unit root. Despite the
