                 Hours Restrictions and Labor Supply



                              ABSTRACT


     This study presents a model of labor supply in which individuals may
face constraints on their choice of work hours, and analyzes the
sensitivity of parameter estimates and policy conclusions to the usual
assumption of unrestricted choice. We set up the labor supply decision as
a discrete choice problem, where each worker faces a finite number of
employment opportunities, each offering fixed hours of work. The
distribution from which these are drawn, as well as the number of draws, is
estimated along with the behavioral parameters of individual labor supply.
The standard model with unconstrained hours appears as a special case where
the number of draws approaches infinity. We estimate the mean absolute
difference between desired and actual work hours to be about ten hours per
week. The results strongly support the notion that hours choices are
constrained, and suggest that models which ignore restrictions on hours
worked may yield biased estimates of the wage elasticity of desired hours.
Further, we suggest that analysis of policies such as income transfers and
the flat rate tax which do not consider their effects on the distribution
of hours offered may be very misleading.

I. Introduction


      Most jobs appear to be associated with a fixed number of hours which

must be worked each week, as well as a fixed wage or salary. The    standard
9 to 5 day, five days a week, is the most obvious example, but other

regular shifts or office hours leave most workers with very little

discretion regarding hours supplied in the short run. At first glance,

this common observation is inconsistent with the textbook model of the

labor supply decision, in which each individual freely chooses the number

of hours he will work, taking as given a fixed wage per hour. However, if

a   variety of hours packages are costlessly available, workers may simply

choose those which 'impose' the desired number of hours.     Enough mobility

between jobs will thus preserve the simple model even if hours within each

job are completely inflexible. Observed hours will always be equal to

desired hours.    If workers are    perfectly   mobile between jobs, or have

incomplete information regarding job opportunities, they may not choose

their hours from the entire market distribution of jobs. In this case,

models which assume that hours worked are determined by preferences only

will be misspecified, and mayproduce biased estiriates of labor supply

elasticities. Further, policy analysis which considers the individual's

response to tax and transfer changes, but does not take account of their

effect on the constraints individuals face, may be very misleading.

      In recent years, labor supply studies have appeared which depart from

the standard framework to allow for various types of constraints on hours



                                       1
choices. A major impetus to this development has been the observation that

cross—sectional variation in hours worked is explained very poorly by

standard labor supply models. Inconveniently, even the simplest of hours

regressions is seldom reported with a measure of goodness—of—fit, but

studies reported in Cain and Watts (1973), such as those by Hall and by

Boskin, typically report a standard error of about 1000 hours per year for

a cross—section of white husbands.

     A glance at the actual distribution of hours worked by a sample of

prime—age married men suggests that its peculiar shape makes an important

contribution to this poor fit.       It also suggests that some form of

constraint on hours choices might be a plausible addition to the model.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of average weekly hours during 1972 for a

group of 18 to 59 year old married men from the Denver Income Maintenance

Experiment (DIME) sample. This is a low—income sample, but the hours

distribution is typical of that which would be observed for a more

representative sample. The most obvious characteristics of this
distribution are the extreme peak at 40 hours per week and the asymmetry

around this peak. These features are even more pronounced in a
distribution of hours worked in one month.

     A distribution of desired hours with this shape would be difficult to

produce using a standard model of labor supply and customary assumptions

about the distribution of unobservable worker characteristics. Given the

preponderance of jobs between 36 and 40 hours, men who work an average of

26—35 hours per week are unusually scarce.        In general, predicted
distributions based on wages, non—labor income and demographic variables

are smooth and unimodal, and fit the actual distribution very poorly.

Superimposed on the actual distribution inFigure 1 is adistributionof

     How can we explain the paucity of observations at 30 hours per week?

It seems likely to us that constraints have been misspecified in the

standard model, and that jobs offering an average of 30 hours per week are

difficult or costly to come by. This conjecture we intend to explore by

specifying constraints of a general form and building them into the model.

In doing so, we of necessity neglect other possible explanations. One is

misreporting; many people may have worked 30 hours but reported 40 due to

conventional attitudes about what constitutes a 'full—time' job. This is

unlikely to provide more than a partial explanation, since the phenomenon

appears invariant to the type of survey instrument used. It is also not

clear that misreporting should be asymmetric around 40 hours. A second

possibility is that, despite the poor fit of conventional models, very few

people wanted to work 30 hours. This suggests that models with more

flexible functional forms and/or more elaborate distributions for

unobserved components of tastes should be estimated.

     One simple way of explaining why workers are seldom observed to work

30 hours per week is to assert that jobs offering 30 hours are difficult to

find. That is, workers face a limited choice of hours from a market

distribution (so that desired hours need not equal actual hours) and some

hours choices, seldomoffered by firms, are scarce. Implicit in this is

the notion that jobs are associated with fixed hours. If there are

significant fixed costs in set—up, hiring and training, firms may not be

indifferent regarding the hours worked by employees. Thus, firms may offer

tied sales of wages and hours and workers will choose their preferred




                                      4
package from among those offered. The result will be a market distribution

of wage—hours packages which need not be uniform over hours.2 The actual

distribution of offered hours will thus take into account workers'

preferences, but may still act as a constraint on the individual job

searcher.

     We construct a model of labor supply with hours restrictions of a very

simple, but very general form, at the cost of assuming that wages are

constant over hours. At any point in time, each individual can choose from

among a finite set of jobs offering fixed hours. These jobs have been

drawn at random from a market distribution which is the same for everyone

in the sample. Observed hours will correspond to the job which yields

highest utility, where the alternative of not working at all is always

available. A discrete choice between a limited number of jobs seems a

reasonable but parsimonious representation of actual constraints on hours

worked. The polar cases of no constraints on hours worked and completely

exogenous hours are easily nested within the general case as infinite

available jobs or only one available job, respectively.

     Estimating this model should generate two results of interest. The

first is a measure of the sensitivity of labor supply parameter estimates

and behavioral predictions to the assumption that there are no constraints

on the hours choices of individual workers. The second is an estimate of

the degree of constraint experienced by individuals in their hours worked,

in terms of the expected discrepancybetweendesired hours and the 'best'

value of offered hours.

    Previous studies have examined the effects of direct hours constraints

on labor supply decisions, but the specification of these constraints has




                                      5
in general been very restrictive. For example, there exists a large

literature focusing on 'take—it—or—leave—it' choices between the standard

work week or not working at all. Citations can be found in lleckman,

Kill ingsworth,   and MaCurdy (1981) and a survey   in   Penman (1969). Closely
related are studies by Gustman and Steinmeier (1984) which allow potential
retirees   a choice between full—time work at a high wage, part—time work at

a lower wage, or full retirement. The possible presence of quantity

constraints on hours worked has received a great deal of attention in

recent years, but tests for such constraints have contrasted the extreme

cases of exogenous hours and free choice of hours, without considering the

possibility of a discrete choice between several jobs with different hours.

For example, see Ashenfelter (1980), Deaton and Muellbauer (1981), 11am

(1982), Blundell and Walker (1982), and Lundberg (1985). Most closely

related to the approach we have taken in this paper are models in which

each individual faces a stochastic lower bound on hours worked.4 Moffitt

(1982) estimates such a model using income maintenance experiment data. At

the means of the independent variables, the estimated value of minimum

hours was 39 hours per week, implying that the 'vast majority' of the

sample was constrained in its hours choice. This result is perhaps not

surprising given the observed distribution of hours, but it suggests to us

that a discrete choice approach to hours constraints may give a more

complete picture of the process generating that distribution.5

     The next section presents in detail the model tobe estimated, and

Section Ill derives the likelihood function. Section IV describes the data

and presents the results for the conventional and the constrained labor

supply models. Section V contains some conclusions and outlines possible

extensions.

II. The Model


     There are many possible ways of representing a restricted choice of

hours in a labor supply model, from a pure rationing approach to an

explicitly dynamic search model in which information about and mobility

between jobs is costly. The approach we take is, in the interests of

computational feasibility, a compromise between the ad hoc assumption of

exogenous hours, and a highly structured choice model. e represent the

worker's choice as a static one between a limited number of job offers. By

suppressing the time dimension, we do not wish to suggest that workers are

immobile during the month or year we take as a time frame, but that

observed choices may usefully be treated 'as if' they were the outcome of a

static decision as represented in Figure 2.

This worker has drawn three job offers with fixed hours h1, 112. h3 from the

market distribution and is always able to work zero hours and receive only

non—labor income at point D. None of these correspond to desired hours,

h. Observed hours will be determined by that one of the feasible points

(A, B, C, and D) which yields the highest level of utility (in this case

B —> h2).

     Estimating a labor supply model with constraints on hours places very

heavy demands on the available data, which consist of observed wage—hours

combinations and a vector of personal characteristics for a cross—section

of workers. Since the worker chooses the utility—maximizing draw from a

discrete set of alternatives, we need to specify preferences completely,

rather than just a labor supply function. In addition to the parameters of

the utility function, the number of job offers drawn and the shape of the

market offer distribution must be estimated. Identification of these three

sets of parameters requires that some restrictions be imposed on the model.


A.   The Market Distribution of Offered Hours


     On the demand side, we begin with the assumption that employers offer

jobs with fixed hours of work. Rather than explicitly modelling the

availability of jobs with different hours, we will attempt to estimate the

distribution in an essentially unrestricted form. The standard assumption

that wages are equal at all hours of work is maintained.

     Workers face a limited choice from a market distribution of employment

opportunities: N job offers, each associated with a fixed number of hours,

drawn randomly from a discrete distribution.6 The probability that any job




                                      8
drawnfrom the distributionrequires hhours of work perweek is the same

for all workers, and is specified as

                           H
(1)        P(h) =
                    nh"
                          j=1


where the ii's are a vector of constants describing the frequency of offers

for each integer value of hours worked per week and II is maximum hours. In

practice, the EL's will be set equal over some ranges of hours, to reduce

the number of parameters which must be estimated. This step function for

the hours distribution was chosen rather than a more standard parametric

form, since we do not wish to place any a priori restrictions on the shape

of the offer distribution. The option of voluntarily working zero hours. is

available to all workers, even if this is not one of the offers drawn.


B.    Number of Job Offers


      Two different specifications for the number of job offers, N, will be

considered. The first specification treats N as random, drawn by each

individual from a binomial distribution with a fixed maximum, and estimates

the single parameter of this distribution. For example, if we set the

maximum possible job offers at 10, the probability that an individual will

receive N offers will be


          p(N+1) =    {    J N(1_)9_N   for N0,...,9
                      \ N/



The estimated value of p will thus irrply probabilities for integer values

of N, with a mean of 9p+l offers.




                                        9
      To test the distributional assumption that N is binomial, wc also

estimate a second specification in which the probabilities for different

numbers of job offers vithin a range are allowed to vary freely, with no

distributional form imposed.


C.    Preferences


      Workers wish to supply labor so as to maximize utility, which is a

function of the number of hours worked and consumption. Worker i can

expect to receive from any employer a wage w, so his utility in a job

offering h1 hours and yielding consumption equal to c will be


                               Yl
                                    —

where     is person i's nonlabor income and consumption is equal to the sum

of labor and nonlabor income. The parameters 0 <                  < 1 and 2 > 1 are

common to all workers, as is A > 0.            To allow for variation in individual

preferences, the parameters B ae replaced by




The vector X contains observed individual characteristics, such as age and

number of children, which might be expected to capture differences in

III. Estimation


      The model described above was estimated using maximum likelihood

methods.     If the unobserved components of tastes,              were known, a

complete preference ordering of all possible job offers could be
constructed. In this case, the likelihood of observing person i choosing

to work h1 hours is the probability that at least one job offering h was

drawn from the market distribution, and that no other offers were preferred

to h1. For clarity of exposition, we first derive the likelihood terni for

an individual conditional on the value of a1, then treat the case where we

know only the population density of a.

      For each individual i we can define a set of hours           which yield a

level of utility less than or equal to the utility derived from observed

hours h1.


              =   [j:    U1(c1(j),j) < U1(c(h1)1h1) ,   j=O,l,...,E).

      Recalling that P(h1) is the probability that a single draw will

generate an offer of h1 hours, the probability that one draw will yield an

offer which is not preferred to oserved hours will be


                          P(k)
                  hal1


Q1 is a function of individual preferences and the unobservable c through

the set J. The likelihood of observing h1 hours when the number of offers

drawn is N is simply the probability that all N offers were equal to or not

preferred to h1, and that at least one offer was h1, or


(3)         [Q)N * [1 — (1 —     P(h)IQ1)N].


                                         11
      There is one special case, since the option of not working is always

available. If we define an index function


             V(h) = (0 if h = 0
                       1 otherwise


then the full likelihood can be written


                                                                          V(h.)
                                                                             1
(4)          L(h1: X11Y1,w1c1) =      [Q]N    *   [1 — (1 —   P(h)/Q)N1

      In   practice c is unobservable. The set of preferred hours for each

individual will be a function of the unobservable component of preferences,

so in general constructing the likelihood function will involve integrating

over the distribution of .            We   assume that the aj's are i.i.d. normal

random variables and rewrite the likelihood as


                                                                                    V( h.)
(5)          L(h:   X11Y1w1) =   J         o()[Q(8)]N *       [1_(1_P(h1)/Q1(e)N}
                                                                                        1




where 0(c)    is   the normal density with variance c.

      Considering only integer values of hours1 the set of hours not

preferred to h1 becomes a step function in c. Step changes occur at

values of c where person i is indifferent between working h1 hours and some

other value of hours worked, j. Denoting this vector of values as c, we

can define          as the set of hours not preferred to h1 when c takes on the

value          and rewrite (5)   as

        The 's are summed over values of j from one to maximum hours per

week, which in practice is set at 75, and the second term in (6) picks up

the residual tail of the a distribution. The third term, which is non—zero

only when observed hours are zero, is the probability that no work is

preferred to all jobs with positive hours, For reasonable values of the

parameters         and '2 the values                      are monotonic in i. The value of the

       We   wish to treat N, the number of job offers, as a random variable,

evaluating the probability of drawing each possible integer value of N and

summing over these probabilities times the value of the likelihood in (6).

The maximum number of job offers is set at ten, on the basis of preliminary

results. The appropriate likelihood in this case is

       Equality constraints are imposed on p's (parameters of the market

distribution of hours) for groups of values for hours worked. For example,

we assume that the probabilities of drawing offers of from one to 15 hours

are equal. This distribution is estimated with nine steps, 1—15, 16—25, 26—

35, 36—39, 40, 41—45, 46—55, 56—65, and 66—75 hours per week. A subsequent

version of the model allowing more steps failed to rej,cct this restriction.

The parameter for the first group of hours is normalized so that the

probabilitiessumtoone. Oncparameteroftheutilityfunctionmustbe
normalized, since it is defined only up to a positive monotonic
transformation. We have set the parameter A in the income term equal to

1.0.

      As in a conventional labor supply model, preference parameters are in

essence identifiedby the joint distributionof hours, wages, and other

individual characteristics. The variance of the distribution of
unobservables is to a large extent determined by the general goodness—of—

fit between the predicted desired hours and the actual distribution of

hours. The innovation here is that the pattern of discrepancies between

the 'best' predicted distribution and actual hours is employed to identify

the constraints faced by the workers, represented by the shape of the offer

distribution and the number of draws allowed. Note that in order to

describe the degree of constraint faced by individuals, both the estimated

distribution of N and the offer distribution must be taken into account,

and the expected deviation between desired and actual hours will vary over

individuals with different characteristics.


IV,   Results


      A standard labor supply model and two versions of the model described

above have been estimated on a sample of 555 married men from the control

group of the Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, This sample is

described in detail in the Appendix. Model 1 is a standard labor supply

model where all variation in hours is attributed to variation in tastes.

The utility function in (2) was used, with the unobserved components of

tastes (g1's) assumed tobe normally distributed. The parameters of the

utility function and the variance of e were estimated by maximum
likelihood.     Model 2 includes restrictions on employment opportunities of

the type described in Section II, treating N as a randor variable with a

binomial distribution over the sample. Model 3 relaxes this distributional




                                      15
assumption, and allows the probabilities of receiving from one to ten

offers to vary freely.8


A.   Preferences and Desired Hours


     Model 1 was estimated so that the bias in estimated preference

parameters resulting from ignoring hours constraints could be assessed.

Misspecification of the budget constraint has been demonstrated tobe a

serious problem for the estimationof labor supply functions. Ignoring

deviations from the standard linear budget constraint between leisure and

income, such as fixed costs of working, tax schedules, etc., can severely

bias estimates of preference parameters, and yield misleading predictions

regarding changes in policy.9

     The estimated parameters for our 'no hours constraint' Model 1 are

presented in Table 1. The population—constant preference parameters are

estimated with some precision, bat   individual   characteristics other than

wage and non—labor income have little explanatory power. Table 2 reports

income elasticities for the mean wage rate, and for wages one standard

deviation above and below the mean (all other variables are held at sample

means).   These estimates appear quite reasonable——the income elasticities

and the implied compensated wage elasticities have theoretically correct

signs——though the wage elasticities are rather high for a sample of married

men. This, however, is quite typical of the DIME sample.

     Column 2 of Table 1 reports the parameter estimates for Model 2, in

which N is random and distributed binomially. Preliminary estimates with

non—randomNsuggested that 10 job offers wouldbe a reasonable raaximum.

The estimated value of p indicates that the mean number of job offers is




                                     16
about three)0 To determine an appropriate upper bound for N, we
experimented with several different values. In all cases, it was possible

to reject the hypothesis that the average number of jobs is greater than 5.

The wage elasticities implied by Model 2 are much smaller than the

estimates from Model 1 and the variance of the distribution of the

unobservable has also decreased. Together, these differences imply that

Model 2, which allows for restricted hours choices, predicts a distribution

of desired hours which has a considerably smaller variance over the sample

than does the standard model.

     Model 3, which removes the binomial restriction on the distribution of

N, generates results which are even more dramatic in this respect, since

the values of the uncompensated wage elasticity falls in half again. Note

from Table 1, however, that Model 2 cannot be rejected as a restriction on

Model 3. The predicted probabilities for different values of N are similar

to those generated by Model 2 (see Table 3), but were very imprecisely

estimated.


B.   The Market Distribution of Offered Hours


     Table 4 shows the offer distributions generated by Models 2 and 3, and

contrasts them with the actual distribution of hours worked. The main

discrepancies are a large number of offers in the 1—15 hour range which are

seldom accepted, and a shortage of offers over 40 hours per week.


C.   Constraints on Hours Worked


     The extent to which an individual is constrained in his choice of

hours depends upon both the number of jobs available to him, and the

distribution of offered hours, relative to desired hours. A calculation of

the discrepancy between desired and actual hours for each man in our sample

requires knowledge, not only of the value of N and the offered hours drawn

by each, but also the value of a, the unobserved component of preferences.

We can, however, calcuiate the expected value of this discrepancy for an

individual with given observed characteristics, since we have estimated the

distributions for a, N, and offered hours.

    To compute the distribution of desired hours and the difference

between desired and actual hours of work we use Monte Carlo techniques. We

draw for each individual a value for a from a normal distribution, then use

the estimateddistributions ofNto choose a randomnumberof job offers.

The appropriate number of offers are drawn randomly from the offer

distribution, and the estimated utility parameters are used to calculate

the utility asscciated with each offer. The average over the sample of the

highest—utility jobs offer yields the value for constrained hours reported

in Table 5. These values are, of course, close to the mean of actual

hours, but considerablybelow our predictions of desired hours for both

Model 2 and Model 3. The average man in our sample receives three job

offers, and is working several hours a week less than he would like because

offers in the most preferred 45—50 hour range are scarce. The average

absolute deviation between desired and actual hours is from 10 to 12 hours

per week. This is a sizable but, we believe, plausible measure of the

extent to which workers are constrained.

    Figure 3 reproduces the patterns of predicted desired hours (smooth

and symmetric), predicted offered hours (a step function with a peak at 40

and excess weight in the lower tail), and actual hours. Desired and

offered hours are calculated using parameter estimates from Model 3.

Figure 4 shows the distribution of the deviation between desired and actual



                                     21
hours. Note that most of the sample are working fewer hours than they

would prefer.

      The most important application for estimates of individual labor

supply response is the analysis of welfare and production effects of

changes in the tax and transfer system. The results presented in Table 5

suggest that there are at least two serious problems with the standard

approach to such policy analysis. First, estimates of the elasticity of

desired labor supply with respect to the tax rate are very sensitive to the

assumption of no hours constraints. For the two models presented here the

estimated effects of both the standard income tax and a flat rate tax with

the same average tax rate are considerably smaller when we allow for hours

constraints.

      Second, if we assume that the distribution of offered hours does not

shift in response to a change in the tax code, the predicted changes in

actual hours are considerably smaller than changes in desired hours. These

discrepancies suggest that traditional labor supply models, which ignore

hours constraints, are likely to overestimate tax responses.          This

overestimation results from biased utility parameters due to
misspecification and from ignoring the direct effect of restricted hours.

However, the assumption that the distribution of offered hours does not

change is an untenable one. It is possible that even a small change in the

tax structure could produce a large change in the distribution of offered

hours. Thus any analysis which incorporates only the supply response to a

tax change niayproduce significant over— orunder—estiriates    of the true

response in the presence of restricted hours choice.

D.   Specification Tests


     Since DIME is a low income sample, there is likely to be some concern

over the assumption that e, the unobserved component of utility, is

distributed normally, rather than according to some truncated or skewed

distribution. To check for rnisspecification of the distribution of ewe

apply a test proposed by Ruud (1981), in which the argument of the normal

density function is replaced by a polynomial in that argument. In

practice, we replace (e) with (c+C2c2+C33+C4e4+C5c5) in Model 3.
Maximization of the likelihood function with all C's held equal to zero

generates a Lagrange multiplier statistic which is distributed           The

value was 6.18, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis of normality for a.

     The restriction that the market distribution of offered hours is a 9—

step function was also tested, by estimating a model with 17 steps. The

      test statistic was 11.8 (compared to a 90 percent critical value of

13.4), so we fail to reject our distributional assumption for the i's.


V.   Conclusions

     The results presented in this paper call into question policy analysis

based on labor supply models which assume that workers may freely choose

how much they work. For example, models which allow for the possibility of

hours constraints yield very different estimates of the effects of tax

changes on desired hours of work. Further, since our results suggest that

hours constraints have a significant impact on hours worked, the
possibility that changes in the distribution of available hours could occur

in response to changes in the tax or transfer system becomes important. To

correctly analyze the effects of such changes, we must model not only the




                                     26
 labor supply decision but also labor demand, and in particular the process

 determining the distribution of available hours of work.

      One approach to incorporating hours constraints in an empirical labor

 supply model is presented in this paper. The specification for hours

 constraints we use is a fairly general one. Each worker chooses from among

 a finite set of jobs offering fixed hours, which have been drawn at random

from a market distribution. ¶e estimate the mean number of job offers

received to be about three, and the mean absolute difference between

desired and observed hours to be ten hours per week. For this sample,

therefore, hours choices appear to be significantly constrained, with a

large proportion of the sample choosing one of the abundant 40—hour jobs.

It is noteworthy that, since mean desired hours are estimated to be 47.2

hours per week, most individuals are working less than they wish.

     Our representation of hours constraints is a stylized one, but gives

apparently sensible results and is suggestive of the way in which future

research might proceed. The estimates of individual disequilibrium and of

wage and income elasticities are, of course, conditional upon our

specification for preferences and the distribution of offered hours.

flowever, specification tests failed to reject our assumptions that the

unobservable component is normally distributed and that the offer
distribution can be represented as a step function with nine steps.

Fruitful extensions to the model presented here might include
experimentation with other functional forms for utility or attempts to

incorporate   tied wage—hours offers, which are impl iod by a market
equilibrium involving hours restrictions.
     Most of the individual variation in hours worked is left unexplained

by simple models of unconstrained labor supply. There is a fundamental



                                     27
indeterminacy here——we are unable todistingu.ishwithcertaintybetween

unobserved components of preferences and unobserved constraints. However,

in markets where we have some reason to suspect that behavior may be

constrained in the short run, it seems to us good policy to operate on both

fronts simultaneously. Building hours constraints into a labor supply

model explicitly is a first step in one direction; refining our
specification of preferences is a desirable continuation in the other. In

addition, we must begin the task of modelling the demand side of hours

constraints.

1.   The independent variables were the wage rate, non—labor income, age,

      education, and number of children. The value of R2 was less than

      0.03. The distribution was constructed by adding a normal random

      variable, with a standard error equal to the s.e.e. for the estimated

      equation, to the predicted value for each of the 555   workers   in our

      sample.

2. The derivation of this sort of equilibrium is presented in S. Rosen

      (1974) and, in the particular context of hours worked and wages, in

      Lewis.

3. Burtless and Hausman (1978) allow for differences betweenworkers'

      desired and actual hours worked, but require those deviations to have

      a normal distribution and to be independent of observed worker charac-

      teristics. Given the discussion above, we would expect the
      distribution to be decidedly non—normal and deviations to be

      correlated with a worker's desired hours, which is a function of

      observed characteristics.

4.   Closely related are models incorporating fixed costs of v7orking, such

      as those of Cogan (1980, 1981) and Hausman (1980).

5.   We   are not aware of any attempts to estimate labor supply models

      incorporating in a general way both restricted choice over the market

      distribution of offered job packages and the relationship between

     wages and hours within packages. Indeed, estimation of such a model

      does not at present seem feasible. Gustman and Steirimeier (1984)

      allow for tied wage—hours offers, but permit a choice between only two

     packages. Estimates of the market equilibrium wage—hours locus by




                                      29
     Rosen (1976) and   Lundberg (1984)   assume that individuals may choose
     freely from the entire distribution of offered packages.
6. These should be interpreted, not as individual jobs in the literal
     sense, but as employment opportunities which may include multiple jobs
     with   non—conflicting hours.

7.   Based on some preliminary estimates of the unconstrained model,

      individual differences in preferences have been incorporated in the

     coefficient of the hours term, though any of the parameters might be

      allowed to vary over individuals.

8.   The possibility of zero offers, and thus involuntary unemployment, has

     been excluded from this version, which uses annual hours and includes

     no non—workers.    It has, however, been included in versions employing

     monthly hours, with no significant change in the conclusions.

9.   For example, see Cogan (1980, 1981) and Hausman (1980) for the effects

     of incorporating fixed costs to the worker, and Hausman (1983) for a

     comprehensive discussion of empirical studies of labor supply with

     taxation.

10. The expected number of job offers is 1 +     9"p,   since we do not cons i—

     der the possibility of receiving no job offers.

Data

       A sample of 555 married men from the control group of the Denver

Income Maintenance Experiment (DIME) has been used for of this study. Work

experience during 1972 is the relevant measure of hours, but a time series

of up to 48 months of data for each individual is also available. Monthly

information includes total hours worked at all jobs, straight—time hourly

wage on each job, income received from all other sources (including

earnings of other family members and transfer payments——support payments

from DIME were not received by this group), and number of children under 16

years of age in the household.        Table A.l presents some important

characteristics of this sample, and more information can be found in

Lundberg (1981).

       All men in this sample are between the ages of 18 and 59. The only

individuals excluded from the available population were 10 individuals for

whom education data were missing, and 15 who did not work at all during

1972 (the   latter have been included in   the distributions in Figures 1 and

2).   Monthly data for September 1972 were used in a preliminary version of
this model. The inclusion of individuals who did not work during this
month did not appear to affect the estimated degree of constraint.

       The DIME data possess several advantages for this type of analysis,

such as excellent monthly information on hours and separate questions for

the wage rate and monthly income. A possible disadvantage arises from the

selection criteria applied to yield a low—income control group for the

experiment——the sample is not representative of the entire population and

this may cause problems in making distributional assumptions for the



                                      33
unobserved element of preferences (but see the results of a specification

test in IV.D), as well as limiting the generality of results regarding the

degree of hours constraints. Estimates from this sample, however, benefit

from higher quality data than are available elsewhere, and provide a useful

starting point for applications to more representative samples.
