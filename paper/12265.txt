                                           ABSTRACT

This paper evaluates the effects of population aging and fiscal policies on national saving in Korean
situation. For the prediction of the national savings rate of Korea for the next several decades, we
employ a life-cycle model, which incorporates the generational accounting approach needed to assess
the distribution of fiscal burden across generations. We found that the rapid population aging and
long-term budgetary imbalance will substantially lower the national savings rate in Korea. A
sensitivity analysis based on an alternative model, an altruistic family model, shows that these
predictions are robust to the specification of altruism among generations. In addition, the estimation
results of consumption functions with respect to various kinds of wealth suggest that the
annuitization of wealth due to maturing of public pensions and introduction of reverse annuity
mortgage is likely to further decrease the savings rate in the future.

1. Introduction

  While the current proportion of old-age population of Korea is lower than other OECD
countries, the speed of population aging is very high. Even though the proportion of the
population aged 65 and older was 7.2% as of 2000, much lower than the developed countries,
the proportion is projected to increase to 23.1% in 2030, almost the same as their projected
average. More old-age dependents relative to workers resulting from population aging
suggest the likelihood of more consumption relative to income and, therefore, less national
saving. Increase in the old-age dependency ratio substantially affects the fiscal policies. The
government expenditure such as public pension benefits and medical insurance benefits will
increase rapidly as the population is aging. Public assistance program for the low-income
classes is also expected to increase since the poverty rate for old-age population is higher
than that of working ages in Korea. On the other hand, the decrease in working population
will restrict the tax base of the future. As a result, the population aging will increase the fiscal
burden of future generations, therefore, decrease resource available for them, which suggests
less saving in the future.
   The long-term budgetary imbalance in Korea will also contribute to the future savings
reduction through the increase in fiscal burden of future generations. Even though the
consolidated budget balance at present maintains surplus, the budget balance will turn deficit
in the near future and the magnitude of the deficit will rapidly rise in the future if Korean
government maintains the current fiscal policies. In particular, long-term budgetary
imbalance of public pensions due to too generous promised level of pension benefits
compared with pension contributions, and prospective increase in Medical Insurance benefits,
and the resistance to increase in social insurance contributions, will deteriorate the long-term
budgetary imbalance. Therefore, the current fiscal stance of Korean government will shift the
fiscal burden to the future generations, which will lower the national savings rate in the
future.
   The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effects of population aging and fiscal policies
on national savings in Korean situation. For the prediction of the national savings rate of
Korea for the next several decades, we employ a life-cycle model, which incorporates the
generational accounting approach needed to assess the distribution of fiscal burden across
generations. Even though our main focus is on the effects of population aging and fiscal
stance, we also study the effects of change in asset composition, such as annuitization of
asset resulting from maturing of public pensions and introduction of reverse annuity
mortgages through the estimation of consumption functions, which enables comparison of
elasticity of consumption with respect to various kinds of wealth. We found that the rapid
population aging and long-term budgetary imbalance will substantially lower the national
savings rate in Korea. A sensitivity analysis based on an alternative model, an altruistic
family model, shows that these predictions are robust to the specification of altruism among
generations. In addition, the estimation results of consumption functions with respect to
various kinds of wealth suggest that the annuitization of wealth due to maturing of public
pensions and introduction of reverse annuity mortgage is likely to further decrease the
savings rate in the future.
     The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the
demographic transition in Korea for the next several decades, based on our population
projection. Section 3 explains our basic framework for the prediction of savings rate of the
future, a life-cycle model in which the agents’ consumption and savings is determined by the
propensity to consume and the magnitude of resource available for the remaining lifetime,
including human wealth, current asset holdings, and the value of net transfer income from the
government. Section 4 explains the data source used to estimate the propensity to consume,
which is used in the projection of consumption and savings, the method of imputation of
human wealth and net transfer income from government. Section 5 presents our findings, and
Section 6 summarizes and concludes the paper.


2. Demographic Transition in Korea

  Figures 1-3 summarize the population projection based on the 2001 population projection
model of National Statistics Office (NSO) of Korea. The 2001 NSO projection covers the
period 2001-2050. We extend the population projection up to 2110 using the NSO’s
assumptions about fertility rates1, mortality rates2, and international mobility rates3. Baseline
calculations are conducted under the assumption that the total fertility rate and age-sex
mortality rates will remain constant at their 2050 levels until 2110.
  The figures indicate that Korea will experience drastic change in demographic structure as
well as total population. The total population is projected to reach maximum level around
2025 and then decrease rapidly. The proportion of the aged 65 and older will increase from
9% (as of 2005) up to 38% and that of the economically active population, aged 15-64, will
decrease from 71% to 53%, which implies that while the current proportion of old-age

 We made 3 alternative fertility rate assumptions, high, medium, and low fertility rate assumption. Our base
case result is based on the medium fertility assumption (see Table 3).
2
    The average life expectancy is projected to rise from currently 76 years to 83 years in 2050.
3
  International movement of population is limited in Korea. For example, net immigration in 2000 was 11
thousand (emigration 43 thousand, immigration 54 thousand). We assume that the international movement rates
remain constant at their 2050 levels until 2110.

population is smaller than other OECD countries (see Table 2), the speed of population aging
is very high, because of a low fertility rate and prolonged life expectancy. In particular, the
fertility rate of Korea is much lower than many other OECD countries4. Moreover, National
Statistics Office of Korea projects that the total fertility rate will decrease from 1.47 (2000) to
1.40 (2040), which will accelerate the process of population aging5.
  United Nations (1998) projection also shows that the proportion of the population aged 65
and older will increase from 7.2% (as of 2000), much lower than the average of developed
countries (14.4%), to 23.1% (2030), almost the same as their projected average (22.6%). The
time required for the old-age population proportion to increase from 7% (14%) to 14% (20%)
is 19 years (7 years), which is much shorter than in other developed countries (France (115
years (41 years)), U.S. (71 years (15 years)), Japan (24 years (12 years))). Thus, Korea will
age much faster than any other OECD countries.


3. Basic Framework

   We adopt a life-cycle framework for the prediction of savings rates of the next several
decades. The economy is populated with a large number of individuals who belong to
different cohorts indexed by the year of their birth. The individuals do not face mortality risks
and live for D years. We assume that each agent in the economy makes decision on
consumption flow and the magnitude of bequest to maximize the lifetime expected utility. The
objective function and the budget constraint of the agent aged a at year t are as follows:

                     D
(1)   U a ,t =             β i − a u (C i ,t +i − a , i) + β D +1−a v(bD +1,t + D+1−a )

                                                                                                                 ∏ 1 + r (W                            + Ba ,t +i −a − Ta ,t +i −a )

 The fertility rate of Korea as of 2000 was 1.47. The rates for other OECD countries are 1.36 (Germany), 1.88
(France), 1.41 (Japan), 2.06 (U.S.), 1.64 (U.K.).
5
  The fertility rate has fallen up to 1.13 (as of 2003), lower than its assumed level in 2030 under the base case
assumption. However, we do not reflect this drastic change in fertility of recent years in the fertility assumption,
since the change might be temporary change resulting from economic crisis since 1997 triggered by foreign
currency deficiency, which is followed by economic recession.


                                                                                          
where C , b, u (⋅), v(⋅) represent consumption and magnitude of bequest, differentiable strictly
concave utility functions of consumption6 and bequest, respectively. And, , A, W, B, T are
discount rate, current asset holdings, non-capital income, transfer payment from the
government, and tax payment to the government.
  The lifetime budget constraint implies that the present value of consumption and bequest is
not more than the total wealth available for the remaining lifetime, which is composed of
asset holdings at present ( Aa,t ), human wealth ( HWa,t ), which is the present value of non-
capital income earned for the remaining lifetime, and the net government transfer wealth
( NBa,t ), which is defined as the present value of transfer income from the government minus
tax payment.
   The optimization of the agent aged a at period t yields the following path of consumption
and bequest.

             Ci ,t +i −a                                                               c       u c (c , i )

          bD +1,t + D+1−a                                                                         b         v'(b)

           C D ,t + D−a                                                                           c      u c (c , D )

where f and g are the marginal rate of substitution functions for the homothetic utility.


  Using equation (3) and (4) together with lifetime budget constraint, we solve for the
consumption of the aged a.

                                                   −1
                    D +1      i
(5)      C a ,t =          ∏ς       i ,t + i − a        (Aa,t + HWa,t + NBa,t ) = PCa,t (Aa,t + HWa,t + NBa,t )
                    i=a      s =a



   The equation (5) shows that an individual’s consumption at the age of a is the product of
total asset available for the remaining lifetime and this age’s average propensity to
consumption out of the total asset ( PC a ,t ). The equation (5) is our basic framework to project
the consumption rate for the next several decades.
   We follow several steps for the projection. We first estimate the average propensity to
consume, by age and sex, out of total asset using micro data set. Then, we project the
magnitude of total assets by age and sex, including current asset holdings, human wealth, and

6
  We define the utility as function of age as well as consumption amount to reflect the difference in preference
across ages.


                                                                            
the net government transfer wealth, for the next several decades. Finally, we compute the
consumption amount by age and sex for each year and savings rate.
  The national savings are composed of the private savings and the government savings. The
private savings are the difference of the total income, the sum of wage income, capital income
and net transfer from government, and consumption (see equation (6)). The current asset
holdings evolve following the equation (7).

(6)      S a ,t = Wa ,t + rt Aa ,t + Ba ,t − Ta ,t − C a ,t


(7)     Aa +1,t +1 = Aa ,t + S a ,t


   The government saving is defined as the (primary) budget surplus of the government: i.e.
tax revenue - transfer payment - government consumption ( GCt ) (see equation (8)), and the
national income ( Yt ) is the sum of labor income and capital income (see equation (9)).

(9)     Yt =          (Wa,t + rt Aa,t )µ a,t
               a =0



where µ a,t is the population of the aged a at period t .


4. Data and Imputations

   To predict future savings rates, we need to estimate the average propensity to consume, and
predict the magnitude of human wealth, and the net government transfer wealth by age for the
future, in addition to each year’s Gross National Product (GNP) and government consumption,
which we discuss in section 3. In this section we discuss the procedures of estimating the
average propensity to consume, and projection of the magnitude of human wealth, and the net
government transfer wealth for the future period.

4. 1. Estimating the average propensity to consume
  We use Korea Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS)7 to estimate the average propensity
to consume. KLIPS consists of household survey and individual survey. The household
survey contains information about the income, consumption, and asset holdings, including

7
  The KLIPS stated to survey from 1998 and its most recent survey is 2002 survey. We use the 1999-2002
surveys for the estimation of the average propensity to consume.


                                                              
real estate and financial asset, of households. The individual survey contains information
about the current employment status, current level of wage and income of the self-employed,
job experience of the past, public pension participation status, and current pension benefits
amount.
  As mentioned in section 3, total asset consists of current asset holdings, human wealth, and
net government transfer wealth. We assume that total asset holdings of each household are
equally distributed among the household head and his/her spouse.
  We compute individuals’ human wealth, the present value of non-capital income for the
                             D     t +i − a
                                              1
remaining lifetime,
                            i =a
                                   ∏1+ r
                                    s =t          s
                                                      Wi ,t +i −a   , using the age-sex profile of average income and

employment rate8. We assume that the average wage growth rate and the discount rate are
1.5% and 3.5%9 per annum in real term.
   To compute the government transfer wealth, we first compute the net public pension wealth
from the KLIPS sample. For the retired people, we use the reported public pension benefit
amount. For the people currently working, we use pension benefit formula and contribution
rules of public pensions. In that process, we explicitly take into account the value of each
individual’s already acquired pension benefit wealth, which is reflected in his/her job
experience of the past, as well as the expected value of net pension wealth, which will be
acquired by the contributions in the future. The value of the latter is dependent upon the
expectations about the future employment status and government policy change. We assume
that each individual’s employment status of the future follows the same path of the
employment rate by age and sex. We assume that the individuals in the sample maintain
myopic expectations about the future government fiscal policies, since we do not have any
consensus about the public pension reform. As for the other components of the government
transfer wealth, related with social insurance, means-test public aid programs, and taxes, the
KLIPS does not contain enough information to impute their value. Therefore, we take an
alternative approach, which uses the generational accounts (GA) separated across the
components of fiscal policies. We compute the ratio of the negative value of the whole
generational accounts, i.e. the value of the net government transfer wealth10, to that of public
pensions, reported in Table 10, and multiply this ratio with net public pension wealth
computed using KLIPS sample to get the value of the net government transfer wealth. Table 5
8
  Table 4 shows the population distribution, employment rate, and the average income by age and sex in 5th year
(2002) sample of KLIPS as an example.
9
    This value is based on the real interest rate of government bonds in recent years.
10
  Section 4.3 explains the procedure of GA calculations and the GA values for the components of fiscal policies.
The GA is defined as the present value of the net tax payment to government (taxes minus transfer income), of
the representative agent of each generation for the remaining lifetime. Therefore, the net government transfer
wealth defined in Section 3 is equivalent to the negative value of the GA.


                                                                         
reports the value of net public pension wealth and the net government transfer wealth by age
and sex. The value of the net public pension wealth shows an irregular age profiles, since
Korean public pension consists of two different plans: occupational pensions (OCP) which
covers government employees, private school employees and military personnel; and national
pension (NPS) which covers the rest of Korean residents. Since the NPS, which covers most
of Korean residents, was introduced in 1988, most of NPS participants have not acquired
entitlement of pension benefits. The OCP was first introduced in 1960 to cover the
government employees and military personnel, and expanded the coverage to private school
employees in 1975. Since the OCP’s are relatively mature plans, they have produced many
pension benefit recipients. However, the net pension wealth reported in Table 5 shows that
pension wealth of the aged 75 and older is 0, since the KLIPS sample does not cover many
occupational pension recipients. The imputed value of the net government transfer wealth
shows negative for most of cohorts, because the value does not reflect the value of
government consumption. It is also because the transfer payment from government is not
large at present due to immature public pension systems and small magnitude of expenditure
of public aid programs11.
   To impute the individual’s consumption, we need assumption on the distribution of
consumption within family. We use Besanger et al. (2000)’s estimate of age-profile of
consumption within family in Australia12. The average propensity to consumption is defined
as ratio of consumption level to total wealth. We compute the average propensity to consume,
using 1999-2002 KLIPS samples, and use the average level for the period in the projection of
the savings rate for the several decades.

4. 2. Projecting human wealth and current asset-holdings
   The magnitude of human wealth and current asset holdings of the future are computed
based on the assumption that the productivity growth rate and interest rate remain constant: i.e.
we adopt a partial equilibrium approach. The productivity growth rate and interest rate are
assumed 1.5% and 3.5% per annum in real term. The projection begins with imputation of
aggregate value of asset and human capital stock at the benchmark year. The aggregate labor
income is assumed 60% of GDP based on the record of labor income share for the period
1990-2003. We compute the distribution of wage income by age and sex, by allocating the
aggregate value based on the age-sex profile of wage income estimated by the Ministry of

11
  Table 10 shows that the generational accounts for most of cohorts are positive, which implies that most of
taxpayers pay more taxes than they receive from the government.
12
   Besanger et al. (2000) also estimated the distribution of consumption among family members for the case of
U.S..

Labor (2001). Then we use the definition of human capital (see equation (2)), to compute the
stock value of human capital for the next several decades.
  The aggregate value of asset holdings is assumed to be aggregate capital income, 40% of
GDP, divided by the interest rate. We impute the age-sex distribution of asset holdings in the
benchmark year using the asset holding profile by age and sex using the 1999-2002 KLIPS
survey. The distribution following the benchmark year is computed using equations (6)-(7).

4. 3. Projecting net government transfer wealth
   The net government transfer wealth is the present value of the transfer income from the
government minus tax payment to the government for the remaining lifetime, which is the
negative value of generational accounts.
   Computing generational accounts is based on the government’s intertemporal budget
constraint. This constraint, written as equation (10), requires that the future net tax payments
of current and future generations be sufficient, in present value, to cover the present value of
future government consumption as well as service the government’s initial net debt.

                  D                    ∞                     ∞
(10)                    N t ,t − s +          N t ,t + s =          Gs (1 + r ) −( s −t ) − Wt g
                 s =0                  s =t                  s =t



  The first summation on the left-hand side of (10) adds together the generational accounts of
existing generations. The term Nt,t-s stands for the account of the generation born in year t-s.
The index s in this summation runs from age 0 to age D, the maximum length of life. The
second summation on the left-hand side of (10) adds together the present value of remaining
net payments of future generations, with s representing the number of years after year t that
each future generation is born. The first term on the right-hand side of (10) is the present
value of government consumption. In this summation the values of government consumption,
Gs in year s, are discounted by the pre-tax real interest rate, r. The remaining term on the

right-hand side, Wt g , denotes the government’s net wealth in year t − its assets minus its

explicit debt.
  Equation (10) indicates the zero sum nature of intergenerational fiscal policy. Holding the
present value of government consumption fixed, a reduction in the present value of net taxes
extracted from current generations (a decline in the first summation on the left side of (10))
necessitates an increase in the present value of net tax payment of future generations.
  The term Nt,k in (10) is defined by:



                                                                            
                                k+D
(11)             N t ,k =              Ts ,k Ps ,k (1 + r ) − ( s − t )
                            s = max( t , k )



In expression (11), Ts,k stands for the projected average net tax payments to the government
made in year s by the generation born in year k. The term Ps,k stands for the number of
surviving members of the cohort in year s who were born in year k. For the generations who
are born in year k, where k>t, the summation begins in year k. Regardless of the generation’s
year of birth, the discounting is always back to year t. A set of generational accounts is simply
a set of values of Nt,k, one for each existing and future generation, with the property that the
combined present value adds up to the right-hand side of equation (10).
   The traditional Generational Accounts are calculated in two steps. The first step involves
calculation of the net tax payments of current generations (the first term on the left-hand-side
of equation (10)). This is done on the basis of current fiscal rules without being constrained by
the intertemporal budget constraint of the government. In the second step, given the right-
hand-side of equation (10) and the first term on the left-hand-side of equation (10), we
determine, as a residual, the value of the second term on the left-hand side of equation (10),
which is the collective payment, measured as a time-t present value, required of future
generations. Accordingly, whereas the fiscal burdens for current generations are based entirely
on current fiscal rules, the government budget constraint fully determines the fiscal burdens
for future generations.
   Based on the collective amount required of future generations, we determine the average
present value of lifetime net tax payments for each member of each future generation under
the assumption that the average lifetime tax payments of successive generations rise at the
economy’s rate of productivity growth. Leaving out this growth adjustment, the lifetime net
tax payments of future generations are directly comparable with those of current newborns,
since the generational accounts of both newborns and future generations take into account net
tax payments over these generations’ entire lifetimes. Measuring the generational imbalance
as the difference between two lifetime tax burdens provides a measure for the sustainability of
the public finances. If future generations bear a heavier tax burden than the newly born do,
current fiscal rules will have to be adjusted in the future to meet the budget constraint.
   We modify the presentation of generational accounts to make the generational accounts
appropriate for calculation of consumption level of generations who will survive for the next
several decades. We compute the generational accounts by age and sex at every year for the
next several decades, because the consumption by age and sex at each year is dependent upon
the net government transfer wealth, the negative value of generational accounts, at the year.
The standard approach estimates the fiscal gap between current and future generations,


                                                                      
assuming existing policy for current generations. It is also customary to express this fiscal gap
using other measures, such as the required changes in taxes and or transfer payments for
current and future generations together. Because it is likely that some of the burden will be
placed on current generations and there are differing effects of required changes in taxes and
transfer payment across future generations, we take this latter approach one step further and
actually present alternative estimates of the accounts for current generations and future
generations, taking such projected increases in their fiscal burden into account. In addition we
also renew the generational accounts for non-zero age groups. For example, we renew the
accounts the cohort aged a every year, who were a-1 years old in the previous year, and this
process continues until this cohort reaches the age D, the maximum length of life. The
renewal of the accounts is necessary, because the consumption of the aged a is dependent
upon the renewed accounts. We denote as GA1 the accounts as conventionally presented, and
refer to the modified accounts incorporating the adjustment to restore fiscal balance as GA2.13
  Table 10 reports standard generational accounts (GA1) for Korea14, under the base case
assumptions for the productivity growth rate (1.5 percent) and the real discount rate (3.5
percent).15 The table shows positive values of net payments for most cohorts alive in our
benchmark year 2000 for GA calculation, except for cohorts aged 90 or older, indicating that
most generations will, on balance, pay more in present value than they receive. One reason for
positive burdens even among the elderly is the high taxes on consumption, capital income and
assets, relative to taxes on labor income.16 The age profile of the average tax burden on capital
is more skewed to older age groups than that of labor income taxes, and the consumption tax
burden for older age groups is quite high.
   The more important reason that even older generations have positive net payments is that
social welfare benefits such as public pension benefits, Medical Insurance (MI) benefits,
Minimum Living Standards Security (MLSS) benefits and other social welfare services
(OSTP) were quite small in the aggregate as of 2000. Aggregate public pension and MI
benefits were 1.1 percent and 1.7 percent of GDP respectively as of 2000 and those for the
MLSS and the OSTP were 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent of GDP respectively. However,

expenditures will increase transfer payments to old-age groups. This maturation is shown in
Figure 4, which displays the relative (to age-40 males) benefit profile in 2000 along with the
corresponding profiles projected at other dates through 2080. As a result, the accounts for a
wider range of old-age groups will turn negative in the future, given current policy.
  The row labeled “Future Gen.” indicates the present value of amounts that those born in
2001 will, on average, pay, assuming that subsequent generations pay this same amount
except for the adjustment for growth. The account for future generations is about 118 percent
larger than those for those aged 0, which implies that the current fiscal policies are not
sustainable and that a substantial fiscal burden is shifted to future generations.
   Table 10 also reports the present value, rest-of-life transfer benefits and tax burdens by
category. The substantial negative entries for public pensions and Medical Insurance play a
key role in the large overall generational imbalance. On the tax side, three important
characteristics of the Korean tax system are: (i) the large share of consumption taxes; (ii) the
relative unimportance of labor income taxes; and (iii) the large proportion accounted for by
taxes on asset transactions. The largest present value (for ages 0 and age 30) is the
consumption tax, followed by the capital income tax, the tax on asset transactions, labor
income tax, other taxes, and taxes on asset holdings. The present value of the tax burden on
older age groups, relative to that on younger age groups, is heaviest for consumption taxes,
followed by capital income taxes, taxes on asset holding, taxes on asset transactions, and
labor income taxes.

no change in fiscal policies; (ii) increasing tax burden of the cohorts alive in 2010 and
thereafter by 23.1% of tax burden under current policies; and (iii) maintaining budget balance
every year (pay-as-you-go scheme). The case (i) is a hypothetical situation where the
government does not intend to attain long-term budgetary balance, thus, this should be
treated as a benchmark case to evaluate the effects of policy changes to attain long-term
budgetary balance. The Case (ii) is a scheme of prefunding, since under this scheme the
government (primary) budget balance maintains surplus around 2025 and thereafter the
budget turns deficit. Comparison of the case (i) with the case (ii) or the case (iii) shows that
the current fiscal policies are not sustainable and to maintain the current policies related with
government consumption and transfer payments the net tax burden for future generations as

generations is crucially dependent upon the method to attain the long-term budgetary balance.
The pay-as-you-go scheme (case (iii)) further shifts the fiscal burden to the future
generations than the prefunding scheme (case (ii)).


5. Findings

5. 1. Projected Savings Rates, 2002-2090

   We predict the savings rates for the period 2002-2090, based on the life-cycle framework
described in section 3, and using the imputed value of current asset holdings, the projected
value of human wealth, net government transfer wealth explained in section 4. Before our
prediction, we adjust the average propensity to consume to reproduce the level of aggregate
consumption in our benchmark year 2002. We adjust the average propensity in two steps. First,
we reduce the propensity to consume for the aged 75 and older by 50%, since their estimated
value is extremely high, more than 200% of the value for the aged 70-74. It is also due to the
fact that the number of observation of the aged 75 and older is very small, thus, the estimated
value of the average propensity to consume is not reliable. The predicted value of aggregate
consumption in our benchmark year, using the adjusted propensity to consume, is 413 trillion
won, 6.2% higher than its actual value. Therefore, we reduce the overall level of the average
propensity to consume by 6.2%, maintaining its profile by age and sex.
  Tables 11-14 summarize the prediction results. Table 11 shows the predicted value,
evaluated at the fixed price as of 2002, of the wealth and annual values related with the wealth
and government budget balance. The non-capital income grows faster than the productivity
growth rate (1.5% per annum) until late 2010’s despite the population aging, since the total
population will increase until it reaches a peak around 2025. The growth rate of non-capital
income falls rapidly, which induces the decrease in growth rate of human wealth, which is
defined as the present value of non-capital income earned for the remaining lifetime. The
growth rate of the human wealth is lower than that of non-capital income, because the former
reflects the decrease in the growth rate of the latter in the future. The human wealth has the
largest proportion of total wealth.
   The transfer wealth, which is defined as the present value of the net transfer income from
the government for the remaining lifetime, is negative for the next several decades under the
current policies. However, its value becomes positive around 2055, which reflects the fact that
the government transfer payments will increase much faster than the tax revenue due to the
population aging, maturing of public pensions, and increasing demand for social welfare
expenditure. Table 10, which summarizes generational accounts for Korea (GA1), shows that

                                               
the accounts for most of current generations are positive, reflecting the fact that the current
level of government transfer payment is low due to the short history of public pensions and
low level of social welfare expenditure at present. Despite the positive accounts for most of
current generations, the generational imbalance of the net payment is very high (118%), since
the forward-looking property of the generational accounting reflects the rapid increase in
government transfer payments in the future due to maturing of public pensions, and
prospective increase in social welfare expenditure resulting from population aging and
increasing demand for social welfare expenditure18. The negative accounts of public pensions
and medical insurance and social welfare expenditure (MLSS, OSTP) explains substantial
part of the generational imbalance. While the growth rate of tax revenue is lower than that of
government transfer payment because of reduction in economically active population due to
population aging, the government consumption grows faster than tax revenues, which further
deteriorates the government budget balance.
   The growth rate of aggregate consumption is higher than the GDP growth rate, due to the
population aging and increasing age profile of the average propensity to consume, which
raises the ratio of private consumption to GDP19. The increasing ratio of consumption to GDP
results in decrease in the value of asset holdings. The absolute level of the asset holdings falls
after the early 2010’s, which decreases capital income and the GDP growth rate20.
   Tables 13-14 show the predicted savings rates under the alternative assumptions about the
fiscal policies and fertility rates. We simulate 3 cases: (i) a hypothetical situation where
current fiscal policies are maintained disregarding the long-term budget imbalance; (ii) an
economy where the government proportionally adjusts the tax burden of cohorts alive in 2010
and thereafter to match the present value of tax revenue of the present and the future to that of
government transfer payment and government consumption (prefunding); and (iii) an
economy where the government maintains the budget balance every year (budget balance).
   The private savings, and government savings, defined as the government primary budget
surplus, depend crucially upon the method to restore the long-term budgetary balance.
Compared with the case (i), the national savings rates, the sum of private and government

18
  Auerbach and Chun (2005) projected that aggregate public pension benefits will increase from 1.1% of GDP
as of 2000 to 16% in 2080. Benefits of Medical Insurance and public aid programs are projected to increase
from 1.7% and 1.1% of GDP, respectively, to 5.1%, 2.1% during the same period. The projected level of the
Medical Insurance benefits and public aid to low-income families is based on very conservative income
elasticity (1.2). Therefore, the projected levels should be interpreted as their minimum level under current
policies.
19
     The ratio rises from 56.8% as of 2002 to 72.5% in 2050.
20
  The effects on the asset holdings might be exaggerated, since our approach is a partial equilibrium approach.
Under a general equilibrium approach the effects will be mitigated, since the increase in the rate of return to
capital will be a buffer to mitigate the reduction in asset holdings.


                                                          
savings rates, in the case of prefunding is higher, since higher level of transfer wealth in case
(i) induces higher level of consumption and the government budget in case (i) is more
imbalanced, which implies that delay in the policy revisions to restore the long-term
government budgetary balance will induce lower savings rate. Comparison of case (ii) and
case (iii) shows the effects of intergenerational redistribution of net tax burden. Figure 5
shows that transition from the prefunding scheme to the balanced budget scheme redistributes
the fiscal burden, defined as net payment to the government, from current generations to
future generations. This redistrtibution of resource from the future generations to the current
generations raises the savings rates of current generations. Therefore, the private savings rates
of the near future are higher in case (iii)21. However, the private savings rates after 2050 are
higher in case (ii), because under the prefunding scheme, the resource for the future
generations is much larger than that under the pay-as-you-go scheme. The government
savings rate of the period after 2020 is lower in the case (ii), since the case (ii) allows the
budget deficit in the far-away future while the prefunding accumulates the budget surplus in
the government fund in preparation for the budget deficit in the future.
   Even though there are some variations in the projected savings rate depending on the
method to restore the long-term budgetary balance, the overall results imply that the drastic
decrease in the savings rate will be inevitable because of the population aging and its
magnitude will be substantial. In particular, the decrease in the government savings rate
resulting from the increase in government’s transfer payments and government consumption
contributes substantially to the decrease in national savings rate and the absolute magnitude of
the fall in government savings rate is much larger than that in private savings rate.
   We try a sensitivity analysis on the fertility rates. Changing the fertility rates substantially
affects the savings rate in the long run. However, the national savings rate of the next several
decades are not affected much, because we assume gradual change in fertility rate (see Table
3). It is also because it takes time for the change in the fertility rates, which changes the
number of newborns, to affect the age structure of population, which affects the aggregate
value of consumption and savings.
   It is remarkable that in the transition period, increase (decrease) in fertility rate decreases
(increases) the private and government savings rate, even though the magnitude of the
decrease (increase) is not very large. Figure 6 shows that even though the increase in fertility
rates increases private savings (pri sav), the speed of increase in private savings is lower than
that of GDP for a considerable time, because the increase in the proportion of young

21
  The reditribution of resource to the current generations increases the consumption level of current generations.
However, the private savings rates also rise since the marginal (also average) propensity to consume is lower
than 1.


                                                         
population reduces the net transfer payments (gov net trf), which makes the speed of increase
in disposable income in aggregate lower than that of GDP. Figure 6 also shows that the speed
of increase in government consumption (gov con) is higher than that of GDP in the transition
period. It is due to the fact that the increase in young population dependency ratio resulting
from the increase in fertility rate increases the government consumption for the young
population, such as educational expenditure, for the transition period, while the rise in the
fertility rate will reduce the speed of government consumption increase eventually because it
reduce the proportion of old age population, which reduces the old-age-population-specific
government consumption.

5. 2. Further Consideration

  Effects of Altruism

   The life-cycle framework used for the prediction in this paper precludes the possibility of
consumption smoothing among generations through intergenerational redistribution. We
investigate its effects, based on an altruistic family model, where the family planner
maximizes the expected utility over consumption of each surviving member at different dates
(see equation 12) subject to household budget constraint (see equation (13):

                    ∞    D
  (12)   U =                    θ a PatU (C at )(1 + δ )−t
                   t = 0 a =1


            ∞      D
                        Pat C at
  (13)                               ≤ R0
           t =0 a =1    (1 + r )t

where θ a is the weight in the family utility function given to an age a individual, Pat is the
surviving population of age a in year t, δ is a pure rate of time preference, and R0 is full
family resources, which is composed of current asset-holdings, human wealth, and net
government transfer wealth.
   The solution of the maximization problem has the distinctive property that the cross-section
age-consumption profile is constant over time, and that consumption at each age grows over
time at a rate determined by the after-tax interest rate and the rate of time preference:

         C jt +1                1+ δ         C ' U '(C ')
  (14)              = h −1             =η, h    =
          C jt                  1 + rn       C    U '(C )




                                                             
          C it        θj
   (15)        = h −1
          C jt        θi


where rn is the after-tax interest rate, and h is the marginal rate of substitution function of
homothetic utility.
  We solve the equations (13)-(15) for the consumption level over time for each generation,
using the estimated age-consumption profile (see Table 8), under the assumption that the
growth rate of consumption ( η ) for each age group is the same as the wage growth rate22.
   Figure 7 reports the predicted savings rates over time under the situation where the current
fiscal policies are maintained. The altruistic family model produces similar predictions to
those based on the life-cycle model. The national savings rate declines to 4% around 2065,
and government savings rate turns to negative value. The difference in the predicted savings
rates between the two frameworks is in the trend of private savings rate. The consumption
smoothing across generations due to the altruism between generations produces different
trend of private savings rate from that under the life-cyle framwork: the private savings rate
predicted under the altruistic family model is lower in the transition preriod when the
population rapidly ages than that under the life-cycle model, while the private savings rate in
the long-run is higher under the former.


  Effects of annuitization of wealth

   The prediction of the savings rate under the life-cycle framework, described in sections 3
and 4, is based on the assumption that the propensity to consume does not change over time
and is the same regardless of the kind of wealth. However, the previous researches, such as
Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1992) and Kotlikoff et al. (1996), suggested the possibility of rise in
the propensity to consume resulting from the annuitization of wealth. The investigation of the
effect of the annuitization of wealth in Korean context is very suggestive, since the proportion
of the current asset holdings including housing and real estate is projected to decrease (see
Table 11). In addition, the increase in the old age population and maturing of public pensions,
and introduction of reverse annuity mortgages imply that the household wealth will be
substantially annuitized.
   In order to investigate the effects of the annuitization of household wealth, we estimate the
consumption functions at the individual level, which include current asset holdings, human
wealth, and net pension wealth as explanatory variables. For the estimation, we use 1999-
2002 KLIPS sample, which is used to estimate the average propensity to consume (see section

22
   We assume that the nomial intrest rate is 5%. We adjust the intrest rate to this value in order to prevent the
labor income share from diverging from the range of 60-73%.


                                                        
4.1). For the estimation of consumption functions, we include the individuals, who belong to
the age group 15-64, and have positive non-capital income. We use log values of consumption
and those of explanatory variables as well as their absolute level for the estimation. We
include the age and the age squared as explanatory variables to control the differing
preference across age groups.
  Table 15 shows mixed implication of the annitization of wealth. When we use the 1999-
2002 samples separately or the pooled sample, the elasticity of consumption with respect to
the net pension wealth is smaller than that with respect to the current asset holdings 23 .
Moreover, the coefficient for the current asset holdings in the estimation using the level
variables is larger than that for the net pension wealth in most cases, which implies that the
marginal propensity to consume with respect to the former is larger than that with respect to
the latter. This suggests that the annuitization of wealth will not lower the savings rate.
However, using fixed-effect panel equations produces larger elasticity of consumption and
marginal propensity to consume with respect to the net pension wealth than those with respect
to the current asset holdings. Considering the fact that the fixed-effect panel equation
approach reflects the characteristics of the individuals in the sample better than the pooled
sample approach or the estimation using a single-year sample, the result suggests that the
annuitization of wealth in the future in Korea, due to the population aging, maturing of public
pensions, and introduction of reverse annuity mortgages, will further reduce the savings rate
in the future.
   We also estimate the consumption function at the household level, since the individual’s
consumption used as the dependent variable in the estimation of consumption function at the
individual level is constructed by allocating the household consumption based on Austrailia’s
age-profile of consumption (see Table 7). We use household consumption (and its log value),
which is reported in KLIPS, as the dependent variable, and include the number of household
members, primary income earner’s age, the age squared, and each household’s total values of
current asset holdings, human wealth, and net pension wealth, as explanatory variables. Table
16 shows that change of analysis unit from the individual level to the household level does not
change the structure of consumption functions estimated using the fixed-effect models and
moreover it reinforces our prediction that the annuitization of wealth is likely to further lower
the savings rate, because the marginal propensity to consume with respect to the net pension
wealth estimated using single-year samples or the pooled sample is larger than that with
respect to the current asset holdings in most cases.


23
   This result may be partly due to the measurement error incurred in computing the value of the net pension
wealth.

  It is remarkable that maturing of the NPS is likely to further increase consumption level.
Table 16 shows the coefficient for the product of dummy variables, for the NPS participation
as opposed to the OCP, and the value of net pension wealth, is negative and significantly
different from 0 in most of cases24, which implies that the elasticity of consumption with
respect to net pension wealth is smaller for the NPS participants than that for the OCP
participants. It is probably due to the fact that the history of the NPS is very short and most of
the NPS participants have not acquired the entitlement to pension benefits. Therefore, it is
highly likely that the maturing of the NPS will raise the elasticity of consumption with respect
to the net NPS wealth at least to the level with respect to the net OCP wealth in the future,
which will further reduce the savings rate.


6. Conclusion

   This paper has investigated the effects of population aging and fiscal policies on the
national savings rate of the future. For the prediction of the national savings rate of Korea for
the next several decades, we employ a life-cycle model, which incorporates the generational
accounting approach needed to assess the distribution of fiscal burden across generations,
and we try a sensitivity analysis by using an altruistic family model to investigate the effects
of altruism among generations on the savings rates. We also study the effects of change in
asset composition, such as annuitization of asset resulting from maturing of public pensions
and introduction of reverse annuity mortgages by estimating consumption functions, which
enables comparison of elasticity of consumption with respect to the magnitude of various
kinds of wealth. We found that the rapid population aging and long-term budgetary
imbalance will substantially lower the national savings rate in Korea, and that the existence
of the altruism among generations does not produce qualitatively different results. In addition,
the estimation results of consumption functions with respect to various kinds of wealth
suggest that the annuitization of wealth due to maturing of public pensions and introduction
of reverse annuity mortgage is likely to further decrease the savings rate in the future.
   In addition to the population aging and the generational imbalance of fiscal burden,
premature reunification of South and North Korea will be a large burden of South Korean
taxpayers. Auerbach et al. (2005) showed that to finance the reunification cost, tax burden of
cohorts alive in 2010 and thereafter should be raised by about 30% of tax burden under
current fiscal policies, which will further reduce national savings of the future. In order to

  The coefficient is significantly different from 0 at 5% significance level in the case of pooled sample II level
and log equation. The P-value of the coefficient is 5.4% in the fixed-effect panel estimation (fixed-effect II)
using log variables. In the case of the fixed-effect panel equation using level variables, the coefficient is not
significantly different from 0.

restore the sustainability of fiscal policies as well as to prevent a drastic decrease in the
savings rate, fundamental reforms of fiscal policies, such as public pension reform, Medical
Insurance reform, and restructuring of government consumption policies, are necessary.
  This paper needs some methodological revisions. Since we adopted a life-cycle framework,
under which we implicitly assume that the propensity to consume is the same across various
kinds of wealth. However, the estimated consumption functions suggest that change in the
composition of wealth induce drifts of the propensity to consume. Construction of the model,
which enables the analysis of the effects of asset composition changes, will be an important
agenda for our future research.
   Our projection suggests a drastic decrease in asset holdings due to population aging and
fiscal policies. The prediction may exaggerate the decreasing trend of asset holdings and
savings rate, since our approach is a partial equilibrium approach. A general equilibrium
approach needs to be considered, because the general equilibrium change in factor prices (i.e.
rise in rate of return to capital) resulting from decrease in capital stock, mitigates the drastic
downward trend of asset holdings.
