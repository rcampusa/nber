                                              ABSTRACT

We employ a latent class model to assess the impact of Mexico’s Seguro Popular ("SP") program on
the number of prenatal visits in a cross-sectional sample of 4,381 women who gave birth during 2002-2005.
We specify an ordered probit model to permit a pregnant woman’s probability of membership in one
of three latent classes to depend on observed covariates. In the ordered probit model, enrollment in
SP is explicitly treated as an endogenous variable. We model the number of prenatal visits, conditional
upon membership in a particular latent class, as a Poisson regression. We employ the EM algorithm
to reduce the computational burden of model estimation. At any iteration of the algorithm, the parameters
of the model of latent class membership can be estimated separately from the parameters of the model
of prenatal care utilization. We find that enrollment in SP was associated with a mean increase in
1.65 prenatal visits during pregnancy. Approximately 59 percent of this treatment effect is the result
of increased prenatal care among women in the first latent class, that is, women who had with little
or no access to care. The remaining 41 percent of the treatment effect is the result of a shift in membership
from the second to the third latent class, which we interpret as increased recognition of complications
of pregnancy prior to labor and delivery. Our model has a better fit and predicts a larger impact of
SP than alternative models that relax the assumption of endogeneity, do not impose ordering on the
latent classes, or incorporate only two latent classes. Our findings are consistent with prior work on
the favorable impact of SP on maternal health (Sosa-Rubí, Galárraga, Harris 2009).

                                   1. INTRODUCTION

         Since the seminal paper of Deb and Trivedi (Deb and Trivedi 1997), latent class

models have become increasingly common in the econometric analysis of the demand for

health care. In these models, the econometrician assumes that each individual belongs to

one of a fixed number of latent classes, but the specific class to which an individual

belongs remains unobserved. Based on these assumptions, she jointly estimates the

probability of membership in each class, as well as the demand for health care

conditional upon membership in each specific class (Atella, Brindisi et al. 2004; Deb,

Munkin et al. 2006). In most applications, investigators have assumed that the unknown

probabilities of class membership are fixed parameters. In a few papers, analysts have

modeled these probabilities as functions of observed covariates (Nagin and Land 1993;

Roeder, Lynch et al. 1999; Greene and Hensher 2003; Clark, Elité et al. 2005; Bago

d'Uva 2006; Clark and Etile 2006; Bago d'Uva and Jones 2008; Greene, Harris et al.

2008).

         Latent class models have made significant progress in addressing the

heterogeneous effects of health-sector policies, such as those policies aimed at improving

access to medical care (Deb and Trivedi 1997; Deb and Holmes 2000; Jimenez-Martin,

Labeaga et al. 2002; Conway and Deb 2005). These models have demonstrated how such

unobserved or partially observed factors as health status and attitudes toward health risks

can determine consumers’ demand responses. However, such models have not squarely

confronted the serious problem that health-care coverage is endogenous in non-

experimental databases (Cameron, Trivedi et al. 1988; Atella and Deb 2008). Even in

contexts where the government exogenously introduces a change in eligibility criteria or
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                      May 18, 2009                                  Page 4


insurance coverage for specific types of health care, the individual’s decision to take

advantage of the new policy may still be voluntary (Sosa-Rubí, Galárraga et al. 2009).

As a consequence, unobserved factors may influence both the decision to participate and

the demand for medical care conditional upon participation (Cameron, Trivedi et al.

1988).

         Here, we extend the latent class framework to take account of this knotty problem

of endogeneity. We assume, as have other investigators, that the probability of latent

class membership is a function of observable covariates. Unlike prior work, we permit

one of these covariates to be endogenous to the model of latent class determination. We

show how the EM algorithm, an iterative procedure that has been widely used to estimate

latent class models, can be extended to our model. At each stage of the iterative EM

algorithm, we separately estimate two distinct subsets of parameters: the parameters of

the model of latent class membership, which contains the endogenous variable; and the

parameters of the model of demand conditional on class membership.

         We apply our approach to an evaluation of the impact of Seguro Popular (or

“People’s Insurance”), a public health policy inaugurated in Mexico in 2001 to improve

access of the poor to quality medical care (Gakidou, Lozano et al. 2006; King, Gakidou et

al. 2009; Sosa-Rubí, Galárraga et al. 2009). We study the effect of a household’s

participation in Seguro Popular (“SP”) on the demand for prenatal care by pregnant

women who delivered babies during 2002–2005. Analyzing cross-sectional data from the

2006 National Survey of Health and Nutrition (Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Nutrición,

or “ENSANUT”) (Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública 2006), we specify a Poisson count-

data model for the number of prenatal visits, conditional upon membership in one of
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                       May 18, 2009                                   Page 5


three latent classes. We further specify an ordered probit model for the determination of

class membership. The household’s participation in SP enters as a covariate not only in

the former Poisson model, but also as an endogenous covariate in the latter ordered probit

model. Consequently, enrollment in Seguro Popular can influence the distribution of

class membership as well the conditional demand for prenatal care. Our specification has

significantly better fit to our data than alternative restricted models that specify only two

latent classes, do not account for the endogeneity of SP, or do not model class

membership. Moreover, our model predicts significantly larger impacts of SP – as well

as public policies designed to promote participation in SP – than alternative models.

        Based upon our findings, we interpret the three latent classes of pregnant women

in Mexico as representing: (1) poor women without access to prenatal health care

services; (2) women with access to prenatal care but without identified complications of

pregnancy; and (3) women with access to prenatal care and identified pregnancy

complications. Our empirical finding that SP moves pregnant women from the first to

the second class suggests that SP has improved access among women who previously had

little no prenatal care. Moreover, our finding that SP moves some women from the

second to the third class suggests that SP has permitted identification of pregnancy

complications might have otherwise gone unrecognized before labor.

                                   2. ECONOMETRIC MODELS


                                 2.1. General Latent Class Model

        Our cross-sectional sample consists of independent observations on M pregnant

woman, indexed i = 1,…, M . For each pregnant woman, we observe the number ni of

prenatal visits, as well as other covariates to be described below.

        We assume that each woman belongs to one of three latent classes, indexed by

k = 1, 2, 3 , but we cannot observe the class to which she belongs. Extension of our

analysis to an arbitrary number of classes is straightforward. We denote by fk ( ni ; Xi , β )

the conditional distribution of the number of prenatal visits ni , given that woman i

belongs to class k , where is a vector Xi of observed covariates and β is an unknown

parameter vector. We shall specify a parametric form for this distribution shortly.

        Let π k ( Zi ,θ ) denote the probability that pregnant woman i belongs to class k ,

where Zi is a vector of observed covariates that may differ from Xi , and where θ is an

                                                                             3
unknown parameter vector. These probabilities are constrained so that       ∑ π ( Z ,θ ) = 1
                                                                                   k   i
                                                                            k =1


for all i = 1,…, M . Below, we specify parametric forms for the dependence of the latent

class probabilities π k on observed covariates.


                             2.2. Estimation via the EM Algorithm

        The foregoing assumptions imply a mixture of count-data models. The log

likelihood is

                              M
                                  ⎡ 3                                ⎤
(1)     L ( n, X, Z β ,θ ) = ∑ ln ⎢ ∑ π k ( Zi ,θ ) fk ( n; Xi , β ) ⎥
                             i =1 ⎣ k =1                             ⎦
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                                           May 18, 2009                                            Page 7


The log likelihood function in (1) is not separable in the parameters β and θ . However,

the EM algorithm offers an iterative approach to maximization of (1) that permits us to

estimate the parameters β and θ separately during each successive iteration. The EM

algorithm has been widely employed to maximize the log likelihood function in latent

class models (Wedel, Desarbo et al. 1993).

          We applied the EM algorithm to the maximization of the log likelihood in (1) as

                                                                 (          )
follows. Assume that we have estimates β (t ) ,θ (t ) at iteration t = 1, 2,… of the

algorithm. We update these parameter estimates in two steps: the E-step and the M-step.

In the E-step, we evaluate the posterior probability that woman i belongs to class k as


(2)        (t )
          pik =
                           (       ) ( ) for k = 1, 2, 3
                       fk ni ; Xi , β (t ) π k Zi ,θ (t )

                  ∑ f ( n ; X , β ( ) ) π ( Z ,θ ( ) )
                   3
                                         t                   t
                           j   i    i            j   i
                  j =1



Equation (2) is a version of Bayes formula, in which the prior probabilities are

      (      )                                           (            )
π k Zi ,θ (t ) and the likelihoods are fk ni ; Xi , β (t ) . We then define the log likelihood of

the extended data (sometimes called the “complete-data log likelihood”), consisting of

the observed data {ni , Xi , Zi } as well as the class variable { ki } for each woman

i = 1,…, M , as if each woman’s latent class were known:

(3)       L ( n, X, Z, k β ,θ ) =

                       M                                             M

                   ∑ ln ⎡⎣π ki ( Zi ,θ ) fki ( ni ; Xi , β )⎤⎦ = ∑ ⎡⎣ ln π ki ( Zi ,θ ) + ln fki ( ni ; Xi , β )⎤⎦
                    i =1                                             i =1



                               (             )
Given the estimates β (t ) ,θ (t ) at iteration t , the expected value of this extended log

likelihood is

           (                    )
                                      M    3
(4)      Q β ,θ , β (t ) ,θ (t ) = ∑ ∑ ⎡⎣ pik(t ) ( ln π k ( Zi ,θ ) + ln fk ( ni ; Xi , β )) ⎤⎦
                                     i =1 k =1


where the expectation is taken over the posterior distribution given in (2). In the M-step,

we maximize this expression with respect to ( β ,θ ) in order to obtain updated values of


                    (                 )
the parameters β (t +1) ,θ (t +1) . A critical feature of the maximization problem in this M-


                                          (                )
step is that the expectation Q β ,θ , β (t ) ,θ (t ) of the extended log likelihood in (4) is

separable in the parameters β and θ . It is well known that the EM procedure converges

to the maximum of the likelihood function (1) (Redner and Walker 1984) (Xu and Jordan

1996).


                                    2.3. Poisson Conditional Distributions

         In what follows, we assume that the conditional distribution of prenatal visits ni ,

given that pregnant woman i belongs to latent class k is Poisson:

                              λikn exp ( − λik )
(5)      fk ( ni ; Xi , β ) =                    , where λik = exp ( Xi′β k ) , for k = 1, 2, 3
                                     n!

and where β = ( β1 , β 2 , β 3 ) . Although we shall not do so here, we could generalize our

analysis to any conditional distribution for the count variable ni , such as the negative

binomial (Deb and Trivedi 1997).

         Given the Poisson conditional distributions in (5), the expected log likelihood (4)

in the M-step simplifies to

(6)        (                    )
         Q β ,θ , β (t ) ,θ (t ) =

                        3   M                                                             3   M

                    ∑ ∑ ⎡⎣ pik(t ) ( ni Xi′βk − exp ( Xi′βk ))⎤⎦ − M ln ( ni !) + ∑ ∑ pik(t ) ln π k ( Zi ,θ )
                    k =1 i =1                                                            k =1 i =1
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                                              May 18, 2009                                         Page 9


The maximizing solution for each β k is obtained by setting the corresponding derivatives

       (                       )
of Q β ,θ , β (t ) ,θ (t ) with respect to each β k equal to zero. That is,

            M
(7)        ∑ p( ) X ( nt
                      ik   i       i   − exp ( Xi′β k )) = 0 for k = 1, 2, 3
           i =1


where (7) is a vector equation that holds for each coordinate of Xi . This is equivalent to

separately solving three weighted Poisson regressions, where the weights for regression

k are the posterior probabilities pik(t ) . This procedure for obtaining the updated

parameters β (t +1) at iteration t + 1 does not depend on the specification of our model for

the probabilities π k ( Zi ,θ ) , to which we now turn.


                               2.4. Basic Model: Mixture of Poisson Distributions

           We develop our models for π k ( Zi ,θ ) in stages. We begin with the conventional

mixture model, where the probability of belonging to each latent class is a fixed

parameter that does not depend on observables.

(8)        π k ( Zi ,θ ) = θ k for k = 1, 2, 3

This is the model underlying nearly all of the latent class literature. Given (5), our model

is a finite mixture of Poisson distributions. The expected log likelihood in the M-step

simplifies to


                (                         )
                                                3   M                                                 3   M
(9)        Q β ,θ , β (t ) ,θ (t ) = ∑ ∑ ⎡⎣ pik(t ) ( ni Xi′β k − exp ( Xi′β k )) ⎤⎦ − M ln ( ni !) + ∑ ∑ pik(t ) ln θ k
                                               k =1 i =1                                             k =1 i =1


The maximizing value for each θ k at the M-step is given by

                               M
                           1

                   2.5. Ordered Probit Model for the Mixing Probabilities

        We modify our basic model so that the probabilities π k are functions of the

observable variables Zi . Specifically, for all i = 1,…, M ,

                                                                           ⎧ 1 if ki * ≤ 0
                                                                           ⎪
(11)    ki * = Z i′α + ε i , where ε i ~ i.i.d. N ( 0,1)          and ki = ⎨ 2 if κ ≥ ki * > 0
                                                                           ⎪ 3 if k * > κ
                                                                           ⎩       i



Equation (11) is an ordered probit model, where α and κ are unknown parameters. We

assume that the unit normal error term ε i is independent of the covariates Zi . Denoting

θ = (α ,κ ) , and letting Φ (⋅) represent the unit normal cumulative distribution function,

we have:

(12)     π 1 ( Zi ,θ ) = Φ ( − Zi′α )

         π 2 ( Zi ,θ ) = Φ (κ − Zi′α ) − Φ ( − Zi′α )

         π 3 ( Zi ,θ ) = Φ ( Zi′α − κ )


                                                              (            )
Maximization of the expected log likelihood Q β ,θ , β (t ) ,θ (t ) in (6) with respect to the

parameters θ = (α ,κ ) at the M-step is similarly obtained by setting the corresponding

                  2.5. Ordered Probit with a Binary Endogenous Variable

        We further modify our ordered probit model, introducing an observed binary

endogenous variable yi . Specifically, for all i = 1,…, M ,

Equation (14), which determines latent class membership, is an ordered probit model that

now depends on a variable yi in addition to the observables Zi . Equation (15) specifies a

probit model in which the binary variable yi depends on a separate vector Wi of

observable covariates, which may differ from Xi and Zi . We assume that the error terms

 ε i and ν i in (16) are independent of the covariates Zi and Wi . If the correlation

coefficient ρ in (16) is non-zero, then the variable yi is endogenous.

        Let θ = (α , δ ,κ , γ , ρ ) and si = 2yi − 1 . Let Φ 2 (⋅, ⋅, ρ ) denote the unit bivariate

normal cumulative distribution function with correlation coefficient ρ . We have:

                                  Φ 2 ( − Zi′α − δ yi , siWi′γ , − si ρ )
(17)   π 1 ( Zi ,Wi , yi ,θ ) =
                                               Φ ( siWi′γ )


       π 2 ( Zi ,Wi , yi ,θ ) =
                                  ( Φ (κ − Z ′α − δ y ,
                                     2         i        i   siWi′γ , − si ρ ) − Φ 2 ( − Zi′α − δ yi , siWi′γ , − si ρ ))
                                                                       Φ ( siWi′γ )

                                                    Φ 2 ( Z i′α + δ yi − κ , siWi′γ , − si ρ )

In (17), each expression π k ( Zi ,Wi , yi ,θ ) represents the corresponding probability that

pregnant woman i belongs to latent class k given the observed values of Zi , Wi and yi .

                                                                                     3
These latent class probabilities likewise satisfy                                   ∑ π ( Z ,W , y ,θ ) = 1 for all i = 1,…, M .
                                                                                           k   i   i   i

        With the inclusion of the endogenous variable yi , the log likelihood function

becomes

                                        M
                                            ⎡ 3                                         ⎤ M
(18)       L ( n, X, Z,W , y β ,θ ) = ∑ ln ⎢ ∑ π k ( Zi ,Wi , yi ,θ ) fk ( n; Xi , β ) ⎥ + ∑ ln Φ ( siWi′ γ )
                                       i =1 ⎣ k =1                                      ⎦ i =1

where the additional term on the right-hand side corresponds to the likelihood

contribution of the probit model for yi in (15). Once again, the EM algorithm can be

employed to maximize the log likelihood in (18). Suppose that we have parameter

             (                   )
estimates β (t ) ,θ (t ) at a specific iteration t . For each woman i = 1,…, M , we once again

compute the posterior probability that woman i belongs to class k as

           pik =
                            (      ) (                  ) for k = 1, 2, 3
                        fk n; Xi , β k(t ) π k Zi ,Wi , yi ,θ (t )

                   ∑ f ( n; X , β ( ) )π ( Z ,W , y ,θ ( ) )

Given β (t ) ,θ (t ) , the expected value of the extended log likelihood is

Maximization with respect to the parameters β = ( β1 , β 2 , β 3 ) and θ = (α , δ ,κ , γ , ρ ) is

similarly obtained by setting the corresponding derivatives of (19) equal to zero. Note

that (20) remains separable in β and θ , so that the first-order conditions for β in (7) still

apply. Moreover, parameter γ , which appears only in the last term of (20), need not be

estimated iteratively.


                               2.6. Testing Alternative Models

        With one exception to be described below, our alternative models of the number

of prenatal visits are successively nested. Thus, the basic model with fixed mixing

probabilities (8) is nested within the ordered probit model of mixing probabilities (12).

The former model is equivalent to the latter under the restriction that θ = 0 . Likewise,

the model (12) is nested within the ordered probit model of mixing probabilities with an

endogenous variable (17). The former is equivalent to the latter under the restriction that

ρ = 0 . Thus, the standard likelihood ratio tests can be employed to distinguish between

models.

        We can extend the nesting concept to other alternative models not explicitly

considered above. Consider the model (17) with only two latent classes, rather than

three. This would correspond to a simple probit model of mixing probabilities with an

endogenous variable. Such a model would likewise be nested within the model (17), and

would be equivalent to the restriction that κ = 0 . Alternatively, consider a simple count-

data model in which the number of prenatal visits ni is Poisson distributed with mean

λ1 = exp ( X1′ β1 ) . This model is nested within the basic latent class model with fixed

probabilities (8), with the restriction θ 2 = θ 3 = 0 .

             Prior contributions to the latent class literature have considered a multinomial

logit specification for the mixing probabilities π k ( Zi ,θ ) (Nagin and Land 1993; Roeder,

Lynch et al. 1999; Clark, Elité et al. 2005; Bago d'Uva and Jones 2008). In that case,

equation (12) is replaced by

                                 exp ( Z i′α k )
(21)         π k ( Z i ,θ ) =                      for k = 1, 2, 3
                                ∑ exp ( Z ′α )
                                 3

                                           i   j
                                j =1



where θ = (α1 , α 2 , α 3 ) . This model, which can also be estimated by the EM algorithm, is

not nested within our ordered probit models. In our empirical analysis, we employed the

Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Aikake 1974) and the Bayesian Information

Criterion (BIC) (Schwarz 1978) to compare (21) with our alternative models. The former

criterion corresponds to 2N − 2L * , where L * is the maximized value of the log

likelihood function L in (2) or L in (18) and N is the total number of parameters in

( β ,θ ) .   The latter criterion corresponds to N ln M − 2L * , where M , as noted above, is

the sample size.


                                       2.7. Computation of Treatment Effects

             In our empirical work, we focus on two treatment effects: (1) the direct effect of

Seguro Popular; and (2) the indirect effect of public policies intended to increase

participation in Seguro Popular. In the terminology of (Heckman and Vytlacil 2007), the

former corresponds to the “treatment effect on the treated,” while the latter represents the

“policy relevant treatment effect,” where a public policy that may alter the probability of

treatment. In both cases, the endpoint is the predicted number of prenatal visits in our

sample population.
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                                 May 18, 2009                                             Page 15


         To that end, we explicitly identify Seguro Popular with the binary endogenous

variable yi . We permit yi to be a covariate the model of the conditional distribution of

the number of prenatal visits ni , given that pregnant woman i belongs to latent class k .

Thus, equation (5) is generalized to:

                               λikn exp ( − λik )
(22)      fk ( ni ; Xi , β ) =                    , where λik = exp ( Xi′β k + ζ k yi ) , for k = 1, 2, 3
                                      n!

and where β = ( β1 , β 2 , β 3 ,ζ1 ,ζ 2 ,ζ 3 ) . The explicit inclusion of yi in (22) does not alter the

fact that the expected log likelihood function is separable in the parameters β and θ .

         Let E ⎡⎣ ni y ⎤⎦ denote the mean number of prenatal visits of pregnant woman i ,

conditional upon the presence or absence of Seguro Popular, that is, conditional upon y .

For each k = 1, 2, 3 , we abbreviate λik ( y ) = exp ( Xi′β k + ζ k y ) and π ik ( y ) = π k ( Zi ,Wi , y,θ ) ,

                                                                    3
where π k (   )   is defined in (17). Then E ⎡⎣ ni y ⎤⎦ = ∑ π ik ( y ) λik ( y ) . The direct effect of
                                                                   k =1


Seguro Popular (that is, the effect of a change in y from 0 to 1) on the mean number of

prenatal visits of pregnant woman i is:

                                                   3
(23)     ΔE [ ni ] = E ⎡⎣ ni 1⎤⎦ − E ⎡⎣ ni 0 ⎤⎦ = ∑ (π ik (1) λik (1) − π ik ( 0 ) λik ( 0 ))
                                                  k =1


which can be decomposed into:

                       3                                    3
(24)     ΔE [ ni ] = ∑ π ik (1) ( λik (1) − λik ( 0 )) + ∑ (π ik (1) − π ik ( 0 )) λik ( 0 )
                      k =1                                 k =1


The first summation captures the effect of Seguro Popular on the mean number of visits

within each latent class, while the second term captures the effect of Seguro Popular on

                                                                                      (   )
the probabilities of latent class membership. Noting that λik (1) = exp (ζ k ) − 1 λik ( 0 ) for

k = 1, 2, 3 , we can derive a computationally simpler form for (24) as:

                       3
(25)    ΔE [ ni ] = ∑ λik ( 0 ) ⎡⎣π ik (1) exp (ζ k ) − π ik ( 0 ) ⎤⎦
                     k =1



We calculate the population mean and median values of ΔE [ ni ] .

        We next compute the indirect effect of a change in a policy variable intended to

increase participation in Seguro Popular. For this purpose, we focus on a specific

continuous covariate wh that is a component of the vector W but not a component of the

vectors X or Z . We define:

                        ⎛ − Z ′α − δ y + ρW ′γ ⎞
(26)    π i1 ( y ) = Φ ⎜ i                i

                        ⎝         1− ρ  2
                                               ⎠

                         ⎛ κ − Z ′α − δ y + ρW ′γ ⎞    ⎛ − Z ′α − δ y + ρW ′γ ⎞
        π i 2 ( y ) = Φ ⎜      i             i

                                  3. BACKGROUND AND DATA


              3.1. Seguro Popular and Prenatal Health Services in Mexico

        Beginning in the mid-1990s, Mexico introduced a series of public policies

designed to improve the health of its poorest and most vulnerable populations: the

Program to Expand Coverage (“Programa de Ampliación de Cobertura”) in 1995,

Oportunidades (initially named “PROGRESA”) in 1997, and the Fair Start in Life

program (“Arranque Parejo en la Vida”) in 2001 (Frenk, Gonzalez-Pier et al. 2006).

There is evidence that these programs improved access to health care and health

outcomes, particularly in the area of maternal and reproductive health. Evaluations of

Oportunidades, in particular, have demonstrated an increase in prenatal visits among

pregnant women beneficiaries (Gertler 2000).

        Despite these initiatives, half of Mexico’s population remained uninsured at the

start of 2001. At that time, a pregnant woman faced essentially three choices for her

prenatal and obstetric care. First, if a family member were employed in a specific sector

of the formal economy, such as petroleum (PEMEX), she could take advantage of the

prevailing system of social security (“Seguridad Social”), which offered a modern

network of high-quality primary and secondary maternal health care services, mostly in
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                        May 18, 2009                                   Page 18


urban areas. Second, if she were ineligible for social security but eligible for a state-run

program, she could seek prenatal and obstetric care at government-sponsored facilities,

including those of the Department of Health (“Secretaría de Salud”). Such facilities were

often poorly staffed and widely regarded as having variable quality. Third, she could

seek medical care in the private sector, paying out of pocket. While many urban women

with adequate incomes paid a private obstetrician, poorer women and those in rural areas

frequently sought low-priced care from informal providers, including midwives and

traditional healers. Some of these women had no prenatal care prior to labor and

delivery.

        Seguro Popular (“People’s Insurance”) was introduced in 2001 with a two-fold

purpose: to provide insurance coverage to the nation’s most vulnerable populations; and

to increase the quality of health care services provided in the public sector (Gakidou,

Lozano et al. 2006; King, Gakidou et al. 2009; Sosa-Rubí, Galárraga et al. 2009).

Initially launched as a pilot project in five states and gradually rolled out in the rest of the

country, Seguro Popular had been incorporated by 2005 into all of Mexico’s 32 states.

        On the demand side, SP served as a voluntary insurance program for uninsured

households, with well-defined eligibility rules, benefit packages and premiums scaled to

income. The eligibility rules favored the poorest households in rural areas, including

those who were also eligible for the Oportunidades program, and precluded households

with access to insurance through the system of social security. On the supply side, the

federal government allocated funds to state health departments to upgrade public health

care facilities to meet minimum quality standards. Federal transfers to states were
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                     May 18, 2009                                   Page 19


directly related to the number of SP-enrolled households, so that the states had an

incentive to enroll households in the program.

        In a prior study of survey-based observational data, we found that Seguro Popular

enhanced access of pregnant women to obstetrical care for labor and delivery (Sosa-Rubí,

et al 2009). Another observational study has found that SP enhanced access to treatment

for hypertension in those areas with adequate physician supply (Bleich, Cutler et al.

2007). A recent experimental study, in which randomization was performed at the level

of the locality, demonstrated reductions in out-of-pocket “catastrophic” health spending,

but no significant effects on utilization, medication spending, or health outcomes (King,

Gakidou et al. 2009). The latter negative findings may have been due to the relatively

short, 10-month duration of the experimental intervention (Victora and Peters 2009).


                        3.2. The 2006 ENSANUT Survey Data

        We analyzed data from the 2006 National Health and Nutrition Survey (Encuesta

Nacional de Salud y Nutrición, or “ENSANUT”), a nationally representative cross-

section survey of 48,304 households containing 206,700 individuals, conducted in all 32

states of Mexico during November 2005 – May 2006 (Instituto Nacional de Salud

Pública 2006). We complemented the survey responses with data on the characteristics

of the localities in which respondents lived, as derived from 2005 census data (Instituto

Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI) 2005). We focused on a sample of 4,381

females aged 14–49 years, who reported giving birth during 2002–2005, and who

provided responses concerning the number of prenatal visits as well as the explanatory

variables to be delineated below.
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                       May 18, 2009                                  Page 20


        Table 1 shows the summary statistics for all variables used in our econometric

analyses. We have classified the explanatory variables into individual, household and

locality characteristics. At the individual level, we included variables reflecting the

woman’s age, educational attainment, language spoken, work status, reproductive history,

and past history of conditions that commonly complicate pregnancy. To address possibly

nonlinearity in the relationship between age and prenatal care, we included age squared

as an explanatory variable (not shown in Table 1). We classified educational attainment

into three levels: primary school or no education; second school; and high school or

greater. The first level served as the reference category. Although we could not ascertain

the respondent’s work status during her pregnancy, nonetheless we included an

explanatory variable reflecting the respondent’s work status during the two weeks prior to

the ENSANUT survey.

        At the household level, we included variables reflecting the presence of young

children, an index of household wealth, and indicator variables for household enrolment

in Oportunidades, Seguro Popular, or Seguridad Social (social security). The asset index,

in particular, was based upon household infrastructure, building materials, and ownership

of certain durable assets, such as a refrigerator, television, telephone, oven and stove

(McKenzie 2004).

        At the locality level, we included variables reflecting rural location and level of

social deprivation. The latter indicator, also known as the locality’s index of

socioeconomic marginality (“índice de marginación”) is based on such factors as the rate

of illiteracy, the proportions of dwellings with a dirt floor, with overcrowding, without
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                       May 18, 2009                                  Page 21


running water, sewer drainage, or electricity, and the proportion of the population under

the poverty (CONAPO 2005).

        We also included a locality-level variable for the percentage penetration of

Seguro Popular among the eligible population (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y

Geografía (INEGI) 2005). SP penetration depended in large part on the investments

made by each state to upgrade the infrastructure and staffing of local health care facilities

in compliance with federal requirements. Local penetration also depended on individual

states’ efforts to inform households of their eligibility and recruit them into the program.

We therefore treated local SP penetration as an exogenous instrumental variable that

influenced the probability that a pregnant woman would enroll in Seguro Popular, but did

not affect her probability membership in a particular latent class or her utilization of

prenatal care conditional on class membership. Thus, local SP penetration appeared as an

exogenous variable in the vector Wi of covariates in equation (15) but not in the vector

Zi of covariates in equation (14) or the vector Xi of covariates in equation (5).

        Other investigators have used similar individual-, household- and local-level

covariates to explain prenatal care utilization in developing countries (Wong, Popkin et

al. 1987; Pebley, Goldman et al. 1996; Celik and Hotchkiss 2000; Magadi, Madise et al.

2000; Chen, Liu et al. 2003; Sepehri, Sarma et al. 2008).


                                       4. RESULTS


                            4.1. Principal Estimation Results

        Table II shows the estimates derived from our principal specification, as given in

equations (5) and (14)–(16). The first two columns of estimates show the results of the
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                         May 18, 2009                                     Page 22


model of latent class determination, where the column entitled “Ordered Probit” refers to

equation (14) and the column entitled “Probit SP Enrollment” refers to equation (15). At

the bottom of the first column, the parameter κ refers to the threshold parameter in the

ordered probit equation (14), while the parameter ρ refers to the correlation coefficient

of the error terms in equation (16). The last three columns of Table II show the

parameters of the three conditional Poisson models of prenatal care utilization, as

specified in equation (5).

        At the bottom of each of the last three columns of Table II, we report the

estimated population mean values of the probabilities π k ( Zi ,Wi , yi ,θ ) for k = 1, 2, 3 , as

defined in equation (17), as well as the estimated population mean values of the rate

parameters λik = exp ( Xi′β k ) for k = 1, 2, 3 , as defined in equation (5). Thus, the average

probability of belonging to the first latent class was π 1 = 0.0514 , while members of that

class had a mean of 0.5242 visits. The average probability of belonging to the second

class was π 2 = 0.8814 , where the mean was 7.3302 visits. The average probability of

belonging to the third class was π 3 = 0.0672 , where the mean was 16.8447 visits. We

interpret the first latent class as representing those pregnant women with little or no

access to prenatal care, who made very few visits, if any. The second latent class

represents the large majority of pregnant women, who on average sought care about once

every five weeks during a 40-week pregnancy. Finally, we interpret the third latent class

as representing those women with complications of pregnancy that were recognized prior

to labor, and thus required an average of one prenatal visit every 2.4 weeks.

        In the ordered probit specification in equation (14), a positive value of the

parameter δ implies that an increase in the endogenous variable yi will shift the
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                       May 18, 2009                                     Page 23


distribution of latent class variables to the right. That is, an increase in yi will tend to

move pregnant woman i from latent class k = 1 to latent class k = 2 , and from class

k = 2 to class k = 3 . Under our interpretation of the three latent classes, the rightward

shift from the first class to the second represents an improvement in access to prenatal

care. The rightward shift from the second to the third class represents the recognition of

preexisting complications of pregnancy prior to labor and delivery. In the first column of

Table II, the endogenous variable Seguro Popular in fact had a significant positive

coefficient.

        A positive value of a particular component of the parameter vector α , as

specified in equation (14), similarly implies that an increase the corresponding

component of Zi will shift the distribution of latent class variables to the right. Among

the observed covariates with a significant positive coefficient in the same column were:

educational attainment, household wealth, enrollment in the Oportunidades program, and

a history of prior health conditions (diabetes, hypertension, urinary tract infections) that

could complicate pregnancy. The negative coefficient for the number of pregnancy

losses suggests that this variable serves as a proxy for reduced access to care in prior

pregnancies rather than as an indicator of current pregnancy risk.

        In Table II, the estimated correlation coefficient of the error terms in the model of

latent class determination (that is, ρ , as specified in equation 16) is –0.22, and the

estimate is significantly different from zero ( P = 0.025 ) . Put differently, those

unobserved factors that increase participation in SP are correlated with those unobserved

factors that prevent women from recognizing complications prior to labor (latent class 3)

and relegate them to the low-access group (latent class 1). The finding of a negative
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                       May 18, 2009                                   Page 24


correlation coefficient is consistent with our prior work on Seguro Popular (Sosa-Rubí,

Galárraga et al. 2009). A negative correlation coefficient has been seen in other

observational studies in developing countries (Waters 1999), although the evidence

overall remains mixed (Harmon and Nolan 2001; Trujillo 2003; Jowett, Deolalikar et al.

2004).

         In the second column of estimates in Table II, we find that indicators of lower

educational attainment, lower family wealth, and participation in the Oportunidades

program are predictors of participation in Seguro Popular. We dropped Seguridad Social

from the covariates in this equation, since it was perfectly correlated with

nonparticipation in SP, inasmuch as women enrolled in Seguridad Social are ineligible

for SP. Finally, the percentage penetration of SP in the local area is a strong predictor of

individual participation. This finding supports the validity of local SP penetration as an

instrumental variable.

         In the group of columns in Table II under the heading “Poisson Models of

Prenatal Visits,” the estimates for latent class 1 reveal significant positive coefficients for

age, high school education, number of prior pregnancy losses, and the index of household

wealth. Living in a rural locality or in a locality with a high index of social deprivation

reduces the number of prenatal visits within in this group. Enrollment in Seguro Popular

markedly increases the number of visits within this latent class. Being a beneficiary of

social security (Seguridad Social) or the Oportunidades program also increases prenatal

attendance, but the effect of enrollment in Oportunidades is reduced in those localities

with high levels of deprivation, as evidenced by the negative interaction term.
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                       May 18, 2009                                      Page 25


        The utilization estimates for latent class 2 in Table II show significant positive

coefficients for number of prior pregnancy losses, our index of household wealth, and a

history of diabetes, hypertension or urinary tract infections. Enrollment in social security

or Oportunidades also increases attendance, and the interaction with the index of

deprivation in the locality is again negative. Seguro Popular, however, does not have a

significant effect on prenatal visits in the second latent class.

        The estimates for the third latent class in the rightmost column of Table II require

more scrutiny, as the signs of many of the significant coefficients are unexpectedly

negative. This reversal of sign is seen for such variables as age, secondary and high

school education, number of prior pregnancy losses, the index of household wealth, and

enrollment in social security or Oportunidades. Many of the same variables have a

significant positive sign in the ordered probit equation that determines latent class

composition. Thus, if a woman becomes a beneficiary of Oportunidades, she tends to

move out of the second and into the third latent class or, under our interpretation, her

doctor or midwife recognizes a previously undetected complication of pregnancy. We

assume that those inframarginal women who are already in the third latent class have the

most serious complications of pregnancy. If so, then a marginal rightward shift in the

distribution tends to decrease the average severity of complications in third latent class,

thus resulting in a negative association between Oportunidades and prenatal attendance.

        Figure 1 compares the predicted distribution with the empirical distribution of

prenatal visits in the sample population of 4,381 pregnant women. The predicted

distribution is displayed as three partially superimposed vertical bar graphs, each

corresponding to a separate latent class. For each class k = 1, 2, 3 , the vertical bars

represent the predicted unconditional distribution of prenatal visits, that is, π k fk ( n ) as a

function of n . In Figure 2, the empirical distribution is compared to the predicted

                                                                                   3
distribution of prenatal visits for the three latent classes combined, that is,   ∑ π f ( n ) as
                                                                                         k k

a function of n .

        Figures 1 and 2 show a generally good fit between the empirical and predicted

distribution of visits. A total of 3.22 percent of women had no prenatal visits, while the

predicted proportion was 3.04 percent, nearly all of which represented the contribution of

the first latent class. A total of 1.12 percent of women had 1 prenatal visit, while the

predicted proportion was 1.13 percent, consisting of 0.66 percent in class 1 and 0.47

percent in class 2. At nine visits, there is a marked deviation between the observed

frequency (23.90%) and the predicted frequency (9.97%). This deviation may be due

respondents’ tendency to report one visit per month, or 9 per pregnancy. Similar

deviations between observed and predicted frequencies are seen at 15 visits (3.38%

versus 1.01%) and 20 visits (1.28% versus 0.27%), which may also be due to rounding by

respondents. As a consequence of these deviations, a chi-squared test rejects the

hypothesis that the observed and predicted distributions are indistinguishable

( P < 0.001) .

                          4.2. Comparison of Alternative Models

        Table III displays the results of our comparison of alternative models. Model A,

in the first row, corresponds to our principal specification. By contrast, in Model B, we

retain three latent classes and the ordered probit model of latent class membership, but

assume that SP is an exogenous variable. Equivalently, the correlation coefficient ρ of
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                      May 18, 2009                                  Page 27


error terms in equation (16) is assumed to equal zero. In Model C, we restrict our

analysis to two latent classes, retaining a probit equation for class membership with SP as

an endogenous variable. Equivalently, the threshold parameter κ in equation (14) is

assumed to equal zero, while the parameter ρ in equation (16) remains unrestricted. In

Model D, we replace the ordered probit specification with a multinomial logit model of

latent class membership with SP as an exogenous variable, as specified in equation (21).

Model E entails fixed mixing probabilities, as specified in equation (8). Finally, we

include Model F, which represents a naïve Poisson model with no latent classes.

        As noted above, all of our alternative models except Model D are nested within

our principal Model A. Based upon the standard log likelihood ratio test, all of these

models are rejected in favor of Model A. Thus, the test statistic computed as twice

difference in log likelihood between Models A and B, which is distributed as χ 2 with 1

degree of freedom, is equal to 5.04. Hence, we reject Model B at the significance level

P = 0.0248 . Similarly, the test statistic computed as twice the difference in log

likelihood between Models A and E, which is distributed as χ 2 with 17 degrees of

freedom, is equal to 93.65. Hence, we rejected Model E at the significance level

P < 10 −6 . Finally, while the multinomial logit Model D is not nested in our principal

Model A, we find that Model A is superior by both the AIC and BIC criteria.

        Appendix Tables I, II, and III, respectively, display the coefficient estimates of

Models B, C, and D. In Model B, when the endogeneity of Seguro Popular is ignored, its

effect in the ordered probit equation for latent class membership was reduced by more

than half. In Model C, when only two latent classes were assumed, the population mean

numbers of visits were 1.4 and 7.7, respectively. The two-class model thus failed to
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                          May 18, 2009                                      Page 28


identify the subpopulation of women who, under our interpretation, had recognized

complications of pregnancy. In Model D, which does not account for the potential

endogeneity Seguro Popular, the coefficient of SP was not significant either in the

equation for class 2 versus class 1 membership, or in the equation for class 3 versus class

1 membership. In both Models B and D, we continued to observed significant negative

parameter estimates for such variables as education, prior pregnancy losses, household

wealth, and social security enrollment in the conditional Poisson utilization model for

latent class 3. Thus, the negative coefficients for these variables in our principal model,

as shown in the rightmost column of Table II, do not appear to be an artifact of the

ordered probit specification or the treatment of SP as endogenous.

        In the ordered probit Model A, any explanatory variable such as SP that shifts

pregnant women in class 1 rightward to class 2 must also shift pregnant women in class 2

rightward to class 3. The alternative multinomial logit Model D, by contrast, does not

impose such a restriction. In that model, an explanatory variable such as SP could, at

least in principle, shift pregnant women in class 1 rightward to class 2 and, at the same

time, shift pregnant women in class 3 leftward to class 2. To test whether the ordering

restriction imposed by our principal Model A has a significant effect on the predicted

probabilities of class membership, we compared the predicted values of the latent class

probabilities for Model A with the corresponding predicted values of the latent class

probabilities for Model D.

        To simplify the notation, let π ikA = π k ( Zi ,Wi , yi ,θ ) denote the probability that

pregnant woman i = 1,…M belongs to latent class k = 1, 2, 3 , as predicted from equation

(17) based the parameter estimates for θ in Model A. Similarly, let π ikD = π k ( Zi ,θ )

denote the corresponding probability predicted from equation (21) based on the

                                                            (             )              (
parameter estimates for θ in Model D. Let π iA = π i1A , π iA2 , π iA3 and π iD = π i1D , π iD2 , π iD3   )
denote the corresponding vectors. We computed the Euclidean distance Δ i = π iA − π iD

for each pregnant woman i = 1,…M in our sample, where the distance Δ i ranges from 0

to a maximum possible value of             2 . In our sample of M = 4, 381 pregnant women, the

median value of Δ i was 0.012, while 4,155 women (94.8 percent) had values of

Δ i < 0.5 .

         Since each of the vectors π iA and π iD is contained within the two-dimensional

                                     + π 2 + π 3 = 1 , we can plot them within a triangular planar

region. The use of such triangular plots in economics dates back at least to McKenzie’s

analysis of factor prices in world trade (McKenzie 1955). (See also Leamer’s use of

“endowment triangles” in a three-factor general equilibrium model (Leamer 1987).)

and the lower panel displaying the corresponding plot of the values of π iD . In both of the

panels in Figure 3, the three vertices of the triangle refer to the respective corners of the

simplex, that is, (1, 0, 0 ) , ( 0,1, 0 ) , and ( 0,1, 0 ) . The three sides correspond to the lines

where one of the three components of the vector (π 1 , π 2 , π 3 ) is zero. In each graph, the

gray points represent the 4,155 women with a value of Δ i < 0.5 , while the black solid

points represent the remaining 226 women with a value of Δ i ≥ 0.5 .

         If the unordered multinomial logit Model D did not adhere to the ordering

imposed by our principal Model A, then we would expect to see a large number of points

situated along or close to the bottom margin of the triangle in the bottom panel of Figure

3, where π 1 > 0 and π 3 > 0 , but π 2 ≈ 0 . In fact, nearly all the points lie very close to the

left and right sides of the triangle. Put differently, the vast majority of women were

found either to have some probability of belonging to latent classes 1 and 2 or some

probability of belonging to latent classes 2 and 3, a finding that supports the validity of

the ordered probit specification.




                           4.3. Estimation of Treatment Effects

        Table III also shows the estimated treatment effects for our principal model and

each of our alternative models. In all cases, we have computed both the population mean

and median effects on the predicted number of prenatal visits. The pair of columns under

the heading “Effect of Seguro Popular” refers to the direct effect of SP on the number of

prenatal visits, that is, the “treatment effect on the treated,” as defined in equation (23).

The pair of columns under the heading “Marginal Effect of SP Penetration” refers to the

indirect effect of a 10-percent increase in SP penetration on the number of prenatal visits,

that is, the “policy relevant treatment effect,” as defined in equation (27). In the latter

case, we interpret the penetration of SP as a policy indicator of local, state and federal

efforts to enroll eligible households into the program.

        For both the direct effect of SP and the indirect effect of SP penetration, the

distribution of estimated individual treatment effects was asymmetric and skewed to the

right. Thus, the mean treatment effects were consistently larger than the corresponding

median effects. For both types of treatment effects, our principal Model A predicted a

much larger impact than the alternative models. Under Model A, the effect of the
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                             May 18, 2009                                    Page 31


treatment on the treated corresponded to mean increase of 1.65 prenatal visits. Failure to

take account of the endogeneity of SP in Model B reduced the estimated mean direct

effect of SP to 1.31 visits, that is, by approximately 21 percent.

             As shown in equation (24) above, the direct effect of SP in Model A could be

decomposed into a change in the mean number of visits within latent classes (the first

         3
term    ∑ π (1)( λ (1) − λ ( 0 )) in equation 24) and a shift in the distribution of latent

                                     3
classes (the second term        ∑ (π (1) − π ( 0 )) λ ( 0 ) in equation 24).
                                         ik   ik     ik                        These components
                                 k =1


were, respectively, 0.976 visits (or 59% of the effect) and 0.675 visits (or 41% of the

effect). The first component was dominated by the effect of SP on the number of

prenatal visits among women who remained in latent class 1 (that is, by

(π (1) − π ( 0 )) λ ( 0 ) in equation 24), while the second effect was dominated by the
   i1           i1         i1



movement of pregnant women into latent class 3 (that is, by (π i 3 (1) − π i 3 ( 0 )) λi 3 ( 0 ) in

equation 24). Under our interpretation of the latent classes, the direct treatment effect of

SP derived predominantly from a combination of two impacts: increased prenatal

attendance among pregnant women with little or no access to care, and increased

recognition of pregnancy complications prior to labor.


                                5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

             In this observational study of a cross-sectional survey database, we found that

Seguro Popular increased access to prenatal care for Mexican women who gave birth

during 2002–2005. Specifically, enrollment in SP was associated with a mean increase in

1.65 prenatal visits during pregnancy (Table III). Approximately 59 percent of this
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                                May 18, 2009                                          Page 32


treatment effect was the result of increased prenatal care among women in the first latent

class, that is, women who had with little or no access to care. The remaining 41 percent

of the treatment effect was the result of a shift in membership from the second to the third

latent class, which we interpret as increased recognition of complications of pregnancy

prior to labor and delivery.

           These estimates represent the effect of the treatment (that is, Seguro Popular) on

the treated (pregnant women whose households enrolled in SP). In an attempt to assess

the effect of a policy-relevant treatment, we also studied the effect of an absolute increase

of 10-percentage points in local penetration of Seguro Popular, that is, the proportion of

eligible women enrolled in SP in the local area. We view local penetration as an

intermediate measure of efforts by state health departments to upgrade health facilities to

meet federal standards and then enroll eligible households. We estimated that a 10-

percent increase in local penetration would result in a mean increase of 0.139 prenatal

visits (Table III). Based upon published budgetary and coverage data (Comisión

Nacional de Protección Social en Salud 2007; Comisión Nacional de Protección Social en

Salud 2007), we estimate that a 10-percent increase in local penetration required a

governmental investment of approximately USD 526 in the year 2006.** However, full

     In 2006, the federal government transferred 4.608 billion pesos to the states as part of the Seguro Popular
program (Comisión Nacional de Protección Social en Salud 2007). The number of affiliated households at
the close of 2005 was 3.556 million (Comisión Nacional de Protección Social en Salud 2007). Given these
data and the prevailing exchange rate of 10.25 pesos per USD, we estimate that in 2006, the federal
government allocated to each state an average of USD 126 per affiliated household. There were 11.898
million eligible households in a total of 285,823 localities in Mexico (Comisión Nacional de Protección
Social en Salud 2007), or an average of 41.6 eligible households per locality. An increase in 10% in the
penetration of SP thus required enrolling an average of 4.16 households, which comes to USD 526.
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                       May 18, 2009                                  Page 33


evaluation of such a marginal investment would require us to assess all of the potential

benefits of Seguro Popular, and not simply the increment in prenatal visits.

        Our analysis adds to the small but growing number of studies that model the

probability of latent class membership as a function of observed covariates (Nagin and

Land 1993; Roeder, Lynch et al. 1999; Greene and Hensher 2003; Clark, Elité et al.

2005; Bago d'Uva 2006; Clark and Etile 2006; Bago d'Uva and Jones 2008; Greene,

Harris et al. 2008). Our research is distinguishable from prior work in that we explicitly

address the problem of endogeneity in modeling latent class membership. We thus

attempt to confront a serious drawback in the application of latent class models to

observational data on health care utilization. We find, in fact, that failure to account for

the endogeneity of Seguro Popular results in a significant underestimate of the impact of

this public policy program on the utilization of prenatal care (Table III). Moreover, we

show how the EM algorithm can substantially reduce the computational burden of such

models. Specifically, at each stage of the iterative algorithm, the parameters of the model

of latent class membership can be estimated separately from the parameters of the model

of health care utilization.

        Our study has several limitations. First, we used an ordered probit specification

to model latent class membership. The assumption of joint normally distributed errors,

inherent in the probit specification, simplified the task of incorporating endogeneity into

the model of latent class membership, but the ordering imposed by our model may have

been too restrictive. It is reassuring that the unrestricted multinomial logit specification

gave nearly the same probability distribution of class membership (Figure 3).
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                       May 18, 2009                                   Page 34


        Second, our conditional utilization model for the third latent class yielded

unexpected negative coefficients for such covariates as the woman’s education, the

household’s assets, and household enrollment in social security (Table II). These

covariates were also found to shift the distribution of latent class membership to the right.

That is, higher educational or household wealth attainment permits a woman to recognize

a previously undetected complication of pregnancy, thus moving her at the margin from

the second to the third latent class. If the inframarginal women already in the third latent

class had the most serious complications requiring the largest number of prenatal visits,

then a marginal rightward shift in the distribution would tend to decrease the average

severity of complications in third latent class. This would result in a negative association

between education or household wealth and prenatal attendance. The negative

coefficients for the third latent class do not appear to be an artifact of our ordered probit

model of class membership, as they are likewise observed in other less restricted models

(Appendix Tables I and III).

        Third, we have not pursued a number of potentially important analytical strategies

for assessing the impact of Seguro Popular on prenatal care. In particular, we did not

estimate two-part models (Pohlmeier and Ulrich 1995; Chen, Liu et al. 2003; Sepehri,

Sarma et al. 2008). To be sure, we found that pregnant women in our first latent class

had a mean of 0.52 prenatal visits (Table II and Figure 1), and our predicted distribution

of the number of visits accurately captured the observed mode at zero visits (Figure 2).

Nonetheless, we have made no formal tests of the accuracy of a two-part model against

our latent class model. Moreover, our conditional utilization models relied upon the

Poisson distribution. We did not test alternative specifications for the number of prenatal
Harris & Sosa-Rubí                      May 18, 2009                                  Page 35


visits, such as the negative binomial distribution (Chen, Liu et al. 2003; Sepehri, Sarma et

al. 2008). Further research is required to determine whether a finite latent class model in

which class membership depends on observed covariates better captures the

heterogeneity that is implicit in the negative binomial distribution. Finally, our sole

measure of prenatal care was the number of visits. We did not address the timing of the

first visit (Harris 1982; Wong, Popkin et al. 1987; Magadi, Madise et al. 2000), the type

of provider (Pebley, Goldman et al. 1996), or the content of care (Wong, Popkin et al.

1987) in the present study.

Then the marginal effect of a change in wh becomes:

        ∂E [ ni ]                   3

         ∂wh                      k =1



This is the expression in equation (27) in the main text.
