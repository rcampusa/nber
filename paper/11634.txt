Using panel data and case studies, we analyze the pre-1970 history of international capital flows and
current account reversals. Considering a sample of emerging markets and advanced economies with
per capita GDPs at least 60 per cent those of the lead country, we show that the incidence of
reversals has been unusually great in recent years. The only prior period that matched the last three
decades in terms of the frequency and magnitude of reversals was the 1920s and 1930s, decades
notorious for the instability of capital flows. In contrast, reversals were both less common and
smaller in the Bretton Woods and pre-World War I gold standard eras.

1. Introduction

        Sharp reductions in current account deficits can be disruptive. Milessi-Ferretti

and Razin (2000) in their seminal study of the phenomenon, known as “current account

reversals,” emphasize the dangers of large current account deficits that must be

compressed when external financing dries up. Their study, written in the aftermath of the

Asian crisis, presumably had countries like Thailand in mind. The authors cite other

disruptive reversals, such as Uruguay’s at the beginning of the Latin American debt

crisis, when financing for the current account deficit collapsed and growth fell from +5

per cent to -7 per cent.2 Looking forward there is the question of what would happen to

growth in the United States if financing for the country’s 5 per cent plus current account

deficit evaporated abruptly. Will the dollar fall, fanning import price inflation and

forcing the Fed to raise interest rates? How would the housing and stock markets react?

Sharp reductions in consumption and investment might have to be brought about by this

rise in interest rates and fall in asset valuations, since the current account is the difference

between investment and saving.

        But not all current account reversals are disruptive. In Milesi-Ferretti and Razin’s

own sample, the median change in growth between the periods before and after such

reversals is zero. The output response, in other words, is very heterogeneous. For every

Uruguay there is a Nigeria, where growth went from -5.5 per cent in 1981-83 to +3 per

cent in 1984-86 despite sharp compression of the current account.

        From an analytical standpoint, this is not surprising. Deficits develop for different

reasons. A deficit reflecting a temporary surge in investment owing to unusually rapid

productivity growth and high profitability will have different implications than a deficit

reflecting a temporary surge in consumption produced by the growth of public

consumption or overvaluation of the currency. Equally, current account deficits can be

eliminated for number of very different reasons, which are likely to have very different

output effects.

        Nor is it clear that current account reversals were always as disruptive as in recent

years. The obvious contrast is the period before World War I, when very large deficits

were allowed to develop and persist. Bayoumi (1989) considers average current account

deficits over periods as long as 1870-1913 and finds that these reached high levels in

countries like Australia and Canada. Taylor (1996) and Obstfeld and Taylor (2004) do

the same over successive decades starting in the late 19th century and show that current

account balances were larger in that period than anytime in the 20th century. To be sure,

some of these deficits were compressed abruptly with interruptions to the flow of external

finance, reflecting a combination of rising interest rates in the capital-exporting countries

and economic and political problems in the capital importers. Instances springing to

mind where current account deficits fell sharply and precipitated banking or currency

crises include Denmark in 1885-6, Argentina in 1889-90, Canada in 1890-91, Australia in

1891-2, Brazil in 1896-7, Japan in 1899-1900, and Finland in 1900-1.3 Although crises

can occur for reasons other than those associated with current account reversals, the

connections between the two phenomena are clear. Recall Fischer’s (1988) caution that

the “primary indicator [of a looming crisis] is the current account deficit.”4

        At the same time, crises – currency crises in particular – were lower in frequency

under the gold standard than in recent years.5 Indeed, another reading of gold standard

experience is that the economic and political environment made current account reversals

less of a problem. Greater wage and price flexibility in an era of unstructured labor

markets facilitated the adjustment of relative prices when the current account balance had

to be compressed abruptly (Bayoumi and Eichengreen 1996). With government budgets

close to balance in peacetime, the twin deficits problem that gives rise to “bad current

account deficits,” financing for which dries up suddenly when concerns arise about the

sustainability of public debts, was less prevalent. Because large current account deficits

reflected unusually high levels of investment in export-supporting infrastructure, those

deficits could be smoothly reduced by increased savings out of progressively higher

domestic incomes and increases in exports of goods and services (Feis 1930, Fishlow

1986).6 Since the credibility of the commitment to exchange rate stability was beyond

reproach, events that might have interrupted capital inflows and forced disruptive

compression of the current account elicited capital inflows that allowed that deficit to be

wound down smoothly rather than precipitating a crisis. Some of these tales are

consistent with fewer or smaller current account reversals, while others are consistent

  We can think of this as a somewhat refined version of the Lawson Doctrine as applied to the gold
standard.


                                                    3
with smaller output losses (smoother adjustment to equally frequent or large current

account shocks).

       These observations suggest a series of questions. Were current account reversals

less frequent under the gold standard? Were their growth effects less disruptive? And if

there are differences across epochs, what is their explanation?

       Bracketed by the gold standard and the post-1970 float were the 1920s and 1930s,

when capital flow volatility, economic instability, and financial crises were pervasive,

and the Bretton Woods quarter century, when capital flows were limited, recessions were

rare, and banking crises were essentially nonexistent. Given the contingent nature of the

connection between economic volatility on the one hand and current account reversals on

the other, it would be illuminating to know whether reversals were larger, more frequent,

and more disruptive in the interwar period – and smaller, less common, and less

disruptive under Bretton Woods.

       In what follows we take a first cut at measuring the frequency, magnitude and

effects of current account reversals in the gold standard era (1880-1914), the interwar

period (1919-39), Bretton Woods (1945-70), and the post-Bretton Woods float (1972-

1997). We use regression analysis to see how far we can get in ascribing cross-period

differences to observable characteristics of countries and the international economic

environment.

       The results confirm that the gold standard era and the years since 1970 differed

strikingly from one another: reversals were smaller and less frequent in the gold standard

period. Controlling for, inter alia, the size of the initial current account imbalance, the

movement in the real exchange rate and the state of the global economy does not make




                                              4
this difference go away. Evidently, there was something else about the gold standard

years that rendered current accounts more stable. But when reversals did take place, their

effects were every bit as disruptive as after 1945. This prompts us to consider a set of

case studies in an effort to shed more light on the issue.

           The intervening period from the 1920s through the 1960s is more difficult to

characterize. The two interwar decades emerge here, as elsewhere, as years of instability:

reversals were frequent and large and had major output costs. Under Bretton Woods, in

contrast, reversals were few and small; in both respects this period resembles the gold

standard years. These facts are presumably explicable in part by the prevalence of capital

controls and tight regulation of domestic financial markets.

           Finally, the years since 1972 are grouped with the gold standard years in terms of

ease of adjustment to reversals. The output losses from current account reversals appear

to be significantly smaller not just compared to the interwar years (which is not

surprising) but also compared to Bretton Woods. In the conclusion we speculate about

what changes in markets and institutions might help to account for this fact.



2. The Country Sample

          Our empirical analysis utilizes data from Bordo and Eichengreen (2003) extended

to incorporate additional variables and countries.7 The principal sources are compendia

and monographs containing national historical statistics for the period prior to 1913,

publications of the League of Nations for the interwar period, and standard World Bank




7
    For a more extensive discussion of data sources see that publication.


                                                        5
and International Monetary Fund sources after World War II. The resulting data set has

been checked and adjusted for compatibility.8

       A problem for any study that undertakes historical comparisons over long periods

is the country sample. Reasonably complete macroeconomic statistics including not only

GDP and trade but also financial variables are available back to the late 19th century only

for a subset of Western European countries, overseas regions of recent European

settlement (the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), and a few of the

larger Latin American countries (Argentina and Brazil). The question is whether to

follow this same group of countries over time (as in for example Taylor 1996 and

Obstfeld and Taylor 2004) or to add additional countries as more data become available

(as in inter alia Bayoumi 1989).

        Both approaches have drawbacks. Following the same 10 to 15 European

countries and offshoots over the entire 120 years maximizes the comparability of the

country sample at the cost of representativeness. If we are interested in the determinants

and consequences of current account reversals in modern-day emerging markets and how



8
  Several limitations of these data are worth noting. The current account estimates for the period before
1945 build on reported figures for imports and exports of goods and services, following inter alia Bayoumi
(1990), Taylor (1996), and Obstfeld and Taylor (2004). This leaves open the possibility that some service
items are under- or unreported (imports and exports of shipping, insurance and financial services, for
example). In addition, there is the possibility of spurious volatility in earlier (specifically, pre-1914) output
data (Romer 1986). To the extent that this bias exists, it will presumably exaggerate the difference between
growth rates during expansions and contractions and therefore the magnitude of the output effects of
current account reversals. Finally, some variables that have proven popular in recent analyses of the causes
and consequences of current account reversals (measures of the composition of the public debt, for
instance) are not readily available for this earlier period and are therefore excluded from the analysis. In
particular, information on the capital account, as distinct from the current account, is not readily available
for earlier periods. (For an idea of what kind of distinct data on international capital flows exist for the
period prior to 1913, see Bloomfield 1963, 1968 and Stone 1999.) Data on reserves and imports and
exports of goods and services capture capital flows imperfectly to the extent that they do not measure trade
in certain services – see above – and to the extent that information on foreign exchange reserves is
incomplete. The analysis here follows Milesi-Ferretti and Razin (2000) – hereinafter MFR – who similarly
focus on the current account reversals but do not look separately at sudden stops in capital flows, unlike
Edwards (2004a, b) who looks at both.


                                                       6
these compare with such reversals in their historical antecedents, then a sample that

includes at most a couple of modern-day emerging markets is not likely to be

representative of their experience. If, on the other hand, one freely adds more countries

as data on these become available, then one ends up with better representation of modern

emerging markets but also with problems of intertemporal comparability. At the

beginning of the period the sample will be mainly comprised of a small number of

relatively advanced industrial economies, while at the end of the period it will be

dominated by a large number of low income countries, where the causes, consequences,

and incidence of current account reversals may be significantly different. Assume, for

example, that current account reversals are more frequent in low-income countries.

Adding more low-income countries as data on them become available over time will then

bias the analysis toward the conclusion that reversals have been growing more frequent

purely as a result of sample composition.

     We therefore take a third approach to sample selection. Our strategy is to define a

consistent criterion in terms of relative per capita income – that is, a threshold value of

per capita income relative to the highest-income country in the first period, 1880-1913 –

and to add additional countries as data on them become available only if they satisfy this

criterion.9 We calculate for the period 1880-1914 the ratio of per capita income in the

lowest income country in the sample for that period (Brazil) to the highest income

country (the United States), which turns out to be 0.6. As data for more countries

become available, we then add all countries whose per capita incomes are at least 60 per

cent of the per capita incomes of the lead country. In 1919-39, for example, the lead


9
 Observations for very low income economies are also limited toward the beginning of the sample period
because many such economies were not then independent countries.


                                                   7
country is again the United States, so we add all countries whose per capita incomes are

at least 60 per cent of U.S. levels for which we have comprehensive data. We do the

same for the Bretton Woods period and again once more for the post-Bretton Woods

years.

     The resulting country sample is shown in Appendix Table A1. One can see how

sample size increases over time, while sample composition is not unduly dominated by

low-income countries which are necessarily omitted at the beginning of our long

historical period. Thus, our analysis of current account reversals should be thought of as

characterizing their incidence and consequences in middle- and high-income countries

(also referred to in the literature as “emerging” and “advanced” markets) but not also in

the poorest countries. Insofar as the economic volatility tends to be higher and

dependence on capital flows is less in the poorest countries, separate analysis of such

countries would seem appropriate. In some of the analysis that follows we compare what

we find using this limited sample for the post-1970 period with results obtained using the

somewhat larger country sample employed by Milesi Ferretti and Razin as a way of

gauging the consequences of our sampling strategy.



3. A Brief History of Current Accounts

         We set the stage for the analysis that follows by first summarizing the historical

behavior of current accounts.

         Two traditional ways of doing so are calculating the mean absolute value of the

current account over some period of time (say, five years) and running Feldstein-Horioka

(1980) regressions of the two components of the current account (investment and




                                              8
savings) on one another. Obstfeld and Taylor (2004) have done this for 15 countries

similar to our pre-1914 sample. They report that the average absolute value of the current

account balance as a share of GDP was between 3 and 4 per cent prior to 1914. The

(absolute) current account remains at a relatively high 3.9 per cent in the immediate post-

World War I years 1919-1926, reflecting the exceptional investment demands associated

with postwar reconstruction (the largest value is for France), but then falls to 2.7 in 1927-

31 and 1.5 in 1932-39, as capital controls are imposed and international financial markets

shut down. The average absolute value of current accounts was small in the Bretton

Woods years, when capital flows were still heavily controlled (1.8 per cent of GDP in

1947-59 and 1.3 per cent in 1960-73), before rising in 1974-89 and 1989-2000 (to 2.2 per

cent and 2.3 per cent, respectively), higher than under Bretton Woods but not the same

levels witnessed before 1914.10

           Obstfeld and Taylor also run a succession of cross section regressions using five-

year averaged data of investment on savings and a constant term. The results are

consistent with the hypothesis that capital mobility and hence the average magnitude of

current account balances traces out a u-shaped pattern over time. The “savings-retention

coefficient” (the estimated effect of savings on investment) is 0.5 until 1914, 0.6-0.7 in

the 1920s, 0.8-0.9 in the 1930s, 0.9 in the Bretton Woods years, and 0.7-0.8 in the post-

Bretton Woods sample. Like the summary statistics in the previous paragraph, this

regression analysis suggests that while capital mobility is higher today than in the third

quarter of the 20th century, it has yet to rescale the peak reached before 1914.11




10
     Obstfeld and Taylor also look at wartime current account balances, which we do not consider here.
11
     Or even to match the levels reached in the 1920s.


                                                       9
           While these results provide a summary measure of ex post capital mobility in a

constant sample of countries, it is not clear that they adequately summarize capital

mobility in the world as a whole, since the number of independent countries – and the

number of middle- as well as high-income countries potentially connected to

international capital markets in particular – is changing over our 12 decades. Bear in

mind, as emphasized above, that we are concerned with middle- and high-income

countries and systematically omit from our sample low-income countries that are

plausibly less connected to international capital markets (and for which data are scarce).

To the extent that our country sample corrects for this, we may paint a somewhat

different picture. A further problem with these estimates is that for almost all of these

cross section estimates of the savings-retention coefficient the confidence levels

overlap.12 While the tendency for this coefficient to be larger toward the middle of the

sample period suggests a u-shaped time profile for capital mobility (high toward the

beginning and end of the period), it is not clear whether the intertemporal differences are

significant – and thus whether the null of a random fluctuations around the average can

be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis of a u-shaped time profile of capital

mobility.

           We may be able to do better insofar as our criterion for selecting countries allows

the sample to expand over time, while still applying consistent conditions for an

observation’s inclusion in the sample. The first column of Table 1 shows the mean

absolute value of current accounts for various subperiods for our sample; column 2 is the

comparison with Obstfeld and Taylor. We still observe a u-shaped pattern, with the

magnitude of current account balances dipping down in 1927-31 and 1932-39. Our
12
     In part, this is presumably a function of the small samples of 12 countries for each point in time.


                                                        10
numbers are essentially the same as Obstfeld and Taylor’s through 1939 but larger for the

recent period. Taken literally, this suggests, contrary to Obstfeld and Taylor, that

international capital markets are more integrated than before 1913, not less.13 The

difference reflects our sampling strategy and our addition of more relatively small

countries with relatively large current account balances, especially in the last subperiod.

Figure 1 provides visual confirmation of these patterns. It is also a reminder, however,

that confidence intervals are wide, so that not too much should be made of these

differences.

        Table 2 is another reminder of this fact. Using a different periodization, it reports

estimates of the associated savings-retention coefficients. The savings-retention

coefficients are 0.58 for the prewar period, 0.88 for interwar period, 0.86 for the Bretton

Woods period, and 0.73 for the post-1971 sample. This methodology and periodization

thus suggests that capital mobility was slightly higher before 1914, although the contrast

here is more muted than in some previous results (see e.g. Bayoumi 1989).

        Thus, our new sample, intended to facilitate summary characterizations of

differences in the extent of global capital mobility over time rather than simply following

an unchanging country sample, broadly confirms the standard historical interpretation but

also provides some new nuances.



4. From Current Accounts to Current Account Reversals

        We now move from current account balances to current account reversals, defined

as episodes in which the current account strengthens sharply, generally moving from


13
  That capital markets are more integrated today than before 1914 is also the conclusion of Bordo,
Eichengreen and Irwin (1999), who use an entirely different approach.


                                                    11
deficit to surplus, in three or fewer years. It is useful at this point to reiterate what was

said in the introduction about why we focus on these episodes. Current account balances

have a number of positive functions that appear in textbooks under the heading of “the

intertemporal approach to the current account” (see for example Obstfeld and Rogoff

1996). If the current account strengthens when output is high and weakens when it is

low, its fluctuation is indicative of a country’s ability to smooth its consumption. An

ongoing current account deficit in a rapidly growing country may also be an indication

that investment and growth are not unduly constrained by domestic savings capacity,

facilitating the country’s convergence to steady state levels of output and capital

intensity. In practice, however, these advantages may be neutralized or dominated if

large or persistent current account deficits increase the likelihood of disruptive

adjustments that produce large output losses.14 Everyone can recall episodes when large

current account deficits ended in the sudden curtailment of financing, sharp compression

of the current account, and a drop in economic growth. Yet, as we have also noted, post-

1970 experience suggests that not all current account reversals end this way. And it is

not obvious a priori that large current account deficits bore the same association with

instability in earlier periods, such as the pre-1914 gold standard years.

        Thus, we wish to determine whether current account reversals were always a

problem – whether they have always been frequent and disruptive. If current account

reversals were not always a problem, then it will be important to establish why.

Hopefully the answer will point to policy measures that can be taken at the national or


14
  This is the warning in the quote from Fischer above to the effect that large current account deficits are
leading indicators of impending problems. His intuition that large current account deficits are leading
indicators of currency and banking crises gains further support from the literature on early warning systems
for emerging markets (Goldstein, Kaminsky and Reinhart 2000).


                                                    12
international levels to tilt the costs and benefits of international capital mobility in

socially desirable directions.

          To identify current account reversals we use the same criteria as MFR. We

construct two variants of their measure, denoted Rev1and Rev2. Rev1 (and Rev2) must

satisfy three criteria: the average current account deficit must fall by 2 (3) per cent of

GDP between the first three and second three years; the maximum deficit in second three

years must be no larger than minimum deficit in first three years; and the average deficit

must fall by at least a third (as a percentage of GDP) between the first three and second

three years. Obviously, the 2 per cent cutoff generates more reversals than the 3 per cent

cutoff.

          A list of the individual reversals for the pre-1970 period, excluding reversals

occurring in consecutive years and reversals occurring in wartime, appears as Appendix

Table A2.



5. Statistical Findings

          Table 3 summarizes the frequency of reversals under the gold standard, the

interwar period, Bretton Woods, and the post-Bretton Woods years. Rev1 (based on two

per cent reductions in the current account deficit relative to the three preceding years)

shows that a lower frequency of reversals under the gold standard than under any of the

subsequent regimes. There are 59 reversal episodes (11 per cent of the period sample of

years) in 1880-1914, 102 episodes (27 per cent of the sample) in 1918-1939, 62 episodes

(12 per cent of the sample) in 1945-72, and 361 episodes (26 per cent of the sample) in

1972-1997. So measured, reversals were relatively infrequent under the gold standard




                                               13
and Bretton Woods but much more frequent during the interwar period and since the

collapse of Bretton Woods. If one excludes reversals occurring in consecutive years,

their number falls to 30, 35, 28 and 101, but the ranking of frequencies (6, 10, 5 and 10

per cent) remains basically unchanged, the main difference being that the Bretton Woods

period looks slightly better than the gold standard years. From the perspective of the

historical literature, these contrasts are not surprising; the interwar years and recent

decades are both periods when there was much commentary about capital flow volatility,

unusually severe recessions and financial crises, all of which may be correlates of current

account reversals.

       To be sure, simple tabulations do not tell us why reversals were more frequent in

some periods than others. Candidate explanations include, inter alia, volatile policies,

volatile financial markets, and a volatile global economic environment. We will consider

these possibilities more directly below.

     Figure 3 shows the number of reversals by year. In the first panel of Figure 3 for

the gold standard, the largest cluster is in the first half of the 1890s following the Baring-

Argentina crisis and the collapse of international lending. In the interwar period,

reversals are spread fairly evenly over the immediate postwar years, the 1920s, and the

early 1930s, reflecting macroeconomic turbulence, shocks to international financial

markets (associated with failed stabilization efforts, reparations disputes and so forth), the

rise in U.S. interest rates in 1928 (which led to the sharp curtailment of foreign lending)

and then onset of the Great Depression and widespread debt default starting in 1931.

Reversals are relatively few in the mid-to-late 1930s, reflecting the widespread adoption

of trade and capital controls through which countries balanced their current accounts and




                                              14
limited their dependence on capital flows. Under Bretton Woods, reversals are

concentrated in the first postwar quinquennium and centered in Europe. This was the

period when postwar foreign aid that had financed current account deficits was drawing

to a close and foreign reserves had been run down, forcing countries to balance their trade

accounts.

        Next we calculated the magnitude of reversals in each period, measured as the

change in the current account/GDP ratio between the three pre-reversal and three post-

reversal years. The magnitude of reversals so measured was 3.13 per cent of GDP under

the gold standard, 6.43 in the interwar years, 3.51 under Bretton Woods, and 5.46 since

the breakdown of that system. Evidently, reversals were largest in the interwar years but

only slightly smaller after 1970. They were smallest under the gold standard, but only

slightly smaller than under Bretton Woods when international capital flows and the

magnitude of feasible current account balances were tightly constrained. The special

nature of gold standard experience compared to the two other periods of high capital

mobility comes through clearly from this comparison.15



15
   As an alternative, we also scaled the change in the current account/GDP ratio by the initial current
account balance (as a share of GDP, where initial is defined as the average over the three years preceding
the event). Since the magnitude of the scaling factor varied across periods, this can be thought of as a
period-specific measure of the magnitude of reversals (one that controls for differences across periods in,
inter alia, the extent of international capital mobility and therefore the size of current account deficits in the
typical pre-reversal period). The change in the current account/GDP ratio in (the three) subsequent years as
a percentage of the initial (three year) current account ratio is 79 per cent, 210 per cent and 190 per cent
and 112 per cent in our four chronologically successive periods. The main difference here is that Bretton
Woods appears as a period of relatively large reversals, so scaled. Of course, the reason reversals appear so
large under Bretton Woods when expressed as a percentage of the initial current account ratio is that those
initial current account deficits were so small, reflecting the prevalence of controls on capital inflows and
the demoralized state of international financial markets. Indeed, there are no very large current account
deficits in the Bretton Woods years comparable to those evident in other periods, and the largest current
account deficits in the Bretton Woods years tend to be concentrated in 1945-50, when there were still
reserves and foreign aid to finance them (see above). The unweighted average of the current account
deficit in the three years preceding the reversal episodes is 3.8 under Bretton Woods, compared to 5.2 in the
interwar period and 5.7 in the post-Bretton Woods years (and 4.9 under the gold standard).


                                                       15
        Table 4 shows summary statistics for GDP growth and the change in growth in

the year of the reversal and windows ranging from one to four years following its

occurrence. Growth is slower in reversal than nonreversal years, and it generally remains

depressed for one or two additional years before bouncing back. Subsequently, growth in

the reversal cases generally exceeds growth in the nonreversal cases, as output lost in the

reversal episodes is made up. The v-shaped output response to reversals has been noted

previously; see for example Calvo (2005).

        Gauged in terms of the difference in growth rates between reversal and

nonreversal years, reversals were less costly – as well as smaller and less frequent – prior

to 1914. Growth was not significantly slower in reversal than nonreversal years before

1914 (the difference in growth rates, of -0.02 per cent, is not significantly different from

zero at standard confidence levels), 2.68 percentage points slower in the interwar years,

and 3.75 percentage points slower in the Bretton Woods years (Rev1 definition). It is

tempting to interpret the growing output costs of reversals as reflecting a secular decline

in wage, price and general economic flexibility over time (see e.g. Bayoumi and

Eichengreen 1996).

        However, the difference in growth rates between reversal and nonreversal years

falls to 1.32 percentage points after 1972, though that difference is still statistically

significant at the 99 per cent confidence level. Note that this is a different intertemporal

pattern than we found for the frequency of reversals and their magnitude, both of which

were greater after 1972 than in the Bretton Woods years. It also becomes hard to identify

differences across regimes when we look at the longer-term impact of reversals (the




                                              16
change in output between the reversal year and the subsequent three years, or between the

year following the reversal and the subsequent four years).16

        Table 5 reports probit regressions designed to shed light on the incidence of

reversals. All independent variables are lagged. Following MFR, most of the

explanatory variables are averaged over the first three years of the six year window in

question to maintain consistency with the definition of reversals themselves.17 Given our

limited degrees of freedom and interest in intertemporal comparisons, we pool the data

for the four periods and include period fixed effects. Since certain countries are

especially prone to reversals in certain periods, we use the cluster option in Stata to adjust

for the fact that the error terms for a particular country in a particular period may not be

independent of one another.18 The regressions come in trios. Within each trio, the first

column reports robust standard errors. The second clusters the observations by countries.

The third then drops the observations for the UK, which we classify as the center country

for part of the period, on the grounds that reversals in a country that either is or recently

was the financial center are a qualitatively different phenomenon.19

        MFR found that reversals are more likely in countries with large current account

deficits, real exchange rates suggesting growing overvaluation, large government deficits,

low per capita incomes, low reserves, high interest rates at the center, high growth at the

center, and high ratios of concessional to total debt. They consider U.S. interest rates and

OECD growth; for the period before 1914, we consider British interest rates and British

   We return to this below.
17
   See the footnote to the relevant table for details.
18
   To be clear, we do not allow for clustering of the error terms for all reversals for, say, Argentina, but for
all reversals for Argentina in a particular period, say, 1880-1913 or 1972-98.
19
   In contrast, we have no reversals for the United States except in the first period, when we take Britain
and not the U.S. as the center country.


                                                       17
growth, while for the interwar period we consider U.S. interest rates and U.S. growth.

Like them, we find some evidence that reversals are more likely in countries with large

current account deficits and large budget deficits, in countries with low per capita GDPs

relative to the lead country (proxying, presumably, for relatively weak institutions and

markets), and in periods when growth rates in the center country are high. We also find

that reversals are more likely in more open economies, where here openness may be

proxying for economic size. Edwards (2005), in another analysis of middle- and high-

income countries, similarly finds that reversals are more likely in relatively small,

relatively open economies.

        It is important to mention some of the variables that do not show up as consistently

significant. For example, some studies of recent decades have found that reversals are

more likely when the exchange rate is pegged, presumably making it more difficult to

adjust relative prices prior to the event (Edwards 2004b). Here the coefficient estimates

for whether or not the exchange rate is pegged display never approach statistical

significance at standard confidence levels.20 Similarly, the last three columns of the table

add a dummy variable for capital controls. There is some evidence that the maintenance

of controls limits the incidence of reversals, although this variable again is not

statistically significant at conventional confidence levels.21


20
   We replicated MFR’s result when we used our sample of countries but limited the observations to the
post-1972 period, but not otherwise.
21
   We found essentially the same thing for the four subperiods estimated separately (in results not reported
here), although significance levels vary. For the gold standard period, large prior current account deficits,
large prior budget deficits, and low GDP per capita are the most robust and statistically significant
determinants of reversal incidence. For the interwar period, reversals are more likely in countries with
lower GDP per capita, large prior current account deficits and budget deficits and no capital controls. For
the Bretton Woods period, countries with terms of trade improvement and large current account deficits are
more likely to experience reversals. For the post 1970 sample, large prior current account deficit and
having a peg are the main determinants of reversals. We also ran our specification using the MFR sample
of countries in the post-1970 period. The main difference is that the GDP per capita changes sign such that


                                                     18
         Another noteworthy feature of Table 5 is that the dummy variables for the gold

standard and Bretton Woods periods are negative and significant (the post-1972 years are

the omitted alternative). Recall that we found above that reversals were less frequent

under the gold standard and Bretton Woods than in the interwar and post-1972 periods.

These coefficients are telling us that this difference is not fully explained by differences

in observable country characteristics (the size of the initial imbalances, the fiscal stance,

the global growth enrivonment etc.) but that it is at least partially explicable in terms of

other factors that we are not capturing here.

         Table 6 turns to the consequences of current account reversals. The dependent

variable is growth over three years, starting with the year of the reversal, as a deviation

from the world average for that same three-year period following the reversal onset.22

The explanatory variables include the size of the reversal and a vector of controls (except

where indicated otherwise, averaged over the 3 years preceding the event). Again, the

data are pooled and estimated with period fixed effects. The first two columns show

ordinary least squares regressions with robust standard errors. Columns 3 through 6 then

cluster the observations by country within each period.

         The results suggest that reversals were relatively costly when a large current

account deficit had been allowed to emerge and the real exchange rate was allowed to

become significantly overvalued in the preceding period. In addition, we consider a

countries with relatively high per capita incomes are more likely to experience reversals. (Note that the
MFR sample does not include the advanced-industrial countries, so this result is telling us – consistent with
intuition – that within the sample of emerging markets the higher-income EMs more integrated into
international capital markets are more subject to reversals). The main difference between these two pooled
regressions is that the one using the MFR countries for the post-1970 period shows a positive sign on the
interwar dummy (although one that varies in significance across specifications).
22
   It makes little difference if we instead define the dependent variable as the growth rate in the subject
country over the three year period and include the global growth rate over the same period as another
independent variable on the right hand side. In this case the main difference is that the dummy variable for
Bretton Woods becomes positive (although it remains insignificant).


                                                     19
dummy variable for whether the current account was in deficit or surplus in the pre-

reversal period, since in some of our cases the event in question is one in which a small

current account surplus becomes much larger, and it can be argued that in this case the

output effects may be easier to accommodate. The results are consistent with this

hypothesis. Finally, we added a dummy variable for the presence of controls on capital

account transactions on the grounds that such controls may limit capital flight in the wake

of the reversal, again moderating the output effects. The results are consistent with this

intuition: output losses are smaller when the current account is already in surplus in the

pre-reversal period and capital controls are present. But again the addition of these

variables does not alter our earlier findings.

       An additional result is that a number of period dummies show up as statistically

significant. A negative (positive) sign means that growth was slower and output losses

were larger (growth was faster and output losses were smaller) in the period in question:

thus we find smaller output losses under the gold standard but larger output losses in the

interwar and Bretton Woods periods than in the omitted post-1972 alternative after

controlling for other observed characteristics of countries and the global environment

(that is, after controlling for the values of the independent variables). Recall that the

simple tabulation of output losses in different periods showed the same thing. That we

see the same pattern here suggests that the other explanatory variables such as the size of

the initial current account imbalance, the overvaluation of the real exchange rate or the

presence or absence of capital controls do not explain why the typical output loss from

reversals was smaller in some periods than in others.




                                                 20
       This result sits uneasily with the cases in Section 6 below, which show that the

output effects of current account reversals under the gold standard could be substantial.

Eyeballing the data suggests that prior to 1914 the drop in output only commenced after a

year or more, whereas after 1971 it more commonly set in immediately. An explanation

for this different pattern is the greater incidence of currency crises after 1971, as noted

above, and the tendency for output to fall with the onset of a crisis. Consistent with this

conjecture, Bordo and Eichengreen (2003) identify currency crises coincident with only 7

per cent of the current account reversals occurring before 1914 but coincident with 12 per

cent of the reversals occurring after 1971.

       To determine whether the results were sensitive to this timing, we redefined the

output response as the change in GDP not between year t (the year of the reversal) and

t+3 but between year t+1 and t+4. When we do this, the negative coefficient on the gold

standard dummy is no longer significantly different from zero. (The other results are

unchanged.) This suggests that not too much weight should be attached to the results in

Table 6 suggesting that the output losses from reversals were smaller under the gold

standard. Reversals may have been less frequent and smaller, but when they occurred

their output effects could still be severe, especially when they were accompanied by a

currency crisis. (See the next section.)

       In comparison, a variety of further sensitivity analyses had little impact on the

results. For example, when we added a vector of country fixed effects, the basic results

continue to hold. We also experimented with a number of additional explanatory

variables. For instance, a potential explanation for why the output effects of reversals

were smaller in some periods than others is that the reversals themselves were smaller.




                                              21
We therefore added the size of the reversal (measured here as the change in the current

account ratio between time t-3 and time t) as an additional explanatory variable. This has

plausible effects; for example, it lowers the significance level on the gold standard

dummy in Table 6, suggesting that one reason that the output losses associated with

current account reversals were smaller under the gold standard is that the magnitude of

the reversals themselves were smaller. However, the new coefficient is not statistically

different from zero, and the other results are little affected by its addition. Finally, we

followed Edwards (2004a) in estimating treatment regressions, first an equation for

current account reversals and then a second stage regression that treats the reversal

variable as endogenous.23 The results, in Table 7, are consistent with their predecessors.

Reversals are more likely in countries that had been running large external deficits in the

immediately preceding period and where growth was slow. They continue to cause

significant output losses, although output begins bouncing back relatively quickly.

          In sum, the results here suggest that the gold-standard period was different:

current account reversals were less frequent and smaller than they have become

subsequently, although when they did occur their output effects could be substantial. The

years since 1972 do not compare unfavorably in these respects with the 1920s and 1930s;

if anything the opposite is true. But reversals today are more frequent and larger than

they were before 1914. Obvious measures of country characteristics and global

economic conditions do not seem to account for this difference. This motivates us to

look more closely at a number of episodes of sharp current account reversals before 1913

to see whether this can help us to understand better what is going on.

23
  In the first stage, probit estimates of the treatment equation are obtained. From these estimates a hazard is
then computed. In the second stage, the hazard is included in the estimation of the outcome equation. This
augmented outcome equation lets us get consistent estimates of the regression disturbance term.

6. Case Studies

         In this section we consider three prominent pre-1914 current account reversals:

Argentina in 1889-90, Australia in 1891-2, Brazil in 1896-7.

         A. Argentina 1889-90. The 1880s was a golden decade for Argentina. The

wool and wheat producers of the pampas were integrated into world markets by the

construction of ports and railways.24 Argentina already had 2,500 kilometers of railroad

track in 1880, and its ample endowment of productive land promised the traffic to

support many more. Labor arrived in abundance; slow growth in Europe, depressed

conditions in that continent’s agrarian economies, and cheap international passenger rates

combined to encourage more than one million immigrant arrivals between 1880 and

1890. (Argentine government propaganda and subsidies for travel costs did not hurt.)

While only some two thirds of these immigrants settled permanently, this was a very

large increase in labor supply for a country with an 1880 population of only two million.

         Britons in particular were galvanized by the attractions of investment in this

economy: new capital calls in London on behalf of the country rose from little more than

£½ million a year between 1875 and 1880 to nearly £5 million a year between 1881 and

1885 and then £17.5 million annually between 1886 and 1890.25 The British lent for

railway construction, for the improvement of port facilities, for the development of urban

infrastructure (most of the immigrants of the 1880s settling in the cities), and for the

system of ranches and meatpacking plants that allowed the exportation of canned and,

eventually, chilled beef. They were active participants in the real estate, securities

24
  Wheat was first exported in 1878.

European investment in Argentina in this period; see Ford (1962).

market, and banking booms of the period, and they lent extensively to politically-

connected provisional mortgage banks.

       While domestic and foreign economic events go some way toward explaining

these developments, their timing cannot be understood without reference to the political

consolidation that occurred in Argentina in the 1880s. This was the period when the

central state, bolstered by recent military victories, asserted its authority over the

provinces and the economy. The rebellion of the province of Buenos Aires was defeated

in 1880, and the city was transformed into the federal capital. The state then established

dominion over the regions inhabited by indigenous peoples. The territorial limits of the

nation were, for the first time, clearly defined. Starting in 1880 a new institutional

framework was created based on strong presidential power, checks and balances

exercised by the congress, and prohibition of presidential reelection. A uniform national

money was finally established. Basic fiscal, administrative and judicial powers were

defined (Botana 1997). Although Romero (2002) remarks that some of these powers

were more notional than real, it is clear that this picture did much to enhance investor

confidence in the administrative capacity of the state. And this in turn facilitated foreign

finance for Argentina’s twin deficits.

       Thus, the growth of the current account deficit in the 1880s resulted from a

combination of domestic economic and political factors. Investment was encouraged by

the exceptional commercial opportunities afforded by a period of geographical

expansion, integration into world markets, large-scale immigration, and political

consolidation; meanwhile the working-age population was increasingly dominated by

recent immigrants as yet in no position to support high savings rates. The central




                                              24
government reinforced the disparity by undertaking public investment projects while

running deficits. For better or worse, the consolidation of the state in the 1880s and the

extensive guarantees provided for private investment (investments in railways in

particular) encouraged foreigners to help finance the difference.26 Not least among the

beneficiaries was the government itself, which could borrow abroad in order to finance

public spending on projects that benefited its clients. Cronyism similarly prevailed in the

provinces, whose governments used provincial banks to contract foreign loans and use

the proceeds to extend credit to the provincial government.

           Maintenance of this fragile equilibrium depended on two conditions. First, there

was a considerable gestation period between the initial investment in export-oriented

infrastructure and the coming on line of exports. Keeping current in the interim on short-

run debt-service obligations hinged on the willingness of foreign investors to provide a

steady stream of bridge finance. Between 1885 and 1890, as Ford (1962, p.87) observes,

“to some considerable extent foreign borrowings were employed in paying service

charges on previous foreign loans…” One potential explanation for why current account

reversals were smaller and less frequent than in subsequent periods is that current account

deficits reflected high levels of export-oriented infrastructure investment – that is, foreign

capital was devoted to uses that generated additional export revenues that could be used

to make debt service payments in the normal course of events (see Feis 1930, Fishlow

1986, and the discussion above). Analysis of the Argentine case suggests that this factor

may be subject to exaggeration. Natural complementarities there may have been, but

gestation periods were long.



26
     Money finance contributed also, Argentina having gone off the gold standard in 1884.


                                                      25
       Second, this happy equilibrium hinged on the credibility of the government’s

commitments. Paying out on its guarantees required a healthy rise in public-sector

revenues; here the gestation period between the initial investment projects and the

induced rise in economic activity again posed a problem. Insofar as some of the projects

that the government guaranteed were of low quality – they were likely to neither pay for

themselves nor to induce an increase in revenues through other channels – the authorities

might find themselves unable to uphold their part of the bargain. At that point, capital

inflows might dry up, forcing the current account deficit to be compressed.

       Thus, the Argentine episode displays many of the characteristics identified in the

preceding analyses as raising the likelihood of current account reversals and heightening

their output effects, prominent among them large budget and current account deficits in

the run-up to the event. In addition, explanations for the Argentine crisis in this period

invoke two factors also emphasized in modern studies that do not show up in other gold-

standard era reversals: tight credit conditions and slowing growth in the center. The

importing country on which Argentina depended most heavily, Great Britain, experienced

a cyclical peak in 1885, and its economy remained officially in recession through 1889

(the latter being the conventionally-dated business cycle trough). This made growing

Argentine exports more difficult. At the same time, the stability of British savings rates

and hence the inverse fluctuation of home and foreign investment (Cairncross 1953)

meant that ample British capital was available to Argentina and other contemporary

emerging markets from the middle of the decade.

       But these same relationships rendered Argentina vulnerable to a decline in the

availability of finance when British growth began to accelerate and investment picked up




                                             26
starting in 1889, and when the Bank of England began raising rates. Overall, the 1880s

was a decade of low interest rates, reflecting relatively weak investment demand in

Europe. Goshen’s 1888 debt conversion took advantage of this fact and put further

downward pressure on yields. Low interest rates encouraged investors to look abroad for

higher yields. As Bailey (1959, p.272) put it, London and Edinburgh were soon

“honeycombed with agencies” for collecting money for overseas investments. But in

1889, the cyclical trough had passed, and British activity began to accelerate. The Bank

of England ratcheted up its discount rate sharply, from 2 ½ to 6 per cent over the second

half of the year. It is not surprising that this led to a decline in new issues in London on

behalf of Argentina and made it difficult for Barings to place the Buenos Aires Water

Supply and Drainage Loan. Foreign financial factors clearly played a role in this current

account reversal, although it can perhaps be argued that it would have occurred, with or

without sharp changes in the Bank of England’s discount rate.27

        With the failure of the Buenos Aires waterworks loan and the distress experienced

by Barings, lending to Argentina ground to a halt. Reversing the current account balance

was painful when the prior deficit was so large and the government budget was in deficit.

Successive governments struggled, with little success, to balance the budget through a

combination of tax increases and expenditure reductions and thereby limit the need for

monetization and inflation. The need to compress imports in order to facilitate current

account adjustment further complicated this task, since import duties were the single

most import source of revenues for the federal government. Moreover, compressing

imports by 50 per cent in 1891 and then boosting exports required sharp depreciation of


27
  Given its prominence in this case, just why the British discount rate does not show up more generally in
our regressions explaining the incidence of current account reversals remains a something of a mystery.


                                                    27
the real exchange rate, which further eroded domestic living standards and depressed

consumption. Real GDP contracted by 4 per cent in 1890 and by a further 11 per cent in

1891 before bouncing back to plus 9 per cent in 1892 and 5 per cent in 1893. Thus, by

the end of 1893 output was roughly back up to where it had been in 1889.28 Still, this

was a large output drop by the standards of contemporary current account reversals,

reflecting the unfavorable initial conditions.

         On the other hand, this was not an exceptionally long recession; that growth was

again positive little more than two years after the reversal was not atypical.29 Historians

point to a number of factors helping to avert a more extended recession. Argentina

avoided having to compress demand still more sharply and to move the current account

into surplus even further by restructuring its debt, first suspending payments, then

obtaining a bridge loan through the Rothschild Committee sufficient to finance the

federal government’s debt service for three years, securing a reduction of debt service

and holiday on amortization payments, and finally assuming the provincial debt at less

than 60 per cent of its face value.30 As a region of overseas European settlement

dominated by recent immigrant arrivals, labor exhibited an unusual degree of

intersectoral mobility, moving smoothly from the production of nontraded to traded

goods in response to the depreciation of the real exchange rate.31 World demand

conditions were favorable; export prices rose over much of the 1890s, and there was a




28
   Living standards and imports in particular remained below earlier levels, however (Argentine imports not
again reaching1889 levels until 1904).
29
   Fishlow (1989b) observes that “the data on railway receipts are suggestive of a less severe and prolonged
downturn than other peripheral economies experienced during the 1890s.”
30
   Perhaps not too much should be claimed of this factor, for these negotiations took many years to
complete and were a pervasive source of demoralizing financial uncertainty while still underway.
31
   Fishlow (1989a,b) emphasizes labor market flexibility as a factor in adjustment.

positive technology shock with the coming on line of large scale exports of chilled beef.32

Some of these factors are policies that governments might attempt to pursue in order to

cope with current account reversals. But others reflect factors having to do with the

structure of markets and the development of technology over which they have little

control.

         B. Brazil 1896-7. Brazil’s reversal took place later than Argentina’s, although it

was affected by the same global economic and financial developments. Between 1886

and 1890 Brazil imported only about 40 per cent as much British capital as Argentina,

despite enjoying the same low global interest rates. In part this reflected the prevailing

commitment to fiscal orthodoxy and the desire to restore the milreis to its official 1846

par; this more conservative fiscal stance limited the magnitude of the subsequent twin

deficits. In part the difference reflected the fact that Brazilian publicity and propaganda

were less effective. It took the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the end of the monarchy

in 1889 to really put the country on the “radar screen” of international investors.33

         As in Argentina, the government then used fiscal largess to buy and maintain the

political support of the military and the provinces. In the Brazilian case there was also

the fact that the abolition of slavery imposed financial losses on powerful agricultural

interests. The latter sought preferential access to cheap credit to compensate for the

capital losses suffered as a result of emancipation.34 Thus, following the proclamation of

the republic in 1889, domestic interest rates were kept low and the exchange rate was

allowed to depreciate. Sauce for the goose being sauce for the gander, financial

32
   While Cardoso (1989) emphasizes this factor in explaining Argentina’s recovery from the 1890-92 crisis,
in reality it comes a bit late to explain the questions at hand here (Argentina exports of chilled beef rise to
significant levels only in the second half of the 1890s).
33
   To be sure, British investors had preferred Brazil earlier in the 19th century, but not in the 1880s.

preferences were extended to industry as well. The speculative boom which resulted

from the ample provision of credit, financed partly by domestic money creation and

partly by foreign borrowing, is known in the Brazilian literature as the Encilhamento. So

soon after the abolition of slavery, and with continuing political uncertainty, domestic

conditions were not conducive to high domestic savings rates. The investment

encouraged by the ample availability of credit thus bequeathed chronic current account

deficits.

        It is striking, given the recent literature on contagion, that Brazil did not

experience a current account reversal, as we measure the phenomenon, at this time. As

Cardoso and Dornbusch (1989) note, negative financial spillovers from Argentina to

Brazil were limited. Part of the explanation, for this as for many things Brazilian, is

coffee prices, which strengthened from 1890. But another part may lie in the fact that

Brazil satisfies less well the leading indicators of vulnerability to a current account

reversal. While current account deficits were chronic, they were not allowed to widen to

the same extent as in Argentina; Brazil was never the darling of foreign investors to the

same extent. Although the commitment to fiscal orthodoxy weakened after the 1880s,

the legacy lived on; budget deficits were never allowed to explode as they did in

Argentina. Less pressure of demand meant less tendency toward overvaluation, which

further slowed the development of a patently unsustainable external position. As a result

the country retained limited capital market access: Brazil was able to contract new loans

in London, most prominently in 1893 and 1895 but also a short-term advance in 1896.

        In this manner Brazil staggered into the second half of the 1890s. Limited capital

market access to finance ongoing deficits allowed the debt to continue rising, which




                                              30
inevitably contributed to growing unease on the part of foreign investors. After 1893,

coffee prices weakened, bringing the situation to a head. By 1896 funding for the current

account deficit had dried up. The trade balance swung from a deficit of a bit less than

one per cent of GDP to a surplus of more than five percent, reflecting the magnitude of

ongoing debt service obligations. Like Argentina before it, Brazil now secured a funding

loan from its London bankers, in this case sufficient to cover the central government’s

interest payments for three years. In addition amortization obligations were suspended

for 13 years. Fishlow (1989a) notes that since the effective debt write-down was less

than in Argentina (where the issue had been forced by the government’s unilateral

suspension of payments), reliance on internal adjustment measures was necessarily

greater. The budgetary problem was addressed by raising tax rates and extending them to

new products, imposing surcharges on customs duties, and renting the federal railways to

private enterprises. The exchange rate was stabilized by withdrawing Treasury notes

from circulation, as required by the conditions attached to the funding loan.

       This sharp deflation, presided over by Finance Minister Joaquim Murtinho,

sharply compressed domestic demand. Imports fell, partly owing to depressed demand

but also due to the import surcharges, while more domestic production was freed up for

export. Trade deficits gave way to ongoing surpluses, which grew larger after 1900. But

the greater reliance in Brazil on deflationary adjustment measures also meant that the

output effects of the reversal were as severe as in Argentina, notwithstanding the fact that

prior conditions would have indicated a less severe recession. Adjustment took place

mainly through the collapse of investment; the trade statistics show a sharp decline in

imports of industrial equipment. National income estimates suggest that GDP declined




                                            31
by 10 per cent in 1897 and 5 per cent in 1898, mirroring the 1890-1 contraction in

Argentina, before stabilizing in 1899, and then beginning to grow again quite sharply

starting in 1900, aided by strengthening coffee prices and the coming on line of rubber

exports (although not soon enough to prevent a crisis in a banking system severely

weakened by preceding events).

       Thus, the Brazilian case is a reminder that the output effects of a current account

reversal depend not just on inherited macroeconomic and financial conditions but also on

how the reversal is managed.

       C. Australia 1891-2. In Australia, whose reversal was bracketed temporally by

those of Argentina and Brazil, the government resorted to neither currency depreciation

nor default. While many of the other circumstances surrounding this episode were

similar to those in Argentina and Brazil, imperial identity meant that default and

depreciation were essentially inconceivable. Even more than in Brazil, then, the burden

of adjustment fell on the domestic economy. In Australia, GDP fell for four years

running, from 1890 through 1893, not “just” two. The cumulative fall was on the order

of 25 per cent, not “just” 15. Unemployment rose sharply. Immigration slowed and

tentatively reversed direction. Social disorder spread, led by protesting sheep shearers,

dock workers, and miners. Post-1893 recovery, if it may be called that, was slow and

uneven. A summary measure of the severity of the consequent recession is the

comparison with Argentina: whereas Argentine real GDP doubled between 1890 and

1905 according to the conventional national income statistics, Australian GDP in 1905

was a mere 20 per cent above what it had been a decade and a half before. This is

especially impressive given that the absolute swing in the trade balance ratio, from -2.0




                                            32
per cent of GDP in the three pre-reversal years to +0.4 per cent of GDP in the year of the

event, was small by the standards of the other countries we are considering.

        Australia had been experiencing an investment boom, based in substantial part on

investment by nonresidents, off and on since the gold rushes of 1851. Much of this

overseas finance was devoted to speculative assets, including pastoral and urban land.

Like the government of Argentina, the governments of Queensland and New South

Wales subsidized the fares of immigrants. Self-reinforcing capital and labor inflows

fanned a speculative building boom. The urban land boom came to a head in the 1880s,

fueled by rapid increases in mortgage lending by savings banks. As a share of GDP,

bank credit (much of which was backed by foreign liabilities) doubled between 1880 and

1890. The majority of the increase went into residential construction, since the rate of

return on pastoral activities was declining and the ‘eighties was a decade of urbanization.

Land and housing prices shot up in Melbourne in particular.

        As in Argentina and Brazil, these developments were not unrelated to the

activities of government, the individual colonial governments in particular. The

Australian colonies competed with one another to attract both labor and capital,

borrowing to build railways into the interior and providing urban amenities to appeal to

recent settlers. As McLean (1996) puts it, many of these investment projects were based

on overly optimistic assessments of the agricultural potential of the semi-arid regions of

the interior (reflecting temporarily favorable climatic conditions).35 In the second half of

the 1880s, they reflected the tendency for low interest rates in Britain to encourage

relatively indiscriminate borrowing and lending. So long as growth prospects were rosy,


35
   Very much the same syndrome, reflecting the same climatic conditions, was evident in the United States
at this time.


                                                   33
government guarantees for the bonds underwriting the investments were credible. And,

of course, these projects were associated with large current account deficits reflecting the

propensity to import locomotives, steel rail, and a wide range of other investment goods.

       The stop to lending that followed the Baring Crisis was more pronounced in

Australia than in Brazil. Capital inflows fell from £20 million in 1888 to £1 million in

1893. It is tempting to speculate that British investors were impressed by the similar

resource endowments of the two pastoral economies and revised their expectations

accordingly – although the fact that the curtailment of lending and current account

reversal took place fully a year after the Baring Crisis is difficult to reconcile with this

hypothesis. Given that “the imperial and Commonwealth tie” (in the language of Lindert

and Morton 1989) closed off other options, harsh deflationary policies became the order

of the day. There was no depreciation of the currency. Rather, relative prices had to

adjust through a grinding downward movement of wages and costs. Demand was

compressed by tight credit, which discouraged consumption and, in particular,

investment. Capital formation fell from £34 million in 1888 to £16 million in 1892 and

£9 million in 1893. State budgets were brought into rapid balance, further compressing

demand. Despite the stop to borrowing, government debt as a share of GDP rose sharply

with declining nominal income through the middle of the 1890s. Meanwhile, there was

no relief from the interest burden like that obtained by Argentina (and no delay of

amortization like that enjoyed by Brazil): debt service continued to account for nearly 10

per cent of GDP. This meant that imports had to be compressed sharply. In contrast,

exports were maintained at previous levels (unlike Argentina and Brazil, they did not rise

significantly in the wake of the reversal, presumably reflecting the stagnation of the




                                              34
economy). Reflecting the impact of deflation, the export share rose from 20 to 28 per

cent of GDP in the first half of the 1890s.

       The story would not be complete without reference to the drought that started in

1895, which nipped the economy’s recovery in the bud. What coffee was to Brazil, wool

was to Australia, and the drought of the mid-1890s had a devastating impact on the

pastoral economy. Thus, climate and not simply policy may explain why recovery in

Australia was so difficult and long in coming. However, drought was not an exclusively

Australian phenomenon in the 1890s, so the decline in pastoral production was offset to

an extent by strong prices. In addition, drought in 1895 cannot explain why the economy

contracted so persistently and severely between 1890 and 1893. Here the fact that the

domestic economy was forced to shoulder the entire burden of adjustment to the current

account reversal cannot be denied.



7. Conclusion

       In this paper we have presented some new facts and a mystery. The new facts

concern the pre-1970 history of international capital flows and current account reversals.

Analyzing a sample of countries with per capita GDPs at least 60 per cent those of the

lead country and measuring reversals in a consistent way, we find that the incidence of

reversals has been unusually great in recent years. The only prior period that matched the

last three decades in terms of the frequency and magnitude of reversals was the 1920s

and 1930s, decades notorious for the instability of capital flows. In contrast, reversals

were both less common and smaller in the Bretton Woods and pre-World War I gold

standard eras.




                                              35
       That the Bretton Woods years were different is no surprise: capital controls were

widespread and financial flows across borders were suppressed. Current account

reversals were fewer because current account deficits were smaller, reflecting this limited

finance. At the same time, when reversals did occur, their effects could be severe.

       That reversals were relatively few and small before 1914 is striking, given the

absence of impediments to capital flows and the large size of current account balances.

This finding is clearly related to the much commented upon smooth operation of the

prewar gold standard. Cross-country regressions and case studies alike suggest that the

same observable characteristics of countries (large current account and budget deficits in

the run-up, followed by negative shocks to growth at home and abroad) help to explain

the incidence of reversals both before 1914 and after 1971. But controlling for these

characteristics of countries and reversal periods does not make the contrast between the

gold standard and recent years go away. Ultimately, why reversals were not more

frequent and larger in the period of open capital markets a century ago is still a mystery.

To put it another way, the smooth operation of the classical gold standard remains be

explained.

Note: Dependent variable takes the value 1 if a reversal of at least 2 % takes place and 0
otherwise. Standard errors in parentheses,* significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; ***
significant at 1%. All the explanatory variables are lagged once. The variable trade
balance to GDP ratio is averaged over the three years before the event to maintain
consistency with the definition of reversals. Government surplus to GDP, world interest
rate and growth rates are levels.
