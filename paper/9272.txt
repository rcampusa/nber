                                            ABSTRACT


        Using interindustry transaction in input-output tables, we examine Information Technology
(IT) externalities in U.S. private industries over the period 1984-2000. Our empirical results show
that computerization of an industry’s customer and supplier industries reduces both labor and
material costs of the industry. Moreover, cost savings driven by supplier industries are larger than
those driven by customer industries. We also find that industries in the services sector enjoy more
benefits from IT spillovers than industries in other sectors because of their high IT capital intensity
and composition of interindustry transaction. Decomposition of total factor productivity (TFP)
suggests that IT externalities can explain considerable parts of TFP growth, although possible
mismeasurement of output in services industries leads to exacerbated technical changes of services
industries.

1. Introduction


           The rapid innovation in Information Technology (IT) over the past few decades has led to

substantial changes in the U.S. economy. Modern economic activities are largely carried out with

the help of IT. One characteristic of IT capital distinguishing itself from a traditional capital

investment is its wide diffusion across industries and the broad range of its application.

Manufacturing industries operate computer-integrated manufacturing system to link design,

production, and management together for the efficient use of their resources. With the help of IT,

many services are customized and are provided just in time. There are many other areas of IT

application, such as management of inventories and human resources, accurate decision making

based on instant market data, effective control of supply chain, and so on.

           With advanced communication technology, IT enhances the sphere of its application even

further. IT and communication technology make it possible for firms to interact with others in a

faster and more efficient way.1 The network effect of IT has been emphasized as one of the key

factors for assessing the value of IT by many researchers (Bresnahan, 2001; Brynjolfsson and

Hitt, 2000; Inoue, 1998). The IT network not only facilitates communication between firms but

also helps to streamline their production processes and lower transaction costs. Therefore,

another feature of IT capital that distinguishes it from other traditional inputs is that IT capital

may generate considerable economic externalities.

           A network externality exists when the efficiency of products or services increases as

products or services are adopted by more users. There are two types of network externality,

direct and indirect network effects (Katz and Shapiro, 1985). The direct network effect comes

from an increase in users, while the indirect effect comes from the development of applications.

    See Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2000) for case examples.


                                                          1
Both direct and indirect network effects also have a significant influence on the diffusion and

usage of IT.

       There are some studies which empirically investigate whether a product exhibits network

externalities. Gandal (1994), for example, tested the existence of network externalities in the

computer spreadsheets market. He showed that consumers are willing to pay more for a

spreadsheet which is compatible with others. Brynjofsson and Kemerer (1996) also analyzed the

microcomputer spreadsheet market using a hedonic model to determine the effect of network

externalities. They found that the size of a product’s installed base, a key factor in network

externalities, indeed significantly affects the price of the product.

       In addition to network externalities associated with IT, we may think of another type of

externalities of IT, the so called knowledge spillovers (learning effect). The adoption of IT

deeply involves innovations in the production process and organizational changes (Brynjolfsson

and Hitt, 2000). The knowledge that enables a firm or an industry to adopt advanced technology

successfully will naturally spill over to other firms or industries (Romer, 1986).

       The one key element in both network and learning effects is interaction among IT users.

For the production sector, the interaction among agents can be observed as a transaction between

firms or industries. For example, Economides (1996) stressed that vertical relations among firms

can play a critical role in network and learning effects. In a similar vein, assessing IT

externalities between industries, we need to take into account the industrial interdependence

characterized by interindustry transaction.

       In this paper, we construct IT spillover stocks available to an industry that are a weighted

sum of IT capital stock of other industries using weight equal to interindustry transaction. In

doing so, we distinguish the IT spillover stocks into two kinds: one from intermediate inputs




                                                   2
supplier industries and the other from customer industries. Then, we estimate a variable cost

function with the IT spillover stocks using the data on 42 U.S. private industries from 1984 to

2000. The results show that the IT spillover stocks reduce variable costs of all industries.

Furthermore, IT externalities driven by intermediate input suppliers are larger and more

significant than IT externalities driven by customers. Comparing industries, we find that benefits

of IT spillovers are greater in the services industries than in other industries not only because of

their high IT capital intensity but also because of their transaction patterns. In the analysis of the

long-run effect of the IT spillover stocks, we find that the demand for own IT capital of an

industry is significantly affected by the IT demand of customer and supplier industries. Finally,

our decomposition of total factor productivity (TFP) growth suggests that the IT spillover effects

can explain considerable parts of the measured TFP growth.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 constructs the IT spillover stocks.

Section 3 explains the empirical framework. Section 4 describes the data. Section 5 presents

estimation results and section 6 concludes the paper.



2. Measurement of IT Spillover Stock


        Constructing IT spillover stocks incorporating linkages among industries, we use an

interindustry transaction matrix in input-output tables. The interindustry transactions can be

divided into intermediate input demand from other industries and output supply to other

industries which, are also referred to as backward and forward linkages, respectively (Hirschman,

1958). 2 For example, the intermediate input purchase of industry A from industry B is the

backward linkage of industry A, while industry A’s sales of its output to industry C is the forward
2
 Terleckyj (1974) and Wolff and Nadiri (1993) also use the interindustry flow matrix to examine the effect of R&D
spillovers on productivity growth.


                                                        3
linkage of industry A. Therefore, industry B and C are an intermediate input supplier and

customer industries of industry A, respectively.

       Since there is no reason to assume from the backward and forward linkages of an

industry that IT spillovers are the same, we construct two types of IT spillover stocks, SOB and

SOF . SOB represents the IT spillover stock available through intermediate input supplier

industries (backward linkages), while SOF represents the IT spillover stock available through

customer industries (forward linkages). We assume that the IT spillover stock from industry j to

industry i increases as industry j supplies its product relatively more than other industries do to

industry i. Then, the IT spillover stock of industry i through intermediate input supplier

industries is given by:



                                                     a ij j
                                      SOBi = ∑           KO ,                                    (1)
                                              j ≠i   xi




where a ij is the value of industry i’s intermediate input purchased from industry j, xi is the total

value of industry i’s interindustry transaction including both demand and supply transactions,

and K Oj is the IT capital stock owned by industry j. Therefore, SOBi depends not only on the size

of other industries’ IT capital stocks but also on the transaction matrix of industry i. In the

extreme case, if industry i does not need any intermediate input from industry j, then the IT

spillover from industry j will be zero no matter how large the IT stock of industry j is.

       Similarly, we construct IT spillover stock available through an industry’s customer

industries. Assuming that the size of IT spillover from industry j to i increases as industry j




                                                     4
purchases the product of industry i relatively more than other industries do, the IT spillover stock

for industry i through customer industries is given by:



                                                             bij j
                                             SOFi = ∑           KO ,                                             (2)
                                                      j ≠i   xi



where bij is the value of industry i’s sales to industry j.3 Therefore, the IT spillover stocks, SOB

and SOF , provide us two different sources of IT externalities. 4 SOB will capture the IT

externality from computerization of supplier industries, while SOF will grasp the IT externality

from computerization of customer industries.

        Table 1 presents each industry’s own IT capital stock ( K O ) and two IT spillover stocks

( SOB and SOF ) in 1984 and in 2000. From the first and the second column, the own IT capital

stocks increased very rapidly for all industries from 1984 to 2000. Roughly speaking, the own IT

capital stocks in 2000 are about 9-10 times larger than those in 1984 for all industries.

Examining the own IT capital stocks across industries, we can notice that services industries,

such as wholesale trade, bank and security, and business services, are the major IT using

industries. In fact, the IT capital stocks of services industries can explain most of total IT capital

stock in the U.S. private economy. Since our IT spillover stocks are weighted by transaction flow

between industries, the concentration of IT capital in services industries implies that industries

which transact more with service industries have larger IT spillover stocks. Within the

denominator in weights for both SOB and SOF . Therefore, the sum of ∑ i and ∑ i is equal to one.

  We will omit industry superscript for simplicity from this point.

manufacturing sector, industrial machinery and equipment and electronic and other electric

equipment use relatively more IT capital than other manufacturing industries.



                                                [Table 1]



       Columns 3 to 6 in Table 1 present the IT spillover stocks from the backward linkage

( SOB ) and the forward linkage ( SOF ) of industries constructed by equations (1) and (2). Due to

the fast growth of IT capital stocks in all industries, the IT spillover stocks also grew rapidly.

Comparing SOB and SOF in 2000, we come up with some interesting findings. First, thirty two

out of forty two industries have larger SOB than SOF . This difference comes from both the

proportion of intermediate input demand in total interindustry transaction and how much an

industry transacts with IT-intensive industries, particularly with services industries. Second,

SOF is generally smaller in manufacturing industries than in services industries, while SOB

shows little difference between manufacturing and services industries. Unlike backward linkages,

forward linkages of manufacturing industries are not as diversified as those of service industries.

For example, more than 50 percent of the interindustry sale of furniture and fixtures industry are

demanded by the construction industry. Since the construction industry is one of less IT-

intensive industries, SOF for furniture and fixtures becomes small.

       Given our observation of the distribution of IT capital stocks across industries, it is

worthwhile to explore patterns of interindustry transaction, which result in differences of IT

spillover stocks across industries. Table 2 shows the composition of each industry’s transaction




                                                6
with three sectors: primary and construction, manufacturing, and the services sector. 5 For

example, four percent of the total transaction in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing industry is

explained by transaction with industries in the primary and construction sector, 72 percent with

industries in the manufacturing sector, and 24 percent with industries in the services sector.

Comparing compositions of interindustry transaction in 1984 and in 1996, the composition of

each industry’s transaction has changed little over the period, although a proportion of

transaction with the services industries slightly increased for most of industries. We also find that

a large part of industrial transaction is carried out with industries within the same sector. Figure 1,

which graphs columns 4 to 6 in Table 2, clearly illustrates this transaction pattern. Starting from

the transportation industry, most transactions of the services industries are explained by

transactions within the services sector. These transaction patterns, together with IT-intensiveness

of services industries, suggest that if IT externalities exist through interindustry transaction,

services industries will experience relatively a large impact of IT externalities.

3. Empirical Framework


           Assuming capital inputs are quasi-fixed at time period t, an industry’s average variable

cost function with exogenously given IT spillover stocks are written as

    The primary and construction sector includes agriculture, forestry, and fishing, mining, and construction industries.

                                             yt



where Ctv is a variable cost at time t, yt is gross output, Pt is a vector of variable input prices,

K t is a vector of quasi-fixed inputs, SOt −1 is a vector of IT spillover stocks, and T is an index

indicating the level of technology. We assume labor (L) and intermediate input (M) as variable

inputs and non-IT capital ( K N ) and IT capital ( K O ) as quasi-fixed inputs.

              To analyze the effect of IT spillover stocks on the structure of the average variable cost in

detail, we employ a restricted symmetric generalized McFadden cost function used in Bernstein

(2000). Incorporating quasi-fixed inputs, Bernstein modified a symmetric generalized McFadden

cost function introduced by Diewert and Wales (1987). Imposing homotheticity of the variable

cost function in output, we have a following average variable cost function.

        Differentiating the average variable cost function in equation (4) with respect to variable

input prices and using Shephard’s lemma, we have the following variable input intensity

equations:

where qi ,t is the quantity of variable input i at time t. The intensity of variable input ( vi ,t )

depends on variable input prices ( pi ,t ), the industry’s output ( yt ), the time trend ( Tt ), the

intensity of quasi-fixed inputs ( kl ,t ), and the IT spillover stocks ( SOh ,t −1 ).

        In addition to the system of variable input intensity equations, information about the

quasi-fixed input is also used in the estimation. In the long-run equilibrium, shadow prices of

quasi-fixed inputs are equal to rental prices of capital. Therefore, differentiating the average cost

function with respect to capital input intensities, we have



                         ∂ctv                                                                          

where wKl ,t is the rental price for K l at time t. Using equation (6), we can solve for capital input

intensities as:

The intensities of quasi-fixed inputs depend on variable input prices, the industry’s output, the

time trend, rental prices of the quasi-fixed inputs, and IT spillover stocks. Equations (5) and (7)

define the system of equations to be estimated.



4. Data


       The study covers 42 U.S. private industries over the period of 1984-2000. The data used

in the study are obtained from several sources. The nominal values and chain-type price indexes

of gross output and intermediate inputs are obtained from the Gross Product Originating (GPO)

published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The number of full time equivalent

employees is used as the quantity of labor. The wage index is constructed by dividing

compensation of employees by the number of full time equivalent employees. For capital stock,

we obtained investment data for 61 different types of assets from the Fixed Reproducible

Tangible Wealth (FRTW) provided by the BEA. Using the detailed investment series, we

construct capital stock using a perpetual inventory method with geometric depreciation rate from

Fraumeni (1997).

                                                                                     (1 − itck ,t − zk ,t ut )
       The rental price for each asset is estimated by wk ,t =                                                   (rt + δ k − π k ,t ) pk ,t ,

where itck ,t is the investment tax credit for asset k at time period t, u is the corporate income tax

rate, z is the present value of capital consumption allowance, r is the nominal rate of return, δ k is

the depreciation rate, π k is the asset specific capital gain, and pk ,t is the investment deflator. All

tax related variables are obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). We use Moody’s

Aaa corporate bond yield rate for the nominal rate of return and set the capital gains to zero.

           Using the Törnqvist index method, 61 types of assets for each industry are aggregated

into two types of capital, IT and non-IT capital stocks. IT capital stock consists of mainframe

computers, personal computers, direct access storage devices, computer printers, computer

terminals, computer tape drives, computer storage devices, other office equipment, and

software. 6 Non-IT capital stock is constructed by aggregating other non-IT equipment and

structures.

           The value of interindustry intermediate input demand and supply are obtained from the

input-output table prepared by the Office of Employment Projections (OEP) at the BLS. The

OEP developed annual input-output tables for 192 industries for the years 1983 through 2000.

The use table in the input-output data set shows the purchase of commodities by each industry as

inputs into its production process. Aggregating the columns and rows of the use table into 42

industries, we obtain matrix A which shows the transaction of intermediate goods between 42

industries. The diagonal of matrix A is set to zero in order to eliminate intraindustry transaction.

Defining X as equal to A + B where B is the transpose of A, we obtain total interindustry

transaction matrix X. The sum of each column in X represents the total value of interindustry

transaction of the industry in each column. Finally, dividing each column of matrix A by the total

value of interindustry transaction of each industry, we obtain the backward linkages of industries.

Similarly, dividing each column of matrix B by the total value of interindustry transaction, we

obtain the forward linkages of industries.

5. Estimation Result


       We jointly estimate equations (5) and (7) using the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR)

method. The predetermined parameters, θ L and θ M , are set to be average variable cost shares of

labor and intermediate input, respectively. The industry dummy variables are introduced in the

first order parameters, α i and β l . For possible serial correlation in errors, we assume the first-

order autocorrelation in the residuals of the system of equations. In the initial estimation, the

concavity in variable input prices was satisfied, but the convexity in quasi-fixed inputs was not.

After imposing the convexity restriction on the second order partial derivative matrix of the

average variable cost function with respect to the intensities of quasi-fixed inputs, we estimate

the system of variable and quasi-fixed input intensity equations. The parameter estimates are

shown in Table 3.

       IT Spillover Effect


       Using the parameter estimates in Table 3, we estimate the short-run and long-run

elasticities with respect to IT spillover stocks. Differentiating the average variable cost in

                                                                   SOh

spillover elasticities of average variable cost. Omitting time subscripts for simplicity, we have

where ε vi SOh enables us to identify the channel of cost saving induced by the IT spillover stocks.

       Table 4 shows mean the values of short-run elasticities of the average variable cost, labor,

and material intensities with respect to SOB and SOF . The standard errors for elasticities are

evaluated at the base year using the delta method.



                                                    [Table 4]

suggest that IT spillover stocks through intermediate input demand and supply reduce average

variable costs of all industries. In other words, computerization of an industry’s supplier and


                                                    13
customer reduces the average cost of the industry. Relative magnitudes of ε cv SO and ε cv SO imply
                                                                                 B          F




that the IT spillover stocks, through backward and forward linkages, have different effects on the

average cost of an industry. Thirty-three industries out of 42 industries receive more benefit from

the IT capital of intermediate input supplier industries ( SOB ) than from the IT capital of

customer industries ( SOF ). On the other hand, industries such as business services, legal services,

wholesale trade, and bank and security enjoy average cost saving more from the IT capital of

customer industries.

       These different effects of SOB and SOF explain how the technological opportunities of

IT can be different in the backward and forward linkages of an industry. Our results suggest that

it is easier for most industries to capitalize computerization of intermediate input supplier

industries. For example, the IT-based supply chain can enable industries to lower their materials

inventory without interrupting their production processes. Meanwhile, cost saving effects of the

IT spillover stock through the forward linkage are not apparent for all industries. However, it is

interesting that industries receiving more benefits from SOF than from SOB not only have

diversified forward linkages but also are IT-intensive industries in general. Diversified forward

linkages imply that output produced by an industry is demanded not by a few specific industries

but by many industries. Therefore, our results suggest that IT-intensive industries with

diversified forward linkages, such as business services, legal services, wholesale trade, and bank

and security, have more opportunities to take an advantage of IT capital of customer industries.

       Comparing sectors, IT spillover stocks have much more impact on the services sector

than the manufacturing sector. On average, a one percent increase in SOB ( SOF ) reduces by

0.0076 (0.0045) percent the average cost for the manufacturing sector and by 0.0228 (0.0251)




                                                14
percent for the services sector.7 The results are consistent with our prediction. Given the fact that

industries in the services sector own significant parts of the total IT capital stock in the economy,

whether an industry receives benefits generated by the IT capital of service industries depends

on how important service industries are as the industry’s transaction partner. Since input-output

tables indicate that the interindustry transaction can be mainly explained by transactions with

industries within the same sector, IT externality caused by the IT capital of a services industry is

mostly distributed to other services industries.

           Columns 3 to 6 in Table 4 present the short-run spillover elasticities of labor and

intermediate input intensities with respect to SOB and SOF . Both labor and intermediate input

intensities are reduced by SOB and SOF for all industries. For labor intensity in the

manufacturing sector, the effect of SOB is stronger than that of SOF . On average, a one percent

increase in SOB reduces the labor intensity of manufacturing industries by 0.0121 percent. For

the service industries, elasticities of labor and intermediate input intensities are roughly the same

although intermediate input intensities decrease slightly more.

           In the long run, the quasi-fixed inputs are no longer fixed. The IT and non-IT capital

intensities are also affected by the IT spillover stocks. Therefore, we need to take into account

the effects of SOB and SOF on the quasi-fixed inputs to evaluate the long-run effects of the

spillover stocks. Differentiating the quasi-fixed input intensity in equation (7) with respect to IT

                                           SOh
spillover stocks and multiplying               gives us elasticities of the quasi-fixed input intensities,

           The long-run elasticities of variable input intensities with respect to IT spillover stocks

are derived in as similar a way as the long-run elasticities of the average cost are derived. First,

the elasticities of the variable input intensities, with respect to quasi-fixed input intensities, are

given by

With equations (10) and (13), the long-run elasticities of variable input intensities, with respect

to IT spillover stocks, are calculated by



                             ε vl SO = ε v SO + ε vl k ε kl

Here we also have a direct and an indirect effect of IT spillover stocks on the intensities of

variable inputs. In the long-run, SOB and SOF affect the variable input intensities directly and

also through the changes in the quasi-fixed inputs induced by the IT spillover stocks.

       The first and second columns in Table 5 show mean values of the long-run elasticity of

the average variable cost with respect to SOB and SOF . On average, the long-run elasticities of

variable cost with respect to SOB and SOF are -0.0213 and -0.0170 percent, respectively.

Compared to the short-run elasticities, the effect of SOB on average cost becomes stronger in the

long run. On the other hand, the long-run effect of SOF becomes small and insignificant except

for some IT intensive industries such as industrial machinery and equipment, instruments and

related products, wholesale trade, and bank and security. The reason for these differences in the

long-run elasticities can be sought in the elasticities of IT and non-IT capital intensities with

respect to SOB and SOF in columns 3 to 6 in Table 5. An increase in SOB raises both an

industry’s IT and non-IT capital intensities, which results in a strong effect of SOB on the

average variable cost in the long run. On the other hand, an increase in SOF increases the IT



                                                          17
intensity as SOB does, but lowers the intensity of non-IT capital, which leads to a smaller effect

of SOF in the long run.

       We also find that an industry’s own IT demand strongly links with the IT spillover stocks

in the long run. Columns 5 and 6 in Table 5 show that more IT adoption of an industry’s

intermediate input supplier and customer facilitates the industry’s IT adoption. In particular, the

IT demand of an industry responds more to an increase in the IT capital of a customer industry

than in the IT capital of a supplier industry. On average, a one percent increase in SOB increases

an industry’s IT demand by 0.3482 percent, while a one percent increase in SOF increases an

industry’s IT demand by 0.5974 percent.

       Columns 7 to 10 in Table 5 present the average long-run spillover elasticities of variable

input intensities. Both SOB and SOF reduce labor and intermediate input intensities in the long

run. For manufacturing industries, labor intensities decline on average 0.0189 percent to a one

percent increase in SOB and 0.0055 percent to a one percent increase in SOF , while intermediate

input intensities show relatively small reduction. For services industries, long-run effects of SOB

and SOF on variable input intensities are alike. SOB ( SOF ) reduces the labor intensity by

0.0270 (0.0277) percent and the intermediate input intensity by 0.0339 (0.0353) percent for

services industries.



       Industrial Interdependence and Rates of Return to the IT Spillover Stock


       We have examined the effects of the IT spillover stocks on the cost structures of

industries. Since the IT spillover stock is the weighted average of other industries’ IT capital




                                                18
stocks, we can construct a matrix which shows how the IT spillover stock of one industry affects

the cost structure of another industry.

We can also calculate the rate of return generated to industry j’s IT capital in terms of industry

where pKi O is the IT investment deflator for industry i. Both equations (15) and (16) produce

matrices of which an element in row i and column j shows the effects of industry j’s IT capital to

industry i. Table 6 and Table 7 present these matrices. These matrices explain not only how

much the IT capital stock of an industry reduces the variable cost of other industries but also

which industry generates the biggest benefit among the U.S. private industries. For example, the

value in the fourth row and the first column of the Table 6 reports that the variable cost of


                                                                   19
lumber and wood products is reduced by 0.000044 percent with respect to a one percent increase

in the IT capital stock of agriculture, forestry, and fishing. The first column in Table 6 says that

the IT capital stock of agriculture, forestry, and fishing industry has relatively more effect on the

variable cost of food and kindred products and real estate than on other industries. Table 6 also

suggests that the IT capital stock of the industries such bank and security, business services,

wholesale and retail trade, and real estate play a key role in reducing the variable cost of other

industries.

       Using the matrix for the rate of return in Table 7, we can explore give and take

relationships between industries. For example, industry i receives benefits from the IT capital of

its customer and supplier industries. On the other hand, industry i’s IT capital itself generates

some returns to its customer and supplier industries. The first column in Table 8 shows, on

average, returns to an industry received from a one dollar increase in the capital stock of other

industries. Industries such as bank and security, wholesale trade, and business services receive

larger returns than other industries. Within the manufacturing sector, industrial machinery and

equipment and electronic and other electric equipment seem to get more benefits. The common

characteristics of these beneficiary industries is that they are intensive users of IT capital. This

implies that the external return to an industry may depend on the industry’s own IT capital. The

second column in Table 8 shows returns that a one dollar increase in the IT capital stock of an

industry generates to other industries on average. It seems that industries receiving large returns

also generate large returns to other industries. The biggest benevolent industry is business

services. Comparing the first and second columns, we can observe that some industries receive

more than what they give to other industries. For instance, the return that bank and security

receives is four times larger than what it gives to other industries. In general, industries which




                                                 20
receive more returns than what their IT capital stocks generate to other industries are

concentrated in the services sector, such as bank and security, wholesale trade, and

communication.



        TFP Decomposition


        The conventional measure of TFP for a single output technology is defined as the ratio of

output over the Divisia index of aggregate input. Thus, the growth rate of TFP is written as



                                    i       i            i                i

where a dot over a variable is a derivative with respect to time, qi is a quantity of a variable

growth in Denny, Fuss, and Waverman (1981) and Bernstein and Nadiri (1993), we can

decompose TFP growth into scale effects, IT externalities, and technical change. Totally

dividing by C, we have

Then, by definition of TFP growth from equation (17) with equation (21), we can express

conventional TFP growth by



                         i                        i                        i

                            = (1 −       ) +∑             +       .                         (22)
                        TFP         ∂y C y l ∂SOh C SOh ∂T C




                                                              22
As we can see in equation (22), TFP growth is decomposed into three parts. The first term on the

right side of equation (22) shows the scale effect. The second term shows external effects from

the IT spillover stocks. The third term implies technical changes.

           Table 9 shows TFP growth for 42 U.S. private industries over the period from 1985 to

2000. There are 23 industries which exhibit positive productivity growth during the period. It is

also interesting that 12 out of 19 services industries show negative productivity growth. As

Triplett and Bosworth (2000) pointed out, the mismeasurement of output seems to contribute to

negative productivity growth in services industries.

           Columns 2 to 5 in Table 9 correspond to scale effect, IT externality effects from SOB and

SOF , and residuals.9 For many industries, scale effects explain large portions of TFP growth.

Roughly speaking, scale effects account for about 15 to 20 percent of TFP growth for

manufacturing industries. Contribution from the IT spillover stocks to TFP growth is positive for

all industries. Comparing effects of SOB and SOF , contribution from SOB is greater than that

from SOF for most industries. As we observed in the result for the elasticities with respect to

SOB and SOF , the IT spillover effect on TFP is relatively larger in the services industries than in

other industries. However, residuals are exacerbated because of possible mismeasurement of

output in services industries.



6. Conclusion


           The purpose of this paper was to investigate IT externality through interindustry

transaction among U.S. private industries. We generated two types of IT spillover stocks

    Residuals include technical changes.


                                                  23
available to an industry through intermediate input demand and supply, respectively. The

empirical results of this study indicate that IT spillover stocks have a significant impact on the

cost and production structure of industries.

       We find that IT spillover stocks reduce the variable cost of all industries through savings

in both labor and materials. We also find that IT externalities through intermediate input supplier

industries are much stronger than those through customer industries. Comparing industries, we

discover that opportunity of IT spillover is larger for services industries, due to their high IT

intensity and transaction composition, than for manufacturing industries. The analysis for the

long-run effects of IT spillovers suggests that an increase in IT capital stocks of supplier and

customer industries can be an important determinant of industrial IT demands. The study also

shows that the rate of return to IT investment due to its spillover effect is considerable and

varying across industries.

       Finally, our TFP decomposition suggests that IT spillover can contribute to an industry’s

productivity growth. However, we observed that strong IT externality for services industries

together with the problem of mismeasurement of their output could worsen the measured

technical changes of services industries.
