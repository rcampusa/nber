We develop a residential sorting model incorporating migration disutility to recover the implicit
value of clean air in China. The model is estimated using China Population Census Data along
with PM2.5 satellite data. Our study provides new evidence on the willingness to pay for air
quality improvement in developing countries and is the first application of an equilibrium sorting
model to the valuation of non-market amenities in China. We employ two novel instrumental
variables based on coal-fired electricity generation and wind direction to address the endogeneity
of local air pollution. Results suggest important differences between the residential sorting model
and a conventional hedonic model, highlighting the role of moving costs and the discreteness of
the choice set. Our sorting results indicate that the economic value of air quality improvement
associated with a one-unit decline in PM2.5 concentration is up to $8.83 billion for all Chinese
households in 2005.

1. Introduction

     Reliable estimation of household preferences for clean air has long been an

important topic for economists and policy makers.      A large body of literature uses the

hedonic framework to recover the economic value of air quality improvements.            A

meta-analysis of 37 hedonic price studies found that the willingness to pay for air

quality varied widely in the U.S., some even having a “perverse” sign that is

inconsistent with prior expectations (Smith and Huang, 1995).

     Three econometric identification problems could plague the implementation of the

conventional hedonic model, especially in the developing country context.       First, the

hedonic model assumes that households are freely mobile across locations, but the costs

associated with migration are high in developing countries.             When there are

significant migration costs, the benefits that households receive from moving to less

polluted cities must compensate them not only for lower income and higher housing

prices, but also for these costs.   Therefore, the simple variation in income and housing

costs across locations no longer reflects the economic value of differences in air quality

(Bayer et al., 2009).

     Second, the hedonic model assumes that households are free to select an amenity

bundle from a continuous joint distribution of local attributes, but the spatial

distribution of amenities is discrete and may contain many “holes”.     When the spatial

distribution of at least one amenity is discrete, there is no specific link between the

marginal price and the marginal willingness to pay (Kuminoff et al., 2013); this problem

may be particularly important when amenities are discrete and heavily imbalanced


                                             2
across locations, which is often the case in developing countries.

     Third, air pollution is likely to be correlated with unobservable local variables that

affect both housing costs and household income.          In most developing countries,

economic development, job opportunities, government provision of public services, and

polluting industries are all centralized in the same areas, which results in a more serious

omitted variable problem in the estimation of hedonic prices for environmental

amenities.   Any of these three identification problems will lead to biased estimates of

the marginal willingness to pay for clean air.

     Billions of residents of developing countries face excessively high levels of air

pollution, and this air pollution endangers their physical and economic health.

However, the few existing studies find that households’ willingness to pay for

improvements to environmental quality is extremely low in developing countries

(Yusuf and Resosudarmo, 2009; Kremer et al., 2011; Ito and Zhang, 2016).              The

paradox of a heavy economic and health burden generated by severe pollution and

households’ low valuation of environmental quality improvements in developing

countries is the central puzzle at the intersection of environmental and development

economics (Greenstone and Jack, 2015).       China is the largest developing country and

second largest economy in the world, and its air pollution problems pose extraordinary

local and global challenges.    However, data limitations have led to very few studies

measuring the economic value of air quality improvements in China.

    China provides a good setting in which to study households’ sorting decisions

while incorporating the disutility from migration.        Estimates derived from these


                                            3
decisions can be used to evaluate willingness to pay for local amenities.                                        The

incomplete discrimination of hukou (the Chinese household registration system) argues

against the benchmark assumption of free mobility in the conventional hedonic

framework.         Migrants without a local hukou do not have equal access to government-

provided amenities – e.g., public education for kids and medical care service.                                 There

is also tremendous heterogeneity in the application of the hukou system across cities.1

Although moving costs are high in China, the total stock of migrants is estimated to be

about 247 million in 2015, as large as 77% of the U.S. population.

      In sorting across labor and housing markets, Chinese residents express growing

concerns over the quality of the environment and its impact on their health.                               Figure 1

relates air pollution of hukou location and the fraction of the population who leave their

hukou city.       It shows evidence in raw data that that people have fled their hukou city

to avoid the harmful exposure to severe air pollution; preferences for clean air shape

the way that households sort across cities.                          China therefore provides a great

opportunity for the study of pollution induced sorting and the important role played by

migration costs.

      We develop a two-step framework to recover household preferences for air quality.

At its heart is a discrete-choice model of household residential location decisions,

incorporating migration disutility. This empirical model follows Bayer et al. (2009),

who estimate the economic value of air quality improvement in U.S. metro areas; in



  1
    The quantity and quality of state-provided services associated with local hukou status, as well as the difficulties
involved in obtaining the local hukou for migrants vary widely across cities in China, and are highly correlated with
the administrative hierarchies and the economic development of jurisdictions (Chan, 2009).

                                                          4
contrast, we employ different approaches to model migration disutility and different

instruments to deal with endogeneity.                    First, we use a discrete-choice model with

moving disutility to return the indirect utilities associated with residing in various cities.

In order to model moving disutility in China, we not only consider the physical and

psychological costs of leaving far from one’s hukou location, but also the heterogeneity

of the barrier to obtain local hukou and economic opportunities available for migrants

across Chinese cities.           After getting city-specific mean utilities from the first-stage

estimation, we regress them on measures of local air pollution in order to quantify the

marginal willingness to pay for clean air.                       Because air pollution is likely to be

correlated with unobserved aspects of city quality, an endogeneity problem arises in the

second-stage estimation.             Hence naïve OLS estimates of willingness to pay will be

biased.

      We employ two novel instrumental variable strategies to address the endogeneity

of the air pollution concentration of a given city: the smallest angle between the local

annual prevailing wind direction and large-scale thermal power plants outside the city,

along with the total annual coal consumption of the large-scale thermal power plants

located upwind of the city.2              The wind will blow the particulate matter spewed from

distant coal-fired power plants into the city, and these pollutants can dramatically

worsen local air quality.           The two instrumental variables provide an exogenous source

of variation for a number of reasons.                First, wind direction is stable over long periods

of time, and it is strictly exogenous to local economic activity.                         Second, those large-


   2
     The large-scale thermal power plants are defined as the thermal power plants whose installed-capacities are larger
than 1 million KW.

                                                          5
scale thermal power plants supply electricity to vast areas of China, including many

remote regions; many do not supply electricity at all to their nearby cities, but rather to

many remote provinces.      Further, the allocation of electricity supply from large-scale

power plants is determined by the central government – it is difficult for local

governments to exert influence on the allocation of electricity supply from these power

plants.   Finally, the spillover from distant large-scale power plants on local economic

activity is extremely small, but the pollutants emitted from power plants located upwind

severely contaminate the local air.

   Our study is conducted with the most comprehensive and detailed data available on

city level air pollution and household level internal migration in China.         Existing

studies of air pollution in China typically use the Air Pollution Index (API) and PM10

data from the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China.          However, API and

PM10 data can only be obtained in large and medium-sized cities in China, and PM2.5

data were not published until 2014.    Additionally, there is a potential concern that the

official air quality data may be manipulated by local governments (Chen et al., 2012;

Ghanem and Zhang, 2014).       We collect city level annual average PM2.5 using Global

Annual PM2.5 Grids derived from satellite data by Van Donkelaar et al. (2016).      These

data provide a reliable and accurate measurement of air quality for all cities in China.

   Internal migration data are drawn from the 2005 One-Percent Population Census of

China, which is a restricted access census data set collected by National Bureau of

Statistics of China.   It is the only national census data that records income in China.

For each household, this dataset provides four-digit codes of city level hukou location


                                            6
and residential location, along with a wide range of sociodemographic and housing

characteristic variables.

    Our results reveal salient differences between the conclusions of the conventional

hedonic framework and those of the residential sorting framework.              They also

demonstrate the importance of dealing with endogeneity as well as accounting for

migration disutility and the discreteness of the choice set. To compare these two

methodologies, we begin with a conventional hedonic analysis that recovers a negative

estimate of the value of cleaner air.   Instrumenting for air pollution is found to weaken

the bias of hedonic estimates.   Consistent with intuition, the MWTP for air quality has

an expected positive sign when sorting process and migration disutility are taken into

account.     Specifically, we find that the median Chinese household would pay about

$21.70 for a one-unit reduction in annual average fine particulate matter concentration.

Given 407 million households in China in 2005, the economic value of air quality

improvement associated with a one-unit decline in PM2.5 concentration is up to $8.83

billion.   Our estimated willingness to pay for air quality is substantially larger than

that found in existing studies on the economic value of clean environment in developing

countries.    Furthermore, the results indicate that ignoring the discreteness of the

choice set and migration disutility will likely misrepresent the economic benefits of

environmental quality improvement in developing countries.




2. A residential sorting model incorporating moving disutility

     Following Bayer et al. (2009), we present our utility-maximizing location choice


                                             7
model in the context of China.               Household 𝑖 chooses residential city 𝑗, along with

consumption of a composite commodity 𝐶$,& and housing 𝐻 $,& , to maximize its utility

subject to a budget constraint:



                    max             𝑈(𝐶 $,& , 𝐻 $,& , 𝑋& ) 𝑠. 𝑡. 𝐶$,& + 𝜌& 𝐻$,& = 𝐼$,&                 (1)
                {-.,/ ,0.,/ ,1/ }




where 𝐼$,& is household income in city 𝑗, 𝜌& represents the unit price of housing in city

𝑗, and 𝑋& denotes the local amenity of interest (here, air quality) in city 𝑗.                         For

simplicity, we normalize the price of the composite commodity to 1.                            The utility

function for household 𝑖 residing in city 𝑗 is assumed to be:



                                                  >    >    >
                                       𝑈$,& = 𝐶$,&? 𝐻$,&@ 𝑋& A 𝑒 C.,/ DE/ DF.,/                        (2)




where 𝜉& captures all the unobserved characteristics of city 𝑗 that are valued similarly

by all households, and 𝜂$,& is a household-specific idiosyncratic term that is

independent of migration disutility and city attributes.                  𝑀$,& represents the disutility to

household 𝑖 of moving from its hukou city to city j.                        In our study, 𝑀$,& not only

captures the physical and psychological costs of living far from one’s hukou location,

but also the barrier to obtaining local hukou and economic opportunities available for

migrants in city 𝑗.

   Household utility maximization yields the optimum housing consumption:




                                                        8
                                            ∗         >@           L.,/
                                           𝐻$,& =              ∙                                          (3)
                                                    >@ D>?         M/




                                      ∗
Denoting 𝛽L = 𝛽0 + 𝛽- , substituting 𝐻$,& for 𝐻$,& in (2) and using the budget

constraint yields the following household indirect utility function




                         𝑉$,& = 𝐴𝑒 >Q RSL.,/ DC.,/ T>@ RSM/ D>A RS1/ DE/ DF.,/                            (4)




where 𝐴 = 𝛽0 >@ 𝛽- >? /(𝛽0 + 𝛽- )(>@ D>? ) is a constant that does not vary with location

choice j and subsequently drops out of the random utility problem.                          We can derive the

MWTP for the amenity 𝑋& using the marginal substitution rate between 𝑋& and

household income:



                                                          >A       L.,/
                                          𝑀𝑊𝑇𝑃$ =              ∙                                          (5)
                                                          >Q       1/




We can only observe household 𝑖’s income in its city of residence. Thus, we must

predict the counterfactual income in other unchosen locations. We then decompose

household income into a predicted mean and an idiosyncratic error term—i.e., ln𝐼$,& =

          L
ln𝐼$,& + 𝜀$,& .    Substituting this into (4) and taking logs yields:



                                                                                    L
                  ln𝑉$,& = 𝜃& + 𝛽L ln𝐼$,& + 𝑀$,& + 𝜈$&                    𝜈$& = 𝛽L 𝜀$,& + 𝜂$,&            (6)

                               𝜃& = −𝛽0 ln𝜌& + 𝛽1 ln𝑋& + 𝜉&                                               (7)




                                                      9
where 𝜃& represents city-specific mean utility that is common to the households in city

𝑗 and captures all the utility-relevant characteristics of the city, and 𝜉& captures the

unobservable component of 𝜃& .

    The residential sorting framework introduced above can easily handle the discrete

and imbalanced distribution of amenities in developing countries.                   This is different

from the conventional hedonic model where individuals are assumed to face a

continuous joint distribution of all amenities.

    In a sorting equilibrium, no household could improve its utility by migrating to a

new city, given income, housing price, local amenities, moving disutility and all the

parameters in the equation (6) and (7) (Kuminoff et al., 2013; Klaiber and Kuminoff,

2014).    All the structural parameters can be recovered using a two-step approach

related to that in Berry et al. (1995).   In the first step, we directly estimate equation (6)

to recover all the alternative-specific fixed effects, 𝜃& (𝑗 = 1, ⋯ , 𝐽).            Assuming that

𝜈$& is independently and identically distributed Type I extreme value, the probability

that household 𝑖 chooses to reside in city 𝑗 can be written as:



                                                     ghi (j/ D>Q RSL.,/ DC.,/ )
                  𝑃 ln𝑉$,& ≥ ln𝑉$,c , ∀𝑙 ≠ 𝑗 =     l                                             (8)
                                                   kmn ghi (jk D>Q RSL.,k DC.,k )




    We use the multinomial logit estimation procedure to infer the parameters in

equation (8).   Mean utility, 𝜃& , is recovered as a city-specific fixed effect.

    In the second step, we use the estimated fix effect obtained from the first stage, 𝜃& ,

as the dependent variable and regress on air quality, housing price and other city factors


                                              10
in the form of equation (7).           Two identification problems will result in biased estimates

of 𝛽1 in this second step.             First, it is likely that housing price 𝜌& is correlated with

unobservable city attributes in 𝜉& .                 However, from Eq. (3), we have that 𝛽0 =

𝛽L 𝜌& 𝐻$∗ /𝐼$,& ; the parameter 𝛽L can be obtained from the first step estimation and we

set 𝜌& 𝐻$∗ /𝐼$,& equal to the median value of the share of income spent on housing, which

is 0.162 in our sample. 3              We therefore address the endogeneity issue by moving

𝛽0 ln𝜌& to the left-hand side of equation (7):




                                       𝜃& + 𝛽0 ln𝜌& = 𝛽1 𝑋& + 𝜉&                                                  (9)




We can consider the new dependent variable, 𝜃& + 𝛽0 ln𝜌& , as the housing costs adjusted

life quality of residing in city 𝑗.

     Second, local amenities tend to be correlated with unobservable aspects of city

quality.     In the case of air quality, local economic activity is likely to be positively

correlated with air pollution concentration along with housing price and income. This

endogeneity problem leads to biased estimates of the marginal utility of air quality.                             To

deal with the issue, previous studies have generally relied on instrumental variables that

are exogenous to local economic activity.                           Chay and Greenstone (2005) use

nonattainment status defined by 1970 Clean Air Act as instruments for county level air

quality improvement.              Bayer et al. (2009) instrument for air quality using the


   3
     Following Bayer et al. (2007), for the purchased houses and self-built houses, we use the coefficients of city-
specific housing price regression of equation (10) (see the next section) to convert the housing values into a measure
of annual costs in 2005, and then calculate the share of housing expenditure in household income. The details of
housing price regression will be illustrated in the next section.

contribution of distant sources to local air pollution, which is computed through a

county-to-county source-receptor matrix in America.                       In China, however, stringent

regulations on particulates matter concentration were not implemented until 2012,4 and

a source-receptor matrix is not available.                      Hence, we define two innovative

instrumental variables for local air pollution based on backgrounds in China.                         The first

is the smallest angle between the local annual prevailing wind direction and the large-

scale thermal power plants located outside city 𝑗 and within a certain distance.                           The

second is the total annual coal consumption of the large-scale thermal power plants

located at upwind region of city 𝑗.             We will further explain our instrumental strategy

in section 4.4.       To the best of our knowledge, the two instrumental variables in our

study have not been used previously in the sorting literature.




3. Data

3.1 Primary data sources

     We estimate the residential sorting model and recover counterfactual household

income and city-specific housing price using the 2005 One-Percent Population Census

of China.      The 2005 One-Percent Population Census of China was conducted by the

National Bureau of Statistics of China.              It is the latest population census data that has

been made available to academic researchers, but only with restricted access.                              The



   4
     On December 5, 2012, “12th Five-Year Plan on Air Pollution Prevention and Control in Key Regions” was issued
jointly by Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, National Development and Reform Commission of China,
and Ministry of Finance of China issue. The plan sets stringent targets for ambient concentrations of particulate
matter (PM2.5 and PM10) for the first time in China. For more background information, see

census data has about 2.3 million individuals and 1 million households, covering all 31

province-level jurisdictions. 5            The data not only records very detailed information

about housing conditions, but also contains a long list of variables about demographic

and economic characteristics of household members, such as age, gender, education

level, employment status, occupation, hukou type (rural/urban), four-digit code of

hukou city, and four-digit code of residential city.                 The most important variable in the

data is the individual monthly income.                 To the best of our knowledge, the 2005 One-

Percent Population Census of China is the only census data that has the information

about income.6

      We assume that the migration decision of a household is made by the household

head, hence we use the household head’s hukou city and residential city to define the

migration status of the household.                Similarly to Bayer et al. (2009), we exclude the

households if the age of household head is greater than 35 years to ensure the migration

decisions are mainly driven by the current city factors.                      We drop observations with

missing values, and use the sample whose hukou are held by the households not by the

working units.7

      To get a more accurate estimation of counterfactual household income, we delete



  5
     The sample size of the 2005 One-Percent Population Census of China should be about 13 million, but National
Bureau of Statistics of China only released a one-fifth random subsample of the census data.
   6
     We have checked all the national population census questionnaires in China: Questionnaire of the Third National
Population Census (1982), 1990 National Population Census Questionnaire, Census 2000 long mail-
out questionnaire, the 2005 One-Percent Population Census of China Questionnaire, the 2010 National Population
Census Questionnaire, the 2015 One-Percent Population Census of China Questionnaire.
   7
     One clarification of hukou in China is household hukou and working unit collective hukou. Migrants who are
employed in state owned enterprises, public institutions, and government departments are typically provided with
temporary working unit collective hukou. The individuals whose hukou are temporarily held by working units
don’t have equal access to government provided amenities as natives who hold household hukou, but they are
relatively easier to apply for local household hukou and eligible to more government provided welfare in comparison
with other migrants. Thus, it is difficult to clarify the migration status of the households who hold working-unit
collective hukou. In 2005, only 2.35% of households had hukou that were held temporarily by their working units.

the samples that have the highest or lowest 0.1% value of individual monthly income,

transform the monthly income into annual income, then predict annual counterfactual

individual income in each city, and aggregate counterfactual individual income at

household level to recover counterfactual household income.                               Because China’s real

estate market was not established until 1991, we drop the households if their houses

were built before 1991 to infer city-specific housing price.8

      We collect the city characteristic variables from China City Statistical Yearbook,

which covers 285 cities of China in 2005.9                       Thus, we only use the samples whose

hukou city and residential city are both covered by the 285 cities.                            In total, there are

61,536 households in our sample.                  The summary statistics of census variables used in

our study are presented in Table A1.

      The regional distribution of the 285 cites is illustrated in Figure 1.                        There are 337

cites at the prefecture level and above in 2005.                  The 285 cities in our sample cover 85%

of the cities in this group, and contain approximately 91.04% of the Chinese population

in 2005.

      To estimate the MWTP for clean air, we require data on air pollution concentration,

household income, housing price, and city attributes.                        We describe the measurement

of city level air pollution in detail below.                Table 1 reports the summary statistics and



  8
     The Chinese government has enacted many reforms in the housing sector since 1978, but has only carried them
out in some cities, e.g., Shen Zhen. Prior to 1991, housing was mainly allocated to employees at state owned
enterprises, public institutions and government departments through a planned system; therefore, there was no
housing market, and one cannot observe transaction values. In 1991, the central government authorized a housing
reform project which covered 24 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China. This represented a
comprehensive reform of the housing sector in China. Since then, the housing market in China has matured,
allowing people to exchange their housing through the price system. This has made it possible for us to observe
transaction prices since that time.
   9
     The 2005 China City Statistical Yearbook lists 286 cities, but all the variables in our study are missing in Lhasa.
Thus, we only use the 285 cities to construct households’ residential choice set.

3.2 Air quality measures

      Previous studies on China’s air pollution problems generally use the Air Pollution

Index (API) and PM10 data from the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China.

However, API and PM10 data can only be obtained in large and medium-sized cities in

China, and PM2.5 data were not published until 2014.                     We use PM2.5 satellite data

for our analysis rather than official air quality data, since it has the following advantages.

First, the location choice set of households includes not only large and medium-sized

cities, but also many small-sized cities; official air quality data are not available for

these cities.     Our satellite PM2.5 data are available for all the cities in China, thus the

data facilitates the construction of households’ location choice set.                        Second, fine

particles       (diameter<2.5µm)          are     more      hazardous        than      larger     particles

(2.5µm<diameter<10µm) in terms of mortality, cardiovascular and respiratory

endpoints, and PM2.5 is considered to be the best indicator of the level of health risks

from air pollution.10       Finally, a potential concern of the official air quality data is that

it may be manipulated by the local government (Chen et al., 2012; Ghanem and Zhang,

2014), however our satellite data are immune to any underlying data manipulation.

      We use city level annual PM2.5 concentrations measured using the Global Annual

PM2.5 Grids derived from satellite data by Van Donkelaar et al. (2016).                                 Van

Donkelaar et al. (2016) estimate ground-level PM2.5 by combining Aerosol Optical

Depth (AOD) retrievals from the NASA MODIS, MISR, and SeaWiFS, which are

subsequently calibrated to global ground-based observations of PM2.5 using

Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR).                          The raster grids of this ground

calibrated PM2.5 data have a high grid cell resolution of 0.01 degree. 11                           Our data

provides a comprehensive and reliable measurement of air quality for a wide range of

cities in China, covering all the prefecture, sub-provincial and provincial cities.

      Figure 3 illustrates the satellite air pollution data, depicting the spatial distribution

of annual PM2.5 concentration for China in 2005.                   The figure shows that air quality is

unevenly distributed in China – the most severe air pollution occurs in eastern provinces,

where manufacturing industries agglomerate and high economic growth takes place.

PM2.5 concentration is also high in Xinjiang province, because vast areas of this

province are dessert.           Figure 4 illustrates the time trend of mean annual PM2.5

concentration of Chinese cities since 2001; the mean concentration is above the WHO

air quality guideline in all these years.12




4. Econometric Specification

4.1 Estimating counterfactual household income

      We first recover the individual income each household member would earn in

every location, by estimating a separate regression of individual income on personal

characteristics for each labor market of every city, correcting for Roy sorting bias using

the procedure described in Dahl (2002).               The hukou system results in discrepancies in


  11
     NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System also published Global Annual Average PM2.5
Grids, and its grid cell resolution is 0.5 degree, but the resolution is too large to calculate city level PM2.5
concentration.

income between migrants and natives in Chinese cities.                        It is difficult for migrants to

obtain a local hukou in the large cities of China, but easy for them to obtain one in small

and medium-sized cities.            Thus, we allow for two separate labor markets in each of 35

large cities (i.e., a labor market for natives and another for migrants), but only one labor

market in each of the other 250 cities of our sample to calculate counterfactual

individual income.13

       We define 𝜔$,& as the probability of individual 𝑖 residing in city 𝑗.                          Following

Dahl (2002), we infer 𝜔$,& in the context of China.                      We first allocate all individuals

into three data cells according to their education attainment: less than high school, high

school graduate, and some college or above.                       Within each cell, we further assign

individuals into two hukou type cells: urban hukou and rural hukou.                                Within each

education-by-hukou type cell, we finally divide them into 285 hukou locations.

Overall, we have 1,710 data cells, and 𝜔$,& is computed as the share of the population

in individual 𝑖 p s cell that settle in city 𝑗.                 Then we run the individual income

regression in each labor market of city 𝑗 using the following equation:



                                   p                              w      L

where 𝑚 denotes labor market.                  On the basis of the heterogeneity of the barrier to

obtain local hukou, we specify two labor markets in 35 large cities of China, but only


  13
    These thirty five large cities include all the provincial cities, sub-provincial cities, and provincial capitals
(excluding Lhasa) in China. They are Beijing, Changchun, Changsha, Chengdu, Chongqing, Dalian, Fuzhou,
Guangzhou, Guiyang, Hangzhou, Harbin, Haikou, Hefei, Hohhot, Jinan, Kunming, Lanzhou, Nanchang, Nanjing,
Nanning, Ningbo, Qingdao, Shanghai, Shenyang, Shenzhen, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Wuhan, Xiamen, Xi'an,
Xining, Yinchuan, Ürümqi, and Zhengzhou.

one labor market in other cities.          Γ$,& is a vector of individual attributes, including age,

age squared, and dummy variables for hukou types (rural hukou, urban hukou),

educational attainment (below high school, high school and some college or above) and

gender (male, female).

        We predict counterfactual individual income of each household member in every

location using coefficient estimated by equation (10). 14                       After that, we add the

predicted individual incomes to the level of the household in order to calculate the

counterfactual household income 𝐼$,& in every city

4.2 Measuring housing price

       We define the value of the home occupied by household 𝑖 in city 𝑗, 𝑃$,& , as the

value of the house (for owner-occupied units) or annual rent (for rental units).                           We

assume 𝑃$,& is a function of a city-specific constant (𝜌& ) and a vector of housing

characteristics (𝛨$ ) that includes age of housing structure, the number of rooms, floor

area, whether the housing structure is a storied building, whether tap water is provided,

whether kitchen is provided, and whether there is a restroom.                       We then estimate the

following equation:




  ln𝑃$,& = ln𝜌& + 𝜆v,&,{|}~•€•‚ Ω$,{|}~•€•‚ + 𝜆w,&,{|}~•€•‚ Ω$,{|}~•€•‚ 𝐴𝑔𝑒$ +

                        𝜆v,&,…|$c† Ω$,…|$c† + 𝜆w,&,…|$c† Ω$,…|$c† 𝐴𝑔𝑒$ + 𝜙&p Η$ + 𝜀$,&
                                                                                   0
                                                                                                          (11)




  14                                            w
    We omit the Dahl correction terms 𝜔$,& and 𝜔$,& when predicting individual income in each city, because they
only serve as controls for Roy sorting bias.



                                                      18
where Ω$,{|}~•€•‚ is a dummy variable that equals 1 if household 𝑖 purchases its home

and 0 if it is rented; Ω$,…|$c† is a dummy variable that equals 1 if household 𝑖 builds

its home and 0 otherwise.   The 2005 One-Percent Population Census of China reports

the current rent in the census year, but the past price of owner occupied housing when

the house was self-built or purchased.      Thus 𝜆v,&,{|}~•€•‚ + 𝜆w,&,{|}~•€•‚ 𝐴𝑔𝑒 and

𝜆v,&,…|$c† + 𝜆w,&,…|$c† 𝐴𝑔𝑒 measure the premium on purchased housing and built

housing of different age in city 𝑗, respectively.   𝜙& describes the role of housing

characteristics on prices in city 𝑗.   The fixed effect 𝜌& measures the unit price of

housing services adjusted by housing characteristics and ownership in city 𝑗 .

Therefore, we can infer the housing price in each city as the constant in city-specific

regression of equation (11), using the 2005 One-Percent Population Census of China

described in section 3.1.

4.3 Modeling moving disutility in the first-step estimation

   High migration costs mean that the conventional hedonic model will be unable to

recover unbiased estimates of the value of local amenities (Cragg and Kahn, 1997;

Timmins, 2007).     The residential sorting framework introduced in Section 2 can

capture the moving disutility in the sorting process by incorporating a fixed cost

associated with every alternative location (Bayer et al., 2009).      The inclusion of

moving disutility yields a more accurate measure of the MWTP, particularly in

developing countries.   The mobility rate is high in the U.S. – 18% of the United States

population has moved to a new place of residence every year since the Second World

War (Klaiber and Kuminoff, 2014).        But on average, only 5.48% of the Chinese


                                          19
population has left their hukou location for a new city every year between 2005 and

2015. 15       The hukou System restricts population mobility in China (Chan and

Buckingham, 2008; Chan, 2009), and the comparison of internal migration between the

two countries indicates that there exists a remarkable higher moving disutility in China.

       Consider the heterogeneity of the barrier to obtain local hukou and economic

opportunities available for migrants across Chinese cities, we use six dummies and their

interactions to capture the migration disutility in China.                    We first divide the cities into

four groups: Beijing and Shanghai, sub-provincial cities along with Tianjin and

Chongqing,16 provincial capitals,17 and ordinary cities.                        The difficulty for migrants

to obtain local hukou is highest for Beijing and Shanghai, followed by sub-provincial

cities, and then by provincial capitals and ordinary cities.                          In terms of economic

opportunities for migrants, the situation is entirely different.                       Beijing and Shanghai

provide migrants the maximum amount of economic opportunities, followed by sub-

provincial cities, provincial capitals and ordinary cities in descending order.                           Thus we

model the moving disutility in China using the following equation:




  15
      On the basis of the 2005 One-Percent Population Census of China, the 2010 National Population Census of
China and the 2015 One-Percent Population Census of China, we report the pattern and evolution of internal
migration in China from 2005 to 2015. We define the share of people between 18 and 65 years old that have left
their hukou place for a new place of residence during last year to measure the population mobility in China. In
2005, only 4.49% of people left their hukou place during the last year. The figure increases to 8.75% in 2010, but
decreases to 4.77% in 2015. Moreover, males have a higher mobility rate than female in 2005, 2010 and 2015,
respectively. On average, 5.92% of male and 5.04% of female have moved to a new place every year during 2005
to 2010.
   16
      Tianjin and Chongqing are provincial cities in China, but the barrier to obtain local hukou and the economic
opportunities for migrants in the two cities are similar to sub-provincial cities. Hence, we assign Tianjin, Chongqing
and sub-provincial cities to the same group.
   17
      We exclude 10 cities which are both sub-provincial cities and provincial capitals in the group of provincial
capitals, and assign the 10 cities to the group of sub-provincial cities. In the mainland of China, there are 27
provincial capitals and 15 sub-provincial cities. Among them, 10 cities are both sub-provincial cities and provincial
capitals. Thus, there are 17 cities in the group of provincial capitals in our study.

                                                         20
  𝑀$,& = 𝜇v 𝐷v,$& + 𝜇w 𝐷w,$& + 𝜇Š 𝐷Š,$& + 𝜇‹ 𝐷v,$& 𝐷‹,$& + 𝜇Œ 𝐷v,$& 𝐷Œ,$& + 𝜇• 𝐷v,$& 𝐷•,$&                        (12)



       𝐷v,$& = 1 if location 𝑗 is outside of household 𝑖’s hukou city18 (=0, otherwise).
       𝐷w,$& = 1 if location 𝑗 is outside of household 𝑖’s hukou province (=0, otherwise).
       𝐷Š,$& = 1 if location 𝑗 is outside of household 𝑖’s hukou macro-regions19 (=0,
                   otherwise)
       𝐷‹,$& =1 if location 𝑗 is Beijing/Shanghai (=0, otherwise).
       𝐷Œ,$& =1 if location 𝑗 is a sub-provincial city/ Tianjin/ Chongqing (=0, otherwise).
       𝐷•,$& =1 if location 𝑗 is a provincial capital (=0, otherwise).



        The first three dummies of equation (12) measure the disutility with respect to the

physical and psychological costs of leaving one’s hukou city. 20                                The interactions

between “outside of hukou city” dummy and three city group dummies capture the

difficulty of obtaining local hukou and economic opportunities available for migrants.

Moving disutility is normalized to zero if the household stays in its hukou city.

        Then, we calculate the following likelihood function to infer the parameters in the

first step estimation:



                                                                                                           –.,/
                                       —     ghi (j/ D>Q RSL.,/ D “‘mn •‘ ’‘,./ D ”‘m• •‘ ’n,./ ’‘,./ )
       𝐿 𝜃& , 𝛽L , 𝜇v,…,• =       $    &    l                        “              ”                             (13)

where 𝜒$,& is an indicator function that equals one if household 𝑖 chooses to live in

city 𝑗, and 0 otherwise. Recall that 𝜃& estimated from equation (13) denotes city-

specific indirect utility independent of household income and moving disutility, and we

      For a given household, we use the household head’s hukou location to define a household’s hukou location.

Northwest China and Northeast China.

      In China, most people’s hukou city is the same as their birth city. At 2014, only 7.08% of people’s hukou city is
different from their birth city.

second step estimation.

4.4 Instrumenting for air pollution in the second-step estimation

   We use the following equation to perform our second-step estimation:




                    𝜃& + 0.162 𝛽L ln𝜌& = 𝛽œC ln𝑃𝑀& + 𝑍& p 𝛽ž + 𝜉&                   (14)




where 𝑃𝑀& represents fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration; 𝑍& denotes

other local characteristics, including GDP per capita, population, education service,

medical care service, distance to large seaports and industrial pollutant emissions; the

parameter 𝛽L is inferred from our first step estimation.

   As introduced in Section 2, we use two innovative instrumental variables together

to address the endogeneity of local air pollution in city 𝑗 . The idea behind our

instrumental strategy is illustrated in the Figure 5.

   The first instrumental variable, which we label IV1, is the smallest angle between

the local annual prevailing wind direction and the large-scale thermal power plants

outside city 𝑗.   We exclude the thermal power plants that locate at more than 500 km

from city 𝑗 to avoid the weak instrumental variable problem.     As illustrated in Figure

5a, the thick arrow represents the annual dominant wind direction of city 𝑗, and large-

scale thermal power plant A are located outside city 𝑗, but less than 500km from the

city, thus the angle 𝛼 is the first IV for air pollution concentration in city 𝑗.   Note

that if there are more than one large-scale thermal power plant (located outside city 𝑗


                                            22
and within 500km), we use the smallest angle to define IV1.

   The second instrumental variable, which we label IV2, is the total annual coal

consumption of all large-scale thermal power plants located upwind of city 𝑗.           As

depicted in Figure 5b, we take a section of a circular buffer drawn at a distance of

500km from the city. The angle between the left/right side of the section and the annual

dominant wind direction of city 𝑗 is π/4.         We exclude the overlapped area of the

sector and city 𝑗, and the shaded area is defined as the upwind region of the city.    For

instance, there are two large-scale thermal power plants located in the upwind region

of city 𝑗, power plant A and power plant B.       IV2 is then defined as the sum of annual

coal consumption of A and annual coal consumption of B.

   There are 105 large-scale power plants in China in 2005, the total electricity

generation of the large-scale power plants is up to 842.5 billion kWh, and the total coal

consumption reaches approximately 2,670 million tons.         Figure 6 shows the location

of the large-scale power plants in 2005.     The comparison of Figure 3 and Figure 6

indicates that the large-scale coal-fired power plants are highly correlated with PM2.5

concentration in terms of spatial distribution.   Note that there is no large-scale thermal

power plant in Xinjiang Province, however air quality is poor in Xinjiang.     The reason

is that vast areas of this province are covered by desert and sand dust will cause a high

concentration of particulate matter.

    Good instrumental variables must satisfy two assumptions.        The first assumption

is that they should be strongly correlated with the variable being instrumented.

China’s installed generating capacity reaches 517.18 million kW in 2005, and the


                                            23
production of electricity is composed of four types: hydro, fossil, nuclear, and other.

Fossil fuels maintain the largest share at about 75%, which remains very steady between

1995 and 2009 (see Figure A1 in the appendix).

       To illustrate the effects of our instrumental variables on air pollution, we regress

local PM2.5 concentration on the two instruments.                         Table 2 presents the estimated

results.       The coefficients on the two instrumental variables are highly statistically

significant, and have expected signs.               The results suggest that the location (the angle

between the large-scale thermal power plant and annual prevailing upwind direction)

and the coal consumption of distant large-scale thermal power plants significantly affect

local air pollution.

       The second assumption is that the instrumental variables are orthogonal to local

economic activity, which is valid for the following reasons.                      First, wind direction is

determined by nature and remains stable over long periods of time, thus it is strictly

exogenous to local economic attributes. Second, the large-scale thermal power plants

supply electricity to vast areas of China; some of them do not even supply electricity to

their nearby cities, but rather to many remote provinces.                    There are 1,486 fossil plants

in 2004,21 but only 7.1% of them are large-scale power plants.                       Third, in China, the

allocation of electricity supply from large-scale power plants is determined by the

central government.            Although many reforms have taken place over the past 30 years,

there are still strict regulations in the power sector and ownership of the sector is largely

with the state.         The central government owns the grid, and controls the setup and


  21

                                                       24
operation of power plants if their generating capacity is large.    “The state regulator

may continue to be involved in investment decisions for large projects in order to ensure

that financing follows the guidelines of the State Development Planning Commission

and Ministry of Finance.” (Berrah et al., 2001). Thus, local governments find it difficult

to exert influence on the setup of large-scale power plants and the allocation of

electricity supply from them.     Finally, the impact of distant power plants on local

economic activity is extremely small, but the particulate matter spewed from coal-fired

power plants located at upwind region contribute substantially to local air pollution.

     Our instrumental variables are constructed on the basis of background in China,

which provides a new way to address the endogenous issue of air quality in developing

countries.



5. Estimation Results

5.1 Housing price and income regressions
   Table A2 summarizes the results from the city-specific housing price regressions.

In the average city, the premium on purchased housing is higher than self-built housing,

and both premiums go down as the age of housing structure increases.         The price of

storied buildings is higher than single-story houses.    Newer, larger houses are more

expensive, as are houses with more rooms, tap water, kitchen and restroom.           The

intercept in each city-specific regression represents the unit price of housing services

adjusted by housing attributes and ownership in each city.

   Table A3 reports the summary statistics of estimated coefficients from the city-

specific income regressions.    On average, individual income goes up with educational

                                           25
attainment.   Income also increases with age, but at a declining rate.   In Chinese cities,

women earn less than men, and urban hukou holders earn more than rural hukou holders.


5.2 Estimates from the conventional model
     We first estimate a conventional hedonic model based on regression specifications

typically used in previous studies.       The hedonic estimates provide a useful benchmark

for comparison with the residential sorting model incorporating moving disutility.     We

estimate a hedonic model with and without instrumental variables for local air quality,

in order to demonstrate the role of pollution endogeneity.

   In the hedonic framework without moving disutility, the housing price-air quality

gradient minus income-air quality gradient yields the MWTP for clean air.       Therefore,

we estimate the marginal impacts of air pollution concentration on housing service price

(the intercept from the city-specific housing price regression) and city average

household income:



                                   ¢
                           ln𝑌& = 𝛽œC lnPM2.5& + 𝑍&p 𝛽ž¢ + 𝑢&¢                        (15)

                                      M                    M    M
                          ln𝜌& = 𝛽œC lnPM2.5& + 𝑍&p 𝛽ž + 𝑢&                           (16)




   Table 3 reports the coefficients on air pollution concentrations from the income

hedonic regression and the housing price hedonic regression, respectively.       Columns

(1)-(3) present the results from the OLS regressions and columns (4)-(5) present

instrumental variable estimates.           After controlling for city characteristics, the

coefficients on lnPM2.5 estimated by OLS regression are significantly negative in the


                                               26
income hedonic model, and significantly positive in the housing price hedonic model.

The “perverse” sign of these OLS hedonic estimates is at odds with intuition.                                     The

effects of instrumenting for air quality indicate that the OLS estimates are biased.                              The

IV results suggest that the marginal impacts of air pollution on household income and

housing price are economically insignificant.                      When we compare the full model of

column (3) and column (5), the coefficients on lnPM2.5 decline in magnitude and

significance in both income and housing price hedonic regressions.                               Our instruments

weaken the bias of the hedonic estimates, but their signs remain inconsistent with

expectations.        The positive correlation between housing price and air pollution, as well

as the negative correlation between income and air pollution, are driven by high

migration costs that distort sorting behavior in China.                       Our IV estimates only reduce

the bias induced by unobservable local characteristics that are systematically correlated

with local air pollution, but don’t account for the imbalanced and discrete distribution

of amenities and high moving costs in developing countries like China.


5.3 Estimates from the residential sorting model
       Table 4 presents estimation results from the first-step discrete choice model.                             The

coefficient on counterfactual income is 1.62, which is statistically significantly different

from zero, implying that households are more likely to reside in the locations where

they can earn high income.                  There exists a remarkable disutility associated with

leaving one’s hukou city.22              The disutility of moving increases as households leave


  22
    In China, most people’s hukou city is the same as their birth city. China Labor-force Dynamics Survey in 2014
has the information of both hukou location and birth location, and this data covers 14226 families and 23594
individuals in 29 provinces of China. Using this data, we find that only 7.08% of people’s hukou city is different
from their birth city. It is natural to guess that this number is smaller in 2005. Additionally, it usually takes a long
time for migrants to obtain local hukou. Some local governments’ official documents require that migrants must

                                                          27
their hukou provinces, and then hukou macro-regions, but at a decreasing rate.                                   The

interaction between out of hukou city dummy and three city group dummies imply that

the moving disutility is lowest in Beijing and Shanghai in China, followed by sub-

provincial level cities, provincial capitals and ordinary cities in ascending order.

Although it is most difficult to obtain local hukou in Beijing and Shanghai, the two

large cities provide migrants with the maximum amount of economic opportunity.23

Because the benefits from economic opportunities outweigh the costs associated with

obtaining local hukou, the consequence of combing the two effects is that moving

disutility is relatively low in large cities of China.                  The 2005 One-Percent Population

Census of China shows that about 31.8% of migrants choose to locate in the 10 largest

cities of China.          Therefore, the results in Table 4 are consistent with the spatial

distribution of migrants in China – the majority of migrants choose to reside in Beijing,

Shanghai and the other metropolitan areas of China.

      The city-specific fixed effects in Table 4 represent the average indirect utilities

from residing in each city, independent of moving disutility and household earnings.

It is not feasible to list average utilities for all the cities; therefore, we present the mean

of these city fix effects.          The city-specific utilities are measured relative to Beijing,

which we set to zero.

      We use housing-price adjusted city fixed effects as the dependent variable in the

second-step estimation.               Table 5 presents the second-stage OLS results from


work in the city for more than 3 years before applying for local hukou. If a migrant moved out from his hometown
and obtains hukou in a second city, he must have worked in this city for a long period, and get used to the life in the
city. Overall, there exists a significant moving disutility for households leaving their hukou city.
   23
      In our study, economic opportunities not only refer to job opportunities, but also include other opportunities,
such as assimilate into local society, learn and improve personal ability, and invest in profitable projects etc.

                                                         28
estimating equation (14).     The first row in each column shows the coefficient on

lnPM2.5.    The OLS estimates of marginal utilities of air pollution are all statistically

significant with the expected negative sign.      Negative preference for air pollution

suggests that air pollution results in utility losses, and households prefer to settle in

locations with cleaner air.

     Chinese households have expressed concern over worsening air pollution in their

residential cities.   Some families have even fled highly polluted cities, giving up

earnings in exchange for air quality improvements.     Compared to column (1) of Table

5, the coefficient on lnPM2.5 rises in magnitude after we control for city characteristics

in column (2).    Fine particle concentration tends to be correlated with local industrial

pollutant emissions.     To account for the potential role played by local industrial

emissions, we add three industrial emissions variables as covariates in Column (3).

The inclusion of these industrial emissions has only a trivial effect on the marginal

impact of PM2.5 concentration.

     It is likely that air pollution is correlated with unobservable local variables that

affect both housing costs and household income.        Hence, we use two instrumental

variables together to deal with the endogeneity problem.     Table 6 reports the second-

step IV estimates.    In comparison with the corresponding OLS results, the coefficients

on lnPM2.5 from IV estimation increase approximately 40% in magnitude – the OLS

estimates range from -0.78 to -0.71 while the IV results range from -1.10 to -0.98.   The

results suggest that the endogeneity problem leads to downwardly biased estimates of

households’ preference for air quality improvements.      Similar to OLS estimates, the


                                            29
inclusion of industrial pollutant emissions does little to affect the coefficient on

lnPM2.5.

        The coefficients on other city characteristics differ in significance, but most have

the expected sign.          Cities with more education services and higher GDP per capita are

significantly more appealing to residents.                 The coefficient on population24 is negative

but insignificant, implying that households do not place significant value on city size

after controlling for GDP per capita and local amenities.                             The coefficient on the

minimum distance to three large seaports is negative, and significantly different from

zero.     Regional development is out of balance in China, and economic development,

good amenities and regional preference of government policies are centralized in

several coastal provinces of China.               Hence, households prefer to reside in coastal cities.

        Tables A4-A6 in the appendix present coefficient estimates for lnPM2.5 for

thirteen different specifications.               The specifications vary in three dimensions: (i)

different thresholds in the construction of IV, (ii) exclusion of power plants within

50km of a given city in the construction of IV, and (iii) dropping the observations in

Xinjiang and Shanxi province.

        On the basis of these results, we conclude that the main specification of our study

does a good job and that our findings are insensitive to the choice of econometric

specification in the second step estimation.



   24
      Population might be correlated with unobservable city attributes; we include it here simply to account for the
impact of unobservables and prevent bias in other parameters where we have more interest (here, air pollution). To
deal with the potential for endogeneity of current population, we also employ a specification using the city population
in 1982 as an instrument. The coefficient on PM2.5 remains essentially the same in magnitude and significance,
and the coefficient on population becomes insignificant. We also employ a second-step estimation without
controlling for population, and the results are nearly identical to the main results.

                                                         30
5.4 Marginal willingness to pay
      In the residential sorting framework, we can recover the marginal willingness to

pay for clean air through the estimated parameters of equations (13) and (14).                              For

household 𝑖 residing in city 𝑗, the MWTP in the residential soring model is calculated

as:




                                 𝑀𝑊𝑇𝑃$ = 𝛽œC /𝛽L 𝐼$,& /𝑃𝑀2.5&                                              (17)




      To compare the conventional hedonic model and the residential sorting model

incorporating moving disutility, we estimate a comparable MWTP through the

coefficients from the wage hedonic model of equation (15) and the housing-price

hedonic model of equation (16).              The MWTP in the hedonic framework is computed

as:



                                  ¢                  M
                         𝑀𝑊𝑇𝑃$ = 𝛽œC − 𝛽œC 𝜌& 𝐻$,& /𝐼$,& 𝐼$,& /𝑃𝑀2.5&                                      (18)




      Table 7 reports the MWTP for air quality of a representative household using the

median household income ($1481.24) and the median fine particulate matter

concentration for affected households (41.39 µg/m³) in the sample. 25                             Hence, the

results represent the median household’s willingness to pay for a 1 µg/m³ decline in

PM2.5 concentration, expressed in 2005 U.S. dollars.                      We focus on the full model,

  25
     To capture the median household preference for clean air, we use the median PM2.5 concentration for affected
households to calculate the MWTP. We merge the micro household data with city level PM2.5 data using the four-
digit code of residential city, and calculate the median level PM2.5 concentration and the standard deviation of
PM2.5 concentration for affected households in the sample.

                                                         31
and make a comparison of the MWTP estimated by the hedonic model versus the

residential sorting model.

     The results provide strong evidence of the importance of dealing with endogeneity,

as well as accounting for sorting process and migration disutility in developing

countries.   The first and second row of Table 7 present the OLS and IV estimates from

the conventional hedonic framework, respectively.        The MWTP estimated by hedonic

OLS regression has a negative sign, which is inconsistent with prior expectations.

When we use instrumental variables to address the endogeneity problem, the MWTP is

still negative, but declines in magnitude.     All of the hedonic results suggest that the

economic value of clean air is negative.          Given the adverse effects of severe air

pollution on health and productivity in developing countries like China, these estimates

are unreasonable.       The third and fourth rows present the OLS and IV estimates from

the residential sorting model with migration disutility.     Both OLS and IV estimates

from residential sorting model have an expected positive sign.        After instrumenting

for air quality, the MWTP estimated by the residential sorting model rises dramatically

from $15.61 to $21.70 in the full model, indicating the importance of addressing

endogeneity problem.

     There is a striking difference between estimates from the hedonic model and the

residential sorting model in our study.    Comparing the results shown in the second and

fourth rows of Table 7, the sign of the estimated MWTP changes from negative to

positive after accounting for the discrete and imbalanced distribution of amenities and

migration disutility.     Bayer et al. (2009) estimate the MWTP for clean air in the U.S.


                                             32
The MWTP estimated by the hedonic model is positive but increases in magnitude

when accounting for moving disutility in the residential sorting framework.     Thus, the

bias problem in our study is more severe than that in Bayer et al. (2009). In comparison

with the U.S., moving costs are higher in China, and the spatial distribution of amenities

is more discontinuous and imbalanced, which can explain the extreme results found

with the hedonic model.

     We now use our results to estimate the economic value of air quality improvement

in China – in other words, the willingness to pay (WTP) for a decline in fine particle

concentration.   Following Freeman (1974) and Chay and Greenstone (2005), we

assume that household preferences are linear and homogeneous with respect to air

quality level, thus the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for clean air is constant.

Our estimates indicate that a median household would pay $21.70 for a one-unit decline

in annual average PM2.5 concentration.            The standard deviation of PM2.5

concentration for affected households is 14.58 in China in 2005, thus the median

household is willing to pay $316.39 for a one-standard-deviation decrease in PM2.5

concentration, which accounts for 21.36% of median household income.          Given 407

million households in China in 2005, the economic benefit of air quality improvement

is up to $8.83 billion associated with a one-unit reduction in annual PM2.5

concentration, and $128.77 billion associated with a one-standard-deviation decline in

annual PM2.5 concentration.       The welfare benefit of air quality improvement is

substantial, which is in accordance with the fact that severe air pollution endangers

residential health and economic development in developing countries like China.      Our


                                           33
estimates provide a monetary measure of the benefits of air quality improvement, and

shed light on the importance of air pollution control in developing countries.


5.5 Sensitivity Analysis


     To examine the robustness of the main results, we report the MWTP for clean air

estimated under a range of alternative empirical specifications.       In our baseline

estimates, we specify 500km as the maximum distance to construct the instrumental

variables.    Table 8 presents the estimated MWTP using a variety of thresholds (450km,

475km, 500km, 525km, 550km) in the construction of the instrumental variable.      The

MWTP are calculated using the corresponding coefficients on lnPM2.5 in Table A4.

The estimated MWTP using different thresholds in IV construction are nearly identical,

which indicates that our results are remarkably robust to the maximum distance in the

definition of IV.

     Next, we exclude large-scale thermal power plants that are less than 50km from

city 𝑗. This approach imposes a stronger restriction on the IV strategy, and reduces

the potential for correlation between our instrumental variable and local economic

activity.    Table 9 shows the estimated MWTP using power plants more than 50km but

inside various distance thresholds in IV construction.   The results are computed using

the corresponding coefficients on lnPM2.5 in Table A5.         A comparison between

Tables 8 and 9 shows that the estimated MWTP hardly changes with and without the

exclusion of these power plants, which confirms the orthogonality of our baseline

instrumental variables to local economic activity.

      Recall that there is no large-scale coal-fired power plant in Xinjiang province,

                                           34
but the concentration of fine particulate matter is high due to large areas of desert in

this province.        As a result, the correlations between our instrumental variables and

local air pollution are weak in this province.               To address this concern, we drop the two

cities of located there in our second step estimation, and the results are shown in the

first row of Table 10. 26            Exclusion of Xinjiang Province does little to affect our

estimated MWTP.

           Another concern with the validity of our instrumental variables strategy is that

the central government might locate large-scale thermal power plants in regions where

coal production is high.           Shanxi is the largest coal production province in China, and

accounts for 29.9% of total coal production in China in 2005.27                          Therefore, we drop

the eleven cities of Shanxi Province in our sample in the second step estimation.28                           The

estimated MWTPs are presented in the second row of Table 9, and they are qualitatively

similar to our baseline estimates of MWTP.                   We also drop the cities in both Xinjiang

and Shanxi province in our second-step estimation; the estimated MWTP’s are shown

in the bottom row of Table 9.              Exclusion of the cities in the two provinces has little

impact on our results.

valuation of non-marketed amenities in China.       We develop a discrete-choice model

of household residential location decisions that incorporates migration disutility and

use it to recover the parameters of indirect utilities associated with residing in various

cities across China.    We use two innovative instrumental variables for air pollution

concentration in a given city – the smallest angle between the annual prevailing wind

direction and the large-scale thermal power plants outside the city, along with the total

annual coal consumption of the large-scale thermal power plants located upwind from

the city.   We use the estimates from this model to calculate the MTWP for air quality

improvement in China.

       Our results indicate a striking difference between the residential sorting model and

the conventional hedonic model.        The MWTP recovered with the discrete sorting

model incorporating moving disutility implies that the median household is willing to

pay $21.70 for a one-unit decline in annual PM2.5 concentration.          In contrast, the

comparable MWTP from the conventional hedonic model is unexpectedly negative,

implying that the hedonic model severely underestimates the monetary value of clean

air.   Using instrumental variables to address the endogeneity bias yields noticeable

differences in both methodologies.

       Our study suggests that the welfare effects of environmental quality improvements

are substantial in developing countries like China.      This helps to address the central

puzzle at the interaction of environmental economics and development economics

(Greenstone and Jack, 2015).      Although credible estimates of the costs of air pollution

regulation are not available, our results indicate that the true value of air quality


                                             36
improvement is substantially higher than has been previously recognized, which shed

light on the social benefits of pollution regulation policies for governments in

developing countries.
