                                               ABSTRACT

        This paper addresses the question of whether societies that afford economic opportunity to
women offer other opportunities as well. The analysis in this paper shows that the performance of a
country’s women in international athletic competition reflects the degree of their relative participation in
that country’s labor market. There is a significant positive relationship across countries between a high
ratio of the labor force participation rate of women to the labor force participation rate of men and the
number and type of medals won by a country’s women in the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics. Teams
representing countries with high relative labor force participation rates also were both more likely to
qualify for the 1999 Women’s Soccer World Cup and to do well in that competition. This effect of
relative labor force participation rates on athletic success is found while controlling for a nation’s income
per capita, population, men’s performance in related sporting events, rate of participation of women in
government, and fertility rate. These results suggest that the participation of women in a country’s labor
force is an important reflection of their opportunities in other areas as well.

I. Introduction

        What can a country’s performances in international sporting events, like the

Olympics or the World Cup, teach us about its society? World-class level competitors

are more likely to come from more populous countries, all else equal, since these nations

represent larger pools of potential talent. The percentage of a country’s population that

has the opportunity to develop their athletic talent is larger in richer countries where

people are healthier, the young are less likely to be engaged in work, and more resources

are devoted to leisure activities, including sports. A number of studies have shown that,

in fact, population and per capita income are significant determinants of Olympic

success.1

        The analysis in this paper demonstrates that another key characteristic of a

country, one not studied in any previous research on this topic, is related to the

achievements of its citizens in international athletic competitions. The performance of a

country’s women in international sporting events is related to the economic opportunities

afforded them, as measured by the ratio of the labor force participation rate of women to

the labor force participation rate of men. This result is consistently obtained in

regressions in which we control for population and per capita income, as well as the

athletic success of a country’s men, a variable that can capture a range of unobservable

factors that reflect a country’s commitment to sports. We also provide evidence that the

explanatory power of the ratio of labor force participation rates on women’s athletic

 Studies of the determinants of the success of a country’s athletes at the Summer Olympics include the
analyses of the 1964 games by Donald W. Ball (1972), the 1972 games by Ned Levine (1974) and by A.
Ray Grimes, William J. Kelly and Paul H. Rubin (1974), a panel of 24 Summer Olympiads over the period
1896 to 2000 by Gerard Kuper and Elmer Sterken (2001a), the post-World War II Summer Olympic Games
by Daniel K.N. Johnson and Ayfer Ali (2000, 2002), and the Summer Olympic Games from 1960 to 1996
by Andrew B. Bernard and Meghan R. Busse (2000).


                                                    1
success is not merely reflecting the effect of the role of women in a country’s government

or its fertility rate, even though these two variables are both correlated with the ratio of

labor force participation rates and each explains, to some extent, the success of women in

international athletic competitions. These results suggest that the cross-country evidence

of the participation of women in a country’s labor force is an important reflection of their

opportunities in other areas of society as well.

        These results are based on evidence from the Sydney Summer Olympics in 2000

and Women’s Soccer World Cup in 1999.2 We conduct a variety of tests, including ones

on the number and type of Olympic medals earned, the likelihood of qualifying for the

World Cup, and the number of points earned in World Cup Competition. These

competitions are well suited for our analysis since they include a much wider pool of

countries than other international sporting events, like Wimbledon or the Winter

Olympics, where competitors are typically drawn from a narrow set of industrial

countries.

        The relationship between the ratio of labor force participation rates and number of

Olympic medals won can be sizeable. For example, our estimates suggest that women

from a country at the 75th percentile of this variable won almost 3 more medals than their

sisters who hail from a country at the 25th percentile. To illustrate this, we note that

Canadian women won 7 medals in Sydney while Spanish women won 4. The main

difference between these countries is not income, or population, but the fact that Canada

 There are no other studies, to my knowledge, of the economic and demographic determinants of the
success of countries in either the Women’s or Men’s Soccer World Cup competition comparable to the
ones on the determinants of success in Olympic competition.



                                                   2
is at the 75th percentile of the ratio of labor force participation rates of women relative to

men while Spain is at the 25th percentile.

         In the next section of this paper we describe both our main measure of women’ s

relative integration in the labor force, the ratio of labor force participation rates, and our

cross-country indicators of women’s international athletic performance. We also provide

some statistics on both of these variables and their relationship in this section. We then

present a more complete analysis of the relationship between the performance of a

country’s women in the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics and its ratio of labor force

participation rates. This is followed by a similar analysis using data from the 1999

Women’s World Cup. Section V offers some concluding comments.




II. Labor Force Participation and Athletic Performance: A First Look

         The central idea of this paper is that cross-country evidence of women’s

performance in international athletic competition reflects differences across countries in

women’s economic opportunities, as manifested by their relative rates of participation in

a nation’s labor market.3 In this section, we describe the main sets of variables used to

test this hypothesis. Some initial statistics on the relationship between women’s presence

in the labor market and their performance in international athletic competition, presented

at the end of this section, serve as a warm-up for the regression analysis that follows in

the next two sections.




3
 It would be desirable to use in this analysis, in addition to the ratio of labor force participation rates, a
variable that reflects the ratio of women’s wages to men’s wages, controlling for differences in human
capital across the sexes, but there is no series like this available for a wide cross-section of countries.


                                                         3
II.A . Labor Market Participation

        In a survey article on women’s labor force participation and economic

development, Kristin Mammen and Christina Paxson (2000) write “Women’s labor force

status relative to that of men is an important benchmark of their status in society.” (p.

141). The World Bank Development Indicators 2001 volume echoes this idea with the

text accompanying the table presenting the ratio of labor force participation rates of

women relative to that of men, which reads “Girls in many developing countries are

allowed less education than boys are – a disparity reflected in lower female primary

enrollment and higher female illiteracy. As a result, women have fewer employment

opportunities, especially in the formal sector.” (p. 23).

        In this paper, we use the 1999 value of the ratio of labor force participation rates

(which we call LaborRatio) as an indicator of women’s economic opportunities in a

country in that year. This ratio represents the rate of economically active women relative

to the rate of economically active men.4 The distribution of this variable is depicted in

the histogram in Figure 1. This histogram reflects the fact that 73 countries, representing

almost half the sample, had a value of LaborRatio less than 0.72. Another 45 percent of

the sample, representing 68 countries, had a value of LaborRatio between 0.72 and 0.91,

and the remaining 8 countries, with a value of LaborRatio greater than 0.91, were all

countries with levels of income per capita of less than $800 in 1999. We note that the

World Development Indicators 2001 includes the remark that a value of unity of

  The International Labor Organization defines the economically active population as all those who supply
labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period, including both the employed and
the unemployed.



                                                    4
LaborRatio indicates gender equality. But only 2 of the 149 countries in this sample,

Cambodia and Ghana, have values of LaborRatio equal to or greater than 1.5

         While the eight countries with the highest values of the ratio of labor force

participation rates all had low levels of income per capita, the 26 countries in the sample

with a value of LaborRatio below 0.52 (the value for Ireland) all had levels of income per

capita below $8,100, and 22 of these countries had a level of income per capita below

$4,000. Mammen and Paxson (2000) show that, across countries, there is a U-shaped

relationship between the rate of women participating in the labor force and the logarithm

of income per capita. As shown in Figure 2, a similar relationship holds for LaborRatio

and the logarithm of income per capita in our sample of 149 countries. The solid line in

this figure represents the estimated relationship between LaborRatio and two regressors,

the logarithm of income per capita and the squared value of the logarithm of income per

capita. The estimated regression result is

                           LaborRatio = 2.11 – 0.36 lnGDPcap + 0.02 lnGDPcap2

where lnGDPcap is the natural logarithm of income per capita. The coefficients on both

income and income squared are significant at better than the 99 percent level of

confidence and the R2 of this regression is 0.13.

         The minimum point of the quadratic function corresponds to a level of income per

capita of about $3700, which is close to the levels of income per capita for Mexico and

Botswana. At this level of income, the estimated value of LaborRatio is 0.63. In fact, the

lowest values of LaborRatio among the countries in our data set are well below this, with

5
 The correlations between LaborRatio, which is calculated using 1999 values of the labor force
participation rates, and the same ratios calculated with data for 1994, 1989, and 1979 are 0.998, 0.995 and
0.945, respectively, for the 149 countries used in the analysis of the Olympics. The results reported in the




                                                       5
0.23 for Saudi Arabia, 0.32 for Belize, and 0.33 for Jordan. The three countries with the

highest values of LaborRatio in our data set are Tanzania (0.95), Cambodia (1.00) and

Ghana (1.01), all of which had annual income per capita in 1999 of less than $500.

Consistent with the U-shaped fitted relationship between LaborRatio and the logarithm of

income per capita, richer countries are also counted among those with the highest levels

of the ratio of labor force participation rates. For example, seven rich countries had a

value of LaborRatio greater than 0.80, including the United States (0.82), Canada (0.82),

Iceland (0.84), Denmark (0.85), Norway (0.85), Finland (0.88) and Sweden (0.90).



II.B Performance in International Athletic Events

         One criterion in the choice of indicators used in this paper to measure national

athletic performance is to select variables that allow for the widest possible set of

countries in our data set. Therefore, we use the results of the Summer Olympics and the

Women’s World Cup. We use two variables reflecting the outcomes of the 2000

Sydney Olympics and two variables indicating performance in the 1999 Women’s World

Cup. The two Olympic variables are Medals, which is the number of Olympic medals

won by women, and MedalPoints, a point-weighted measure of the number of Olympic

medals won by women, where a gold medal counts as 5 points, a silver medal as 3 points,

and a bronze medal as 1 point.6 The two measures reflecting the outcome of the 1999


rest of this paper are virtually identical to those obtained by replacing LaborRatio with an average of the
labor force participation rates in 1979, 1989 and 1999.
6
  Grimes, Kelley and Rubin (1974), Levine (1974), and Bernard and Busse (2000) do not distinguish across
types of medals while Ball (1972) used weights of 3, 2 and 1 for gold, silver and bronze, Johnson and Ali
(2000) used an ordered probit model and Kuper and Sterken (2001a) ran separate regressions for each type
of medal. While counting medals in most cases is straightforward, some clarification is worth noting. A
team medal counts as one medal for a country. A medal in mixed doubles badminton counts as a medal for
a woman (there is no mixed doubles in Olympic tennis). In several events (especially Judo) there were ties


                                                      6
Women’s World Cup competition are Cup99, a dummy variable that takes the value of 1

if a country qualified for the 1999 Women’s World Cup and otherwise equals 0, and

Cup99Points, a variable that adds to the values of Cup99, for the sixteen countries that

qualified for the Women’s World Cup, the number of points earned in competition,

where a win is worth 3 points, a draw is worth 1 point and a loss is worth 0 points.

         Some initial statistics showing the relationship between LaborRatio and each of

the four measures of international athletic performance are presented in Table 1. Each

row of this table represents the sum of the values of Medals, MedalPoints, Cup99, and

Cup99Points for the set of countries in one of the quartiles of LaborRatio. Note that the

values of LaborRatio that define the quartiles differ somewhat between the 149 countries

that competed in the Sydney Summer Olympics for which we have complete data and the

54 countries that were involved in the 1999 Women’s World Cup competition for which

we have complete data.7

         Medals were awarded to women from 59 different countries at the 2000 Summer

Olympics in Sydney. We have data on labor force participation rates, and other

regressors used in our subsequent analysis, for 55 of these countries, as well as for 94

other countries whose women participated in Sydney but did not win any medals.8 Table

1 shows that the countries that had values of LaborRatio in the lowest quartile (that is,



and each medal was counted – for example, two bronze medals were awarded in Women’s Extra
Lightweight Class in Judo, one to a Belgian woman and one to a German woman, and this was recorded as
a bronze medal for each country.
7
  The 54 countries used in the analysis of the World Cup represent 53 countries that attempted to qualify for
World Cup plus the United States that, by virtue of being the host country, was automatically awarded one
of the 16 qualifying slots. As discussed below, 6 other countries that competed in the World Cup
qualifying rounds (but not the World Cup itself) could not be included in our analysis because of missing
data.
8
 The four countries whose women won medals but for which we do not have complete data are Cuba,
North Korea, Taiwan, and Yugoslavia.


                                                      7
between 0.22 and 0.56) won about one-seventh the number of medals of the countries in

the next highest quartile (which had values of LaborRatio between 0.56 and 0.73), about

one-tenth the number of medals won by countries in the third quartile (which had values

of LaborRatio between 0.73 and 0.84), and about one-eighth the number of medals won

by countries in the highest quartile (which had values of LaborRatio between 0.84 and

1.01). The disparity across quartiles in the sum of the values of MedalPoints is even

more pronounced, especially when comparing the lowest quartile to the two highest

quartiles. One reflection of this is that women from countries in the lowest quartile won

20 gold medals while women from countries in the third quartile won 47 gold medals and

women from countries in the highest quartile won 42 gold medals.

        The relative shortfall in performance among countries in the lowest quartile of

LaborRatio is also apparent in the two variables related to the 1999 Women’s World

Cup. Only two countries in the lowest quartile of this set of 54 countries (Brazil, the

country at the 25th percentile in terms of the value of LaborRatio, and Mexico), and two

countries in the second quartile (Nigeria and Italy) qualified for the competition in 1999,

with the other twelve teams that qualified coming from countries with values of

LaborRatio above the median value of 0.67. Teams from countries in the highest quartile

earned, collectively, the most points. This reflects the fact that more teams came from

this quartile than any of the lower ones as well as the fact that the average number of

points earned by a team from this quartile was larger than the average number of points

earned by a team from any of the lower quartiles.

        The U-shaped relationship between LaborRatio and income per capita suggests

that the set of countries in the quartile with the highest values of LaborRatio are drawn




                                                 8
from both the richest and the poorest countries in the sample. The patterns presented in

Table 1 are all the more striking since they do not control for per capita income, an

important determinant of the success of a country’s athletes in international sporting

events. In the next section we investigate the effect of LaborRatio on the success of a

country’s women in the Summer Olympics, controlling for income per capita as well as

other factors.



III. Labor Force Participation and Olympic Success

        The Summer Olympics draws participants from more countries than any other

single athletic event. The athletes at the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics represented 199

countries and territories. Women represented 38 percent of the 10,651 athletes at the

Sydney Games. Out of the 290 events at the 2000 Summer Olympics, 118 events (41

percent) were exclusively for women.

        The success of a country’s women at the Summer Olympics can be explained by a

number of factors. The focus this paper is whether this success reflects the relative

economic opportunities of women in a country’s labor market, as indicated by its value of

LaborRatio, and our empirical specifications includes this variable. We also include a

variable that measures the success of a country’s men in the Olympics. This variable

helps to control for a range of unobserved factors that reflect the overall commitment of a

country to Olympic sports. As explained in more detail below, this variable takes

different forms, depending upon the empirical specification, in order to match it to the

particular test for women’s success in the Olympics. Finally, all specifications also

include two other variables that have been shown in the research cited above to be



                                                 9
important determinants of the overall success of a country’s athletes at the Summer

Olympics. The logarithm of a country’s population between the ages of 15 and 64 in

1999 (lnPop) reflects the size of the initial pool of talent from which elite athletes are

drawn. We also include the logarithm of a country’s income per capita in 1999

(lnGDPcap) as another regressor since the quality of the pool of potential athletes is a

function of the overall physical well-being of the country’s population as well as the

resources devoted to athletic pursuits, both of which are likely to be positively correlated

with income.9

           Table 2 includes three different sets of tests of the influence of LaborRatio on the

success of a country’s women at the 2000 Summer Olympics. The first tests

(Regressions 1 – 3 in Table 2) are probit regressions in which the dependent variable

distinguishes between countries whose women won at least one medal and those

countries whose women won no medals. In these regressions, the variable AnyMen,

representing the success of a country’s men at the Olympics, is also dichotomous, taking

the value 1 if any men from a country won a medal and otherwise taking the value 0. The

next tests (Regressions 4 – 6 in Table 2) are tobit regressions in which the dependent

variable is Medals, described above. These regressions include the regressor MedalsMen,

representing the number of medals won by a country’s men. The final three regressions

presented in Table 2 (Regressions 7 – 9) also use tobit, but in this case the dependent

variable is MedalPts, described above. These regressions include a variable representing

the medal points earned by a country’s men, MedalPtsMen.

           The significance of the control variables, lnGDPcap, lnPop, and the variables

representing the success of a country’s men in the Olympics, on the probability of a

9
    A data appendix at the end of the paper discusses the variables used in the analysis.

                                                       10
country’s women winning at least one medal, on the number of medals won by a

country’s women, and on the weighted value of the number of medals won by a country’s

women is demonstrated in columns 1, 4 and 7, respectively, of Table 2. In each case, the

coefficients on all three of the variables included in the regressions are highly significant,

with p-values less than 0.02 for all coefficients.

        Our main interest, however, in on the regressions that include LaborRatio. The

results presented in columns 2, 5 and 8 augment those in columns 1,4, and 7,

respectively, with this variable. In each of these three regressions, the coefficient on

LaborRatio is significant, with p-values of about 0.01 or better.

        The point estimate of 10.08 in the tobit regression on the number of medals won

(Column 5) suggests that women from a country at the 75th percentile of LaborRatio

earned 2.82 more medals than their sisters from a country at the 25th percentile solely by

virtue of the difference in the relative labor force participation rates (since 2.82 = 10.08 x

(0.84 – 0.56 )). This is a notable amount since there were 21 countries whose women

won only 1 medal and another 24 whose women won between 2 and 8. This is also

comparable to the ceteris paribus effects of population and income per capita since the

differences between the estimated numbers of medals won by women from a country at

the 75th percentile and a country at the 25th percentile for these two variables are 2.96 for

income per capita and 3.67 for population.

        Column 8 of Table 2 present an estimate of the effect of LaborRatio on the medal

points earned by women. This estimate suggests that women from a country that has a

value of LaborRatio at the 75th percentile value will earn 8.01 more medal points (28.59 x

(0.84 – 0.56 )) than women from a country that is otherwise identical but for having a




                                                     11
value of LaborRatio at the 25th percentile value. The comparable estimates for the

differences between the estimated numbers of medal points won by women from a

country at the 75th percentile and a country at the 25th percentile of income per capita and

population are 7.60 and 10.20, respectively.



III.A Robustness

         One possible concern with these results is that our measure of the integration of

women in the workforce, LaborRatio, is serving as a proxy for other features of a

country. For example, we may suspect that those countries that have a higher proportion

of women in the labor force may also have a greater presence of women in the

government. In this case, it may be that a higher representation of women in government

is associated greater support of women’s athletics and this, in turn, contributes to the

performance of a country’s women in the Summer Olympics. In addition, we may

suspect that a higher relative labor force participation rate reflects a lower fertility rate,

which means that more young women have the opportunity to participate in sports rather

than raise children.10 This could also contribute to the success of a country’s women at

the Olympics.

         We test for the robustness of LaborRatio to the presence of these variables by

augmenting the specification discussed above with two variables, the percentage of

women in all levels of a country’s government, WomenGov, and the fertility rate of



10
  In fact, augmenting the relative labor force participation rate equation presented in Section II with the
variables WomenGov and Fertility described in the next paragraph results in the estimated relationship
         LaborRatio = 2.87 – 0.50 lnGDPcap + 0.03 lnGDPcap2 + 0.004 WomenGov – 0.04 Fertility
This regression is run on data from 146 countries and the R2 is 0.22. All the coefficients in this equation
are significant at better than the 95 percent level of confidence.



                                                      12
women in a country, Fertility. 11 These results are reported in Columns 3, 6 and 9 of

Table 2. In each case, the coefficient on LaborRatio is smaller when WomenGov and

Fertility are included in the regression, confirming, to some extent, our concern.

However, the p-values on the coefficient on LaborRatio are 0.035, 0.027 and 0.08 in the

regressions in columns 3, 6, and 9, respectively, showing that LaborRatio has a

significant effect on the probability of a country’s women winning at least one medal, on

the number of medals won by a country’s women, and on the weighted value of the

number of medals won by a country’s women, even when including these two variables.

         We also conducted robustness tests by including three different dummy variables;

one denoting countries that were members of the former Soviet Union, one denoting

other countries in Eastern Europe, and one denoting the host country, Australia.12 In a

tobit regression of the number of medals won by a country’s women that includes these

three dummy variables, as well as those included in the specification in Column 6 of

Table 2, the coefficient on LaborRatio is 8.32 (which is larger than the value of the

coefficient reported in Column 6) and its p-value is 0.017. This increase in the value of

the coefficient on LaborRatio with the inclusion of these three regional dummy variables

also occurs in a tobit regression in which the dependent variable is MedalPts. In this

case, augmenting the specification reported in Column 9 with the three regional dummy

variables results in an estimated coefficient on LaborRatio of 21.82, with a p-value of

11
   The effect of LaborRatio on the probability of a country’s women winning any medals, on the number of
medals won by a country’s women, or on the number of medal points earned by a country’s women is
virtually the same whether we use WomenGov or, alternatively, the percentage of women in ministerial
level positions or the percentage of women in sub-ministerial positions, two other variables available in the

0.058. A probit regression like the one presented in Column 3 that drops Australia and

also includes two dummy variables, one for Eastern European countries and another for

countries that were former members of the Soviet Union, yields a point estimate of 2.57

for the coefficient on LaborRatio, with a p-value of 0.03.



III.B Individual Events versus Team Events

         We close this section with an investigation of whether the effect of LaborRatio on

the number of medals won by women differs across team and individual events. There

were 260 medals awarded for individual events to women from the 149 countries

included in our data set, and 100 medals awarded to teams that included women. Table 3

presents tobit regressions in which the dependent variable is either the number of medals

won by women in individual events (in Columns 1 and 2) or the number of medals won

by teams that included women (in Columns 3 and 4). Thus, these regressions take the

form of those presented in Columns 5 and 6 of Table 2.

         The results presented in Table 3 suggest that there is a slightly larger effect of

LaborRatio on the number of medals won by women in individual events than on the

number of medals won by women in team events, but this difference is not statistically

significant. The coefficient on LaborRatio is significant at better than the 97 percent

level in the regressions reported in Columns 1, 2 and 3. Only the results in Column 4 fail

to present a significant coefficient for LaborRatio. But in this regression, the F-test of the

joint significance of the coefficients on LaborRatio and Fertility has a p-value of 0.03,

while the p-values for the individual coefficients are 0.12 and 0.09, respectively.


In addition, we also used a dummy variable that indicated whether a country was predominantly Muslim
and found that this was insiginificant and its inclusion did not alter the estimated effect of LaborRatio.


                                                      14
           We next turn to an analysis of relative labor force participation rates on the

outcome of an event that includes only team competition, the Women’s Soccer World

Cup.



IV. Labor Force Participation and the Women’s World Cup

           Like many other team sports, recent years have seen an increase in women’s

participation in soccer. One reflection of this was the institution of the Women’s World

Cup in 1992. In the run-up to the third Women’s World Cup, which was held in the

United States in 1999, national teams from 59 countries and territories competed for the

fifteen available slots in the competition.13

           In this section we demonstrate that the relative labor force participation rate is a

significant determinant of both the likelihood of a women’s national soccer team

qualifying for one of the available slots in the Women’s World Cup competition in 1999

and the performance of those 16 teams that participated in the World Cup. This effect

holds while controlling for factors similar to those that determine the success of a

country’s women in the Olympics, including population and income per capita. In

addition, we may think that some countries are more devoted to soccer than others, so we

also include as a regressor a dummy variable indicating whether a country’s men’s soccer

team qualified for the 1998 World Cup (Cup98Men).

           The first four columns of Table 4 present probit estimates of the likelihood of a

country’s team qualifying for the 1999 Women’s World Cup. The countries included in

the analysis include those that competed for a slot in the World Cup and for which we


13
     The United States, as host country, was automatically awarded one slot.


                                                      15
have complete data. The United States, which automatically qualified for a slot, is not

included in these estimates. The estimates in Columns 1, 2 and 4 do not include North

Korea, a country that did qualify for the 1999 Women’s World Cup, since there is no

available data on its income per capita. To check for the possible influence of North

Korea on the results, Column 3 presents a specification without income per capita which

does include an observation for North Korea.14

         The estimate presented in Column 1 includes the control variables lnGDPcap,

lnPop, and Cup98Men. The p-values of the coefficient on lnPop and lnGDPcap are

0.004 and 0.099, respectively, while the coefficient on Cup98Men is not significant. The

estimate presented in Column 2 introduces LaborRatio, and the coefficient on this

variable is a significant at better than the 99 percent level of confidence. The pseudo-R2

of the regression rises from 0.21 to 0.37 with the inclusion of LaborRatio. Furthermore,

the inclusion of LaborRatio makes the coefficient on lnGDPcap insignificant. We drop

lnGDPcap from the specification in the estimate reported in Column 3, which allows us

to include North Korea as an observation. In this case, the coefficient on LaborRatio has

a p-value of 0.001. The results presented in Column 4 show that the significant effect of

LaborRatio on the probability of a country’s team qualifying for the World Cup is robust

to the inclusion of WomenGov and Fertility in the regression, with a p-value of the

coefficient on LaborRatio equal to 0.009 in this case.

         Columns 5 through 8 of Table 4 presents tobit estimates in which the dependent

variables is Cup99Points (which represents 1 + the number of points earned in World

14
   Six other countries and territories that competed in tournaments to qualify could not be included because
of a lack of data on population. These include Guam, Taiwan, Martinique, Puerto Rico, Tonga, and
Western Samoa. Hong Kong does not have data on the percentage of women in government, so it is not
included in the regressions in Columns 4 and 8 of Table 4.

Cup Competition, as discussed in Section II).15 LaborRatio is a significant determinant

of this variable, as shown in the results in Columns 6 through 8, with p-values of less

than 0.01 in all three cases. The inclusion of LaborRatio raises the pseudo-R2 from 0.12

(as shown by the results in Column 5) to 0.21.16

         The effect of LaborRatio on the number of points earned in World Cup

competition is also evident when we restrict the sample to the 16 teams that qualified for

the event in 1999. We regress the number of points won by a team that participated in

the World Cup (i.e. Cup99Points – 1) against LaborRatio, Cup98Men and lnPop,

dropping lnGDPcap and WomenGov as regressors since data on these variables are not

available for North Korea. The estimated relationship is

(Cup99Points –1) =         -81.86 + 34.76 LaborRatio + 7.60 Cup98Men +                    3.35 lnPop

where robust standard errors appear in parentheses below the coefficient values, bold

represents a coefficient significant at better than the 95 percent level of confidence, and

italic represents a coefficient significant at between the 90 percent and 95 percent levels

15
  Adding 1 to the number of points earned in World Cup competition enables us to distinguish between
Mexico and Denmark, two countries whose teams qualified for the World Cup but lost all their games, and
other countries whose teams did not qualify for the World Cup.
16
   As a robustness check of both the probit and tobit estimates, we augmented the specifications that include
WomenGov and Fertility with two dummy variables, one representing countries that were members of the
former Soviet Union and one representing countries that are predominantly Muslim. The coefficient on
LaborRatio is 6.67 and its p-value is 0.014 in a probit regression that includes these two dummy variables
as well as the other variables included in the specification reported in Column 4. A tobit regression that
includes these two dummy variables as well as the others included in the specification of Column 8 has a
coefficient on LaborRatio of 45.93 with a p-value below is 0.001. In neither case are the dummy variables
significant.

the ceteris paribus effect of LaborRatio on the number of points earned in the 1999

Women’s World Cup with a partial regression leverage plot of this relationship.17

         The pattern of significance of the other variables included in Table 4 bears

mention. There is a significant effect of Cup98Men in the tobit regressions, with p-values

of 0.07, 0.02 and 0.02 in the estimates reported in Columns 6, 7, and 8, respectively. The

importance of this variable is less pronounced in the probit regressions. Population is a

significant determinant of the number of points earned by teams in World Cup

competition in all specifications reported in Table 4. The coefficient on WomenGov is

significant at the 93 percent level of confidence in the regression reported in Column 4,

and at better than the 99 percent level of confidence in the regression reported in Column

8. Neither the estimates in Column 4 nor those in Column 8 include a significant effect

of Fertility. Interestingly, the estimate in Column 4 of Table 3 also did not indicate that

Fertility is a significant determinant of the number of medals won by teams in the

Summer Olympics, although there is a significant effect of this variable on the number of

individual medals. Perhaps this is linked to the fact that the average age of women in

individual sports, like swimming or gymnastics, is lower than the average age of women

in team sports.

V. Conclusion

        This paper demonstrates a link between an economic and social feature of

countries, the relative labor force participation rate of women, and a high-profile

characteristic, the performance of women in international sports competitions. Countries

in which women participate more fully in the labor force tend to be ones whose women

performed better in the Sydney Summer Olympics in 2000, and whose women’s teams

both were more likely to qualify for the 1999 Women’s World Cup and performed better

in this event. This effect holds when controlling for factors shown, in other research, to

determine national Olympic success, like income per capita and population. In addition

to these variables, we also control for the athletic success of a country’s men, the rate of

participation of women in government and the fertility rate.

        These demonstrated statistical relationships, between relative labor force

participation and athletic success, are silent as to causes. It is reasonable to conjecture,

however, that societies in which women have greatere economic opportunities are ones

that enable athletically talented women to reach their full potential. In these societies,

women are more likely to be able to succeed in both work and play.
