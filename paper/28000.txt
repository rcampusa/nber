                                         ABSTRACT

We examine how exposure of Chinese firms to the Covid-19 shock varied with a cluster index
(measuring spatial agglomeration of firms in related industries) at the county level. Two data
sources are used: entry flows of newly registered firms in the entire country, and an entrepreneur
survey regarding operation of existing firms. Both show greater resilience in counties with a
higher cluster index, after controlling for industry dummies and local infection rates, besides
county and time dummies in the entry data. Reliance of clusters on informal entrepreneur
hometown networks and closer proximity to suppliers and customers help explain these findings.

1    Introduction
The importance of firm clusters in industrial organization has been noted by many scholars, going
back to Marshall (1920).The standard definition refers to spatial agglomeration of firms in a common
industry to realize inter-firm spillovers in sharing of technology, inputs and customers. Clusters have
played an important role in industrial development in the early 20th century in both the UK and the
USA, and continue to play an important role (e.g. in the Michigan auto industry and California IT
sector). They also play a prominent role in many less developed countries (LDCs) in Asia and Africa,
though with some distinctive characteristics from developed country counterparts: small firm size,
low capital intensity, a high degree of vertical disintegration and specialization in different stages of
production, strong buyer-seller networks across stages of production, prevalence of trade credit, sharing
of tools and information. Inter-firm exchanges within the cluster are governed by informal relational
contracts rather than formal, legally enforced contracts. Entrepreneurs often belong to a common social
network or community, defined by ethnicity or birthplace, allowing informal agreements to be enforced
via community norms. The importance of many of these features such as prevalence of relational
contracts, trade credit and community enforcement in LDCs have been studied by many authors (Kali
(1999), Kranton (1996), McMillan and Woodruff (1999a,b), Banerjee and Munshi (2004), Machiavello
and Morjaria (2015, 2020), Dai et al (2020b)). Other papers in the theoretical networks literature have
provided interesting insights into the role of buyer-seller networks in coping with demand and supply
shocks (Kranton and Minehart (2000, 2001)).
    In China, most major industrial clusters are located close to marketplaces for final products and
intermediate goods where customers from far and near come to make purchases, reducing the need for
firms to carry large inventories e.g., the Zhili childrens garment cluster (Fleisher et al., 2010), or the
Puyuan cashmere sweater cluster (Ruan and Zhang, 2009). The fine division of labor within clusters
reduce capital barriers to entry (Ruan and Zhang, 2009). In addition, the prevalence of trade credit
and flexible payment arrangements ameliorate working capital constraints facing SMEs (Long and
Zhang, 2011; Merima, Peerlings, and Zhang, 2014). As shown by Dai et al (2020b) using Chinese firm
registration data from 1990-2009, entrepreneurs from common hometown networks with high levels
of informal trust and local cooperation (proxied by population density), have succeeded in achiev-


                                                    1
ing higher rates of firm entry, concentrated in fewer sectors and locations, entered with smaller firms
which subsequently grew at faster rates. Besides China, clusters are widespread in other Asian coun-
tries (Sonobe and Otsuka, 2006) and in Africa (World Bank, 2011) and share similar features. Other
examples include the Tirupur garment industry cluster in South India (Banerjee and Munshi 2004),
aquaculture clusters in Bangladesh (Zhang, Chen, and Fang, 2019) and handloom clusters in Ethiopia
(Zhang, Moorman, and Ayele, 2011).
   As mentioned above, LDC firm clusters are contrasted to forms of industrial organization more
common in high income countries or in multinational corporations (MNCs) — characterized by larger
firm size, greater vertical integration, capital intensity, distance from suppliers/customers, and reliance
on formal market contracts rather than informal networks. However, many LDCs exhibit dualism, or
prevalence of the two polar forms of industrial organization. Firm size distributions tend to feature
a thick bottom tail representing large numbers of small firms (including clusters) mainly serving the
domestic market, and medium to large size firms featuring greater vertical integration, capital and
export intensity. Comparisons of productivity and growth across different categories of firms has been
the topic of a large recent literature, stemming from the findings of Hsieh and Klenow (2009) of high
misallocation (dispersion of marginal revenue products) across firms in China and India compared with
the US. This literature has focused mainly on comparisons of firm size, productivity and growth. Less
is known about comparative assessments of vulnerability to external risk which comprise an additional
dimension of performance, or mechanisms explaining the origin and persistence of small firms with
low productivity. This constitutes the primary motivation of this paper.
   We use firm data from China to assess the relative resilience of clusters with respect to the recent
Covid-19 shock. The shock arrived on the eve of the Chinese New Year in the middle of February 2020,
resulting in a severe lockdown in some parts of the country with high infection rates (Fang et al 2020),
and restrictions on mobility between other parts and with the outside world. The pandemic eased by
early April, resulting in a gradual lifting of the mobility restrictions thereafter. While the Covid-19
infection rates may have directly impacted some entrepreneurs and workers who fell ill, the mobility
restrictions imposed on the rest of the population and on the movement of goods were of potentially
greater significance. Chinese firms rely to a considerable extent on entrepreneurs and workers who
have migrated from their hometowns to the place where the firm is located. Many of them had gone

                                                    2
back to their hometowns for the New Year celebrations and were unable to return to their place of work
until the lockdown restrictions were eased. Moreover, the movement of inputs supplies and goods to
the market was impeded, as well as the volume of imports and exports, resulting in significant supply
and demand shocks faced by firms. As we show in the paper, in the latter half of February there was a
sharp (approximately 70%) reduction in entry flows of new firms compared to entry rates at the same
time in previous years, and an effect of the same order of magnitude on the number of incumbent firms
reopening after the New Year.
   Our primary empirical finding is that the Covid-19 impact was significantly lower in counties/industries
exhibiting a higher degree of clustering, after controlling for industry and time (month and year) dum-
mies, as well as county dummies in the case of new entry rates. Cluster measures change very little
over time, hence the results are robust to cluster measures based on firm censuses in 2008, 2004 and
1995. Counties with an above median cluster index featured a 67% reduction in entry rate during the
month immediately following the Chinese New Year compared to previous years, compared to a 74%
reduction in counties with below median cluster index. A one s.d. increase in the cluster index was
associated with a 12% rise in the entry rate. These results are robust to alternative specifications (at
the weekly rather than monthly level) and controls for local infection rates. The results concerning
impacts on new entry also appear on functioning of incumbent firms: a 1% rise in the cluster index
was associated with a .05-.07% higher likelihood of reopening in February after the New Year, and a
.03-.04% higher likelihood in May, after controlling for local infection rates and industry dummies.
We find evidence of a direct adverse impact of Covid-19 infections: higher local infection rates were
associated with lower entry rates and reopening likelihood among incumbents. But despite the higher
infection rates in counties with higher clustering, they were less adversely impacted overall.
   The remainder of the paper seeks to disentangle the role of different attributes of clusters in affect-
ing resilience. In particular we test hypotheses suggested by findings of Dai et al (2020b) concerning
the role of entrepreneur hometown networks in the emergence and functioning of production clus-
ters. Broadly speaking, their theory is based on the notion that poorly functioning markets for credit
and technology and weak institutions for formal contract enforcement in LDCs inhibit private en-
trepreneurship. These barriers are overcome partly by informal cooperation among social networks of
entrepreneurs. In the Chinese context the networks are based on a common birthplace or hometown.

                                                   3
Those who have become entrepreneurs in a particular industry and location help provide informa-
tion and assistance to others in their hometown to enable them to enter the same sector and location.
Entrepreneurs functioning in a given sector-location from the same hometown share credit, risks, in-
frastructure, technology, supplier and customer lists based on informal agreements. Owing to credit
market imperfections, they enter with firms of small size in a common location, specialize in different
stages of production of a particular end-product, and engage in intensive buyer-seller relationships.
Firms at a given stage of production share customer orders and fixed capital overheads flexibly. Such
forms of mutual assistance raise productivity and lower costs of capital of network member firms.
Entry barriers are lowered, thereby attracting greater inflows of entrepreneurs from the hometown.
Higher density networks tend to concentrate more in specific industries and locations, owing to the
greater lock-in induced by stronger spillovers. The network spillovers also induce a form of adverse
selection of entrepreneurial quality, manifested by greater dispersion (and possibly lower average) of
quality, productivity and size of entering firms.1
       Dai et al (2020b) confirm these predictions empirically in the SAIC firm registration data over 1990-
2009, using 1982 population density of the hometown as a proxy for network quality. They justify use
of this proxy measure by showing that for rural counties, informal trust, social interactions, and patterns
of cross-participation of entrepreneurs in each others firms, are all rising in local population density
(after controlling for population size, education and occupational patterns). Moreover, population
density changes little over time: the 1982 density is highly correlated with density in later decades.
Since significant restrictions on movement of people were still in place in 1982 when the market based
economy was just beginning to emerge, the 1982 population density can be reasonably treated as a
predetermined parameter for any given hometown.
       Section 2 extends the Dai et al (2020b) model to incorporate the effect of an unanticipated Covid-
19 shock which raises factor costs owing to factor shortages arising from mobility restrictions and
   1
     This may not be obvious at first glance; see their paper or Section 2 here for more details. While the entry threshold
for entrepreneurial quality would be lower in a higher quality network, this would be compensated by a higher productivity
spillover from other firms in the network. However, the net effect would be negative, since the marginal entrepreneur in
the network must be indifferent between entering and not, and the outside option would be lower owing to the lower entry
threshold. Hence the net effect on the marginal entrepreneur’s productivity would be negative. Dai et al (2020b) show
that with a log uniform distribution over entrepreneurial quality in the population, the average productivity of incumbents
would also be lower in a higher quality network. This is what they actually find in the data, using observed firm size as a
proxy for productivity.

infections. We assume that the severity of the factor shortages is lower in a high density network owing
to superior supply reliability and sharing of capital and risks. There are two principal predictions. First,
entry flows in higher density networks will be less adversely affected. On the other hand, it is possible
that a larger fraction of incumbent firms in a higher density network shutdown following the Covid-
19 shock. This owes to the adverse selection effect: productivity is more widely dispersed among
incumbents in a higher density network, with a larger lower tail that is more vulnerable to a sudden
rise in factor prices.
    These predictions turn out to be upheld by the data. We first verify that clusters are positively
correlated with hometown density. We then show evidence that counties with higher hometown density
experienced associated a smaller Covid-19 impact on rates of registration of new firms. On the other
hand, they also experienced a lower likelihood of reopening among incumbents. These results are
robust to controls for clustering, hometown heterogeneity and local infection rates.
    However, higher hometown density alone cannot explain the observed differences between the
high and low cluster areas. Neither can variations in the Covid-19 infection rates: areas with a higher
degree of clustering featured higher infection rates, lowering both entry and the reopening likelihood
of incumbents. Using the ESIEC survey data, we subsequently examine the role of other firm attributes
associated with clusters. Controlling for hometown density and heterogeneity, greater spatial proximity
to suppliers and buyers (including online sales) was associated with a higher re-opening rate among
incumbents. Overall, the results therefore suggest that both network quality and spatial agglomeration
played some part in explaining the superior resilience of clusters.
    Section 2 presents the theoretical model. Section 3 then provides details of the data, the cluster
index, firm attributes correlated with clustering, and measures of entrepreneur network quality, along
with relevant descriptive statistics. Section 4 presents the main result concerning resilience of areas
with greater clustering. Section 5 then examines the role of different attributes of clusters: quality of
entrepreneur hometown networks, spatial agglomeration and other related firm characteristics. Section
6 describes how the results varied across four main industry groups, while Section 7 concludes. The
Data Appendix provides details of variables used in the analysis.

2        Theory: Network Density and Covid-19 Impact
We use the same notation and assumptions as Section 3 in Dai et al (2020b). Consider a hometown
with population density p which is a proxy for the level of trust and informal cooperation among its
residents. There are different cohorts of new agents t = 1, 2, .. of equal size, in each of which latent
entrepreneurial talent ω is drawn independently from a log-uniform distribution on the unit interval.
Each agent makes a once-and-for-all occupational decision on whether to select a traditional occupation
and earn ω σ for ever, where σ ∈ (0, 1). A fixed fraction k ∈ (0, 1) receive an opportunity to join a
network of older incumbents from the same hometown who are operating in some destination. A
fraction si,t−1 of incumbent entrepreneurs from this town are distributed across different destinations i
(sector-location pairs), cumulating upto cohort t − 1. si,t−1 also represents the fraction of destination i
offers arriving among the new cohort t agents, reflecting a social process of contacts and formation of
aspirations via mutual association.
        A cohort t agent receiving an entrepreneurship offer decides once and for all whether to accept it.
Entry decisions are made myopically, comparing prospective profits from the two occupational options
at date t.2 Consequent on entering the entrepreneur selects a scale K ≥ 0 of operation, where factor
needs are proportional to K and the factor price (in a pre-Covid year) is r which does not change with
t. The production function equals Aω 1−α K α , where A denotes the ‘community-TFP’ given by of the
entrepreneur depends both on the entrepreneur’s own talent ω and on the size ni,t−1 and quality θ(p) of
the incumbent network at destination i, according to

                                          Ait = A0 exp(θ(p)ni,t−1 )                                          (1)

where θ(p) denotes (exogenous) network quality, and ni,t−1 (endogenous) size of the incumbent net-
work at destination i. A micro-foundation for the community TFP specification is provided in Dai
et al (2020b), in terms of provision of mutual help among incumbents based on informal cooperation.
Network quality θ is rising in density p, which helps sustain higher levels of help within the community.
        Consequent on entering, a date t cohort agent of quality ω would select scale K to maximize profits
    2
   The model becomes more complicated if agents are more far-sighted, but the results continue to extend. See the
Appendix in Dai et al (2020b).

(where ψ ≡ φα − φ).
   The agent with an option to enter accepts it if (3) exceeds the earnings ω σ in the traditional occu-
pation. These agents will be endowed with a level of ability that exceeds a threshold ω it satisfying:

                                       1      1  1             α
                         log ω it ≡       [log −    log Ait +     log r]                                   (4)

The threshold is assumed to lie in the interior of the support of the ability distribution at the beginning
of the process for each destination, and attention is restricted to ‘early phases of industrialization’ when
this continues to be true in later cohorts.
   This defines the dynamics of entry and firm size of entrants, thereby determining the evolution of
the network at different destinations across successive cohorts. Entry flows are given by

                                       eit = ksi,t−1 [B + Cθ(p)ni,t−1 ]                                    (5)

                                      log r + (1−σ)(1−α) log A0 and C ≡           1
                                                                              (1−σ)(1−α)
                                                                                         .   Dai et al (2020b)
show that entry and sectoral concentration (measured by the Herfindahl index) are rising over time.
Moreover, both levels and changes of entry and concentration are rising in network density p when
there are two destinations. Hence community TFP and network size are increasing in p. Entering firm
size and quality of the marginal entrant is decreasing in community TFP, because a higher community
TFP implies higher profits consequent upon entry by any given entrepreneur, and the marginal entrant
must be indifferent between entering and going to his alternative occupation. Hence the net profit of
the marginal entrant must be lower, implying that the marginal entrant must have lower TFP overall.
This represents a form of adverse selection: the lower individual quality of the marginal entrant must
                                                                             1
outweigh the higher community TFP of a higher quality network. If σ >        2
                                                                                 it turns out that the average
entrant also enters with a lower productivity, firm size and profit.

                                                      7
   Fix a particular destination i, and drop the notation for i in what follows. Also abstract from the
sectoral distribution and set the sector shares to unity. Now suppose in the year T = 2020, there is a
sudden unanticipated rise in the factor price r at this destination to r(1 + ∆)ξ(p), where ∆ represents
the size of the Covid-19 shock, and ξ(p) represents its relative intensity for an incumbent network of
density p. Here (1 + ∆)ξ(0) > 1 ensuring that factor prices have increased for every network. Higher
quality networks manage to buffer the shock through mutual help and sharing of capital and risks, so
assume that the intensity ξ is decreasing in p. Using (5), entry flows in year T then fall relative to the
counterfactual of no Covid-19 shock, by

                                           α
                                k                   [log(1 + ∆) + log ξ(p)]                           (6)
                                     (1 − α)(1 − σ)

which is decreasing in p. This is the first, obvious prediction of the model: higher density networks
will experience a smaller contraction in flow of new firms entering.
   Turn now to how incumbent firms are affected. The rise in factor price will reduce operating profits,
and some of the less productive entrepreneurs may not be able to break even so they will not reopen.
We investigate how the shut-down probability will vary with network density p. In general this is
ambiguous, but in the following Proposition we give a sufficient condition for it to be increasing in p
between any two values.

P ROPOSITION 1 Consider incumbents belonging to cohort t < T that have already entered. If nt0 (p)
denotes the total size of the incumbent network that has entered by date t0 , i.e., cumulating across all
cohorts prior to t0 , suppose that

a condition which will hold as long as t is not too distant from T . Suppose also that ξ(p) = exp(−ηp)
where η > 0. Take any two networks with densities pL , pH respectively where pL < pH . Then there
exists η sufficiently small and a range of shock intensities ∆ for which a larger fraction of cohort t
incumbents in network with density pH will shut down in year T following the Covid shock.

which is increasing in p and positive if and only if the entrepreneur’s ability exceeds the threshold
ωB (p, ∆) given by

                                              α
                       log ωB (p, ∆) =           [log(1 + ∆) + log ξ(p)] − θ(p)nT (p) − ĉ                              (9)

where ĉ ≡    1−α
                    log A0 − 1−α log r + log ψ. Clearly in the absence of any shock (∆ = 0) all incumbents
will make positive profits, because the network size and hence community TFP has grown since they
entered. Therefore with ∆ = 0, the breakeven threshold ωB (p, 0) for any network density p is below
the entry threshold ω t (p). But for ∆ large enough this inequality will be reversed and some low ability
incumbents will shut down.
       Now observe that the range of operating profits across cohort t incumbents will correspond to (8)
over a range of ability exceeding the threshold ω t (p) given by (3). So the minimum operating profit
for incumbents of this cohort at date T is Πt (p; ∆) given by (8) evaluated at the entry threshold ω t (p),
which equals

operating profit (10) among cohort t incumbents is decreasing in p.
                                                                               ∂[θ(p){nt (p)−(1−α)(1−σ)nT (p)]
       Given pL < pH observe that (7) implies that Q ≡ inf p∈(pL ,pH )                        ∂p
                                                                                                                 is strictly
                        1
positive. Then η < Q α(1−σ) implies that log ωB (pL ; 0) − log ωB (pH ; 0) is smaller than log ω t (pL ) −
log ω t (pH ). Hence there exist a range of values of ∆ for which log ω t (pH ) < log ωB (pH ; ∆) <
log ωB (pL ; ∆) < log ω t (pL ), i.e., where a positive fraction of the incumbents in network pH will
shut down, but none among the incumbents in network pL would shut down.
       Condition (7) ensures the adverse selection effect persists beyond the entry date t until the date T
when the shock hits.3 Then the lower bound of operating profits in the high density network is smaller,
   3
    This condition holds if T = t. However with t < T , the size of the higher density network grows faster, so it may not
continue to hold at later dates if T is sufficiently distant from t.

                                                              9
implying that it has a longer lower tail. The fraction of incumbents shutting down would be higher in
the more dense network if the shock is of a magnitude that threatens only the excess lower tail. Propo-
sition 1 shows that for any pair of densities, there exist parameter values for which a higher fraction
of high density network incumbents would shut down. In general, the comparison is ambiguous: ex-
amples can be constructed where the opposite result obtains. For instance, for sufficiently high shock,
all incumbents in the low density network shut down, while a positive fraction of those in the high
density network (the extreme upper tail) continues to operate. This is again a consequence of the wider
dispersion of productivity in the higher density network.


3     Cluster Index, Data and Descriptive Statistics
3.1    Cluster Index

Standard measures of industrial clusters in the IO and urban economics literatures are based on indices
of regional specialization in specific industries, such as concentration ratio, relative concentration or
spatial Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI) of firms located in any given region across different indus-
tries. Examples are the Krugman index or the Ellison-Glaeser index. However, as argued by Ruan and
Zhang (2015), these indices do not adequately measure presence of clusters in LDCs. This owes to
the distinctive features of clusters in LDCs compared to DCs, involving co-existence of firms in many
different but related industries, resulting from a high degree of vertical disintegration. Consequently
LDC clusters frequently include firms in different upstream and downstream industries connected via
trade links, or firms producing diverse products but sharing common inputs. The diversity of industries
within the cluster is then reflected in a low measure of regional specialization.
    The Puyuan cashmere sweater cluster in Tongxiang county provides a ready illustration. It con-
tains seven different 3-digit industries with an employment share exceeding 1% for the entire country,
each of which corresponds to different stages of sweater production (with the 3-digit industry code
in parentheses): (1) silk spinning/printing/dyeing (174); (2) wool spinning/printing/dyeing (172); (3)
manufacturing of knitted fabrics (176); (4) leather tanning/processing (191); (5) fur tanning/processing
(193); (6) synthetic fiber manufacturing (282); (7) financial information services (694)). In a more ver-
tically integrated firm, these different stages would have been represented by different divisions within


                                                   10
the firm, resulting in a greater measure of specialization (i.e. classification as a single industry rather
than seven different ones).
   To deal with this problem, Ruan and Zhang (2015) develop a cluster index better suited to LDC
context, based on a measure of inter-industry proximity or ‘related industries’, based on similarity
of ‘revealed comparative advantage’ (RCA). The measure of proximity of industries i, j (based on
employment Eri , Erj across regions r) is given by

                    φeij = min{P (LQeri > 1|LQerj > 1), P (LQerj > 1|LQeri > 1)}

                                                            Erj /Er
where P denotes conditional probability and LQerj ≡          Ej /E
                                                                    .   Say that region r exhibits RCA in
industry j if the employment share of the industry j in region r exceeds that for the country as a whole.
The proximity measure between industries i, j corresponds to the fraction of regions in the country that
exhibit RCA in both industries — i.e., the extent to which the two industries tend to co-locate in the
same regions.
   Given this proximity measure, the region r cluster index (employment-based) φer is defined as
the weighted average of φeij , using employment weights [Erj /Er−i ] ∗ [Eri /Ei ]. It represents the ex-
tent to which the region involves co-location of proximate industries. Using alternative output or
capital weights in the averaging procedure provides an alternative measure of clustering. The overall
Ruan-Zhang (RZ) cluster index takes the average across employment, output, and capital based cluster
indices.
   Ruan and Zhang (2015) calculate the RZ index for China using a SIC3 classification of industries
at the county level, and firm data from the 1995 China Industrial Census, and the 2004, 2008 China
Economic Censuses. It successfully predicts 53 out of top 100 clusters identified by Chinese industry
and government experts, compared with maximum of 3 predicted by various regional specialization
indices such as CR3, Gini, HHI, Krugman or Ellison-Glaeser indices. The latter measures predict the
extent of clustering to be the highest in regions with fewer firms and fewer industries located inland. In
contrast the RZ cluster measure is the highest along the South-East China coast (Guangdong, Shanghai,
Zhejian, Jiangsu provinces) which accords with common wisdom. This is shown in Figure 1 which
provides variations in the RZ cluster index across different regions of China. Hence this measure seems
more appropriate in the Chinese context than the conventional measures of regional specialization, and

                                                    11
we shall use it for the rest of this paper.
    Figure 2 shows that the cluster index and its relative magnitude across counties changes relatively
little over time. It plots the log cluster index in 2004 and 2008 on the vertical axes, against values of the
same index in 1995. Both are highly positively correlated with the 1995 index, with a slight tendency
for clustering to rise over time. Hence it is reasonable to treat the extent of clustering as pre-determined
by pre-1995 entry patterns, alleviating concerns about possible reverse causality.

3.2    Data and Descriptive Statistics

The first data set we employ is the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC) database
that covers the universe of registered firms in China. This provides details of each firm registered,
its location, capital, industry classification and principal business personnel such as shareholders and
top managers (with identifiers for their birthplace). We use this to measure the flow of new firm
registrations at the monthly level in each county-industry pair for the period between 2017 and June
2020. The data also permits us to identify the birth county of the principal representative of each firm,
which we use to measure the quality of hometown entrepreneur networks, as explained further below.
    There were approximately 21 million registered firms in 2018 in China. Since we will be using
the SAIC data to estimate entry flows at a disaggregated (county-industry) level, we group firms into
four main industries: Agriculture, Manufacturing, Business Services and Residential Services. Figures
3 and 4 respectively show the number of registered firms and employment (units of thousand) in the
four industry groups. It is evident that the service sector accounts for the largest share of firms and
employment, followed by manufacturing.
    To examine effects on operation of incumbent firms, we use a second data set: the Enterprise Sur-
vey for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in China (ESIEC) led by Peking University. Starting in 2017,
the ESIEC survey originally covered 16 counties in Henan Province, and expanded to 117 counties in
six provinces in 2018. Although the sample is only representative at the provincial level, the industrial
distribution of our 2017-2019 sample largely resembles the national distribution at the SIC-1 industry
level. The surveys in 2017-2019 includes questions on total asset, employment, besides a large range
of firm attributes. Figure 5 compares different attributes between counties with high (above median)
and low (below median) cluster index. The attributes are the proportion of firms in the county whose

                                                     12
primary supplier is located in the same country (MLocalSup), whose primary customer is located in
the same county (MLocalCon), who have stable suppliers (StableSup), have stable clients (StableCon),
who sell on credit to their largest client (MSellCredit), have undertaken a process innovation (New-
Process), and have positive online sales (Online). Moreover, we show inventory as a proportion of
working capital (Stock), and percentage of employees who are local residents (LocalEmpRa). It is
evident that high cluster regions have a significantly larger proportion of firms with local suppliers and
clients, have stable customers, have online sales, sell on credit, and have undertaken process innova-
tions. They carry smaller inventories and rely less on local workers. Table 1 provides a firm level
regression of these various attributes on the log of the cluster index (in the county of location), control-
ling for industry dummies. We see clusters are associated with significantly greater spatial proximity
to suppliers and customers, have more stable demand, more likely to sell on credit, to have online
customers, process innovations, and more reliant on non-local workers.
   After the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the ESIEC project alliance (comprising Peking Uni-
versity, Central University of Finance and Economics, Harbin Institute of Technology at Shenzhen,
Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, and Shanghai University of International Business and
Economics) conducted rapid phone surveys with previously interviewed entrepreneurs in the months
of February and May. The completion rate was about 50% for those with valid contact information.
The firm size distribution from the phone surveys match closely with the national firm size distribution
based on the China Economic Census 2018 (Dai et al, 2020a). The phone surveys in February and May
2020 included a question on whether the firm had re-opened since the New Year, and various aspects of
its operations. We use these two rounds of phone surveys to assess the likelihood of reopening, besides
various details of their operations such as problems with suppliers, customers, and labor shortages.
   Figure 6 displays the average proportion of firms that re-opened after the New Year in February and
May respectively, across different industry groups. The manufacturing and residential service sectors
were particularly hard-hit, with less than 20% of firms that succeeded in re-opening in February, while
the other sectors had a re-opening rate of 27-28%. By May between 77-85% of firms had re-opened,
with little variation across sectors. Part of the reason that firms were adversely affected was the rate
of Covid infections in the local area. Figure 7 shows a scatterplot of the log of the cluster index in the
county against the infection rate in the prefecture. It is evident that areas with a higher cluster index

                                                    13
experienced a higher infection rate. Figure 8 shows that the local infection rate was also positively
correlated with the (average) infection rate in entrepreneur hometowns. Despite experiencing higher
covid infection rates, we shall see below that higher cluster regions experienced a lower contraction in
new firm registrations and reopening rates.

3.3   Hometown network quality measures

As explained in the Introduction, Dai et al (2020b) show population density of entrepreneur home
counties is a suitable proxy of of their social connectedness. However, they found that this was only
true for rural county birthplaces; urban birthplaces feature higher population densities and markedly
lower levels of trust and cooperation owing to greater social heterogeneity. Hence for urban county
birthplaces we replace the true population density with zero, and then construct the weighted average
of population density of birth counties of listed entrepreneurs. We use the 1982 Census to construct
population density, so that the measure is pre-determined and not subject to any reverse causality.
   This variable alone cannot serve as a suitable measure of relevant social connectedness of en-
trepreneurs operating in any given county, since a large fraction of entrepreneurs in China (approx-
imately 60%) from rural counties set up their enterprises outside their birth county. Hence the area
where the enterprise is located (the destination) is frequently different from the birth county (the en-
trepreneurs origin). If at a given destination the entrepreneurs come from many different origins, their
connectedness would be considerably lower than if they all came from the same origin. Therefore we
need to supplement average home county density with a measure of homogeneity or spatial concentra-
tion of their origins. We measure the latter by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) of concentration
across different birth home counties, excluding the destination county.
   If the story in Dai et al (2020b) is correct in explaining the origins of the clusters, we would expect
counties with a higher cluster index to be associated with a higher average hometown density and a
higher hometown concentration, since either of the latter two attributes would increase network-based
entry of firms from the respective hometowns thereby raising the number of cluster firms. Figures 9
and 10 bear out this prediction. This suggests that average hometown density alone is a good measure
of network quality, and corrections for dispersion are unlikely to be important. Nevertheless in the
regressions below we shall include controls for hometown concentration when we use average density

                                                   14
as a measure of network quality.


4       Empirical Results: Covid-Resilience and Clusters
We use monthly firm registration data at the county-industry level from 2015 to 2020. Similar results
obtain when we analyze the weekly data, but these results are less reliable owing to greater frequencies
of zeroes in the data. The sample excludes a few provinces (Xinjiang, Qinghai, Tibet, and Inner
Mongolia), which have large pastural areas, are sparsely populated and register very few firms at the
county level. In addition, our sample does not include Hubei Province, the epicenter of Covid-19
pandemic as it was under complete lockdown and businesses ground to a halt for about two months.
       With log of new per capita firm entries at the county-industry-month-year as the dependent vari-
able, Figure 11 shows estimated regression interaction coefficients (along with 95% confidence bands)
between month dummies and a 2020 year dummy, when the sample is split into a high (above median)
and low (below median) cluster index. The regressions include dummies for month, 2020, county
and industry, thus controlling for common unobserved sector and location characteristics that do not
vary over time. We see a significantly smaller drop in February 2020 compared to February of pre-
vious years for the high cluster counties: entry rates in February 2020 declined by 67% compared to
February in previous years in the high cluster regions, compared to 74% in the other regions.
       Figure 12 and Table 2 present results from a more demanding specification using a continuous
cluster index interacted with month and 2020, controlling for per capita infection rates in the county and
in the entrepreneurs’ hometown, and includes dummies for county-industry-month, county-industry-
year and month-year (i : county, j : industry, t : year, m : month, i0 (i) : prefecture that i belongs
to):

where P erf irm denotes the log of (per capita entry of new firms +0.001), D denotes dummy, LnClusteri
denotes log of the cluster index in county i, I denotes covid infection rate, and BI denotes infection
rate in the birthplace of the entrepreneurs in the county-industry pair (averaged using hometown shares
as weights). Interaction coefficients between deviations of each month of 2020 from New Year’s Eve

                                                    15
and LnCluster are plotted in Figure 12, along with 95% confidence intervals. We see a significant
positive coefficient of the cluster index in the month immediately following New Year. Moreover,
Table 2 shows a significant negative impact of the local infection rate.
    Next we turn to the ESIEC entrepreneur phone survey data and examine covid impacts on the
performance of incumbent firms in the February and May 2020 rounds, and how it varied with the
cluster index. Table 3 shows regression coefficients of LnCluster on a firm dummy for reopening
in February and May respectively, controlling for an offseason dummy and industry dummies (both
the 4-sector classification as well as SIC1 classification). We see a significant LnCluster coefficient
ranging between 3-3.5 % in February. Controlling for the local infection rate, this rises to 4.6-5.3%,
which implies a 4-4.5% greater likelihood in counties with a 1 s.d. higher cluster index. The direct
impact of the infection rate is again negative and significant. Similar to the case of the entry data,
the superior resilience of clusters obtains irrespective of whether or not we control for the infecton
rate. In May we continue to see a significant higher likelihood of over 2.5% of being open with 1 s.d.
higher cluster index.4 Hence differences between high and low cluster regions persisted even after four
months, despite the substantial easing of the pandemic and related restrictions.
    In summary, both entry of new firms and incumbent performance were less adversely affected in
counties with higher clustering.


5     Disentangling Role of Different Attributes of Clusters
5.1     Hometown Network Density

We have already seen that counties with high clustering also featured higher quality (population den-
sity) entrepreneur hometown networks. To what extent could this explain their lower vulnerability to
the covid shock?
    We first add interactions of month and 2020 with average (log) population density of entrepreneur
hometowns and with (log) HHI of hometowns to regression (11) for new firm entries. The resulting
interaction coefficients are shown in Figure 13. The interaction coefficients of hometown concentra-
tion are not significant. Table 4 shows the estimated regression coefficients for infection rates, and
    4
      For the reopening rate in May, we do not control for the infection rate since the pandemic had eased substantially by
that time.


                                                           16
interactions with months following New Year’s Eve of logs of hometown density and the cluster index.
Higher population density has a significant, positive interaction coefficient one month after New Year’s
Eve, while that of the cluster index also remains positive and significant (though somewhat attenuated
compared to Figure 12 when we did not control for hometown density and concentration). The coef-
ficients of density and cluster happen to have almost the same magnitude and significance. The s.d.
of hometown density is 0.69 compared to 0.88 for the cluster index.Therefore we see that reliance on
higher quality hometown networks helps explain some of the benefits of clustering, but not entirely.
       Even after controlling for entrepreneurial network quality, a 1 s.d. increase in the cluster index was
associated with a 12% higher entry rate between Feb 10 and March 6, 2020, significant at the 1% level.
In the preceding five months and subsequent three months the estimated interactions are statistically
indistinguishable from zero.5 The regression coefficient of the county infection rate continued to be
negative and significant, while that of the hometown infection rate was insignificant — indicating a
strong adverse direct impact of the covid shock.
       Table 5 shows the corresponding results for the reopening likelihood of surveyed firms in February
and May 2020, when we add hometown density and concentration (in logs) to the regression reported
in Table 3. Consistent with the case depicted in Proposition 1, we find a significant negative effect of
higher density in both February and May (though for the former this happens when the cluster index
is also included in the regression). The network-based adverse selection effect therefore provides a
possible explanation of this result. The effect of hometown concentration is throughout insignificant.
       These results also imply that the effect of clustering is even larger when we control for hometown
network quality (i.e., compared to Table 2). Therefore as in the case of the entry results, the benign
effects of clustering on vulnerability to the covid shock survive even despite controlling for the network
effects. In other words, superior network quality alone cannot account for the greater buffering capacity
of clusters. This calls for an exploration of other benefits of clustering.
   5
    Four months prior to New Years Eve, however, we see effects of cluster and network concentration were significant,
while that of density was negative and significant. This corresponded to October 2019, with a large countrywide weekly
holiday.




                                                         17
5.2    The Role of Other Attributes of Clustering

As shown in Table 1, areas with higher clustering are located closer to their suppliers and customers,
are more likely to sell online and on credit, and have more stable customers. They also rely less on
local workers. The closer proximity to suppliers and customers could have helped clusters buffer the
covid shock which imposed severe limits on the movement of goods (input supplies, movement of
sold goods outside the local area) and people (e.g., customers who visited personally). On the other
hand, their greater reliance on migrant workers would have rendered them more vulnerable, as workers
would have gone home during the New Year and may not have been able to return owing to lockdown
restrictions or necessary quarantine procedures.
    Tables 6 and 7 show how the regression results in Table 5 are modified when we replace the cluster
index with related firm attributes, for the February and May reopening likelihoods respectively. We
continue to control for hometown network quality. Firms with more stable suppliers and customers
were more likely to reopen. The same is true for firms with local suppliers and customers, and for
those selling online (significant in May). Firms relying more on local workers were less likely to remain
open, which is somewhat surprising in view of the mobility restrictions associated with the pandemic.
It is possible that higher productivity firms tend to rely more on migrant workers, so this result may
be driven by endogenous selection (particularly in May after the lockdown restrictions had eased).
In summary, greater spatial (both physical and online) proximity to suppliers and customers partly
accounted for the superior resilience of clusters, besides their reliance on higher quality entrepreneur
networks.


6     Variation Across Industry Groups
How did the preceding results vary across sectors? We re-run the analysis for each of the four industry
groups separately. Table 8 shows the regression coefficients on network density and cluster index on
entry rates for each month following January 2020. Neither matters much in agriculture. The benign
effects of network density appear in the two service sectors, while those of clustering appear to be
largest in manufacturing, but also significant (though the magnitude of the coefficient is nearly half
of that of higher network density). This is roughly consistent with the notion that benefits of spatial


                                                   18
proximity are greatest in manufacturing which involves movement of bulky goods. Tables 9 and 10
show how effects of clustering and network quality on reopening rates varied across industry groups.
They are consistent with the results on entry: network density mattered only in the service sector, while
spatial proximity mattered in both manufacturing and services.


7    Concluding Comments
In summary, we find that counties with greater presence of clustering were less adversely affected by
the covid shock in terms of both entry of new firms and performance of incumbents. Part of the ex-
planation of the entry result could be provided by higher entrepreneur network density of such areas
in which incumbents shared risks better with one another and provided greater assistance to new en-
trants from the same hometown in overcoming entry barriers. But superior network quality also tends
to co-exist with lower productivity on average owing to the adverse selection it induces by lowering
entry thresholds, which lowered incumbent performance. Hence the superior ability of incumbents in
clusters to adapt to the covid shock arose despite, rather than because of, superior network quality. The
entrepreneur survey results suggest the role of closer proximity to suppliers and customers in stabiliz-
ing supply chains, reducing vulnerability to transport bottlenecks and market demand fluctuations.
    Our measure of network density was based on 1982 Population Census data on population density,
while the results are robust to using cluster measures based on 2004 Economic Census, rather than the
2008 data. Hence they are unlikely to be susceptible to problems of reverse causality. Our entry results
are robust to industry dummies as well as the use of time-varying county dummies, thereby controlling
for local infrastructure and governance; there are no discernible pre-trend differences between high
and low cluster regions. These reduce concerns of omitted variable bias, thereby suggesting the results
can be given a causal interpretation.
    The results of the paper are useful in two different ways. First, it provides evidence of and insight
into possible reasons for the superior capacity of production clusters to withstand external shocks
in a volatile environment with underdeveloped formal markets and institutions — resulting from a
combination of informal network-based cooperation, risk-sharing and spatial proximity among buyers
and sellers. These risk-coping advantages may account for their survival and growth, despite lower


                                                   19
productivity (on average) compared to other forms of industrial organization based on high vertical
integration, capital intensity and spatial separation from suppliers and buyers. Second, it can help
predict relative vulnerabilty of different regions or industries to possible recurrence of shocks that
impair the movement of goods and people, thus providing a useful tool for direction of assistance by
governments or international aid agencies.
