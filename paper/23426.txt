We examine the spillover effects of recreational marijuana legalization (RML) in Colorado and
Washington on neighboring states. We find that RML causes a sharp increase in marijuana
possession arrests in border counties of neighboring states relative to non-border counties in these
states. RML has no impact on juvenile marijuana possession arrests but is rather fully
concentrated among adults. Using separate data on self-reported marijuana use, we show this is
accompanied by an increase in use in neighboring states relative to non-neighboring states. We do
not find conclusive evidence that marijuana sale/manufacture arrests, DUI arrests, or opium/
cocaine possession arrests in border states are affected by RML.

        Since 2012, eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized personal recreational

marijuana use. 1 One often-cited justification for recreational marijuana legalization (RML) in

these states concerns its expected positive fiscal impacts. 2 For example, the state of Washington

collected $186 million in tax revenue from legal sales of recreational marijuana in fiscal year 2016,

just its second year with legal sales. 3 Other potential impacts include savings to law enforcement

and the criminal justice system from no longer investigating and prosecuting certain marijuana-

related crimes (Miron, 2010).

        Though the fiscal impacts of marijuana legalization may be positive in states that pass RML,

the effect on surrounding states is more likely to be detrimental. The nature of these laws is that

marijuana can be purchased and possessed legally in RML states by those of majority age (21 and

older) regardless of state of residency. 4 This could lead to an increase in marijuana possession and

related crimes in areas that neighbor RML states, which would likely contribute to higher burdens

on law enforcement and the criminal justice system in those places. In line with this reasoning, in

2014, Nebraska and Oklahoma launched a federal lawsuit against Colorado, arguing that

Colorado’s RML has led to an increase in marijuana-related law enforcement costs and other social

costs in their states. While the suit was denied by the Supreme Court, the question of how one

state’s recreational marijuana legalization affects neighboring states’ outcomes has not been

examined. 5 This is the focus of our paper.

        Intuitively, for customers living in neighboring non-RML states, the legal cost of acquiring

marijuana is reduced after RML because although possessing marijuana is still illegal in their home

states, one is now free from penalty for the acts of buying and possessing marijuana across the

border. In addition to this, RML most likely reduces the pecuniary cost of marijuana. Anderson,

Hansen, and Rees (2013) find that medical marijuana legalization (MML) is associated with sharp

decreases in the price of marijuana. Similarly, the average retail price of marijuana in Washington

has dropped substantially since the beginning of legalized retail in the state (July 2014) as shown

in Table 1. Though an individual can certainly consume the marijuana in the RML state, legal

restrictions on where this can occur, as well as simple matters of convenience, may increase

individuals’ propensity to smuggle marijuana back to their home (non-RML) state. 6 We expect

this to occur most especially for individuals living near the border of RML states, since for these

individuals the reduction of the legal and pecuniary costs of buying and possessing marijuana is

    In Washington state, it is illegal to consume “in view of the general public” (Initiative 502), and in Colorado, a
person may not consume “openly and publicly or in a manner that endangers others” (Article XVIII, Colorado
Constitution).

most likely to be larger than the travel cost associated with crossing the border to purchase

marijuana.

     In addition to affecting marijuana possession in neighboring areas, RML may indirectly affect

other types of crimes in those areas. For example, the manufacture and sale of marijuana in

counties that border RML states may become less attractive after RML because customers can

purchase it legally—possibly at a lower price—across the border. This is ambiguous, however,

since sellers also have the opportunity to cross the border and purchase marijuana legally (and then

return to sell it in the non-RML state). Driving under the influence (DUI) could also theoretically

increase or decrease. On the one hand, if marijuana and alcohol are substitutes (as some papers,

such as Anderson, Hansen, and Rees, 2013, have suggested), RML may decrease the frequency of

DUI in bordering areas. On the other, if individuals are more likely to drive under the influence of

marijuana or other drugs, DUI may increase, especially if there is more driving across the border

following RML. Similar reasoning render the relationship between RML and other drug possession

arrests theoretically ambiguous.

     We adopt a difference-in-differences (DID) framework to examine whether RML leads to

changes in various marijuana-related arrests in border counties of adjacent states relative to non-

border counties in the same states. We use the 2009-14 Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), a nation-

wide arrest record database, to examine marijuana possession arrests, marijuana sale and

manufacture arrests, DUI arrests, and opium/cocaine possession arrests. Because of the recentness

of recreational marijuana legalization in the U.S., we focus on the first two states that passed RML

laws, Colorado and Washington (both in 2012). We first examine how RML in Colorado has

affected counties in 6 neighboring (border) states: Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Oklahoma,

Kansas and Nebraska (these six states are collectively defined as the “Colorado region” in this



                                                 4
paper). Next, we examine how RML in Washington has affected counties in the border states of

Idaho and Oregon (collectively defined as the “Washington region”).

     We find that RML causes a sharp increase in marijuana possession arrests of border counties

relative to non-border counties in both the Colorado and Washington regions. If a county shares a

physical border with an RML state, it experiences an average increase in marijuana possession

arrests of roughly 30% following RML implementation (relative to non-border counties in the

same region). In subgroup analyses, we show that RML has no impact on juvenile marijuana

possession arrests, consistent with previous findings that MML does not lead to increased

marijuana consumption among teenagers (Anderson, Hansen, and Rees, 2015). We do not find

conclusive evidence that marijuana sale/manufacture arrests, DUI arrests, or opium/cocaine

possession arrests of border counties are affected on net by RML.

     Other studies have found that drug arrests are generally good indicators of drug use

(Rosenfeld and Decker, 1999; Moffatt, Wan, and Weatherburn, 2012; Chu, 2015). However, we

recognize that any change in arrests may be driven in part by how law enforcement officials

respond to RML in a neighboring state. For example, if police increase efforts toward traffic stops

near the RML state border after the law takes effect, this may partly explain any increase in arrests.

We address this concern in Section 7 in two ways. First, we show that police employment did not

significantly increase in border counties relative to non-border counties following RML.

Nevertheless, it is still possible that existing resources are re-allocated toward enforcement of

marijuana laws. As a result, we also use National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data

to show that self-reported marijuana use in states that border RML states increased after RML

relative to those that do not share borders with RML states. Though this data is only publicly

available at the state (and not county) level, it provides some evidence that increases in marijuana



                                                  5
use and marijuana possession are likely to drive at least part of the increase in arrests. Consistent

with our state-level marijuana use results, Hansen et al. (2017) conclude that a substantial amount

of marijuana sold in Washington was trafficked out of the state before Oregon legalized

recreational marijuana.

     The validity of our DID design is examined using an event study framework, where we allow

the effect of RML to vary for every year in our data. We find no evidence that marijuana possession

arrests were rising in border counties relative to non-border counties prior to the legalization year

(2012), and strong increases in arrests took place in 2013 and 2014 (the latter is the year in which

legal sales began in both Colorado and Washington). In addition to the event study, we include a

robustness check in which we control for proxies for medical marijuana activity in Colorado

(which experienced a large increase in registered medical marijuana patients prior to 2012) and

find that our estimates of the RML effect are largely undisturbed.

     We also address the fact that RML border counties tend to have higher per capita arrests than

non-border counties even before RML in our data. Though our DID design relies on an assumption

concerning trends rather than levels—that the marijuana possession arrest trend in non-border

counties is a good proxy for the trend in RML border counties if RML had not occurred—the

difference in levels between the county types creates concern regarding the validity of this

assumption. Thus, we adopt a synthetic control design using as potential “donors” non-RML

border counties in each region as well as counties from other western states that did not change

their marijuana laws over our sample period. We find that this analysis is also supportive of our

baseline DID estimates.

     Our results raise concerns about the enforcement of marijuana laws in non-RML states that

are neighbors to RML states. Either increased possession of marijuana in these states is giving rise



                                                 6
to more arrests, which places a financial burden on these states (especially in border jurisdictions),

or law enforcement officers are intentionally targeting marijuana possession crimes post-RML (or

some combination of both). Either possibility may mean that attention is diverted away from other

tasks of greater social benefit (Kantor et al., 2017). Thus, even ignoring the public health

consequences of marijuana liberalization, the question of how RML in some states affects non-

RML states deserves more attention, especially given that many U.S. states are likely to legalize

recreational marijuana in the near future while in others there is strong opposition to doing so.

                                               2.   Previous Literature

        Since recreational marijuana legalization is new in the U.S., evidence on the effects of

relaxing marijuana restrictions comes mainly from studies on medical marijuana legalization

(MML) and marijuana decriminalization, which have been occurring in many states over the past

several decades. 7 Studies generally find that MML increases the illegal use of marijuana as well

as marijuana-related arrests and hospital treatments among adults (Model, 1993; Pacula et al., 2010;

Chu, 2014; Kelly and Rasul, 2014; Wen, Hockenberry, and Cummings, 2015). In the context of

MML, allowing marijuana possession for some individuals (those who qualify to use it medicinally)

appears to lead to an increase in illegal use as well.

        Regarding adolescents, previous works suggest that MML does not increase marijuana use

among youths and may even discourage it (Harper, Strumpf, and Kaufman, 2012; Lynne-

Landsman, Livingston, and Wagenaar, 2013; Choo et al., 2014; Anderson, Hansen, and Rees,




7
    One recent exception is Dragone et al. (2017), which looks at the effects of RML in Washington on violent crimes.
They find that rapes and thefts dropped in Washington relative to Oregon after RML took effect.

2015). This may be because the relative risk of selling marijuana to youth (compared to adults)

increases after MML is passed (Anderson and Rees, 2014). 8

        A common theme among many of these studies is that they assume that a change in marijuana

policy in one state or location has no effect on outcomes in other locations, including neighboring

ones. One contribution of our study is to test whether this assumption holds in practice. To the

extent that relaxed marijuana laws in one state affect outcomes in neighboring states, it implies

that results in previous studies could be biased depending on how their control group(s) are

constructed.

        Though there is a dearth of evidence regarding spillover effects of marijuana law specifically,

previous papers have considered spillover effects of region-specific policies on surrounding areas

in other contexts. Dube, Dube, and García-Ponce (2013) and Knight (2013) examine potential

externalities associated with U.S. gun laws, with both finding that weaker gun law restrictions lead

to an outflow of firearms. Figlio (1995) studies differential drinking ages between Wisconsin

(which had a low drinking age in his data range) and border states and shows that counties on the

border had more alcohol-related crashes than other counties. Lovenheim and Slemrod (2010)

similarly find that an increase in a state’s minimum legal drinking age actually leads to an increase

in fatal accidents for 18-19 year-olds in that state living within 25 miles of a jurisdiction with a

lower drinking age. Lovenheim (2008) provides evidence that consumers travel to purchase



8
    The question of how relaxing legal restrictions on the sale and use of marijuana affects public health is complicated
due to its potential impacts on the use of other substances. On this point, the literature is mixed. Model (1993) shows
that marijuana decriminalization was accompanied by less emergency room episodes involving drugs other than
marijuana. Similarly, Bachhuber et al. (2010) and Chu (2015) find that MML lowers state opioid overdose mortality
rates as well as heroin treatments and cocaine/heroin arrests. Anderson, Hansen, and Rees (2013) find that MML leads
to a reduction in drunk driving fatalities. In contrast, Wen, Hockenberry, and Cummings (2015) provide evidence that
MML increases the frequency of binge drinking among adults and has no impact on the use of hard drugs.

cigarettes in lower-price jurisdictions. Finally, Jacks, Pendakur, and Shigeoka (2017) find that the

repealing of prohibition in some counties in the 1930’s contributed not only to an increase in infant

mortality in those counties but in neighboring (dry) counties as well.

        The paper most similar to ours in terms of topic is Ellison and Spohn (2015), in which the

authors examine the impact of the expansion of the medical marijuana program in Colorado on

drug arrests and jail occupancy in counties of Nebraska. They find that Nebraska border counties

experienced significant growth in marijuana-related arrests and jail admissions after Colorado’s

policy change. However, their identification strategy does not make use of a control group. They

also use data from 2000-2004 and 2009-2013 but not data from 2005-2008, which further

underscores the concern that their results may be partially due to other factors that have changed

over time. Our contribution is to use a formal DID framework in which we examine the effects of

RML (previously unstudied in terms of spillover effects) on all border counties of neighboring

states using non-border counties in those states as a control group. 9

9
    While preparing this manuscript, we became aware of a working paper, Lu (2017), which also examines the effects
of RML on marijuana possession in neighboring states. That paper focuses on Colorado and uses arrest and offense
data at the police-agency rather than county level. Because of missing data issues at the agency level, Lu (2017)
focuses only on city jurisdictions with at least 10,000 residents. This excludes many areas that are physically close to
Colorado but are sparsely populated. Our paper includes these areas because the missing data issues Lu (2017) faces
are ameliorated at the county level, as described in Section 3. Thus, Lu (2017) ends up with a very different set of
“border” jurisdictions than in our paper (with the ones in Lu’s paper being more densely populated and farther from
the physical border, on average). Our paper examines both the Colorado and Washington regions, while Lu’s only
examines the Colorado region. The preliminary conclusions in Lu (2017) are largely consistent with ours (that
marijuana possession arrests rise following RML).

        Our main dataset is compiled from Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program Data: County-

Level Detailed Arrest and Offense Data from 2009 to 2014. 10 These datasets report county-level

arrests for different offenses including marijuana possession, marijuana sale and manufacture,

driving under the influence of drugs/alcohol (DUI), and other drug possession like opium/cocaine

possession. 11 UCR also reports adult and juvenile sub-group arrests data, allowing us to examine

the potential heterogeneous effects of RML along this dimension.12

        The UCR data are submitted voluntarily by local law enforcement agencies on a monthly

basis. This data is then aggregated to the county level. In cases of incomplete reporting, arrest

numbers for such agencies are imputed using 1) arrests reported in other months by that agency

and 2) arrests in comparable jurisdictions in the month(s) of missing data. The UCR then provides

a coverage indicator variable to allow users to set their own threshold for acceptable imputation.

The indicator ranges from 100, indicating that all agencies in the county reported for 12 months in

the year, to 0, indicating that all data in the county are based on estimates rather than reported

data. 13 We use all counties in our main regressions and check the robustness of our results using

more restrictive cutoffs for the coverage indicator later in the paper.

     Apart from marijuana possession arrests, UCR provides 3 categories on drug possession arrests: 1) opium/cocaine
possession, 2) synthetic narcotics possession, and 3) other drug possession. Opium/cocaine possession includes
possession of opium or cocaine and their derivatives (morphine, heroin, codeine). The UCR database does not

        We use the County Distance Database from the National Bureau of Economic Research to

construct distances between counties in non-RML states to RML state borders. The County

Distance Database provides great-circle distances using the Haversine formula based on internal

points in the geographic area. 14

        As stated in the introduction, we define the Colorado region as all counties in Wyoming, Utah,

New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska. There are 360 counties in this region and 29 of

them share a physical border with Colorado. 15 Similarly, the Washington region is defined as all

counties in Oregon and Idaho. There are substantially fewer counties (80) in the Washington region,

with 16 physically bordering Washington state.

        Among these two cases, we place more emphasis on Colorado and its adjacent states for the

following reasons. First, Colorado has substantially more bordering states/counties than

Washington does, giving us more observations for the analysis. Second, no states adjacent to

Colorado had major changes in terms of their marijuana laws over our study period. In contrast,

RML was passed in 2014 in Oregon (Ballot Measure 91). Although Oregon’s RML only took

effect in 2015, the anticipation of legalization might have affected the behaviors of individual



The quality of UCR county-level data is high, especially considering that many counties in our sample are very rural.
Restricting the sample to counties with a coverage indicator of at least 50 results in about a 13% loss of observations
in the Colorado region, while restricting the sample to counties with a coverage indicator of at least 90 results in a 26%
loss. For the Washington region, the respective losses are even smaller (about 3% and 11%, respectively).

     Arizona technically borders Colorado at a single point but is excluded from the analysis because of a marijuana
policy change in California. In 2010, California decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana. In Figures
A1 to A3, we can see that it is very likely that marijuana decriminalization strikingly lowered California marijuana
possession arrests from 2010 to 2014. Since Arizona shares a border with California, we exclude Arizona in our main
regressions due to possible contamination resulting from California’s policy change. However, the results with
Arizona included in the region are similar to our main results and are available upon request.

Oregonians and Oregon law enforcement officials in 2014. Finally, Colorado opened its first

recreational marijuana retail store in January 2014, while Washington opened its first in July 2014.

Since the UCR data is currently only available through 2014, the Colorado region results might

give us more insight into the impact of a fully operational RML policy on neighboring states. 16

        For each of the Colorado and Washington regions, Table 2a shows the descriptive statistics

for the full sample, counties that physically border the RML state, and non-border counties in the

region. Tables 2b and Table 2c repeat the analysis for the adult and juvenile subgroups separately.

        From Panel 1 of Table 2a, the average number of marijuana possession arrests per 10,000

people is 18.4 for the whole period (2009-2014) in the Colorado region, with an average of 18.9

before RML (2009-2012) and 17.6 after RML (2013-2014). Comparing border counties with non-

border counties, marijuana possession arrests are higher in border counties even before RML (28.3

arrests per 10,000 people in border counties compared with 18.1 arrests in non-border counties).

After the implementation of RML, we see a big rise in marijuana possession arrests in border

counties but a drop in non-border counties. Marijuana sale/manufacture arrests are also generally

a bit higher in border counties, but both border and non-border counties experience a small increase

in these arrests after RML. DUI arrests decrease markedly for both border counties and non-border

counties after RML. Opium/cocaine possession arrests increase after RML for border counties but

fall slightly for non-border counties.

     Colorado also has an arguably more permissible RML law than Washington, allowing for growing one’s own
recreational marijuana at home, which Washington prohibits. See footnote 3 for details. See also: Philip Wallach and

        Panel 2 of Table 2a reports the descriptive statistics for the Washington region. This region

has a significantly higher marijuana possession arrest rate than the Colorado region. After RML in

Washington, average marijuana possession arrests went from 68.3 to 93.2 in border counties. There

was only a slight increase in marijuana possession arrests in non-border counties over the same

time period. We also see slight decreases in marijuana sale/manufacture arrests and increases in

opium/cocaine possession arrests in both border and non-border counties in the Washington region

following RML (in the case of opium/cocaine possession arrests, the increase in border counties

is large). Finally, border counties saw slightly higher DUI arrests after RML while non-border

counties had lower DUI arrests after RML.

        In Tables 2b and 2c, we can see that adult arrests generally follow the same pattern as the

total sample. However, marijuana possession arrests of juvenile groups in both the Colorado and

Washington regions fell slightly after RML for both county types. Other arrest type averages for

juveniles are quite small in magnitude and generally either fall or stay roughly constant over time.

        In the analysis below, in addition to defining a “border” county based on sharing a physical

border with the RML state in question, we use an alternative (looser) definition based on whether

a county is within 100 miles from the RML state border. Lastly, we are interested in whether border

counties that are near an interstate highway are especially affected by RML, since the travel cost

of crossing the border and purchasing marijuana is especially low in these counties. There are 3

major interstate highways with 5 border crossings in Colorado and 3 major interstate highways

with 3 border crossings (to other U.S. states) in Washington. 17 Thus, we employ a third treatment,



17
     The interstate highways, counties with interstate border crossings, and corresponding FIPS county codes in the
Colorado region are: 1. interstate 25 north border crossing, Larimer County, 8069; 2. interstate 25 south border
crossing, Las Animas County, 8071; 3. interstate 70 east border crossing, Kit Carson County, 8063; 4. interstate 70
west border crossing, Mesa County, 8077; and interstate 76 border crossing, Sedgwick County, 8115. Similarly, the 3

                                                         13
which takes a value of one if a (non-RML) county is within 100 miles of the RML border county

containing an interstate highway (and zero otherwise).

     Figures 1a and 1b display the trends in marijuana possession arrests of counties in the

Colorado and Washington regions under the three treatment definitions discussed above. In each

panel of these figures, treatment (border) counties are compared to control (non-border) counties

as well as the entire region and the national average. In the upper-left panel of each figure, the

border definition is based on sharing the physical border; in the upper-right panel, it is based on

being within 100 miles of the border; and in the lower-left panel, it is based on being within 100

miles of an interstate highway border crossing. For the Colorado region, there are 29 counties that

physically border Colorado, 57 counties that are within 100 miles of the Colorado border, and 34

counties that are within 100 miles of an interstate border crossing. The corresponding numbers for

the Washington region are 16, 33, and 25, respectively.

     Two immediate observations from Figures 1a and 1b are that marijuana possession arrests

are decreasing nationally for these years and that marijuana possession arrests are always higher

in border counties than non-border counties, even before RML. Looking at the Colorado region

(Figure 1a), non-border counties generally follow the same trend as the national average. However,

in border counties, there is a sharp jump in marijuana possession arrests starting in 2012, with

arrests reaching a peak in 2014 (this pattern is most pronounced for counties on the physical border,

but it is similar based on the other two treatment definitions).


major interstate highways in Washington state are: Interstate 90, which exits Washington from Spokane County (FIPS
53063); Interstate 82, which exits Washington from Benton County (FIPS 53005); and Interstate 5, which exits
Washington from Clark County (FIPS 53011). Interstate 205, which is a small branch deviating from Interstate 5, also
exits from Clark County. Readers can refer to national highway system maps provided by U.S. Department of
Transportation (https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/). Most recent data of

        An important question stemming from Figure 1a is why marijuana possession arrests in

border counties rose in 2012 (since recreational legalization in Colorado only took place at the end

of 2012). A possibility is the relaxation of medical marijuana restrictions between 2009 and 2011,

when the number of medical marijuana enrollees in Colorado soared. 18 This perhaps made it easier

to cross the border and obtain marijuana in Colorado during this time period as well. Because our

focus in this paper is on the spillover effects of RML, in the econometric analyses described below,

we classify 2012 as a “control” year (or, as a robustness check, leave it out of the data altogether)

so only increases occurring after 2012 contribute to a positive RML effect. In another robustness

check, we control for the interaction between “border county” and the total number of registered

medical marijuana enrollees in Colorado in each year and find that our results change very little.

Finally, in the synthetic control analysis, we construct a synthetic control county that best matches

the pre-RML trend in marijuana possession arrests in border counties.

        Moving to the Washington region in Figure 1b, we also notice that border counties see a jump

in marijuana possession arrests, but in this case it is in 2013. Arrest numbers also increase after

2012 for non-border counties, although not nearly to the same degree as in border counties.

        Overall, the differential marijuana possession arrest trends between border and non-border

counties after 2012 hint that RML in Colorado and Washington has affected arrests in nearby

counties of non-RML states. In the next section, we examine this hypothesis more rigorously using

a regression-based DID framework.

                                           4. Empirical Methodology

also include state specific linear time trends in some models to control for unobserved factors (such

as public sentiment regarding marijuana) that may have changed over this time period.

      Because the travel cost associated with purchasing marijuana in a nearby RML state is likely

not discontinuous at the edge of a border county, we also perform some specifications in which a

continuous measure of distance is substituted for the binary “border” treatment variable in

Equations (2) and (3) above. In these specifications, 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖 and 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖

represent distance to the nearest county of an RML state and distance to the nearest county in an

RML state that has an interstate highway border crossing, respectively. Thus, the models are

specified as

All other variables are defined the same way as in Equations (1)-(3). We estimate Equations (1) to

(5) using OLS with standard errors clustered at the county level.

                                                            5. Main Results

                                            5.1. Marijuana Possession Arrests

      The effects of bordering an RML state (or, alternatively, distance to an RML state) following

RML implementation (after 2012) on marijuana possession arrests are shown in Table 3. Panel 1

contains results for the Colorado region and Panel 2 shows results for the Washington region.

      From Panel 1, column (1), physically bordering Colorado after RML has a statistically

significant positive impact on marijuana possession arrests (at the 5% level). On average, counties

that physically border Colorado see an increase of 8.1 in marijuana possession arrests (per 10,000

people) relative to non-border counties following RML, or a 29% increase compared with the pre-

RML mean. The number decreases to 6.7 if the border definition is relaxed to being within 100


                                                                     17
miles to Colorado (column (3)). When we focus specifically on counties that are within 100 miles

of a Colorado interstate border crossing (column (5)), the number jump up to 9.9, suggesting that

interstate highways may amplify the spillover effect of RML (to be sure, however, these point

estimates are not statistically different from each other at conventional levels). Columns (7) and

(9) report the effects of distance to Colorado and distance to a Colorado interstate border crossing

on marijuana possession arrests of neighboring states. In these specifications, a 100-mile decrease

in distance to Colorado and to a Colorado interstate border crossing increase marijuana possession

arrests by 3.2 and 3.5, respectively. Even numbered columns show results of models that include

state-specific linear time trends on the right-hand side. All effects are somewhat smaller in

magnitude, but the results remain significant at the 10% level or better.

        Panel 2 of Table 3 shows the results of the same models for the Washington region. The

results generally follow the same pattern as those of the Colorado region in terms of estimated

signs and relative magnitudes between results with and without state-specific linear time trends.

Of the 5 pairs of results using different treatment (border) definitions, a few coefficients fail to

achieve statistical significance at the 10% level, though the estimated magnitudes are relatively

large. Counties that physically border Washington see an especially striking increase of 22.9

arrests (or a 33% increase) relative to non-border counties after RML. Results in columns (7) and

(9) also indicate that the farther a county is located from Washington state, the smaller the increase

in arrests following RML. 21



21
     Table A1 shows the results of the same models as Table 3 but with the year 2012 excluded from the data. The results
in Table A1 are generally consistent with Table 3 in terms of estimated signs but generally show larger absolute
magnitudes, especially for the Colorado region. This is consistent with Figure 1a. However, some of the results in this
table are less precisely estimated than in Table 3, which is possibly a result of losing one year of observations out of
six total (2009-2014).

                                                           18
        We report separate regressions for adult and juvenile subgroups in Tables 4a and 4b. The

results show that the RML effect on marijuana possession arrests in border counties is entirely

concentrated among adults. Point estimates for juveniles are small, not consistently signed, and

never statistically different from zero. These findings appear to be consistent with Anderson,

Hansen, and Rees (2015), who find that MML does not increase marijuana use among teenagers. 22

 5.2. Marijuana Sale/Manufacture Arrests, DUI Arrests, and Opium/Cocaine Possession Arrests

        Tables 5 through 7 show DID results using marijuana sale/manufacture arrests, DUI arrests,

and opium/cocaine possession arrests as dependent variables, respectively. Looking across the

tables at the Colorado region (Panel 1 in each table), there is little evidence that RML has affected

these outcomes in border counties relative to non-border ones (columns (1) to (6) in each table).

Estimated signs are not consistent, and no result is statistically significant at conventional levels.

Looking at the effect of distance to Colorado and distance to a Colorado interstate border crossing,

results without state-specific linear time trends (columns (7) and (9)) show some indication that

marijuana sale/manufacture, DUI, and opium/cocaine possession arrests might have risen

following RML in areas closer to Colorado relative to areas farther away. However, after adding

state-specific time trends (columns (8) and (10)), all results are rendered insignificant (typically

with a large reduction in magnitude).

        In the Washington region (Panel 2 in Tables 5 through 7), there is some indication that DUI

arrests and opium/cocaine possession arrests increased in border counties relative to non-border


22
     As discussed in Section 3, we also examine how robust our results are to including only those counties with few
imputed values for their individual police agencies. We report our baseline results using only those county-year
observations with a coverage index value larger than or equal to 90 in Table A2. This restriction reduces the numbers
of observations to 1,595 for the Colorado region and 427 for the Washington region (74% and 89% of the total
observations, respectively). The results are similar to those contained in Table 3. We also tried using coverage index
cutoffs of 50 and 80 and again obtained similar results (available upon request).

                                                          19
counties following RML. These results are also not generally robust to the inclusion of state-

specific time trends. Our view of the body of the results on other arrest types is that the evidence

on whether RML affected these arrests in neighboring states is inconclusive. Estimates using the

continuous distance measure especially leave open the possibility that other arrest types increased

following RML, so we believe that with additional (years of) data, this is a worthwhile topic for

future research.

                                   6. Robustness Checks

                                         6.1. Event Study

     In this section, we conduct event studies for our three binary treatment variables (border

definitions) with marijuana possession arrests as the dependent variable. This allows us to further

examine the validity of our DID assumption, which is that the trend in arrests for non-border

counties is a good proxy for what would have happened to border counties without RML,

controlling for relevant observable characteristics. Though we can obviously not test this directly,

if border counties were experiencing a different trend in arrests than non-border counties prior to

RML, it would cast doubt on whether RML is in fact responsible for our results. To do this analysis,

we simply allow the effect of “border county” to vary for every year in our sample (rather than

only for pre- and post-RML periods). The results are contained in Tables 8a and 8b (with 2009

serving as the omitted year).

     Table 8a shows our results for all three definitions of “border county” in the Colorado region.

There is no evidence that trends in marijuana possession arrests between border counties and non-

border counties were different before 2012. Starting in 2012, estimates jump in magnitude, but it

is only in 2014, with another jump in magnitude in all three cases, that we see a statistically

significant difference from the border/non-border county difference in 2009.



                                                20
        Event study results for the Washington region are shown in Table 8b. The results are a little

different than the Colorado ones. In this case, the big jump in the border/non-border difference

comes in 2013 (consistent with Figure 1b), with the coefficients falling somewhat in 2014. Point

estimates for the 2013 and 2014 interactions are not always statistically significant at conventional

levels in these specifications. This may be due in part to the limited sample size in this region.

Nevertheless, the much larger coefficients after 2012 compared to earlier years are generally

supportive of the notion that RML has affected marijuana possession arrests in counties that

neighbor Washington.

                                             6.2. Medical Marijuana

        As stated in Section 3 concerning Figure 1a, a question concerning the interpretation of our

results for the Colorado region is whether they are due to RML or earlier expansion in the

availability of medical marijuana in Colorado. In particular, Colorado experienced growth in the

number of registered medical marijuana patients prior to RML passage, likely as a result of the

relaxation of requirements to dispense and obtain it. Though we expect the mechanisms by which

RML and medical marijuana expansions affect non-RML border states to be similar (but not

identical), we would like to know if a divergence between border and non-border counties in these

states after 2012 is in fact due to RML. While data limitations make this difficult to address, we

can add a proxy for medical marijuana availability to our regressions: the total number of patients

enrolled in the Colorado Medical Marijuana Registry program (MMRP) interacted with our border

dummies or distance from the border. 23 The drawback of this method is that since this number

generally increased between 2009 and 2014, some of the variation in marijuana possession arrests

that could have been due to RML (after 2012) is now soaked up by these interactions.

        The results from regressions with these controls are contained in Table 9. Compared to Table

3, most corresponding point estimates are slightly smaller and the continuous distance-RML

interactions with state-specific time trends are no longer statistically significant at conventional

levels. In summary, even with the loss of variation described above, the results are broadly

consistent with the notion that RML itself is responsible for the divergence in marijuana

possessions arrest trends between counties that are closer to Colorado and those that are further

from Colorado. 24

                                           6.3. Synthetic Control Design

        Our last robustness check addresses the question of whether non-border counties serve as a

suitable control group for RML border counties in our DID design. Figures 1a and 1b (and Tables

2a-2c) indicate that border counties tend to have higher per capita arrest figures than other counties

within their states, on average. To address this issue, we adopt a synthetic control design (Abadie

and Gardeazabal, 2003; Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller, 2010) that constructs control groups

as a weighted average of non-RML border counties where weights are chosen to match the pre-

treatment trend in marijuana possession arrests for RML border counties (in each region). We use




(https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/population/data/profile-county/). Most recent date of access: April 27, 2017.
The total numbers of patients in Colorado who currently possess valid registry ID cards by the end of each year from
2009 to 2014 are: 41,039 in 2009, 116,198 in 2010, 82,089 in 2011, 108,526 in 2012, 110,979 in 2013, and 115,467
in 2014.
24
     In Table A3, we try adding a different control for medical marijuana availability to the regressions: the number of
MMRP patients per capita in the Colorado border county lying closest to the non-RML county in question. The results
are very similar to those in Table 3.

                                                           22
the method in Cavallo et al. (2013), which allows for multiple treatment groups (since we have

many “treated” counties on the border). 25

        We focus on our first definition of RML border county (sharing a physical border with the

RML state) in this section of the paper. The pool of counties that might receive positive weight in

the synthetic control (donor pool) for the Colorado region RML border counties includes non-

border counties in that region plus all counties in other western states that did not experience a

change in marijuana law over our time period: Nevada, Texas, Montana, and North and South

Dakota. 26 The donor pool for the Washington region RML border counties is constructed in like

manner.

        The marijuana possession arrest trends for border (treatment) counties and the synthetic

control county are shown in Figures 2a and 2b (for the Colorado and Washington regions,

respectively). The trends for RML border counties are exactly the same as the ones shown in

Figures 1a and 1b. The synthetic control county generally matches the pre-treatment trend for

RML border counties, though the fit is better in the Colorado region than the Washington one.

        In both cases, there is a substantial divergence in trends between the treatment and control

counties following RML. The hypothesis that arrest rates between treatment and control are the

same in 2014 for the Colorado region is rejected at the 5% level, and the same is true in the

Washington region for both 2013 and 2014.




25
     To implement this, we use the “synth_runner” package in STATA developed by Galiani and Quistorff (2016).
Weights (for the synthetic control group) are chosen to best reproduce the marijuana possession arrest per capita trend
for RML border counties in the pre-treatment period.
26
     We exclude all counties on the Mexican border from the donor pool due to their persistently high arrest rates and
potential to be affected by Colorado’s RML policy directly.

                                                           23
        Though our ability to match the pre-treatment trends of RML border counties up until 2012

is not perfect, we believe the results using the synthetic control design cast substantial doubt on

the notion that the reason marijuana possession arrests increased relatively in border counties

following RML is related to differences in baseline levels of arrests or a different pre-treatment

trajectory in those counties.

                                      7. Discussion on Mechanisms

        An open question concerning the interpretation of our results is how much of the increase in

arrests in border counties of non-RML states is driven by increased possession (which would be

closely tied to higher use) and how much is driven by the police response to RML across the

border. 27 In particular, police officers might adopt new techniques or use more resources toward

cracking down on what they perceive to be more illegal marijuana possession following RML.

        Although we cannot address this question directly since we do not have measures of police

resource allocation or effort, we can examine how police employment changed in border versus

non-border counties following RML. Furthermore, we can use data from the National Survey on

Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services

Administration to examine how self-reported use of marijuana changed in RML border states

relative to non-border states following RML.

        First, we examine the effect of RML on one proxy for police presence in a county: the number

of police officers employed per capita (or, alternatively, the number of police agency employees

per capita). This data also comes from the UCR Program database, which reports the number of



27
     We note that an increase in arrests in border counties also need not reflect an increase in marijuana possession
among individuals living in those counties; rather, it could be that those living in non-border counties who smuggle
marijuana across the border are more likely to be apprehended near the border than in non-border areas.



                                                          24
employed police officers as well as total employees at the police agency level. 28 We match each

agency to its county using county identifiers from the Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers

Crosswalk, 2012. 29 We then aggregate the number of employees within a county and divide by

county population to obtain total police officers per 10,000 county residents and total police agency

employees per 10,000 county residents.

        Figure 3 shows that counties that physically border the RML state typically employ more

police officers (and total employees) than non-border counties in both regions, though the relative

trends are different: in the Colorado region, police presence in RML border counties looks to be

diverging somewhat from the rest of the state, while in Washington it is the opposite (at least until

2014). 30 We use the same model specification as in Section 4 but with police officer employment

as the dependent variable. The results are shown in Table 10. We do not report the results on police

agency total employees because they are very similar (available upon request). Table 10 shows

that after adding controls, the effects of the interactions between “border county” and the post-

RML time period on police officer employment are generally positive in the Colorado region,

though the coefficients are small and most are not statistically significant at conventional levels.

     We drop Marion County of Oregon (FIPS code: 41047) in this analysis and in subsequent regressions due to an
apparent error in the data. While all other counties in the Washington region have no more than 60 employed officers
per 10,000 people in any year, Marion County is recorded as having employed more than 500 officers per 10,000
people in 2011 (in other years, the number for this county is always lower than 40).

                                                         25
This is in contrast to the Washington region, where the interactions tend to be negative in sign,

though again they are generally statistically insignificant.

        Next, we examine a measure of marijuana use directly. Though data on marijuana use rates

at the county level is not publicly available, we can use data at the state-level to see if states that

neighbor RML states experienced a relative increase in use compared to non-neighbor states. The

data on the percentage of individuals 18 or older in each state who report using marijuana in the

past year come from NSDUH in 2-year intervals. 31

        We use the intervals of 2009-10 and 2011-12 as control periods and 2013-14 as the treatment

period, which is consistent with our county-level analysis described earlier. 32 Because we have

few observations at the state level, we pool Washington and Colorado regions and treat all border

states (ID, OR, WY, UT, NM, OK, KS, NE) as our treatment group and all other western states

except for Washington and Colorado (CA, NV, AZ, MT, ND, SD, TX) as our control group. Table


31
     NSDUH also releases estimates at the sub-state level in 3-year intervals; however, we cannot use this data because
sub-state regions are typically large and overlap both border and non-border portions of the state.

11 shows the average percentage of adults using marijuana in the past year for “treatment” states

that border Colorado or Washington as well as for the control states. The marijuana prevalence

rate increased from 10.64 to 12.32 percent in border states following RML, while it increased more

modestly from 11.33 to 11.92 percent in non-border states. This suggests a naïve DID estimate of

1.09 percentage points. To examine this further, we perform a DID regression controlling for year

and state dummies as well as medical marijuana legalization status and marijuana

decriminalization status in each state. The results are shown in Table 12. From column (1), border

states experience an average 1.16 percentage point increase in marijuana prevalence following

RML compared with non-border states, which is a 10.5% increase compared with the pre-RML

percentage. After adding state specific linear time trends, the effect increases from 1.16 percentage

points to 3.49 percentage points, though these results may be less credible due to having only three

data periods).

     Overall, the results in this section suggest that police employment has not responded

significantly to RML in border counties relative to non-border counties. Furthermore, self-reported

marijuana use does rise in border states relative to non-border states following RML. Although we

are not able to rule out the possibility that even with existing resources, police departments are

directing increased attention to marijuana possession in areas near RML states, our results suggest

that an increase in possession is likely to be factor in the effect of RML on arrests.

                                            8. Conclusion

     In this paper, we examine the impact of recreational marijuana legalization (RML) in

Colorado and Washington on their neighboring states in terms of marijuana-related arrests. We

find that RML causes a sharp increase in marijuana possession arrests in border counties near both




                                                 27
Colorado and Washington relative to non-border counties, suggesting strong spillover effects of

marijuana legalization.

     In addition, we provide some evidence using state-level NSDUH data that self-reported use

rises after RML in states that border RML states. This is consistent with Hansen et al. (2017),

which suggests that a substantial amount of marijuana sold in Washington was trafficked out of

the state before Oregon legalized recreational marijuana. These findings suggest that an increase

in marijuana possession and use is at least partially responsible for our arrest results. Although

intentional police targeting could also lead to an increase in arrests, we have noted that it has its

own undesirable consequences.

     Our paper suggests that law enforcement efforts to penalize marijuana use in non-RML states

are complicated by neighbors’ choices to adopt RML. Since 2012, eight states (plus the District of

Columbia) have passed RML. As additional states consider legalizing recreational marijuana, the

costs and benefits of these decisions from a national perspective should include the spillover

effects on non-adopting states, which our paper shows is likely to include law enforcement and

criminal justice costs in addition to other social harms associated with increases in arrests and/or

use of marijuana. A full analysis of the value of these costs, which is beyond the scope of this

paper, would lead to a better understanding of the (dis)advantages of letting states decide whether

or not to legalize versus a federal policy on marijuana legality.
