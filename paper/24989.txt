The Costs of Macroprudential Policy

NBER Working Paper No. 24989
September 2018
JEL No. E58,G28

                                          ABSTRACT

Central banks increasingly rely on macroprudential measures to manage the financial cycle.
However, the effects of such policies on the core objectives of monetary policy to stabilise output
and inflation are largely unknown. In this paper, we quantify the effects of changes in maximum
loan-to-value (LTV) ratios on output and inflation. We rely on a narrative identification approach
based on detailed reading of policy-makers’ objectives when implementing the measures. We
find that over a four year horizon, a 10 percentage point decrease in the maximum LTV ratio
leads to a 1.1% reduction in output. As a rule of thumb, the impact of a 10 percentage point LTV
tightening can be viewed as roughly comparable to that of a 25 basis point increase in the policy
rate. However, the effects are imprecisely estimated and the effect is only present in emerging
market economies. We also find that tightening LTV limits has larger economic effects than
loosening them. At the same time, we show that changes in maximum LTV ratios have
substantial effects on credit and house price growth. Using inverse propensity weights to
rerandomise LTV actions, we show that these effects are likely causal.

                                    1.     Introduction

How do macroprudential policies interact with the core objectives of monetary policy to
stabilise prices and output? As a response to the global financial crisis, central banks and
regulators across the world have increasingly relied on macroprudential policies to maintain
financial stability. A recent literature has shown that policy-makers can moderate credit and
asset price cycles using macroprudential instruments (e.g. Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey
(2018), Bruno et al. (2017) and Kuttner and Shim (2016)). This way, they can reduce negative
output tail risks emanating from the link between excess credit and costly financial crises
(Schularick and Taylor (2012) and Jordà et al. (2013)). However, there is very little empirical
evidence on how the use of such instruments affects the traditional objectives of monetary
policy, that is, output and inflation.
   In this paper, we explore the effects of macroprudential measures on output and inflation
for a large cross-country panel of 56 countries over more than two decades. Building on a
new dataset, we use a narrative approach in order to address identification challenges. Our
results show that macroprudential measures, specifically changes in the maximum loan-to-
value (LTV) ratio, do have modest and imprecisely estimated spillover effects on output and
inflation. In particular, we find that a 10 percentage point reduction in the maximum LTV
ratio lowers output by about 1.1% after four years. However, this effect is rather imprecisely
estimated. The near-term impact on the price level is in most specifications even smaller
and close to zero. The effect is more pronounced in emerging market economies (EMEs),
while the path of output is almost unaffected by LTV limit changes in the set of advanced
economies (AEs). In a back-of-the-envelope calculation, we compare the magnitude of this
effect to estimates of GDP responses to monetary policy in Jordà et al. (2017), which are
also based on a broad sample of countries. We find that the two-year response of GDP to a
10 percentage point reduction in the maximum LTV ratio can be compared to that of a 26
basis points increase in interest rates.
   Importantly we also test for potential asymmetries and find that the output effect is
mainly driven by the negative effects of tightenings in maximum LTV ratios, and not by
higher output generated through loosening actions. We also assess the treatment effects of
LTV limit tightenings on financial variables using inverse propensity weighting and find
that credit and house prices fall after a tightening. Overall, these results imply that central
banks might be able to use macroprudential policies to dampen the financial cycle without
risking major interference with their core monetary policy objectives.
   Macroprudential measures are not randomly assigned. In the ideal environment to
measure the effects of changes in LTV limits on output and inflation, the following three


                                               1
conditions are satisfied: (i) LTV policy actions are exogenous with respect to current and
lagged real variables; (ii) such actions are uncorrelated with other shocks (e.g., monetary
policy acting at the same time); and (iii) they are unexpected. While the unsystematic nature
of macroprudential policies means they are typically unexpected, we clearly need to worry
about the exogeneity of the policy action. To address the exogeneity condition, we rely in
this paper on a novel hand-collected dataset detailing the intentions or stated objectives
of policy-makers when they change LTV limits. This approach is in the tradition of the
narrative approach pioneered in Friedman and Schwartz (1963) and Romer and Romer
(1989). In a similar spirit to the narrative identification of monetary policy shocks, we
argue that macroprudential actions taken without reference to current or expected trends
in real output and inflation can be seen as exogenous with respect to price and output
stabilisation objectives of monetary policy. This new narrative measure therefore allows us
to establish the causal effects of macroprudential actions on economic activity and inflation.
Using a battery of tests, we confirm that there is indeed no systematic relationship between
changes in our narrative measure and real economic variables. To address the second
condition, we control for monetary policy shocks in all our specifications. To trace the
dynamic propagation of such exogenous policy interventions, we rely on local projections
(Jordà (2005)).
   Our identification approach requires detailed reading and understanding of the under-
lying motivations for macroprudential measures and the information set of policy-makers.
To keep the required information manageable, we focused on one specific tool that is
frequently used to tackle boom-bust cycles in credit and housing markets, namely, changes
in maximum LTV ratios. We compiled a comprehensive new dataset consisting of quarterly
observations of LTV actions in 56 economies, building on the database developed by Shim
et al. (2013). Our quarterly dataset contains 92 changes in maximum LTV ratios and loan
prohibitions.
   Almost all papers in the literature on measuring the effectiveness of macroprudential
actions employ dummy variables to measure macroprudential policies. Such variables
however do not capture the intensity of policy actions of the same type. For instance, a
decrease in the maximum LTV ratio by 10 percentage points and a decrease in the ratio by
20 percentage points are treated equally. We use instead a numerical variable quantifying
the quarterly changes in the maximum LTV ratio. To our knowledge, this paper is the first
that constructs an intensity-adjusted LTV change variable, which considers not only the
change in the maximum LTV ratio in percentage points, but also accounts for the scope
of loans to which such a change is applied. This allows us to estimate the effect of a one
percentage point change in LTV limits as described above. We also assess the differences


                                              2
between tightenings and loosenings and find that the negative long-run effects are driven
mainly by tightenings.
   Do LTV limits help dampen the financial cycle? To answer this question, we turn to
inverse propensity weighting to mimic random allocation. As in Jordà et al. (2015), we
employ a two-stage procedure, where the probability of an economy being treated with a
macroprudential action, here a tightening in maximum LTV ratios, is estimated in a separate
first stage regression. This purges the data of observable sources of endogeneity. In the
second stage regression, observations are weighted inversely to the estimated probability
of receiving treatment, thus giving greater weight to an action that comes closer to the
random allocation ideal. We find indeed that real household credit and real mortgage
credit are reduced when LTV limits are decreased. At the same time, house prices fall.
Macroprudential policies seem to achieve the desired targets. Our results on real variables
indicate furthermore that they do so at a relatively small cost. Therefore, for central banks
such macroprudential measures may serve as a complementary policy tool that does not
interfere with other objectives in a major way.
   This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a literature review. Section 3
describes data and empirical strategies focusing on how we identify the stated objectives of
LTV measures, how we construct the intensity-adjusted quantifiable LTV change variable,
and whether LTV measures are exogenous to the real cycle. Section 4 presents the empirical
results on the response of real variables to changes in LTV limits. Section 5 considers the
response of financial variables to LTV actions. Finally, section 6 concludes.


                                     2.   Literature

A large amount of literature has considered the effects of monetary policy on output and
price levels. For an overview of the literature on this relationship see Ramey (2016). While
the global financial crisis has renewed interest in the ability of macroprudential policies to
help manage the financial cycle, the responses of output and inflation to macroprudential
policies have rarely been addressed. The few investigations into the effects of these policies
often use historical data on credit controls that were common in many Western European
countries in the decades following World War II (Kelber and Monnet (2014)).
   As one of the few studies, Aikman et al. (2016) evaluate in a joint framework the
impact of monetary and macroprudential policies in the United Kingdom from the 1950s
to the early 1980s. They rely on local projection methods to estimate impulse response
functions to the two policy shocks augmented by forecasts (in line with Romer and Romer
(1989)) and factors (in line with Bernanke et al. (2005)). They find that an analogue to


                                              3
macroprudential measures, credit controls, were quite effective in taming the credit cycle
and had a dampening effect on industrial output. Furthermore, they find little evidence for
an effect of credit controls on the price level. Monnet (2014) studies the effect of quantitative
controls on money and credit during France’s golden age between 1948 and 1973 and
finds strong effects on output and prices. Similar to our approach, identification builds
on narrative evidence on the intentions associated with enacted policies extracted from
archival records.
   There are also a few contributions building on recently collected cross-country databases
on macroprudential policy actions. Kim and Mehrotra (2017) analyse the responses of
credit, output and inflation to changes in macroprudential and monetary policies based
on data for four countries in the Asia-Pacific region using a VAR framework. They find a
negative effect of changes in macroprudential policies on output as well as inflation. Their
macroprudential policy measures are based on data from the Shim et al. (2013) database.
Also based on this database, Boar et al. (2017) analyse the relationship between a country’s
propensity to use macroprudential measures and output outcomes. Dividing countries
into two groups depending on their use of macroprudential policies, they find countries
which use macroprudential policies more frequently, experience higher growth rates in the
cross-section, while the use of macroprudential policies reduces output volatility. Finally,
Sanchez and Röhn (2016) analyse the effects of various policies on economic growth using
quantile regressions. They find that macroprudential policies reduce output growth, but
also reduce the tail risk of output growth. Among other policy variables, they specifically
analyse the role of LTV policies (based on a dummy variable) and find consistently negative
effects of these measures on output growth. However, the significance of this result depends
on the quantiles analysed.
   More generally, many studies have examined the impact of macroprudential policies
on the financial cycle, particularly on measures of credit and house price cycles. For
example, Kuttner and Shim (2016) find that introductions or reductions of the maximum
debt-service-to-income (DSTI) ratio and increases in housing-related taxes have significant
negative effects on real housing credit growth for 55 economies over the period of 1980
to 2012. They find that a typical DSTI tightening action lowers the real credit growth rate
by 4-6 percentage points over four quarters. Using data on total credit to households and
non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs) from the BIS total credit database,
Cerutti et al. (2015) find that borrower-based measures such as the maximum LTV ratio
and the maximum DSTI ratio are associated with lower growth in credit to households
over 2001–13. Dell’Ariccia et al. (2012) find that macroprudential policies can contain
the incidence of credit booms and limit the costs of busts associated with credit booms.


                                               4
Claessens et al. (2013) investigate how macroprudential policies affect individual banks
and find that maximum LTV and DSTI ratios reduce asset and leverage growth. Policies
implemented in adverse times, however, do not help to stop declines. In a single country
study, Wong et al. (2011) find that higher LTV caps lead to a lower level of the mortgage
debt-to-GDP ratio in Hong Kong SAR in the 1990s and 2000s. Tillmann (2015) considers
the impact of LTV and DSTI limits on household credit in Korea from 2000Q1 to 2012Q4.
In particular, he uses a qualitative VAR method to estimate impulse response functions for
macroprudential shocks. He found an unexpected tightening in LTV and DSTI limits had a
significant effect on household credit growth in Korea.
   Using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with housing and
household debt, Alpanda and Zubairy (2017) consider the effectiveness of monetary policy,
LTV limits and housing-related tax policies on reducing household indebtedness. They find
that reductions in mortgage interest payment deductions and regulatory LTV ratios are
the most effective tools to limit household credit, as these measures are the most targeted.
Rubio and Yao (2017) show in a DSGE model that a macroprudential authority can act
as a complementary macro-financial stabiliser for both real and financial cycles when the
steady-state interest rate is low and monetary policy hits the zero lower bound.
   While all these papers study changes in regulatory caps on LTV ratios, Bachmann and
Rueth (2017) analyse the effects of changes in average LTV ratios on output and credit in
the United States. They use a structural VAR framework to identify exogenous variation
in LTV ratios and find that a 25 basis points tightening in the LTV ratio reduces GDP by
approximately 0.1%. At the same time, they find that the Federal Reserve responded to
a tightening in LTV ratios with lower policy rates. As a result, mortgage rates fall and
residential investment increases after a tightening in LTV ratios.
   The narrative approach focuses on evidence derived from the historical record (Romer
and Romer (1989)). More specifically, researchers conduct narrative analysis by systemically
using qualitative information from contemporary primary sources to construct numerical
measures often with the aim of addressing issues of causation. Narrative analysis has
been used not only in the context of monetary policy (Friedman and Schwartz (1963)
and Romer and Romer (1989)) but also for fiscal policy (Romer and Romer (2007) and
Gillitzer (2017)) and financial distress episodes (Romer and Romer (2017)). By contrast, the
narrative approach has not been used in the context of macroprudential policy. Budnik
and Kleibl (2018) describe a database on policy actions of a macroprudential nature taken
by the European Union member countries to affect the banking sector in 1995–2014. The
information in the database is based on responses from a survey with the aim of using
narrative information for the impact assessment of macroprudential policies.

                             3.    Data and empirical strategy

We base our analysis on quarterly data for 56 economies, including both AEs and EMEs,
from 1990Q1 to 2012Q2.1 The data used in this paper rely on various sources such as the
BIS Databank (national sources) and the database on housing market policy actions from
Shim et al. (2013). As our dependent variables we use output (real GDP) and the level of
the consumer price index from the BIS Databank. For credit variables, we use data from the
BIS Databank on bank credit to the private non-financial sector, bank credit to households
and housing credit. Explanatory variables include policy variables, other macroeconomic
variables, asset prices and structural variables. For policy rates, we use actual policy rates,
backdated with one-month or three-month market interest rates obtained from the BIS
Databank. For the US policy rate, we use the federal funds rate obtained from Bloomberg.
    A major contribution lies in the construction of additional data on macroprudential
policy actions: we extend the database for policy actions on housing markets constructed
by Shim et al. (2013).2 While the literature has so far analysed macroprudential measures
using dummy variables, we collected data to quantify policy actions. Our main focus is on
changes in maximum LTV ratios. This instrument is comparable across countries and the
size of a change can be identified in most instances. Because we want to measure the effects
of macroprudential policies on output and inflation, we focus on changes in LTV limits that
target the financial cycle without being driven by concerns about growth or inflation.


3.1.       Narrative identification of macroprudential policy shocks
The greatest challenge in measuring the causal effects of macroprudential policy consists in
constructing a measure of macroprudential policy shocks. The following three criteria must
be fulfilled: (i) policy actions are exogenous with respect to the current and lagged real
variables; (ii) actions are uncorrelated with other shocks; and (iii) they are unexpected. To
address the exogeneity condition, we rely in this paper on a novel hand-collected dataset
documenting the stated objectives of policy-makers when they change LTV limits.


   1 The 23 advanced economies are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. The 33 emerging market economies are Argentina,
Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Chinese Taipei, Colombia, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hong Kong
SAR, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines,
Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and Ukraine.
   2 Actions included in the database can be sorted into the following categories: (i) total bank credit targeted

measures, which capture changes in reserve requirements, liquidity requirements and credit growth limits;
and (ii) housing credit targeted measures, which capture changes in LTV limits, DSTI limits, risk weights on
housing loans, provisioning requirements and exposure limits on the property sector.

Notes: In terms of objectives, LTV actions can be taken with reference to the real cycle, further distinguishing between GDP, inflation
and other real objectives. LTV actions can also be taken with reference to the financial cycle, further broken down by their specific
objectives: house price, total credit, housing or household credit, bank buffer, risk taking, FX borrowing and other financial objectives.
In this table we report the number of LTV actions that were implemented referencing the respective objective. One LTV action can have
more than one stated objective.



     For the narrative identification, we proceeded in the following way. We first listed all
92 LTV policy actions documented in the database of Shim et al. (2013) from 1990Q1 to
2012Q2 for the 56 economies. Such actions consist of the introduction, tightening, loosening
or abolition of the maximum LTV ratio and the prohibition of certain types of loan (that is,
applying a zero LTV ratio). We then consulted official documents for each of these policy
actions such as press releases announcing these actions, annual reports describing the
background of specific policy actions taken and regulatory documents such as circulars to
understand the reasoning behind those actions and identify objectives for the implemented
LTV actions. We then classified the motivations broadly into real and financial objectives.
More specifically, we classified real objectives into the following three categories: GDP,
inflation and other real objectives. We also classified financial objectives into the following
seven categories: house price, total credit, housing and household credit, bank buffer,
risk taking, FX borrowing (including borrowing from non-residents), and other financial
objectives. Table 1 provides a summary of the stated objectives of the 92 LTV actions taken
among the 56 economies from 1990Q1 to 2012Q2. It should be noted that one LTV action
can have more than one stated objective, hence the total number of stated objectives is
greater than the total number of LTV actions.3


   3 Itshould also be noted that for four country-quarter observations, two LTV actions were taken within one
quarter (i.e., 2010Q2, 2010Q3 and 2011Q1 for China, and 1996Q2 for Singapore). For these four country-quarter
observations, we need to carefully match the stated objective with each of the two actions. It turned out that
all these eight LTV actions (2 actions x 4 quarters) had house prices as the only stated objective.


                                                                   7
    As an example of the narrative identification of stated objectives of LTV actions, in
August 2010 the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) lowered the threshold of property
value, at or above which a maximum LTV ratio of 60% applies,from HKD20 million to
HKD12 million, and lowered the maximum LTV ratio for non owner-occupied properties to
60%. In August 2010, the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation stopped providing insurance
on mortgage applications with the LTV ratio greater than 90%, down from the previous
95%. The Chief Executive of the HKMA said that there was ”a need for the HKMA to take
further measures to safeguard banking stability” and that these measures would ”help
banks manage credit risks more prudently.” The stated objectives for these actions recorded
in our dataset are ”Bank buffer” and ”Risk taking”, both of which are financial objectives.
    In the next step, we dropped all policy actions that were primarily motivated by real
objectives. Yet since a policy action can have more than one stated objective, we went
through all actions motivated by financial objectives and verified that at the same time the
authorities did not voice concerns over real imbalances in the economy. Among the 92 LTV
actions, three actions had a stated real objective, hence we excluded them from the sample.
An example of LTV actions with a stated real objective is that in March 2005, the People’s
Bank of China (PBC) lowered the maximum LTV ratio from 80% to 70% for properties in
cities and areas where the price of real estates is believed to be rising too fast. According to
the PBC press release dated 29 March 2005 titled ”The PBC adjusted housing loans policy of
commercial banks and lowered the interest rate of excess reserve of financial institutions”,
this measure was taken ”in order to promote healthy and sustainable development of the
real estate sector.” The stated objectives for this action recorded in our dataset are ”GDP”
and ”House price”. The resulting sample consists of 89 LTV actions accompanied by stated
financial objectives only.


3.2.    Intensity adjustment
So far, papers in the literature on measuring the effects of macroprudential policy in
cross-country data use dummy variables taking the value 1 for tightening actions and zero
otherwise, or those taking value 1 for tightening actions, −1 for loosening actions and zero
for no change.4 Such variables do not capture the intensity of policy actions of the same
type. By definition, in such a research design a decrease in the maximum LTV ratio by 10
percentage points and a decrease in the ratio by 20 percentage points are treated equally.
The coefficients on these dummy variables show the impact of a ”typical” policy action in a
   4 One exception is Vandenbussche et al. (2015). They quantify relative strength of different types of policy
action by using conversion coefficients on changes in the regulatory capital ratio, the reserve requirement
ratio and the maximum LTV ratio by central, eastern and southeastern European countries. Glocker and
Towbin (2015) use intensity-adjusted reserve requirement variables for a single country, Brazil.

certain type. That is because these coefficients only show the average impact of all policy
actions with different magnitudes of actual changes.
    To measure the economic magnitude of the impact of a certain type of macroprudential
policy on target variables such as output and inflation, we need to construct a variable
measuring the size of policy changes. This is especially important for policy-makers when
they try to calibrate the size of the change in regulatory ratios to achieve a certain amount
of slowdown in the growth rate of output, credit or asset prices. It should be noted that
when we construct such a variable, we need to consider both the size of the change in the
relevant ratio and the scope of such policy actions being applied, that is, the range of loans
to which the change in the maximum LTV ratio applies.5
    Specifically, the following criteria are applied to construct the intensity-adjusted LTV
action variable. We denote this variable by ∆MaPPi,t .

   • When the maximum LTV ratio is lowered by 10 percentage points, the LTV variable
      takes a value of 10. When the maximum LTV ratio is raised by 10 percentage
      points, the LTV variable takes a value of –10. This is in line with the aforementioned
      convention of assigning 1 to tightening actions and −1 to loosening actions for dummy
      variables.

   • When a specific type of loan is prohibited, it is regarded as applying a zero maximum
      LTV ratio. If the previously applied maximum LTV ratio is known, then the level of
      the previous maximum LTV ratio is equal to the size of the change in the maximum
      LTV ratio. If there is no previous maximum LTV ratio applied to this type of loan,
      then it is regarded as the introduction of a new zero maximum LTV ratio. In this case,
      we cannot determine the actual size of the change in the maximum LTV ratio.

   • When the prohibition of a specific type of loan is lifted, it is regarded as no longer
      applying a zero maximum LTV ratio. If a newly applied maximum LTV ratio exists,
      then the negative of the level of the new maximum LTV ratio is the value of the
      change in the maximum LTV ratio. If there is no new maximum LTV ratio applied
      to this type of loan, then it is regarded as the abolition of the maximum LTV ratio.
      In this case, we cannot determine the actual size of the change in the maximum LTV
      ratio.

   • When a new maximum LTV ratio is introduced, we cannot determine the actual size
      of the change in the maximum LTV ratio. When the existing maximum LTV ratio is
   5 In principle, one could also consider the initial level of the maximum LTV ratio, but we do not consider

this aspect here.


                                                     10
     abolished, again we cannot determine the actual size of the change in the maximum
     LTV ratio.

   • When the maximum LTV ratio changes more than once in a quarter, we sum up all
     the changes (i.e., calculate cumulative changes) in a quarter and treat them as one
     LTV change.

   • If a specific non-standard type of housing loan becomes subject to a LTV change,
     we assign 10% weight to the loan type. For example, if housing loans extended to
     first-time home buyers only become subject to the maximum LTV ratio of 70% rather
     than 60%, then the LTV variable takes the value of –1, which is calculated as –10
     multiplied by 10%. Also, if a change in the maximum LTV ratio is applied only to
     foreign currency loans, we assign 50% weight to this type of loan.

   Among the 89 LTV actions without stated real objectives, two LTV actions were taken
in one quarter by the same country in the case of four country-quarter observations (i.e.,
2010Q2, 2010Q3 and 2011Q1 for China, and 1996Q2 for Singapore). When we use the
intensity-adjusted quantifiable LTV change variable, we sum up all LTV actions taken in
a quarter. As a result, we have 85 distinct LTV actions in the sample. Among the 85 LTV
actions, 32 actions involve either introductions or abolitions of the maximum LTV ratio or
loan prohibition for which we do not have information about the actual size of the change
in the maximum LTV ratio. For our baseline regressions, we do not consider these 32
actions with insufficient information, but only consider the remaining 53 quantified actions.
Table 2 provides the list of the 53 actions that were not taken with reference to the real cycle
and for which we have accurate information on the size of the change.
   For robustness check, we also construct a quantified LTV action variable for which we
do not adjust for the scope of loans to which the changes in LTV limits apply. Table 3
shows the summary statistics of the 53 LTV variables with and without scope adjustment.
The average size of the scope-adjusted LTV change variable is 7.1 percentage points for the
tightening actions and –7.9 percentage points for the loosening actions. When we do not
adjust for the scope of LTV changes applied, the average size of the change in the maximum
LTV ratio is 22.5 percentage points for the tightening actions and –16.0 percentage points
for the loosening actions. When we compare the scope-adjusted and scope-unadjusted LTV
change variables, scope adjustment reduces the average size of the LTV change variable
into one third to one half of the scope-unadjusted LTV change variable. The large difference
between the two types of the quantifiable LTV variable is also due to loan prohibition
actions which tend to take very large values of the scope-unadjusted numerical LTV change
variable (such as +90 or –80).

   As a robustness check based on the intensity-adjusted measure ∆MaPPi,t , we also define
an additional measure. ∆MaPPi,t
                             Index is an index variable based on our intensity adjusted

policy action variable:

   Similarly, ∆ Tight MaPPi,t and ∆ Loose MaPPi,t are dummy variables for tightenings and
loosenings, respectively:

3.3.   Are LTV changes exogenous to the real cycle?
In the previous section, we presented the new narratively identified data on the stated
objectives and size of LTV changes. In our empirical analysis we combine both to estimate
the responses of real variables to a one percentage point change in LTV limits. As de-
scribed before, focusing on actions referencing only the financial objectives allows a causal
interpretation of the results.
   A relevant concern in this setting is that policy-makers may target real objectives, without
stating them explicitly when implementing macroprudential actions. In this section, we
test this important prerequisite for a causal interpretation of our results.



                                                   12
     We first determine cyclical deviations of the real variables. To do so, we calculate the
deviations of real GDP and prices from trend. To detrend the data we follow Hamilton
(2017). The procedure is based on the idea that the trend component of a variable at time
t + h is the value we could have predicted based on historical data. The cyclical component
will be the difference between the realised value and this trend.
     Let h denote the horizon for which we build such a prediction. Then the cyclical
(detrended) component is the difference between the realised value at time t + h and the
expectation about this value formed at time t. To build this expectation, Hamilton (2017)
proposes a regression of the value y at time t + h on the four most recent values of y at time
t, i.e. yt , yt−1 , yt−2 and yt−3 . Formally, this regression can be written as


                              y t + h = β 0 + β 1 y t + β 2 y t −1 + β 3 y t −2 + β 4 y t −3 + v t + h .

     The choice of h depends on the horizon we attribute to the cyclical component. As
suggested, we choose a horizon of eight quarters, so the residual is the deviation of the
realised value yt+8 from the expectation formed at time t based on information on yt , yt−1 ,
yt−2 and yt−3 . We normalise this variable by its country-specific standard deviation.

particular, changes in the maximum LTV ratio implemented when the output gap (positive
and negative) was larger than two standard deviations, do not stand out as large LTV
changes. We obtain similar results when we use standard H-P filters and when we use
longer lags of detrended real variables.
    In Table 4 and Table 5 we turn to formal procedures to test the relationship between
the treatment (that is, the implementation of macroprudential actions involving LTV limits)
and real economic variables. Note that in an ideal randomised allocation of treatment and
control, there would be no difference between treatment and control sub-populations.
    In Table 4, we differentiate between two treatments, a tightening and a loosening,
and the non-treated control group of observations. We then compare the means of those
sub-populations and test for their equality. In the upper panel we compare the group of
tightening observations to the control group. We compare real GDP and the price level
in treated and non-treated observations based on two measures. First, we compute the
smoothed growth rate of these variables over the previous year, which is over four lags, and
demean this measure at the country level to account for the fact that fast growing EMEs
have historically been more active in using macroprudential policies. The results show no
significant difference between the two sub-populations. We also compare the lag of the
output gap and the detrended price level between the two sub-populations, but do not find
a significant difference.
    In the bottom panel of Table 4, we present the results of tests for the equality of means
between loosening actions and the control group. Again, we do not find a statistically
significant difference between the two sub-populations.

    In Table 5 we test whether we can predict either ∆MaPPi,t or ∆MaPPi,t
                                                                       Index based on the

one-period lagged detrended GDP and the price level. Column (1) shows the results of a
regression of the LTV change on the lagged output gap, the detrended price level and a
constant. In column (2) we additionally include country-fixed effects. Columns (3) and (4)
use ∆MaPPi,t
          Index as the dependent variable instead. Reassuringly, the coefficients are across

all specifications insignificant and the variables have little explanatory power. Based on the
results in this section, we conclude that LTV changes are not predicted by real economic
variables and that their implementation can be seen as orthogonal to the real cycle.
    Another concern may be that macroprudential actions are anticipated by market par-
ticipants. We therefore conducted additional tests whether bank equity indices display
abnormal returns before the announcement of an LTV action. When we analyse monthly
and quarterly returns, we find no evidence that actions were anticipated by the market.
Looking at a higher frequency of daily returns, there seems to be some information leak-
age about the policy change around 10 days before the announcement. For our exercise,
however, it matters that actions were not anticipated in the previous quarter.


          4.     The output and price effects of changes in LTV limits

For the main part of the empirical analysis, this paper uses local projection methods. Jordà
(2005) introduces local projections as a way to compute impulse responses without specifi-
cation and estimation of the underlying multivariate dynamic system. Local projections
are estimated at each period of interest rather than extrapolating into increasingly distant
horizons from a given model as it is done with VAR models. He discusses the advantages
of local projections such as being more robust to mis-specification, being simple in joint or
point-wise analytic inference, and being able to easily accommodate experimentation with
highly nonlinear and flexible specifications.

                                                                15
   Jordà et al. (2013) use local projection methods to condition on a broad set of macroeco-
nomic controls when studying how past credit accumulation affects key macroeconomic
variables. Here we study the path of output and prices conditional on a change in LTV
limits and macroeconomic controls. We denote the dependent variables, real output and
the price level of country i at time t, by yi,t . ∆h yi,t = yi,t+h − yi,t denotes our response
variable of interest, the change in real output or in the price level between base quarter
t and quarter t + h over varying prediction horizons h = 1, 2, ..., H, where H is 16 in our
specifications. We are interested in the response of this variable to a perturbation in our
measure of macroprudential policy ∆MaPPi,t . Specifically, we estimate

                                                         4
                  ∆h yi,t = αih + γth + βh ∆MaPPi,t +   ∑ φkh ∆Xi,t−k + ei,t+h ,           (1)
                                                        k =0

for h = 1, ..., 16. ∆MaPPi,t denotes changes in macroprudential policy, here the regulatory
LTV limit, implemented in country i and quarter t.
   In various robustness tests we vary this treatment variable ∆MaPPi,t in a number of
ways. We first present the results based on the intensity-adjusted variable described in the
data section (∆MaPPi,t ) to assess the impact of a one percentage point change in LTV limits.
In the following specification we replace ∆MaPPi,t with an index to connect to the existing
literature, assigning a value of 1 to a tightening action in LTV limits, a value of −1 to a
loosening action and zero if there is no action. We denote this variable by ∆MaPPi,t
                                                                                  Index . We

also show results for tightenings (positive values of ∆MaPPi,t ) and loosenings (negative
values) separately. We include a rich set of covariates in each specification. These include
country dummies to control for country-specific growth rates αih as well as time-fixed effects
γth to control for global trends. Xi,t is a vector that contains the GDP growth, inflation and
policy rate changes.


4.1.   Main results
We start with our baseline specification, and include the intensity-adjusted LTV change
variable ∆MaPPi,t , which refers to the percentage point change in regulatory maximum
LTV ratios between t − 1 and t constructed as described earlier in the data section. The
results of estimating Equation 1 using the numerical measure of ∆MaPPi,t are visualised
in Figure 2. The two panels display the cumulative responses of output and of the price
level to a one percentage point change in the maximum LTV ratio over the following 16
quarters. Note that we define ∆MaPPi,t such that a positive value refers to a tightening
in macroprudential policies. A value of ∆MaPPi,t = 10 refers to a 10 percentage point
decrease in the regulatory maximum LTV ratio, for example a tightening from 80% to 70%.

                                              16
      Figure 2 shows that the response to a one percentage point change in LTV limits is
a 0.05% lower real GDP after two years, which increases to a 0.11% loss after four years.
These results are rather imprecisely estimated: the coefficient is only significant for very
short horizons immediately after the LTV action is taken. As we will see later this effect
immediately after the implementation of a policy can be attributed to loosening actions
only. Consider again the tightening in the maximum LTV ratio by 10 percentage points
from 80% to 70%: our estimates correspond to 0.5% lower real GDP after 24 months and
1.1% lower real GDP after 48 months for this scenario.

a 1 percentage point change in maximum LTV ratios. Shaded areas refer to 1 standard deviation (dark) and 1.96 standard deviations
(light).


      The price response appears to be slightly positive, but insignificant at most horizons
and we caution against a structural interpretation of these rather imprecise estimates. The
“price puzzle” disappears once we drop LTV actions taken in Hong Kong around the Asian
crisis and the following deflationary period (see Figure A.3). The responses of GDP and
prices at different horizons are reported in Table 6. To get a sense for the magnitude of the
effects, we will compare our results to existing estimates for the effects of monetary policy
shocks below.

    LTV actions are sometimes taken in combination with other macroprudential policies.
Such correlated treatments could bias our results. To address this concern, we control
for regulatory changes affecting debt service-to-income ratios, risk weights and reserve
requirements. We furthermore add four lags of changes in the credit-to-GDP ratio, the
current-account-to-GDP ratio and foreign currency lending as a proxy of cross-border credit.
We do not include these control variables in our baseline specification as the number of
observations is reduced by 15%. The results shown in Figure 3 are in line with our previous
findings. The output response is a bit stronger than in the baseline specification (–0.17
instead of –0.11 after 16 quarters). The response of the price level is similar to the baseline
specification and close to zero after 16 quarters.
    Another concern could the potential interaction between macroprudential and monetary
policy: if monetary policy reacts to the positive price effects of LTV changes, the contrac-
tionary effects we find might be due to monetary policy actions. In the regressions we
control for changes in policy rates, but we also analysed the responses of policy rates to a
change in LTV limits and did not find evidence for a systematic response.
    Figure A.6 in the appendix shows that the response of real consumption is similar to the
response of GDP. The coefficient is also estimated rather imprecisely, fluctuating around
–0.1, in line with our estimate for the path of real GDP. In the following subsections we will
vary the treatment variable in the baseline specification in a number of ways.

4.2.      Index variable specification
We now assess the average effects of changes in LTV limits on real economic output and
the price level. To connect to the existing literature on macroprudential policies that has
focused on changes in macroprudential policy expressed as binary or index variables, we
estimate our baseline specification, including the index variable and the set of control
variables described earlier. This boils down to the following expression

                                                                                4
                        ∆h yi,t = αih + γth + βh ∆MaPPi,t
                                                       Index
                                                             +                 ∑ φkh ∆Xi,t−k + ei,t+h ,
                                                                               k =0

for h = 1, ..., 16. The results are displayed in Figure 4 and show that this typical LTV action
has insignificant contractionary effects on real GDP, while there is almost no effect on the
price level. The coefficients for various horizons are displayed in Table 7. Increasing our
index variable by 1, which corresponds to varying it from no action to a tightening action,
lowers real GDP by 1.52% after 16 quarters. This response is again rather imprecisely
estimated and not significant as indicated by the shaded area in light grey referring to
1.96 standard deviations. Comparing this result to the coefficient using the numerical
value shows that the index specification overestimates the strength of the output effects:
the average size of the change in the quantified LTV variable in this sample is around 7.5
percentage points and hence the effect in the index specification is almost twice as high as
in the baseline results. The response of the price level is closer to zero over all horizons h.

                                                                  20
4.3.   The effects of tightening and loosening actions
The negative coefficient for ∆MaPPi,t suggests that there are small negative spillovers to the
real economy from tightening macroprudential policies. Importantly, this applies to policies
specifically targeting the financial cycle. The result could also be interpreted such that loose
macroprudential policies may be used to stimulate output. To distinguish between the two
domains of policy-making, we analyse whether there is a systematic difference between the
responses to the quantified LTV tightening and loosening actions. To do so, we include the
quantified LTV change in tightening and loosening actions separately. Let us define two
variables as follows:
                                        
                                        ∆MaPP           if ∆MaPPi,t > 0
                                                   i,t
                        ∆>0 MaPPi,t =
                                        0               if ∆MaPPi,t ≤ 0.

   Hence, ∆>0 MaPPi,t measures the size of a tightening action only. ∆<0 MaPPi,t is the
loosening analogue:
                                        
                                        ∆MaPP           if ∆MaPPi,t < 0
                                                   i,t
                        ∆<0 MaPPi,t =
                                        0               if ∆MaPPi,t ≥ 0.

   We can add these two variables to the baseline specification:

                                                                    4
        ∆h yi,t = αih + γth + βh ∆>0 MaPPi,t + κ h ∆<0 MaPPi,t +   ∑ φkh ∆Xi,t−k + ei,t+h ,   (2)
                                                                   k =0

for h = 1, ..., 16. In Equation 2, βh denotes the coefficient on changes in maximum LTV ratios
in the positive domain and κ h in the negative domain. Remember that our MaPP variable
is defined such that tightenings in policy are associated with a positive value of ∆MaPPi,t .
Hence, the βh coefficient refers to the effect of a one percentage point lower maximum
LTV ratio when a tightening action is implemented, while κ h refers to the effect of a one
percentage point higher maximum LTV ratio when a loosening action is implemented.
Hence, the baseline estimates are a weighted average of these two estimates.
   The results are displayed separately in Figure 5 and Figure 6. The responses of output
displayed on the left-hand panels in these figures show a difference between a one percent-
age point tightening and loosening LTV actions. In particular, the average slightly negative
response displayed in the first seven quarters is mainly driven by loosening actions and
the response after eight quarters is mainly driven by tightening actions. The price level
increases slightly as a reaction to a tightening action, while it shows almost no response to
a loosening action. These findings from the visual inspection are confirmed in Table 8.

4.4.     Robustness
In this section we check the robustness of our results in a number of subsamples. In
particular, we investigate whether the results differ across subsamples of our data. As
described earlier, macroprudential policies increasingly received attention after the global
financial crisis and this is also true for policies implementing LTV limits. To rule out that
results are driven by some characteristics associated with the post-2007 period, we test
whether our results also hold in a pre-2007 subsample. We therefore run our baseline local
projection using the quantified LTV changes only for policies implemented until 2006. As
shown in Figure 7, in this subsample the responses of GDP and prices to a change in the
maximum LTV ratio look very similar to the full sample results. The negative response of
output is slightly stronger at longer horizons in this sample than in the full sample.
    We also ensure that our results are not driven by a single country. We therefore report
in the appendix specifications where we drop, one by one, China, Hong Kong SAR and
Iceland from our sample. In our sample, these are the countries that have used LTV policies
most frequently in EMEs and AEs, respectively. Figure A.3, Figure A.4 and Figure A.5
show that we obtain consistent results when we exclude these economies one by one.
    Morover, we test if the efficacy of macro-prudential policies differs between countries
at various development stages. We address this possibility in our next test and run our

baseline specification for subsamples of EMEs and AEs separately. Our sample contains 23
AEs and 33 EMEs, using the BIS classification of economies.
    Figure 8 and Figure 9 show that the responses of output and prices indeed depend
on the development stage. The negative output response is entirely driven by EMEs (see
Figure 9). In these countries the response is negative at all horizons and this result is
statistically significant in the first two years after the policy is implemented. In the sample
of AEs (see Figure 8) the response of GDP is very close to zero at all horizons. The price
level also displays heterogeneous responses between the two groups. While the response of
the price level is small and mostly insignificant in both cases, the pattern differs: the price
level first increases slightly in EMEs and returns to zero, while it decreases in AEs first and
becomes slightly positive after two years. These results indicate that the costs of using LTV
limits are smaller for AEs. One possible channel for these differences could be that policies
are better calibrated to desired targets in AEs and hence do not trigger a misallocation of
credit.
    In addition, we report here the results of using the scope-unadjusted measure for
changes in LTV limits. As explained in the data section, we adjusted the size of LTV limit
changes for the scope of policies implemented. In this test we assume all changes in LTV
limits affect all types of credit and hence no adjustment for scope is necessary. Figure 10

shows the results for our baseline specification using this approach: the coefficients are
even smaller, although more precisely estimated.
   The appendix shows the results of additional tests: responses over a 30-quarter horizon
(Figure A.7) and responses in boom (GDP above trend) and slump (GDP below trend)
subsamples. We show in Figure A.8 and Figure A.9 that the immediate negative response
of output is driven by slump periods, while the negative output response in the long run
is driven almost entirely by actions taken in a boom. We also analyse separately the set
of actions that are intended to moderate the financial cycle and are not intended to foster
resilience. We classify actions as targeted at moderating the financial cycle if the stated
objectives refer to the growth of house prices, total credit, housing/household credit and
FX borrowing. Figure A.10 shows that the output effects of such actions are initially a bit
stronger than in the baseline, but remain stable after eight quarters.
   In all our specifications we use the implementation dates of changed policies. Usually,
the announcement of a policy and its implementation fall into the same quarter. We did,
however, check whether our results change if we employ announcement dates rather than
implementation dates in the analysis. In total, six actions were affected. In two cases the
announcement was in the last week of a quarter. Therefore we assume there was no time for
economic actors to adjust their behaviour in this quarter. We then use the announcement
quarter rather than the implementation quarter for the other four changes. The results for
the baseline specification are also shown in the appendix (Figure A.11), and there is no
visible change compared to the results based on the implementation quarter.


4.5.      Comparing LTV changes with monetary policy
Our data on the size of LTV changes also allow us to compare the effects of quantified
LTV changes to those of monetary policy. Table 9 displays estimates of the response of real
output to a 100 basis point increase in policy rates found in several studies. In particular, we
present estimates based on a narrative identification approach (Romer and Romer (2004)),
estimates based on high-frequency identification (Gertler and Karadi (2015)) and estimates
that are obtained by exploiting the open-economy trilemma for identification (Jordà et al.
(2017)). Furthermore, we report the state-dependent effects analysed in Tenreyro and
Thwaites (2016).6
   We compare our estimates of the effects of LTV limit changes with those of monetary
policy. We do this based on the following question: what is the monetary policy adjustment
that yields the same output response as a 10 percentage point LTV limit change? In our
baseline regression, the estimated response to this change after two years is –0.5%.

      Notes: the table reports estimates of the output effects of a 100 basis point increase in policy rates/short term interest rates.



    This response would correspond to a change of 12 basis points in the policy rate based
on the results reported in Romer and Romer (2004). Based on a high frequency identification
procedure, Gertler and Karadi (2015) find smaller effects and our estimate of a 10 percentage
point LTV limit tightening would correspond to a change of around 42 basis points in the
federal funds rate. In another study, Jordà et al. (2017) estimate the response of real GDP to
short-term interest rates and find an effect of –1.9% after two years. This estimate is most
likely the best comparison for our purpose, as it is also based on local projections using an
international panel dataset. Here, our estimated response of real GDP corresponds to a 26
basis point interest rate change, falling in the middle of the range between the other results.
    What do we learn from this exercise? A monetary policy shock of 26 basis points is
certainly not negligible, but our estimates are rather imprecise compared to those identified


                                                                    27
in the literature on monetary policy shocks. Tenreyro and Thwaites (2016) and Jordà
et al. (2017) show that the output costs of monetary policy are much higher in the boom
than in the slump. We show in the appendix that these effects are very similar for LTV
changes. There seems to be little room for policy-makers to exploit state dependence of the
effects when choosing between monetary and macroprudential policies. The good news
for policy-makers is that the output response to a change in LTV limits is attenuated in
the sample of AEs. Here the output costs seem rather low, while the costs of interest rate
policies discussed above applied almost exclusively to the United States or a sample of AEs.


                     5.    The effects on financial variables

What are the benefits of macroprudential tightenings? The previous section has shown
that tightenings in LTV limits are associated with modest output costs, but the cost-
benefit tradeoff of implementing macroprudential policies also depends on the efficacy
of macroprudential policies to dampen the financial cycle. In this section we therefore
analyse the responses of real household and mortgage credit and of asset prices to a
tightening in the maximum LTV ratio. To answer the question, we cannot rely on the same
identification strategy we used to assess the output costs. As we previously have argued,
the objectives of LTV limit changes are mostly related to the financial cycle and policies are
often implemented to affect credit variables. We therefore need to approach this question
using a different identification strategy.
   To estimate the response to a tightening action in LTV limits, which is the treatment, we
employ an inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimator. The IPW estimator gives more
weight to those treatments that are difficult to predict based on observables and less weight
to those instances that are endogenous due to the other factors. Jordà et al. (2016) use the
local projections weighted by the inverse propensity score for the probability of observing a
financial crisis driven recession rather than a normal recession. Other applications study
the response to sovereign defaults (Kuvshinov and Zimmermann (2016)) and austerity
(Jordà and Taylor (2016)).
   We use the IPW estimator to analyse the responses of financial variables to a tightening
in LTV limits. Let di,t be the tightening dummy that takes value one if ∆MaPPi,t > 0 and
zero otherwise. The estimation proceeds in two stages. In a first step, we specify a logit
model to estimate the probability that LTV limits are tightened

   Zi,t−1 is a vector of macroeconomic controls at time t − 1, where we include smoothed
four-quarter changes in real and financial variables. In addition, we include country-fixed
effects to account for country-specific usage of LTV policies. We refer to the probability
of a tightening as the propensity score and its estimate from Equation 3 is denoted by p̂i,t .
In the second stage, we estimate local projections using regression weights given by the
inverse of p̂i,t . Weighting by the inverse of the propensity score puts more weight on those
observations that were difficult to predict and thereby re-randomises the treatment. In
our application, this implies putting more weight on regulatory LTV tightenings that were
taken as a surprise based on observables, and putting less weight on those tightenings that
could be predicted.
   ∆h yi,t now denotes the change in financial variables between time t and t + h. To
implement the second stage, we run the following specification using weighted least
squares (WLS)

                                                 4                      4
              ∆h yi,t = αih + γth + Λh di,t +   ∑      φkh ∆Xi,t−k +   ∑ κkh ∆yi,t−k + ei,t+h .   (4)
                                                k =0                   k =1

   The weights are defined by wi,t = di,t / p̂i,t + (1 − di,t )/(1 − p̂i,t ), where we truncate
wi,t at 10. In this specification, we include the baseline set of controls from our previous
exercises and lagged changes in the response variable. Further details on the methodology
can be found in Jordà et al. (2016).


5.1.   Credit responses
We first apply this procedure to estimate the response of credit variables targeted by LTV
limits. These targeted variables are normally household credit and mortgage credit. Table 10
presents the results of our first stage. We run logit classification models for the tightening
dummy ∆ Tight MaPPi,t as we want to account for increases in financial variables presumably
targeted by tightening actions. Hence, we include in this regression the smoothed growth
rates over the previous four quarters of detrended GDP and the detrended price level.
Furthermore, we include the growth rate of real credit variables and the real stock price
index over the previous four quarters in the regression as well as country-fixed effects.
Credit variables, and here particularly the growth rate of total real private credit, emerge
as the best predictors of a tightening action in LTV limits. The number of observations
is reduced to 437, which is due to country fixed effects, because not all countries in our
sample introduced an LTV tightening during our sample period. Furthermore, housing and
mortgage credit data are available only for a subset of our observations. We report the AUC
statistics which stands for area under the receiver operating curve. The statistic measures

                                                       29
the ability of a model to correctly sort observations into the ”tightening” and ”no tightening”
bins as combinations of true positive and false positive rates that result from changing
the threshold variable for classification. In other words, it yields a summary measure of
predictive ability that is independent of individual cut-off values chosen. The AUC takes
on the value of 1 for perfect classification ability and 0.5 for an uninformed classifier or the
results of a ’coin toss’. Here the AUC is 0.77 which is a significant improvement over the
coin toss.

    Figure A.1 in the appendix plots the estimated probabilities of treatment based on
the first stage, differentiating between treated units (red) and control units (blue). Our
procedure in the second-stage regression now assigns a higher weight to the treated
observations that were less likely to be treated based on this analysis, i.e. those observations
with very low probabilities. Figure 11 presents the results of these inverse propensity
weighted local projections. We find that a tightening action in maximum LTV ratios
decreases credit variables as intended. Real household credit is reduced by almost 6% after
two years and mortgage credit by more than 5%. Both coefficients are statistically significant.

The coefficients remain stable for longer time horizons, while confidence intervals widen
and, as a result, the effects are no longer significant after four years. These results are in line
with a number of recent studies that find negative effects of macroprudential tightenings
on credit. Remember that the number of observations is reduced in this set-up, as we use


                                                                   31
a large set of fixed effects and covariates in the first stage logit regression to predict the
treatment probabilities. Figure A.12 shows that conditional estimates, which do not employ
an IPW estimator, display a stronger decline in credit. We also analysed the response of
total domestic bank credit (deflated with the CPI). Similar to the findings in Akinci and
Olmstead-Rumsey (2018), we do not find a significant response of total bank credit.


5.2.      Asset prices
In addition to the effect of LTV tightenings on credit variables, we assess the effect of these
measures on asset prices; here we focus on stock prices and house prices. The first stage
is again a logit classification model for the tightening dummy. We use a similar set of
predictors as in the previous set-up, but replace household and mortgage credit by real
house price growth, which is also only available for a subset of observations. Figure A.2
in the appendix plots the estimated probabilities of treatment between treated units (red)
and control units (blue). Table 12 presents the results of this approach. In line with the
first stage for credit variables, we find that real growth of private credit is a driver of the
probability of an LTV limit tightening being enacted.

Notes: The solid blue lines display the coefficients of cumulative responses of real stock and house price indices over the 16 quarters
following a tightening in maximum LTV ratios. The grey areas display one (dark) and 1.96 (light) standard deviation intervals.



     Table 13, Figure 12 and Figure A.13 present the results of this exercise. We see that both,
real stock and house prices, initially fall after a tightening action has been implemented.
There is strong heterogeneity in the response of stock prices as displayed in the left-hand
panel. While the coefficient is negative and large, the confidence intervals are wide and,
as a result, this negative effect is insignificant. The response of real house prices is quite
different. Here, the confidence intervals are rather small and the negative effect becomes
significant after two years. The coefficient further declines the longer the horizon, reaching
a highly significant 8% decline in real house prices after four years. This result is in line
with many findings in the literature as well as the targeted nature of LTV limits. As we
have seen from analysing the response of credit variables, LTV actions seem to be effective
in reducing mortgage credit and they also dampen house prices.


                                                    6.     Conclusion

This paper uses a narrative identification approach to determine the causal effect of changes
in maximum LTV ratios, an important element of the macroprudential toolkit, on output
and inflation. Our main objective is to understand to what extent, if at all, macroprudential

changes in maximum LTV ratios for a sample of advanced and emerging market economies.
     Our main result is that changes in maximum LTV ratios appear to have relatively modest
effects on output and inflation. The output effects tend to be imprecisely estimated and
small in advanced economies. After employing a number of different specifications and
a battery of robustness tests, we show that our results point to more sizeable effects of
LTV tightening than loosening, as well as to consistently larger effects in emerging market
economies. The effects of LTV changes on inflation tend to be negligible. As a rule of
thumb, over a two-year horizon the mean output effect of a 10 percentage point change in
maximum LTV ratios corresponds roughly to that of a 25 basis point change in policy rates,
but the standard errors are large. Using inverse propensity weighting methods to mimic
random allocation of the LTV treatment, we also provide evidence that LTV changes have
substantial effects on credit growth and house prices.
     This paper contains several potentially important implications for policy makers. First,
our results suggest that central banks in advanced economies could be in a position to
use macroprudential instruments to manage financial booms without interfering with the
monetary policy objectives in a major way. Second, the use of a scope-adjusted quantified
LTV change variable in this paper makes first inroads towards calibrating macroprudential
tools. Finally, the evidence in this paper demonstrates that changes in maximum LTV ratios
introduced under financial objectives tend to have rather substantial effects on activity in
credit markets and house prices as intended.
