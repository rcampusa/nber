                                          ABSTRACT

As a way of slowing COVID-19 transmission, many countries and U.S. states implemented
shelter-in-place (SIP) policies. However, the effects of SIP policies on public health are a priori
ambiguous as they might have unintended adverse effects on health. The effect of SIP policies on
COVID-19 transmission and physical mobility is mixed. To understand the net effects of SIP
policies, we measure the change in excess deaths following the implementation of SIP policies in
43 countries and all U.S. states. We use an event study framework to quantify changes in the
number of excess deaths after the implementation of a SIP policy. We find that following the
implementation of SIP policies, excess mortality increases. The increase in excess mortality is
statistically significant in the immediate weeks following SIP implementation for the
international comparison only and occurs despite the fact that there was a decline in the number
of excess deaths prior to the implementation of the policy. At the U.S. state-level, excess
mortality increases in the immediate weeks following SIP introduction and then trends below
zero following 20 weeks of SIP implementation. We failed to find that countries or U.S. states
that implemented SIP policies earlier, and in which SIP policies had longer to operate, had lower
excess deaths than countries/U.S. states that were slower to implement SIP policies. We also
failed to observe differences in excess death trends before and after the implementation of SIP
policies based on pre-SIP COVID-19 death rates.

1. INTRODUCTION

    The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented policy response from public health

officials and governments. As of May 8, 2021, approximately 3.2 million deaths worldwide and

581,000 deaths in the United States were attributed to COVID-19 (Johns Hopkins Coronavirus

Resource Center 2021). To slow COVID-19 transmission, many countries and United States

localities implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), one of the most common of

which is "shelter-in-place" (SIP) policies. These policies are designed to reduce COVID-19

transmission by restricting non-essential mobility.

    Conceptually, the impact of SIP policies on public health is ambiguous and complex. The

effect of SIP policies depends on both behavioral responses and the efficacy of behavioral

responses in averting COVID-19 transmission. Early evidence suggests that SIP policies slowed

COVID-19 transmission early in the pandemic in the United States (Courtemanche et al. 2020)

and globally (Ge et al. 2021). However, more recent studies suggest that individuals changed

behavior in response to the severity of the pandemic and the enactment of SIP policy

implementation lagged this individual behavior change. While social distancing is an important

mechanism to avoid COVID-19 spread, the studies that use mobility tracking data find only

modest additional social distancing responses following SIP policies (Cantor et al. 2020; Berry et

al. 2021; Askitas, Tatsiramos, and Verheyden 2021; Xu 2021; Nguyen et al. 2020). Individuals

concerned about COVID-19 risk may change behavior even in the absence of regulations or

shelter-in-place advisories. Thus, it is unclear how much change in COVID-19 risk mitigation is

due to formal SIP policies, compared to risk mitigation that would have occurred in the absence

of these policies.




                                                                                                  2
   At the same time, even if SIP policies reduce COVID-19 transmission, their impact on

overall health is unclear, as SIP policies likely have several important unintended consequences

(Correia, Luck, and Verner 2020). SIP policies might lead to unemployment or reduced

economic activity (S. Chen et al. 2020). SIP policies may increase stress and anxiety due to

social isolation (Xie et al. 2020; Patrick et al. 2020), potentially leading to increased substance

use and suicides (Mason et al. 2021; Holland et al. 2021). Reduced physical mobility may have

also caused increases in child abuse and domestic violence (Leslie and Wilson 2020; Cappa and

Jijon 2021), which can adversely affect health in both the short and long run (Sonu, Post, and

Feinglass 2019). Recent work also suggests that SIP policies reduced use of high value non-

COVID care such as cancer screenings and vaccinations (Cantor et al. 2020; Whaley et al. 2020;

McBain et al. 2021). These complex effects suggest that SIP policies might reduce COVID-19

related mortality, but might also increase mortality from other causes. This naturally raises the

question: What is the impact of SIP policies on all-cause mortality?

   In this paper, we examine the impacts of SIP policies, both internationally at the country-

level and in the U.S. at the state-level on excess mortality. A key measure of all-cause mortality

is excess deaths, which compares deaths from all causes in a given geography at a given point in

time to expected deaths from all causes based on historical data (Krelle, Barclay, and Tallack

2020). Using excess deaths as a key outcome captures both potential reductions in COVID-19

deaths and potential increases in non-COVID deaths. Using excess deaths, rather than confirmed

COVID-19 deaths, also alleviates concerns about the accurate classification of COVID-19

deaths. While emerging evidence, summarized below, has documented increases in excess deaths

during the pandemic, the existing literature has not systematically examined the role of SIP




                                                                                                      3
policies in averting or contributing to excess deaths. Further, no studies have compared the

impact of SIP policies between countries and compared these impacts within U.S. states.

   To do so, we use data from 43 countries that implemented SIP policies and all 50 U.S. states.

We estimate the effect of SIP policies using an event study approach. We also examine the

change in excess deaths following the introduction of SIP policies separately for each country

and U.S. state. We also compare differences in excess mortality based on the timing of SIP

policy implementation.

   In both settings, we fail to find that SIP policies saved lives. To the contrary, we find a

positive association between SIP policies and excess deaths. We find that following the

implementation of SIP policies, excess mortality increases. The increase in excess mortality is

statistically significant in the immediate weeks following SIP implementation for the

international comparison only. At the U.S. state-level, excess mortality increases in the

immediate weeks following SIP implementation and then trends below zero following 20 weeks

of SIP implementation.

   It is possible that the timing of SIP policies is endogenous. For example, if SIP were

implemented when excess deaths were rising then the results from the event study would be

biased towards finding that SIP policies lead to excess deaths. However, we find the opposite:

countries that implemented SIP policies experienced a decline in excess mortality prior to

implementation compared to countries that did not implement SIP policies. We find no pre-

existing trends in excess mortality prior to implementation of SIP policies in U.S. states.

   It is also possible that the average effects in our event studies might hide heterogeneity in the

impact of policies across countries and U.S. states. For example, SIP policies might be more

effective when implemented early in the pandemic or SIP policies might work better when




                                                                                                   4
community transmission is high. Therefore, we estimated separate event studies for each country

or U.S. state and separate event studies for groups of countries and states with high COVID-19

transmission in the two weeks prior to the implementation of the SIP policy. Overall, we find

little evidence of heterogenous effects except that SIP policies seem to be more effective in

island nations or the island U.S. state of Hawaii.

   The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. We first review the prior literature on SIP policies

and health outcomes. Next, we present the data on SIP polices and excess deaths and methods for

estimating the impact of SIP policies on excess deaths. Finally, we discuss results, limitations

and implications for public policy, and future research.



2. LITERATURE REVIEW

   This study adds to a growing literature that has examined the effect of NPIs on the number of

COVID-19 cases, deaths, and social distancing behaviors. Some existing studies have used

cellular phone mobility tracking and have found that the implementation of SIP policies leads to

small changes in mobility with weaker effects on mobility in the U.S. compared to Europe

(Berry et al. 2021; Singh et al. 2021; Askitas, Tatsiramos, and Verheyden 2021; Xu 2021).

Within the U.S. context, there were important differences based on income, with larger increases

in physical distancing for individuals in high-income neighborhoods than individuals in low-

income neighborhoods (Jay et al. 2020; Singh et al. 2021).

   Studies have also estimated the impacts of SIP policies on COVID-19 cases and deaths.

Berry et al. (2021) finds that implementation of SIP policies did not lead to reductions in new

COVID-19 cases or deaths, while Singh et al. (2021) finds that SIP policies reduce COVID-19

cases by 163 cases per 100,000.




                                                                                                     5
   At the same time, recent work predicts that the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated

economic recession may lead to a significant increase in the number of deaths of despair in the

U.S. (Mulligan 2020). These deaths of despair are due to economic stagnation and social

isolation associated with the pandemic and include deaths due to causes such as suicide and

substance use disorder (Petterson, Westfall, and Miller 2020). Within the U.S. the number of

drug overdoses, unintentional injuries, and homicides increased between March and August 2020

(Faust et al. 2021).

   Prior research also documents disparities in the impact of the pandemic on health. In

California specifically, there was a large increase in the number of excess deaths for Latino and

Black residents, those without a high school degree, and younger adults. Increased excess deaths

for these populations may be due to occupational exposure, crowded housing, and inadequate

access to testing or treatment (Y.H. Chen et al. 2020). Similarly, Krieger et al. (2020) used data

for zip code tabulation areas (ZCTA) in Massachusetts to conclude that the mortality rate during

the peak of the pandemic was higher for areas that are poorer, denser, racially segregated, and

have a higher share of minority race individuals (Krieger, Waterman, and Chen 2020). Other

U.S. studies have examined excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic and find 87,000

excess deaths between March and August 2020, with COVID-19 responsible for 67 percent of

these deaths (Woolf et al. 2020). By the end of the year, the authors revisit their findings and

conclude that in 2020 there were 522,368 excess deaths, and that the number of excess deaths

was higher for non-Hispanic Black than non-Hispanic White or Hispanic populations (Woolf et

al. 2021). Relatedly, a different study used Social Security data and finds that excess all-cause

mortality was highest in Black people and lowest for White people. There was also significant

variation by state in the disparities of excess death by race (Polyakova et al. 2021). Finally, a




                                                                                                     6
U.S. study using mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System found that the largest

increases in excess death by October 2020 were found for those between the ages of 25 and 44

and among Hispanic or Latino persons (Rossen et al. 2020).

   Outside of the U.S., other studies have found increases in excess mortality of 61 percent in

Spain, 56 percent in the United Kingdom, and five percent or lower in Germany, Denmark, and

Norway (Morgan et al. 2020). Other work finds increases in excess deaths in England, Wales,

France, Italy, Netherlands, and Portugal (Félix-Cardoso et al. 2020). Aleman et al. 2020

estimates the effects of Spain's national lockdown by comparing deaths in Madrid (which was in

a later stage of the pandemic) to other parts of Spain one week after implementation of lockdown

(Aleman et al. 2020). They find that during this one-week period the lock down led to a 19%

reduction in deaths. Similarly, Ciminelli and Garcia-Mandico (2020) find that the effects of

Italy's national shutdown on deaths varied with the share of essential businesses in different

municipalities, with municipalities with a lower share of essential businesses experiencing a

decline in deaths after the lockdown relative to municipalities with a higher share of essential

businesses (Ciminelli and Garcia-Mandico 2020).



3. DATA


3.1. Data on Social Distancing Policies

   To measure the impact of state-level SIP or Stay-at-Home requirement policies, we use data

from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), Blavatnik School of

Government for both national-level country data (Hale et al. 2021), and U.S. state-level data

(Hale et al. 2020). Related work has used eleven categorical variables from the OxCGRT dataset

to estimate the impact of containment and closure interventions on COVID-19 transmission



                                                                                                   7
across countries, and found none of the interventions had a statistically significant effect

(Rannan-Eliya et al. 2021). The data contains information on 16 indicators of government

response that are publicly available; however, for our analysis we used the SIP indicator

recorded for each day. It is an ordinal index scaled from zero to three. A value of zero indicates

no measures, one indicates recommended not leaving house; two indicates required not leaving

house with exceptions for daily exercise, grocery shopping, and essential trips; and three

indicates required not leaving house with minimal exceptions--for example, leave only once a

week, etc. We average the daily SIP order value for the seven days of a week to create a weekly

SIP value for each week. The SIP indicator for the week is assigned a value of 0 if the daily

average SIP value for that week is less than 0.5 and the SIP indicator for the week is assigned a

value of 1 if the daily average SIP value for that week is greater than equal to 0.5.


3.2. Deaths Data


3.2.1. Country: National-level Weekly Excess Deaths

   The data on the national-level weekly death for each country is downloaded from the Our

World In Data (OWID) (Giattino et al. 2021). OWID uses all-cause mortality data from the

Human Mortality Database and the World Mortality Dataset. Excess deaths for each week of

2020 is the difference in total deaths in a given week of 2020 and the average of total deaths in

that week from 2015 to 2019.



   Excess Deaths (Week n, 2020) = Total Deaths (Week n, 2020) ­ Average Deaths (Week n, 2015 ­ 2019)



The full dataset contains 82 countries; however, only 43 countries have data available on total

deaths for each week of 2020. The remaining 39 countries have monthly data of total deaths that


                                                                                                       8
occurred in 2020. Therefore, in our study we focused on the 43 countries that have total deaths

data for each week of 2020 as this study analyzes the weekly trend.


3.2.2. Country: National-level Weekly Covid-19 Deaths

   We used the weekly COVID-19 death data to identify the week of first COVID-19 death for

our analysis. The data on COVID-19 deaths, which are a subset of the total deaths described

above, for countries are obtained from the OWID (Ritchie et al. 2020). The national-level

country dataset contains the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 on each day for 192

countries. We used data for 43 countries that we analyze for excess deaths and filtered out the

rest. With these data, the weekly deaths caused by COVID-19 in each country was calculated by

summing the daily COVID-19 deaths in seven days of each week.


3.2.3. U.S. States: State-level Weekly Excess Deaths and Weekly COVID-19 Deaths

   To capture the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic on total deaths in the U.S., we used

number of excess deaths for each state and the District of Columbia for each week of 2020 from

The Economist COVID-19 excess deaths tracker GitHub repository (The Economist 2020).

Moreover, we used the same dataset to identify the week of first COVID-19 death in each state.

The data for the U.S. are generated by The Economist using information from the Centers for

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USAFacts, and NYC Health. The data track the total

number of excess deaths in each state and the District of Columbia for each week.

    Lastly, as our unit of analysis is "excess deaths per 100,000 population," we calculated

excess deaths per 100,000 people for both country-level and U.S. state-level analysis. The data

on the population of each 43 countries in our study come from the same COVID-19 deaths

dataset obtained from OWID, and the data on the population of 50 U.S. states and the District of

Columbia are included in The Economist excess deaths dataset.


                                                                                                  9
4. ESTIMATION APPROACH


4.1. Effects of Social Distancing Policies on Excess Deaths

   This study analyzes the impact of the implementation of a SIP policy on excess deaths per

100,000 population at both the country-level and U.S. state-level. Using the data on COVID-19

deaths, we identified the week in which the first COVID-19 death occurred in each of the 43

countries in our study and in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Then, we calculated

the total excess deaths per 100,000 population in the 24 weeks (or 6 months) after the week of

first COVID-19 deaths in each country and U.S. state.

   We then measured the speed of the implementation of SIP policy and the length of the

implementation of SIP policy during our period of analysis, i.e. the 24 weeks after the first

COVID-19 death. To measure the speed of the implementation of SIP policy, we estimate the

number of weeks a country or a U.S. state took to implement the first SIP policy from the week

of first COVID-19 death. The duration or length of the implementation of the SIP policy was

measured as the number of weeks the SIP policy was in place from the week of first COVID-19

death in a given country or a U.S. state to 24 weeks after the first COVID-19 death.

   We start by descriptively estimating the association between excess deaths and speed of

implementation of SIP policies. To do so, we produce a scatter plot with the total number of

excess deaths per 100,000 population during the 24 weeks after the week of first COVID-19

death on the y-axis and speed of the implementation of SIP policy on the x-axis. We estimate

separate scatter plots for countries and for the U.S. states in our study. We similarly compare the

total number of excess deaths per 100,000 population during the 24 weeks after the first COVID-

19 death with the duration of implementation of SIP policy in 25 weeks, i.e., the week of first

COVID-19 death and 24 weeks from that first week.



                                                                                                  10
    Furthermore, to formally estimate the effect of SIP policy on excess deaths per 100,000 we

used an event study approach. For the U.S. analysis, we included state and week fixed effects.

For the international analysis, we used country and week fixed effects. We analyzed the pre- and

post-SIP implementation trends for excess deaths per 100,000 population. For each event study,

we estimated a regression model of the form:
                                                       

                       =  +   ( ) +   ( ) +  +  + 
                                 =2                   =1



    In this model, the outcome of interest Y is excess deaths per 100,000 population. Lags and

leads indicate that the given state is a number of weeks away from the time when the policy is

implemented. Lags represent the pre-treatment period, while the lead terms represent the post-

treatment period. The first lag period is chosen as the baseline period; hence it is omitted from

the model specification.  and  are unit (state or country) and week fixed effects, respectively.

Here, i represents a given unit, i.e., a country for the country-level analysis and a state for the

U.S. state-level analysis, t represents the week number, and  is the error term. We cluster

standard errors at the respective geographic unit (country or U.S. state).

    These event studies provide estimates of the mean effect of SIP policies on excess deaths.

However, there still may be differences in the effect of SIP policies based on the trajectory of the

COVID-19 pandemic. As an additional test, we examine differences based on COVID-19 death

rates in the two weeks prior to the implementation of a SIP policy. We categorize each country

or U.S. state as having COVID-19 deaths above or below the median rate in the two weeks prior

to the implementation of a SIP policy and separately estimate event studies for each

classification.




                                                                                                      11
5. RESULTS


5.1. Association Between SIP Policies and Excess Mortality

   Figure 1 compares excess deaths per 100,000 population (y-axis) against the number of

weeks each country/U.S. state took to implement the SIP policy following the first COVID-19

death in that country/U.S. state (x-axis). If SIP policies impact the trajectory of the COVID-19

pandemic, then regions that implement SIP policies sooner after initial exposure to the pandemic

are likely to experience lower deaths. When comparing across countries, we observe the

expected relationship. A one-week increase in the week in which a country implements a SIP

policy (i.e., a one-week delay in the implementation of a SIP policy), is associated with a 7.3

(95% CI: -1.2 to 15.9) increase in excess deaths per 100,000 population. When comparing

between U.S. states, we find the opposite relationship--a 0.4 (95% CI: -7.8 to 7.0) decrease, but

the association is small in magnitude and the confidence interval is large.

   Figure 2 presents similar descriptive evidence on the duration of the implementation of SIP

policies following the first COVID-19 death in each country/U.S. state, as measured by the

number of weeks with an active SIP policy in the 24 weeks post first COVID-19 death, and the

number of excess deaths per 100,000 population in that country/U.S. state. For each geography,

the figure plots the number of weeks between the implementation of SIP policies and excess

deaths per 100,000 population in the 24 weeks following the first COVID-19 death. If SIP

policies reduce excess deaths, then there should be a negative association between the length of

time a SIP policy has been implemented and cumulative deaths. However, when comparing

across countries, we observe a general upward trend, indicating that countries with a longer

duration of SIP policies are the ones with higher excess deaths per 100,000 residents in the 24

weeks following a COVID-19 death. Across countries, a one-week increase in the duration of



                                                                                                   12
SIP policies is associated with a 2.7 (95% CI: 1.1 to 4.3) increase in excess deaths per 100,000

population. In the U.S. comparison at the state-level, the association is smaller in magnitude and

the confidence interval overlaps with zero. A one-week increase in the duration of SIP policies is

associated with a 1.3 (95% CI: -0.5 to 3.1) increase in excess deaths per 100,000 population.

   These descriptive figures suggest that the implementation of SIP policies does not lead to

reductions in excess mortality. In fact, a positive association was observed both when accounting

for the expedience of the SIP implementation and the duration of SIP policies. However, while

suggestive, these figures are challenging to interpret causally. Countries and U.S. states

endogenously implement SIP policies in response to their exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, a variety of unobserved factors (e.g., political leanings, age structure, economic

stability, socioeconomic status, experience with prior pandemics, etc.) might influence the

decision to implement a SIP policy and also might be correlated with excess deaths.

   To more formally estimate the effects of SIP policies on excess deaths, event studies that

estimate trends in excess mortality before and after the implementation of SIP policies are

presented in Figure 3. For both the country (Panel A) and U.S. state (Panel B) comparison, we

find that following the implementation of SIP policies, excess mortality increases. The increase

in excess mortality is statistically significant in the immediate weeks following SIP

implementation for the international comparison. For the within-U.S. comparison, excess

mortality trends below zero following 20 weeks of SIP implementation.

   The results from the event study regression models suggest that difference in excess

mortality between countries that implemented SIP versus countries that did not implement SIP

was trending downwards in the weeks prior to SIP implementation. Had this pre-existing

difference in mortality trends continued, we would expect lower excess mortality in the weeks




                                                                                                   13
following SIP implementation in countries that implemented SIP policies relative to countries

that did not implement policies. However, we find that the pre-existing trend reversed following

implementation of SIP policies. This suggest that our estimates of the effects of SIP on excess

mortality are conservative as pre-existing trends are biased towards finding a protective effect of

SIP. We find no evidence of pre-existing differences in trends in excess mortality across U.S.

states prior to implementation of SIP. However, similar to international comparisons, we find

that SIP implementation was associated with an increase in excess mortality.

    In further analyses, results in the Appendix present additional event studies that separately

estimate the effects of SIP policies in each country/U.S. state. When comparing across countries,

the only countries in which we observe the introduction of SIP policies negatively changes the

trajectory of excess deaths are Australia, Malta, and New Zealand. All three countries are

islands. In every other country, we observe either no visual change in excess deaths or increases

in excess deaths. The results are similar for U.S. states. We observe small reductions in excess

deaths for Hawaii, which is also an island, following the implementation of a SIP policy. The

other U.S. states either show no change in excess deaths, or in many U.S. states, spikes in excess

deaths following the implementation of SIP policies. Further, we do not see that countries or

U.S. states that implemented SIP policies earlier, and thus in which SIP policies had more time

in effect, had lower excess deaths than countries/U.S. states that were slower to implement SIP

policies.

    Figure 4 presents results that separately estimate event studies for countries/states with pre-

SIP COVID-19 death rates below and above the median rates. For both the countries (Panel A)

and U.S. state (Panel B) comparisons, we do not observe differences in excess death trends

before and after the implementation of SIP policies based on pre-SIP COVID-19 death rates. In




                                                                                                    14
all four cases, we do not observe that the implementation of SIP policies leads to reductions in

excess deaths. This finding suggests that the effect of SIP policies is not differentially impacted

by the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic across regions.



6. DISCUSSION

   In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries implemented social distancing and

SIP policies. These policies are designed to slow COVID-19 transmission by limiting physical

interaction. While early U.S. and international evidence suggests that these policies did slow

COVID-19 transmission (Aleman et al. 2020; Courtemanche et al. 2020), the longer-run and

more comprehensive effects of these policies are not fully understood (Berry et al. 2021). We

used data from 43 countries and all U.S. states and find the introduction of SIP policies did not

lead to reductions in excess deaths.

   This study is not without limitations. First, how COVID-19 deaths are defined is not standard

across countries (Beaney et al. 2020). For this reason, we rely on total mortality, instead of

cause-specific mortality. However, total mortality can also suffer from measurement error. For

example, there could be a lag in registering deaths and upward revision of mortality data is

common in many countries. It is also possible that deaths are simply undercounted especially in

developing countries or rural areas due to lack of resources. Second, enforcement and

implementation of SIP policies could vary across countries or U.S. states and our main analysis

does not implement heterogenous treatment effects--although the country by country and state

by state event studies suggest that the findings were qualitatively similar other than for a few

island countries and Hawaii. For this reason, we emphasize that our results should be interpreted

using an intent-to-treat framework. We do not estimate the effect of "ideal" SIP policies or of

improved compliance with SIP policies, but rather evaluate the "real world" impact of SIP


                                                                                                    15
policies that were implemented. Third, it is possible that SIP policies were implemented with

other policies related to the pandemic and we cannot completely isolate the causal effects of SIP

policies. Finally, the counterfactual trajectory of the pandemic in the absence of SIP policies is

difficult to estimate and might vary across countries and states, which could bias estimates.

However, we do not find differences in the impact of SIP policies based on the trajectory of the

COVID-19 pandemic when policies were implemented.

   Nonetheless, the implementation of SIP policies does not appear to have met the aim of

reducing excess mortality. There are several potential explanations for this finding. First, it is

possible that SIP policies do not slow COVID-19 transmission. As discussed earlier, prior

studies find only a modest effect of SIP policies on mobility. A potential reason for the modest

impact on mobility may be that individuals change behavior to avoid COVID-19 risk even in the

absence of SIP policies. It is also unclear whether modest reductions in mobility could slow the

spread of an airborne pathogen. Second, it is possible that SIP policies increased deaths of

despair due to economic and social isolation effects of SIP policies. Recent estimates in the U.S

between March and August 2020 show that drug overdoses, homicides, and unintentional

injuries increased in 2020, while suicides declined (Faust et al. 2021). Third, existing studies

suggest that SIP policies led to a reduction in non-COVID-19 health care, which might have

contributed to an increase in non-COVID-19 deaths (Cantor et al. 2020; Ziedan, Simon, and

Wing 2020). For example, one study in the United Kingdom predicts that there will be

approximately an additional 3,000 deaths within five years due to a delay in diagnostics because

of the COVID-19 pandemic (Maringe et al. 2020).

   In light of this evidence, continued reliance on SIP policies to slow COVID-19 transmission

may not be optimal. Instead, the best policy response may be pharmaceutical interventions in the




                                                                                                     16
form of vaccinations and therapeutics when they become available. Early evidence suggests that

initial vaccination efforts have led to large reductions in COVID-19 incidence (Christie 2021; X.

Chen et al. 2021; Haas et al. 2021). Policy efforts to promote vaccination are thus likely to have

large positive impacts.

Figure 1: Total excess deaths per 100,000 population after 24 weeks from the first COVID-19
death, compared to number of weeks countries/states took to implement first SIP policy from the
week of first COVID-19 death
                                (A) International Comparison




Note: The above graph does not include Ireland, Taiwan and Norway because these countries did
not implement SIP in the period of our analysis, i.e., 24 weeks from the week of first COVID-19
death.
                                (B) United States Comparison




Note: The above graph does not include Arkansas and North Dakota because these two states did
not implement SIP in the period of our analysis, i.e., 24 weeks from the week of first COVID-19
death.
