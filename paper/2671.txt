1.   Introduction.

        This paper tests and confirms                     the existence       of a puzzling phenomenon-

the prices of raw commodities                     have a persistent tendency to move together.

We   find       that    this       co-movement          of prices        applies     to a       broad set of

commodities        that      are    largely       unrelated,       i.e.       for which the          cross-price

elasticities of demand and supply are close to zero.                                 Furthermore,        the co-

movement is well in excess of anything that can be explained by the common

effects       of inflation, or changes                  in aggregate       demand,     interest      rates,    and


exchange rates.

        Our    test     for      excess co-movement               is   also    a    test of the         standard

competitive model of commodity price formation with storage.                                    An innovative

aspect of our test, and one that distinguishes                                it from,    say, Eichenbaum's

(1983.     1984)       tests       of    finished goods           inventory     behavior under rational

expectations,          is   that we do not need data on inventory                        stocks.       Our     test

relies        instead       on     the     joint behavior of prices                   across     a     range    of

commodities,       and the          fact      that     those    prices    should only move together              in

response       Co common macroeconomic                 shocks.

        This excess           co-movement            casts     doubt     on   the    standard competitive

commodity       price model.              A possible explanation              for    it is that commodity

price     movements are             to     some      extent the        result of       "herd behavior in

financial        markets.               (8y    "herd"        behavior we       mean      that    traders       are

alternatively           bullish or bearish on                            commodities     for    no plausible

economic reason.)                  Indeed,       our    finding    would be of little surprise to

brokers,       traders,       and       others    who    deal    regularly      in the futures         and cash

markets, many of whom have held the common belief that commodity prices tend

to move together.                  Analyses of futures and commodity                     markets      issued by

brokerage firms, or that appear on the financial pages                                   of newspapers and
                                                  -2-
magazines,     refer to copper or oil or coffee prices rising because commodity
prices in genersl are rising, as though increases in those prices are caused
by or have the same causes as increases in wheat, cotton, and gold prices.
      To conclude that prices exhibit excess co-movement, we muat account for
the effects of any common macroeconomic                   shocks.     Current and expected future
valuea of macroeconomic variablea             auch as inflation,              industrial production,
etc., should have common effects on current and expected future demands                              (and
possibly supplies)          of commodities,          and hence         on current     prices.         For
example,      a rise    in interest       rates    should lower         commodity    prices;       higher
interest rates depress future aggregate demand and hence commodity demands,
and   raise    commodity       carrying   costs.      At issue         is whether the prices of
unrelated commodities           tend to move         together        after     accounting    for    these
macroeconomic     effects.       We find that they          do.
      The next section          discusses   our data set, and the nature of the price
torrelationa.          As we will see,            price     changes     are    correlated,     and the
correlations     are larger the longer the intervals                    across which the changes
are measured.          In Section 3 we try to explain these correlations                       using a
simple regression model.           We find that after allowing for the common effects
of current      and past values of economic                variables,        there is still a great
deal of       correlation      that remains.              One     possible     explanation    is    that
commodity     demands    and supplies are affected by unobserved forecasts of the
economic variables.         In Sections 4 and 5 we show how a latent variable model
can be used to          test    this   possibility.             We find that latent variables
representingunobserved forecasts of inflation and industrial production are
indeed significant         explanators      of commodity prices.                However,    even after
allowing for these latent variables, there is still excess co-movement left
                                               -3-
over.     Section     6 concludes     by discussing some limitations              of our analysis

and possible reasons for our findings.

2.   The Correlation of Commodity Prices.

        We study monthly price changes for seven commodities:                     wheat,     cotton,

copper,    gold, crude oil, lumber,           and cocoa.         This   is a broad spectrum of

commodities         that are    as    unrelated as         possible.        For   example,       the

agricultural        products   we have chosen are grow1             in different     climates    and

have     different uses.             None    of    the    commodities       are   substitutes     or

complements,        none are co-produced, and none is used as a major input for the

production of another.          Barring price movements           due to common macroeconomic

factors, we would expect these prices to be uncorrelated.1

        We use United States average monthly                 cash prices      from 1960 through

1985.     Ideally,      these data should correspond to a current price                 quotation

for immediate        delivery of a homogeneous           good.   However,    all commodities     are

at least somewhat heterogenous,             and delivery dates can vary.            We have tried

to obtain price data that reflect                 as closely as possible what sellers are

charging at the time for current delivery of a well-specified commodity.

Specific price series and data sources are listed in Appendix B.

        Table   1    shows   a correlation        matrix for the monthly          changes    in the

logarithms      of these prices.            Ten out of the 21 correlations             exceed    .1.


Gold shows strong correlations              with copper, crude oil, lumber, and cocoa;

cotton is also correlated             with copper,        lumber,   and wheat;     and lumber is

correlated with copper and cocoa.

        Are these correlations as a group statistically significant?                    To answer

this we can perform a likelihood ratio                    test of the hypothesis that the

correlation matrix is equal to the identity matrix.                      It is worth discussing

this test briefly because it is closely related to the tests we carry out in
                                                 -4-
later     sections      of the paper.         Consider      m    jointly normal random variablea
whose     theoretical        covariance       matrix       is    given by        S.      The     matrix S
incorporates       whatever restrictions are implied by the theory that is being
teated,     e.g.   ,    S   would be      a    diagonal matrix when the                  variables         are
uncorrelaced.          Denote by S the maximum likelihood estimate of 5, and let                             C)
be the actual covariance matrix of the variables.                           Then the likelihood of
the data under the theoretical restrictions                      is given by:
                                              -l
                                                0)
             L —       51-N/2-(N/2)tr(S                                                        (1)
where N is the number of observations.                      In the special case in which S                  ia
diagonal,    the elements       of S equal the corresponding                elements of 0, so that
tr(S0)       is    simply equal       to m.          The   likelihood      of the data absent any
restrictions       is given by (I), but with 0 substituted for S.
        In the case of s diagonal             covsriance         matrix,   the likelihood ratio is
          divided by the product of the variances,                     also to the N/2 power.              As
shown in Morrison (1967), this implies that the ratio of the restricted and
unrestricted likelihood              functions        is   A     —               where               is    the
                                                                      IRj'2,                RJ
determinant       of the correlation          matrix.           Our test statistic         is    therefore
-2logA,    which is distributed           as          with (l/2)p(p-l)           degrees   of freedom,
where p is the number of commodities.                       For      the seven    commodities         in our
sample, this statistic is 114.6.               With 21 degrees of freedom, this is highly
significant,       so we can easily reject the hypothesis that these commodity
prices are uncorrelsted.
        The correlations      of commodity price changes are much larger for longer
holding periods.            Tables   2   and 3 show correlations               for    (nonoverlspping)
quarterly and annual changes,                 respectively,          in the logarithms          of prices.
Observe that for annual changes, 19 out of 21 correlations                             exceed        .2.   As
the       statistics below each table show, as a group the correlations remain
                                                  -5-
significant      at the 1 percent level.            Nonetheless,       the significance level for

the quarterly and annual changes are lover than for the monthly ones.                             This

occurs because           there   are    many fewer        nonoverlapping yearly than monthly

observations.

        A better measure         f     the statistical      significance      of the quarterly     and

yearly correlations is obtained by using all of the available data,                              i.e.,

using overlapping observations.                  x2 statistics computed as above using all

overlapping      obaervations        give values of 194.9 for quarterly             differences    and

517.7    for    annual     differences.          These    statistics    are    not distributed      as

2(2l) because       the use of overlapping data introduces                 serial dependence.       We

therefore computed, via Monte Carlo, 15,000 draws of our test statistics,

-2log, under the null hypothesis that the monthly price changes are i.i.d.
and uncorrelated across commodities.                     The highest volumes that we drew for

these    statistics       were 121.3       for    quarterly    price    changes,     and 504.1     for

yearly price changes.            Thus these quarterly         and annual correlations       that we

observe are highly significant.

      Of course       these      correlations      might be due         to common macroeconomic

factors,       such as      changes      in current        or expected future         inflation     or

aggregate      demand.     In addition, macroeconomic           variables     may explain more of

the price movements          over longer horizons, which may account for the larger

correlations      that we find for longer holding periods.                       We explore      these

possibilities      below.

3.   The Exolanatorv Power of Current and Past Macroeconomic                       Variables.

      Commodity     prices may have common movements because                        of changes      in

macroeconomic      variables      that affect demands          and/or supplies for broad sets

of commodities.           These changes          can affect prices        in two ways.          First,

macroeconomic      variables may directly affect commodity demands and supplies.
                                                    -6-
For example, an increase in the rate of industrial production will raise the
demands     for industrial            commodities    such as copper,            lumber,    or crude oil
because     these    commodities        are used as inputs to production,                 and will raise
the demands       for non-industrial commodities                 such as cocos or wheat through
the resulting       increases         in income.
        Second,     macroeconomic variables                can    affect    commodity prices            by
affecting     expectations           about   future supplies and demands.             Commodities       are
storable,    so changing expectations about future market conditions influence
the     demand for        storage       and hence      current        prices.       This means       chat
unexpected changes               in    macroeconomic       variable which           are     useful      for
forecasting can have an immediate effect on commodity                           prices.     For example,
higher interest          rates       might. reduce capital        investment      by suppliers       of a
number of commodities,               thereby reducing future supplies and raising current
prices.      In addition,        a change in interest            rates might change expectations
about future aggregate economic activity, which would affect expected future
commodity demands, and again, current prices.
        We can formalize these arguments with a simple model.2                            Write the n&s
supply of    commodity      i at time t,               as:
                     —           +                                                                (2)
                                     bpt
where         —                  and          is   the price of commodity i at t.             The index
                    logP
         captures    changes          in both supply and demand.                 It depends     on both
commodity specific          variables         (e.g.,   a     strike    by copper miners or bad
weather),     as well as current and lagged values of                     xt      a vector of macro-
economic variables          (such       as the index of industrial              production,    interest
rates,    inflation,      etc.)       that can affect many commodities.              We define a set
of commodities       to be unrelated if there are negligible cross-price                        effects
                                                     -7-
                                                                                             and if any

     The evolution of inventory,                         is given by the accounting identity:

                     —              + Qi,t                                                           (3)

Finally,   under      the a sumption           that risk-neutral             inventory holders maximize

expected profits, the evolution of the price of commodity i is given by:
                 —
                      i,t+l          -

where rt is the required rate of return,                       E    is the expectation      conditional

on all information         available          at time    t.   and             is the one-period holding

cost of the commodity, less the capitalized flow of its marginal convenience
                                                                         -


yield over the period.

     The convenience                      is the       flow of benefits that one obtains                 from
                                yield

holding stocks, e.g.        ,   the resulting           assurance       of supply as needed, ease of

                 etc.      On the margin,              this   depends        on the total quantity of
scheduling,

inventory held; the larger is 'it'                     the smaller is the benefit from holding

an extra unit of inventory.                   The convenience yield is also likely to depend

on macroeconomic          variables.3               For example,        an increase    in the rate of

industrial      production implies             an increase in the rate of consumption of

industrial                           and therefore an increase in desired stocks.                             We

                                                                                                         Thus
        Eqn. (4) says that prices at t depend on expected future prices.

current prices depend on expected future conditions                             in the industry,     and as

we show in Appendix A, they are functions                           of current and expected future

values of     x.      We assume that forecasts of                   x   are based on current and past

        It    is possible for serial correlation                      to arise     in 6it•         We explore
this by also astimating the following equation:

        The details of our model not withstanding, eqns.                                  and (7') embody a
simple notion:            the prices of unrelated               commodities         should move together
exclusively        in response to market participants'                      changing perceptions of the
macroeconomic       environment.
        Estimation.
        We estimate eqns. (7) and (7') for each of our seven commodities using
OLS   for    the period April 1960 through November 1985.                           Since the results on
the   correlation of commodity                      prices   are      nearly the         same for the      two
specifications,          we     report largely            on the estimation of               (7)   to    avoid
duplication.        The vector      x includes           the index of industrial production (Y),
the consumer price index                (it),       an   (equally weighted)         index of the dollar
value of British pounds, German marks, and Japanese yen (E), and the nominal
interest rate on 3-month Treasury bills                        (9.)   .'    The vector                     the
                                                                                           at includes
money supply, Ml (H), and the S&P Common Stock Index (5).                                     The model is
first estimated          with the current and one-month lagged values of these
                                                     -9-
variables,     and then is re-estimated with the current values and lags of one

through six months.

      Table 4 shows estiwation results for equations                            that include     x and
current and lagged one month.                  Increases        in inflation and the money           supply

are associated with irreases in the prices of all the commodities,                                  and the

interest    rate with decreases.               The effects of the other variables are more

mixed, but as Table 5 shows, each variable has a statistically                                  significant

impact on commodity prices as a whole.                      That table presents likelihood ratio

tests    for        group     exclusions       of       explanatory       variables     from all      seven


commodity      price equations.             Column (1) applies to equations with one lag,

and column      (2)     to equations         with six lags.            Each statistic          is twice   the

difference      of      the    log    likelihood          functions       for   the    unrestricted and

restricted models, and is distributed                     as x2    with   degrees of freedom equal to

the number of restrictions                 (14 and 49 respectively).             With the exception of

stock returns         in column      (1)    and industrial production in column (2), these

statistics are significant at the                   1   percent level.

We test whether ) is indeed diagonal using the technique decribed in Section

2;   the results       are included         in Table       5.   The test statistic         is significant

at the 1 percent             level for both versions of the model.                     The data reject a

diagonal     covariance        matrix more strongly when we include six lags of the

                    variables.        This might           occur    because in small           samples    the
explanatory

addition       of    irrelevant       explanatory          variables      automatically reduces           the

variance       of      the     i'      without          necessarily        reducing      the    covariances

commensurately.

        To account for serial correlation in the residuals                      (as reflected        in the
Durbin-Watson        statistics in Table 4), we also estimated                       eqn.    (7'), which
includes     a lagged dependent              variable.         To teat for excess co-movement            in
this case, we cannot utilize                 the technique        employed in Section        2.     Inatead
we compare        the likelihoods        of models estimated            both with and without the
constraints        imposed.      Including          the current values and           one     lag    of the
explanatory variables,           the     likelihood        ratio    test for a diagonal            residual
correlation matrix is 71.2.              This is lower than for the regressions shown in
Table 4, but still highly significant.
        These      results      show         that    excess        co-movement    is        statistically
significant,       but tell us little about                    its magnitude.     In particular,         we
would like to know how much of the total variation in commodity prices is
explained by this co-movement.                 This can be determined by comparing                 the R2's
for the    OL.S    regressions    in Table 4 with R2's for regressions which explain
the price change of each commodity                   using      the current changes     in the prices
of all of the other commodities as additional explanatory variables.                                  These
R2's are shown in Table          6.     Except for gold, crude oil, and lumber, the R2's
for   the monthly regressions                on the macro variables are low; most of the
variance of price changes is unexplained.                         When commodity prices are added
as explanatory        variables,       the R2's increase            substantially,     and for wheat,
cotton,     and     copper,      the     change      in            (which measures      the        marginal
explanatory power of commodity co-movements)                       exceeds   the R2 when only macro
variables are included.
        Table     6 also shows         the    R2's for estimates         of eqn.       (7) using non-
overlapping       quarterly and annual data.                   The explanatory    variables are the
same,    but now we use quarterly and annual changes in the logs of prices,
industrial        production,    the     money      supply,      etc.    The    marginal explanatory
                                                        11    -



power     of     commodity      price        co-movements          tends     to increase when we                use


quarterly        and    annual data.5            In the case of cotton,                     for example,        the

addition of other commodity price changes as explanatory variables accounts

for    nearly half of the              total     variation          in annual cotton price              changes.

Table 6 thus shows             th:   commodity     price co-movements               explains       a substantial

fraction of the individual price movements.

        We also examined the sensitivity of our results to the choice of sample

period,        using    monthly      data and one             lag    of each        explanatory        variable.

Leaving        out   the   period     October     1973       through       December       1974 (during which

commodity       prices may have been broadly                      affected     by OPEC, which may have

also affected macroeconomic                  variables),          the statistic          for the absence of

co-movements           falls   to    77.1.      Extending           the    sample       through    October     1986

results in a statistic              of 75.4, and shortening the sample so that it ends in

November 1984 gives 83.0.6               These statistics are all highly significant.7

        After accounting for commodity price movements that are due to common

macroeconomic          factors,      price    changes    remain correlated across commodities.

We make a further attempt to account for this the next two Sections.

4.     A Latent Variable Model.

        In the previous section we tested whether correlations                                among commodity

prices can be attributed                to the correlation of each price with observable

macroeconomic           variables that are               predictors          of     future        conditions     in

commodity        markets.         This approach          is       subject    to     a    serious     limitation:

Individuals have more information about future x's                             than      can be obtained from

any set of current and past x's                 and   z's which are directly observable.                       Thus

eqn.    (6)     is too restrictive.             Some of the news about                  future macroeconomic

variables        is of a qualitative            nature which is difficult                  to include     in the

kinds of regressions reported above.                         This qualitative           information     could    in
                                                         -    12   -
principle    affect all commodities and could thus be a source of correlation
among their prices.
      A natural       way    of capturing                such information about the future is by
incorporating       a Set        of latent variables                     into   our   model.     These   latent
variables     represent         the   market's               forecasts     of the future values of the
macroeconomic       variables.         Our model then becomes a MIMIC (multiple                      indicator
multiple cause) model.8                The       "indicators,"            i.e.,   the variables     which      are
affected by the         latent        variables,              include     both the vector of commodity
prices   and the actual realization                          of the future macroeconomic           variables.
The "causes" of the latent variables                          include any variable which is useful in
forecasting macroeconomic             variables.               Thus the causes include our z's.
      To account for market information that is unavailable to us, we first
generalize    eqn. (6)
                            —                    +                                                       (8)
             E(x+)              9(L)x                (L)z + fvt
             is an unobserved forecast of                              based on the observed current and
Et(xt+)
past values of              and             and on the unobserved residual vector vt.                           We
now consider a subset of the variables x, which we denote by y.                                     We define
the vector of latent variables                       as follows:
                —                                                                                        (9)
                     E(tyt) — e'(L)x + '(L)z + f'v
We now make the strong assumption that                             V   is of full rank.        This means that
                            —                    +                                                       (10)

In   other words,       knowledge           of       J       is    sufficient,    when combined      with the
observable    x's    and    z's,      to generate forecasts of                          j > 1.    We can then
write the log change in the price of commodity                                    i   (which depends     on all
future x's)    as:
                                            +                                                            (11)

      The latent       variables       we include are the expectation at t of the value

at t÷l of y.       Therefore,         the vector of residuals             w in the equation
                       —   't   ÷                                                                   (12)

is   uncorrelated with any                information           available     at t.       The   system we

estimate then consists                of (9),       (11),       and (12).        The    vector of latent

variables    J has      multie         causes,      namely the z's,           and multiple indicators,

namely the current prices and future y's.

      Our procedure is closely related to the more traditional instrumental

variables    method of estimating rational                        expectations     models.      Consistent

estimates    of    g    could also be obtained by using the current and lagged z's

as instruments         for             in a regression equation which is given by (11),
                                t÷l
where .I is replaced by               t÷l          As in the instrumental variables approach,

we assume that certain variables                     (the       z's)    affect commodity prices only

through their effect on agents' expectations                           of certain future variables.

      Like     our      procedure,           the    instrumental            variables    approach       gives

consistent estimates            of        even when the instrument              list is not exhaustive.
                                     g.
However,     the residuals           from an instrumental variables               regression cannot be

used directly to test for excessive co-movement of commodity prices.                                    These

residuals     are constructed using                  the        actual realized values of           future

macroeconomic      variables.          Since the market forecast must by necessity                  differ

from these realized values, the residuals in all the equations will tend to

be correlated.

      We    estimate         (9),     (11)    and (12)          by maximum likelihood,          under     the

maintained assumption that the v's, U's and                             's   are normally distributed.

The contemporaneous             variance-covariance             matrix for the v's as well as that

for the w's is left unrestricted.                    We assume that V's are uncorrelated with

's    and w's at all leads                   and lags, and that the same                 is true for      the
                                                 -    14   -
correlation       between c's and w's.               We first estimate              the model under the
assumption that the covariance matrix for the c's is diagonal so that our
explanatory       and   latent variables             account       for    all   of the correlation          in
commodity prices.          This assumption is then tested by reestimating the model
with an unrestricted contemporaneous                  covariance matrix for the c's.
        We use the same variables as in the regression model of Section                               3, and
include       two latent variables        which represent the current forecasts                     of next
period's       inflation    and    next period's rate                    of growth    of the       Index   of
Industrial      Production.       Thus we are assuming that the money supply and the
stock market affect commodity                  prices       only    via their        ability   to predict
inflation      and output.9
        Estimation is       done     using LISREL.1°                     Besides     yielding parameter
estimates,      LISREL computes          the value of the            likelihood       function given by
eqn. (1), making likelihood ratio tests straightforward.
5.   The Exolanatory Power of Latent Variables.
        Estimation results         for    this    latent variable model are presented                       in

of inflation       between period t and period t+l, and growth in industrial
production between t and t+l respectively.                         The first seven columns of Table
7 represent       the equations      explaining            commodity       prices    while   the   last    two
columns represent the equations explaining the latent variables.
        As this table       shows,       the     latent variables               help explain       commodity
prices.        In the regressions explaining prices, both latent variables have
generally positive and often statistically                        significant coefficients.           To see
that the latent variables are important, note that the R2's are much higher
when the latent variables are included than in the corresponding equations
of Table 4.

      After                                                                    that the covariance

matrix of the       's      is diagonal,       we reestimate        it without that constraint.

Even this less constrained model now incorporates some constraints since we

still assume that the v's and w's are uncorrelated with the E'S
                                                                                         and that     the

case, but is still significant at the 1% level.                       Thus, even after including

latent    variables        there    is still     excess co-movement of commodity                  prices.

      We estimated several variations of this basic model,                           including        two


models with only one latent variable.                      The first has a latent variable for

the   market -forecast           of future      inflation,        and the second has         a     latent

                                                of growth in industrial production.                   The
variable    for the market forecast

second models respectively.             Thus,    forecasted        inflation has more to do with

joint movements       of commodity prices than does forecasted production growth.

Also note that the               evidence                   the   hypothesis of no excess             to-
                                             against

movement is slightly weaker when we include only the latent variable for

inflation     than when we include both.               This means that simply adding latent

variables    may not resolve the puzzle of excess co-movement.                         This can occur
because   while the addition of latent variables                        raises the likelihoods       of
both the constrained and unconstrained models, it is the difference between
these likelihoods    that corresponds to our test ststisticJ2
     We also estimated s latent variable version of eqn. (7') which includes
lagged dependent     variables.            The       results     change very little.        The    test
statistic    for the absence          of co-movement remains equal to 49.7 when there
are two     latent variables,         and becomes 46.3 and 40.3 respectively when the
only latent variables           are    expected       inflation       and the expected change in
industrial    production.        Finally, we tried to extend the number of lags, but
failed to achieve convergence of the likelihood function, presumably because
of the large number of unimportant parameters being estimated.
6.   Concluding Remsrks.
     Common movements           in the prices             of unrelated      commodities    should be
traceable    to changes     in current or expected future values of macroeconomic
variables.     We have shown that these kinds of variables do not account for
much of the obaerved co-movement                 of commodity          prices.     This is the case
whether expectations are based solely on observable macroeconomic variables,
or are also based on unobserved latent variables.
     There sre two possible explanations                      for this finding.       One is that our
model is incomplete         -   some important            macroeconomic     variables are missing
from our specification.               Given our extensive             experimenting    we doubt thst
this is the case,         but this possibility                 cannot be ruled out.        The    other
explanation    is that the            actors   in commodity           markets    react in tandem to
noneconomic factors.            These     reactions           might   be due     to the presence of
equilibrium    "sunspots", "bubbles,"            or simply changes in "market psychology".

In   any case, this would represent          a rejection         of the standard competitive

model of commodity price formation          in the presence of storage.

      There are also alternative            explanations          for    the   dependence   of our

results     on the length of the holding               period.     We have shown that as we

increase the interval over which price changes are measured from a month to

a quarter or a year, the amount of price movementS                       which can be attributed

to macroeconomic     variables    rises while the amount of unexplained                co-movement


rises as well.

                                                            is    that    there    is considerable
      One    possible reason for this finding
                                                                                              As a

result neither       macroeconomic     variables         nor prices of other           commodities


explain a large fraction of individual monthly price changes.

      A second possibility is consistent with the view that we have excluded

relevant     macroeconomic     variables    from our model.             Suppose    that changes in

                                                                        For example,    an unusual
macro variables       affect    commodity    price      slowly.

monthly     change   in inflation might have to persist for some time before it

affects perceptions about the future.              Such slow effects are consistent with

                                                                                       in commodity

                                                         for longer holding periods.           This
also explain more of the price movements

                      exclusion increases          the     unexplained co-movement          as the
means that its

holding period is increased.

       A third possibility        is that common price movements                  are the result of


liquidity     effects.     The fall in the price          of one commodity lowers the price

of others only because it impoverishes                 speculators who are long in several

commodities     at once.     These liquidity effects should be larger the larger is

 the change in any single couimoditys              price.        The variance of price changes
                                       -   18   -
is   larger the longer the horizon,        so we would expect liquidity effects to
become more significant as the horizon increases.
      A fourth possibility     is that commodity prices are indeed driven partly
by bubbles and fads, and that these fads are sufficiently rare that the bulk
of our monthly price changes is unaffectedby them.               At the same time, these
fads would have      to   be    sufficiently        disruptive   that they     explain    a
substantial   amount of commodity price changes over longer horizona.
      More research is needed to test these various hypotheses.                 Hopefully
additional work will help to disentangle               the   causes   of the   excess    co-
movement of commodity prices that we have found.

     Here we derive                eqn. (7) from eqns. (2) through (6) and a linearization.

In particular we use a linearization                                     of        (4)   analogous       to that employed by

Campbell and Shiller (1986) to obtain a linear expression for the logarithm

of price.       Ignoring commodity specific subscripts, eqn. (4) becomes:

where        is the cx post return and                                     can be thought of as the unexpected

a constant h and

Thus       under        cur     null hypothesis,               the    u's        are   uncorrelated across

This leads to eqn. (7) in the text.                               Since    the   u's    could in principle
have a richer temporal                  structure,           we also allow for serial correlation by
introducing            a lagged dependent variable as in eqn. (7').

1.    Limited     experimentation  with other Sets of commodities, including
      replacing    gold with platinum, had little effect on our results.

2.    This model is similar in structure to the finished goods inventory
      model of Eichenbaum (1983).  It is also similar to the commodity price
      models of Stein (1986) and Turnovsky (1983), but more general in that
      they assume i.i.d. shocks, and we allow for a more general error
      structure.

3.    For an explicit model of convenience yield that      illustrates   some   of
      these general dependencies, see Williams (1987).

4.    The interest rate is in level rather than first-differenced       form.
      This is consistent with the first difference of the interest race
      affecting the rate of change of commodity prices.  We include the level
      of interest rates because it may well be a good predictor of future
      inflation and because equation (4) suggests that levels of interest
      rates may help predict individual commodity price changes.

5.    The R2's for the regressions that use only macroeconomic explanatory
      variables increase substantially as we lengthen the holding period,
      which partly explains the larger raw correlations of commodity price
      changes for longer holding periods shown in Tables 1 to
                                                              3.


6.    We focus on the 1960:4 to 1985:11 period because of the major change
      in U.S. government intervention in the cotton market that occured in 1986.

7.    We also considered the weather as an explanator that could affect all
      commodities, and included U.S. data on heating degree days, cooling
      degree days, temperature, and preciptation. This had virtually no
      effect on our results; the resulting x was 87.7.

8.    See Goldberger (1972) and Aigner et. al. (1984).

9.    In some sense this is more restrictive than in the earlier regression
      model because   there the money supply and the stock market were
      potential predictors of all other x's as well.

10.   The input is the correlation      matrix 1 of all the variables      of
      interest.  Thus this matrix includes the correlations among the changes
      in commodity prices, the x's , the z's and the future values of
      inflation and production growth. See Joreskog and Sorbom (1986).

11.      Ignoring the x's, the model has 7 prices, 2 future macroeconomic
      variables, and 4 instruments, for a total of 78 covariances.   The test
      statistic for the less restricted model has 25 degrees of freedom
      because that model includes 53 free parameters:  21 covariances of the
             14 gj's in eqn. (11), 8 's in eqn. (9), 3 elements of the
      covariance matrix for eqn. (9), 1 covariance of the we's in (12), and
      the 6 free covariances of our instruments.
                                        24
12.   Eliminating the latent variable for industrial production makes the
      fit of the less constrained model deteriorate substantially.         The test
      statistic for this model relative to an unconstrained alternative is
      51.8.    This is significant at the 1 percent level since this less
      constrained model imposes 27 restrictIons.      Thus there is less evidence
      against the hypothesis that money and the stock market affect commodity
      prices through forecasts of both inflation and output growth than there
      Is against the hypothesis that they do so through only one of these forecasts.
