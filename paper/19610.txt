                                             ABSTRACT

This paper explores a novel mechanism of gender identity formation. Specifically, we explore how
the work behavior of a teenager's own mother, as well as that of her friends' mothers, affect her
work decisions in adulthood. The first mechanism is commonly included in economic models. The
second, which in social psychology is also emphasized as an important factor in gender identity
formation, has so far been overlooked. Accordingly, our key theoretical innovation is how the utility
function is modeled. It is assumed that an adult woman's work decisions are influenced by her own
mother's choices as well as her friends' mothers' choices when she was a teenager, and the interaction
between the two. The empirical salience of this behavioral model is tested using a network model
specification together with the longitudinal structure of the AddHealth data set. We find that both
intergenerational channels positively affect a woman's work hours in adulthood, but the cross effect
is negative, indicating the existence of cultural substitutability. That is, the mother's role model effect
is larger the more distant she is (in terms of working hours) from the friends' mothers.

1       Introduction
An extensive literature in economics focuses on the importance of cultural norms for economic
decisions and for the persistence of beliefs, norms, and socio-economic status across generations
(Alesina and Giuliano, 2010, 2013; Bisin and Verdier, 2011). When it comes to women, a number
of studies have established that gender norms can explain some of the differences in women’s labor
market outcomes over time, across countries and ethnicities, and across generations (see Alesina et
al., 2013, and surveys by Bertrand, 2010, and Fernandez, 2011). Some of these studies are grounded
in Akerlof and Kranton (2000, 2010) identity economics framework. In the case of gender identity,
the social category is man and woman, and a key (exogenously given) behavioral prescription is
“men work in the labor force and women work at home”. If deviations from this prescription were
costly, then gender identity would lead to lower labor force participation and investments in human
capital.
     But how are these behavioral prescriptions or social norms acquired? This paper explores, both
theoretically and empirically, the importance of early socialization for shaping gender identity and
subsequent work choices of a recent cohort of women. In the psychology literature, gender role
socialization is thought to occur through three main channels: reinforcement by parents of gender
appropriate behavior, children modeling their behavior on same sex parents, and children learning
the rules of appropriate behavior from observing adults in a society (e.g., Hyde and Rosenberg,
1980; Williams, 1977). We explore the importance of the last two channels. That is, we assume
that gender norms are shaped during women’s adolescence by observing the behavior of a specific
reference group: mothers. This includes both the same-sex parent and friends’ mothers, a set
of female adults she is likely to have been frequently exposed to.1 Although social psychology
has emphasized both mechanisms as fundamental factors in gender identity formation, work in
economics has so far only focused on the first mechanism, thus overlooking the second.
     Following Bisin and Verdier (2000, 2001), our behavioral model emphasizes both the direct
role played by having a working mother (direct vertical socialization) and the role played by the
work behavior of the daughter’s friends’ mothers (oblique and horizontal socialization). Relative
to the gender identity framework, our contribution is to argue that an adult woman’s actions
are affected by a pre-determined behavioral prescription formed during adolescence. Relative to
theories emphasizing intergenerational mechanisms of transmission of gender norms and beliefs
(Fernández, 2013; Fernández et al., 2004; Fogli and Veldkamp, 2011), our contribution is to include
both the horizontal and the vertical channel and to allow for individual specific network effects.
     We test the empirical salience of this model by using a network model specification together
with the unique longitudinal structure of the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health
(Add Health) data set. As is common in the literature, information on work hours is used both
    1
    The importance of the quality and quantity of contact for gender stereotyping has been emphasized both in the
social psychology and in the economic literature. See for example, Asgari et al. (2010) and Carrell et al. (2010).

as the outcome of interest and to measure socialization. We measure work outcomes, educational
attainment, marital status and presence of children as of 2007-08 (Add Health, wave IV), when
women in our sample are 24 to 30 years old. However, their social network and information on
mothers’ worked hours, education and other background characteristics are from wave I (1995-96),
corresponding to age 12 to 18.
     As expected, we find that there is a positive relationship between the labor supply of mothers
and daughters: the more mothers work, the more they represent a “role model” for their daughters
(i.e. the more their daughters work). The horizontal effect of peers’ mothers is also positive and
significant. Interestingly, we then uncover a negative cross effect, providing evidence of cultural
substitutability between these two channels. In other words, the more the mother worked, the lower
the impact of friends’ mothers on own work behavior. The quantitative importance of these effects
is stronger in the presence of children. That is, the long lasting effects of others’ work behavior is
strongest when daughters become mothers themselves, with the mother’s role model effect being
strongest for college educated women.
     Our findings are robust to the inclusion of grade and school fixed effects, to measurement errors
in peer groups, as well as to the inclusion of a contemporaneous peer effect variable (current hours
worked by women who belonged to the network of friends during adolescence). To further address
the potential endogeneity of friendships and thus of friends’ mothers’ labor market outcomes, we
implement an instrumental variable strategy that exploits the high residential mobility after high
school in the US. The AddHealth provides informations at the block, tract and county level for many
socio-economic variables collected from various government sources. It also contains extremely
detailed information on residential moves: we know the distance in kilometers between residential
location in wave I and residential location in wave III. We use labor market employment opportunity
measures in the residential block during teenage years to instrument friends’ mothers’ hours worked.
If the daughter, after high school, changes residential location, then the labor market characteristics
at the block level during her teenage years should influence her working hours in adulthood only
through hours worked by school friends’ mothers. This analysis further confirms our results.
     Our paper is part of a literature that uses a neighborhood approach (here a social network
approach) to identify the importance of early socialization for economic outcomes (Katz et al.,
2001; Kling et al., 2001; Oreopolous, 2003; Patacchini and Zenou, 2011; Solon et al., 2000). The
key theoretical innovation relative to this literature has to do with the way the utility function is
modeled. It is assumed that an adult woman’s work decisions are influenced by her own mother’s
choices as well as, and this is the new part, her friends’ mothers work behavior when she was a
teenager. In addition, we introduce a cross term to capture how the social norm of the mother and
of the friends’ mothers affects the daughter’s own choice. The innovation in the empirical analysis
is threefold. First, this unique data set allows for individual-specific peer groups. Second, the
target variable is the behavior of the mothers of peers in adolescence rather than peers behavior in



                                                  3
adulthood. Third, the geographical detail of our data allows us to implement a novel identification
strategy. Although there is a large and growing literature on social interactions in economics
(Jackson, 2008; Ioannides, 2012) and the Add Health data have been used extensively to study
peer effects, this paper is the first, to our knowledge, to use the (lagged) information on friendships
to investigate the role of early socialization for the formation of gender norms.2
    In the context of testing theories of gender identity, the closest paper is Bertrand et al. (2013),
which explores the behavioral prescription “a man should earn more than his wife”. The authors
establish that gender identity, interpreted as a wife’s higher aversion towards earning more than her
husband, is an important determinant of marriage formation and satisfaction, as well as a married
woman’s labor force participation and income conditional on working. By focusing on another
typical gender behavioral prescription, our paper complements their work.
    Finally, our paper is also related to a growing literature documenting the importance of gender
norms for female outcomes. Farré and Vella (2013) find a strong association between a mother’s
attitudes towards gender roles and work experience and daughter’s (and daughter-in-law’s) labor
force participation decision. Fernández (2007) and Fernández and Fogli (2006, 2009) identify the
effect of cultural differences on women’s work and fertility choices by using the lagged values of
this variable in a woman’s country of ancestry and a cross-section of second-generation immigrants.
Fortin (2005) shows the existence of a negative correlation between conservativeness of gender
roles attitudes and female labor force participation. Alesina et al. (2013) uncover the empirical
relationship between the use of plough agriculture and gender role attitudes using its variation
across ethnic groups to identify the effect of cultural differences on women’s participation in the
labor force and in the political arena.
    Our findings can shed light on one possible mechanism that might have contributed to the
so-called “opt-out revolution” in which women in their early twenties and early thirties are said to
be inclined to withdraw from the labor market.3 Goldin (2006) documents that, for the cohort of
women born around 1959, there is little evidence of a counter-revolution to the one that transformed
women’s economic role and that, as she argues, was associated with increasing women’s attachment
to the workplace and greater identity with a career. Fortin (2009) shows that, since the mid-
1990s, newer cohorts of women have developed more conservative gender role attitudes than their
predecessors, the so-called “backlash” effect.4 She argues that the halted progress in women’s labor
   2
     Fryer and Torelli (2010) use the information on the friendship network in AddHealth wave I data to investigate
the economics of “acting white”.

     In 2003, the New York Times published a lengthy article by Lisa Belkin about women who were choosing to leave
the workforce to be stay-at-home moms: the so-called “Opt-Out Generation”. Some of the conclusions of the article
seem to have been premature. See Judith Warner’s “The Opt-Out Generation Wants Back In” published in the New
York Times in August 2013.

     Unlike other papers in this literature, Fortin (2009) bases her analysis on the Benabou and Tirole (2011) frame-
work where “identity” is modeled as a portfolio investment decision. Specifically, a woman can choose to invest in
labor market skill (“career woman” identity) or marriage skills (“housewife” identity) but the two identities are at

market outcomes might partially be attributed to non-economic factors.5 The young women in our
analysis, born between 1978 and 1983, are in their late twenties or early thirties in 2007-08. That
is, they belong to cohorts of women whose behavior has been under scrutiny. We do not find
evidence in support of an intergenerational backlash effect. On the contrary, our results indicate
that mothers’ work had a positive influence on daughters’ gender role attitudes and work choices.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 describes the
data. Section 4 discusses our empirical strategy while Section 5 presents the main results of the
analysis. Section 6 reports the results of several robustness checks. Section 7 further investigates
the mechanisms underlying our findings. Finally, Section 8 concludes.


2     Theoretical model
Consider a woman i who is adult at time t + 1 and who was a daughter and a student at time
t and belonged to network r. We model her choice of effort level in terms of working hours (a
continuous variable), which we denote by hi,r,t+1 . We assume that the choice of hi,r,t+1 made at
time t + 1 is influenced by how many hours her own mother worked at time t (hm     i,r,t ) when she
was a student. In addition, and this is the new part, it is influenced by the average number of
                                                m
hours her friends’ mothers worked at time t (hj,r,t ). The social environment is modeled by using
the daughter’s network r of friendships at time t.

     The network Suppose a finite set of students N = {1, . . . , n} is partitioned into r networks,
where Nr = {1, . . . , nr } denotes the set of students in the rth network (r = 1, ..., r). We keep
track of social connections in network r by its adjacency matrix Gr = [gij,r ], where gij,r = 1 if
i and j are friends, and gij,r = 0, otherwise.6 We also set gii,r = 0. The reference group of
student i in network r is the set of i’s friends given by Ni,r = {j 6= i | gij,r = 1}. The size of Ni,r is
gi,r = nj=1
       P r
             gij,r = |Ni,r |, which is known as the degree of i.

defined as follows:

     On the other hand, taking an international perspective, Blau and Kahn (2013) show that one important factor
underlying this development is the absence of “family-friendly” policies in the United States.

     We assume friendships are reciprocal so that gij,r = gji,r . All our results hold for asymmetric (directed ) networks
but, for ease of presentation, we focus on symmetric (undirected ) networks.

The first term in the utility function (1) represents the benefit individual i receives from working
hi,r,t+1 hours at time t + 1, where

are the observable characteristics (e.g. race, gender, etc.) of individual i both at time t and at time
t + 1. The second term captures the effort cost of providing these working hours. The next two
terms in (1) reflect the influence on individual i’s behavior at time t + 1 of, respectively, her own
mother and her friends’ mothers work behavior experienced during adolescence, where

is the average number of hours her school friends’ mothers worked at time t. The parameters
d1 , d2 > 0 measure the taste for conformity. We assume the parameters αk1 > 0 for all k = 1, ..., K,
but allow α2 to be positive or negative. The last two terms of the utility function are such that
an individual i wants to minimize the social distance both between herself and her mother, i.e.
                                                                                       m
hi,r,t+1 − hmi,r,t , and between herself and her reference group, i.e. hi,r,t+1 − hj,r,t . This preference
specification is standard in economic models of conformity (see, among others, Akerlof, 1980, 1997;
Bernheim, 1994; Kandel and Lazear, 1992; Fershtman and Weiss, 1998; Patacchini and Zenou,
2012). In our context, the taste for conformity operates through two different channels. A woman i
loses utility d21 (hi,r,t+1 −hm      2
                              i,r,t ) from failing to conform to the social norm imposed by her own mother
                                               m
but she also loses utility d22 (hi,r,t+1 − hj,r,t )2 from failing to conform to the social norm imposed by
                                                                                                   m
her friends’ mothers. In addition, the cross term in utility function (1), α2 hi,r,t+1 hm   i,r,t hj,t , indicates
how the social norm of i’s mother and of the mothers of her friends marginally affects the daughter’s
choice. Note that this term can be positive or negative depending on the sign of α2 . To observe
the crucial role of α2 , observe that

                        ∂ 2 ui,r,t+1            m          ∂ 2 ui,r,t+1            m
                                   m = d2 + α2 hi,r,t and             m = d1 + α2 hj,t
                       ∂hi,r,t+1 hj,t                     ∂h         h
                                                             i,r,t+1 j,t

As a result, if α2 > 0, then both the effect of my mother’s working hours and of my friends’
mothers’ working hours on my marginal utility of working is positive. If α2 < 0, then these two
effects become ambiguous.

    Optimal choice of working hours We now characterize the equilibrium where each daugh-
ter i chooses her working hours hi,r,t+1 ≥ 0 to maximize her utility (1). It follows from the first-order
condition that:
                                                                      K

If θ > 0, then a higher average working hours of the friends’ mothers increases the impact of the
mother’s working hours on her daughter’s working hours, and vice versa. In other words, a positive
value of θ indicates cultural complementarity between the vertical and horizontal channel, while a
negative θ implies cultural substitutability. Moreover, an increase in a mother’s working hours has
the following impact on her daughter’s working hours:
                                              ∂hi,r,t+1         m
                                                  m     = γ + θhj,t
                                               ∂hi,r,t
                                                                                                   m
Thus, this effect depends on the sign of θ and on the strength of the peer effects, hj,t . Similarly,

                                              ∂hi,r,t+1
                                                   m    = φ + θhm
                                                                i,r,t
                                               ∂hj,t
                                                                             m
so that an increase in the working hours of friends’ mothers (hj,t ) can increase or decrease own
working hours, depending on the sign of θ and on the intensity of the mother’s working hours hm               i,r,t .
    Using (2), equation (3) is equivalent to:
                                                                                       

   Since the utility function (1) is strictly quasi-concave, there exists a unique solution determined
by (5).


3     Data description
Our empirical analysis is based on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent
Health (AddHealth). Four features of the AddHealth data set are central to our analysis: (i) the
nomination-based friendship information, which allows us to reconstruct the precise geometry of
social contacts, (ii) the longitudinal dimension, which provides respondents’ information during
both teenage and adulthood, (iii) the geo-coded information on residential locations, which allows
us to implement an identification strategy based on residential mobility.
    The AddHealth has been designed to study the impact of the social environment (i.e. friends,
family, neighborhood and school) on adolescents’ behavior in the United States by collecting data
on students in grades 7-12 from a nationally representative sample of roughly 130 private and


                                                         7
public schools in years 1994-95 (wave I). Every pupil attending the sampled schools on the inter-
view day is asked to compile a questionnaire (in-school data) containing questions on respondents’
demographic and behavioral characteristics, education, family background and friendship. This
sample contains information on roughly 90,000 students. A subset of adolescents selected from the
rosters of the sampled schools, about 20,000 individuals, is then asked to compile a longer ques-
tionnaire containing more sensitive individual and household information (in-home and parental
data). These students are interviewed again in 1995-96 (wave II), in 2001-2 (wave III), and again
in 2007-2008 (wave IV). One of the most interesting aspects of the Add Health data is the infor-
mation on friendship networks, which is based upon actual friends nominations during the school
years. Indeed, pupils were asked to identify their best friends from a school roster (up to five
males and five females).7 As a result, one can reconstruct the whole geometric structure of the
friendship networks. Such detailed information on social interaction patterns allows us to measure
the relevant local community, i.e. the students who actually interact closely with each other, much
more precisely than in previous studies. We consider that a link exists between two friends if at
least one of the two individuals has identified the other as his/her best friend. For each school, we
thus keep track of all the individuals who actually interact with a given student. By matching the
identification numbers of the friendship nominations to the respondents’ identification numbers,
one can also obtain information on the characteristics of nominated friends. This information is
key in our analysis as it allows us to trace back the labor market outcomes, the education etc. of
each student’s friends’ parents. The longitudinal structure of the survey provides information on
the characteristics, in adulthood, of the respondent and of his/her high school friends, including
their employment outcomes.
    In particular, wave IV asks detailed information about the current/most recent job that involves
at least ten hours per week, including total number of hours worked in a typical week and the month
and year the job started (and ended). At wave IV, students are 24 to 30 years old. Virtually all
of them are either currently employed or have had a job in the last three years.8 As a result, we
extract information on hours worked in the current/most recent job and we focus our analysis on
the intensive margin.
    While the information on work outcomes, educational attainment, marital status and presence
of children comes from wave IV, we construct the social networks on the basis of information
on friendship choices during high school. This information was collected in wave I of the survey
(1995-96) when the women in our sample where in grades 7 to 12. We note that, while most of
the empirical analysis is restricted to women, the friendship network includes both boys and girls.
The information on school performance, parental labor market outcomes and education, and other
background characteristics also comes from wave I.
   7
     The limit in the number of nominations is not binding (even by gender). Less than 0.1% of the students in our
sample show a list of ten best friends.
   8
     Less than 1% have never been employed.


                                                        8
    Our final sample of in-home wave I students (and their friends) that are followed over time and
with non-missing information on our target variables both in wave I and in wave IV consists of
5,683 women distributed over 374 networks. The minimum number of individuals in a network is
2 while its maximum is 225. The mean and the standard deviation of network size are roughly 5.5
and 13 individuals, respectively. On average, the students declare having about 2 friends (with a
standard deviation of roughly 1.5). We measure the mother’s influence and the influence of the
friends’ mothers (i.e. of the local environment) during the teenage years using information on
weekly hours worked from wave I. The work decision in adulthood is measured using the individual
data on weekly hours worked from wave IV.
    Table 1 provides some descriptive statistics on the individuals in our study. Female students
make up 50% of our sample, of which 60% are white. More than 70% of women in our sample
come from a two-parent household, with an average household size of around 4. Moreover, 56%
of all mothers have a high school diploma, 30% have a college degree or higher graduate degrees.
Mothers worked on average about 38 hours a week in wave I. By age 24 to 30 (wave IV), 43% of
our wave I adolescents are married and 55% of them have children. Only 5% of all women in our
sample are high school drop outs while 38% have a college degree or a higher level of educational
attainment and they work on average about 39 hours per week. Roughly 30% of women in our
sample were high-performing students in school, i.e. had the highest marks in mathematics.

4       Empirical analysis
The econometric framework closely mirrors our behavioral model. As stated above, let r̄ be the
total number of networks in the sample, nr be the number of individuals in the rth network,
           Pr̄
and n =      r=1 nr be the total number of individuals. For i = 1, · · · , nr and r = 1, · · · , r̄, the
econometric model corresponding to (5) can be written as:
                                                                               

                                                                   ij,r,t j,r,t   +   β k xki,r,t,t+1 + εi,r,t,t+1 (6)

   While most of the existing studies on the impact of the social context on individual outcomes
measure the social context at a quite aggregate level (neighborhood, classroom, city),9 here we
adopt a social network approach. Such an approach allows us to measure the influence of social
context more precisely than in previous studies, as the peers are defined by the smallest unit of
analysis, the dyad (i.e. a two-person group). However, when assessing the impact of the behavior
    9
    See e.g., Katz et al. (2001), Kling et al. (2001), Oreopolous (2003), Patacchini and Zenou (2011), Solon et al.
(2000). For an overview of this literature, see Durlauf (2004), Ioannides and Topa (2010) and Ioannides (2011).

of a (narrowly and well-defined) reference group on individual decisions the identification of the
effect is complicated by the possible endogenous formation of the group.
    Observe first that we do not have a standard peer-effect model where the action of a person is
affected by the average actions of his/her peers (see, e.g. Sacerdote, 2001, 2011; Clark and Loheac,
2007; Calvó-Armengol et al., 2009; De Giorgi et al., 2010; Lin, 2010; Bifulco et al., 2011). In (6),
the action (working hours) of a woman is not directly affected by the actions (working hours) of her
peers (school friends), but by the actions (working hours) of the mother of her friends. However,
friends do select into groups (or networks) in a non-random way and thus the friends’ mothers
can also be selected. The perspective of our approach mitigates such an issue because the social
network structure is predetermined in adulthood. However, there might still remain some troubling
unobserved factor constant over time. We will further address this potential concern in Section 6
below.


5         Results
Table 2 reports the OLS estimation results of model (6). Our main results are unchanged as we
increase the set of controls (moving to the right of the table). Specifically, column (3) includes
daughters’ demographic characteristics, race, marital status, presence of children, as well as their
average GPA and their grades in wave I. It also includes controls for background variables such as:
(own) mother’s immigration status and education (two dummies, the omitted category is “less than
high school”), family income and an indicator of residential building quality.10 In column (4) we
add daughter’s completed education (again two dummies) and two additional background variables
that might potentially be driving daughters’ attitude towards gender roles. The first variable is a
measure of religiosity during adulthood11 while the second measures the quality of mother-daughter
interactions during adolescence.12
                                       [Insert T able 2 here]

         In all specifications, we find that there is a positive relationship both between daughter’s hours

      Interviewer response to the question: “How well kept is the building in which the respondent lives”, coded as 4=
very poorly kept (needs major repairs), 3= poorly kept (needs minor repairs), 2= fairly well kept (needs cosmetic
work), 1= very well kept.
   11
      Response to the question: “How often have you attended religious services in the past 12 months?”, coded as 0=
never, 1= a few times , 2= several times, 3= once a month, 4=2 or 3 times a month, 5=once a week, 6=more than
once a week.

      Our index of quality of mother-daughter interactions is obtained by factor analysis using two AddHealth variables
(from wave I). The first variable records the answer to the question “How much do you think she (mother) cares about
you?”. The answers were recorded on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = not at all and 5 = very much. For the second variable,
the respondent had to indicate her level of approval to the following statement: “When you do something wrong that
is important, your mother talks about it with you and helps you understand why it is wrong.” The answers were
recorded on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree.

and mother’s hours (the vertical channel) and between daughter’s hours and friends’ mothers’
hours (the horizontal channel). In the basic specification (column (1) to (4)), we find a negative and
significant cross effect, which implies that θ < 0 (see (4)). In other words, we find evidence of cultural
substitutability between the vertical and the horizontal channel of working hours transmission.
Furthermore, the estimates for the control variables follow the pattern of sign and significance that
is common in the literature on female labor supply. For instance, women work significantly fewer
hours if they have children (see columns (3) and (4)) and college graduates work significantly more
hours than women with less than a high school diploma.
    We interpret our results based on the entries in column (3). Our estimates imply that an
increase in a mother’s working hours (hm   i,r,t ) increases her daughter’s working hours by γ
                                                                                             b = 0.1513.
The marginal effect is given by:  13


                                 ∂hi,r,t+1       m                      m
                                           =γ θ hj,t = 0.1513 − 0.0032 hj,t

                                  ∂hmi,r,t

                                 m
Computed at the mean of hj,t = 37.86 (see Table 1), this is equal to 0.03, corresponding to roughly
8% of average hours worked by daughters in our sample. The marginal effect of the social context
is quantitatively very similar to that of a woman’s own mother (in fact, the vertical and horizontal
channels are indistinguishable from each other). We find that an increase in the working hours of
                     m
friends’ mothers (hj,t ) increases the daughter’s working hours by φ
                                                                   b = 0.1433. The implied marginal
effect in this case is given by:
                                ∂hi,r,t+1
                                     m    =φ θ hm
                                           b+b                          m
                                                i,r,t = 0.143 − 0.0032 hi,r,t
                                 ∂hj,t

which, given an average of 37.2 weekly hours (see Table 1), is equal to 0.022, corresponding to
approximately 6% of average hours worked by daughters.
    These results indicate that the mother’s “role model” effect is larger the more distant (in term
of working hours) she is from her daughter’s friends’ mothers. In other words, if friends’ mothers
are more similar to my own mother, the role model effect is weaker.
    We also study whether the quantitative importance of these effects differs by presence of chil-
dren. Almost all young women in the Add Health cohort work before having children. Thus we do
not expect to find as strong a statistical relationship between the working hours of women without
children and those of “mothers” (either through the vertical or the horizontal channel). However,
assuming that the work-family balance observed during adolescence shapes gender identity, the
long lasting effects of mothers’ work behavior should emerge when the daughters themselves face
the family-work trade-off and makes decisions. As shown in Table 3, this expectation is confirmed
in the data. Interestingly, in this case, the own mother effect dominates that of the friends’ mothers
  13
    A hat above a variable indicates that the variable is estimated. So, for example, γ
                                                                                      b = 0.513 is the estimated value
of γ as reported in Table 2 column (3).


                                                         11
(explaining 11.7% against 4.7% of average hours worked by daughters). The relative importance
of the vertical and horizontal channel greatly differs by education. While for young women with
children of their own and less than a college degree, the results looks fairly similar to those reported
in Table 2 column (3), the own mother effect dominates for the sub-sample of women with children
and at least a college degree (10.6% relative to −0.02%).

                                          [Insert T able 3 here]

    We worry that our results might be capturing the influence of (omitted) background factors that
determine adult labor market outcomes independent of gender. This concern would be mitigated
if we find no significant impact of mothers’ work hours on the sample of men. Thus, in Table 4,
we report the regression results for the adult male sample. This “placebo” test provides additional
support in favor of our hypothesis and empirical strategy. Comparing the entries in Table 4 to
column (1) to (3) in Table 2, it is clear that, unlike daughters, sons’ work hours in adulthood are
unaffected by mothers’ working behavior during adolescence.

6        Robustness checks
To gain more confidence in our identification strategy, we consider a series of robustness checks
whose results are reported in Table 5.

                                          [Insert T able 5 here]

6.1      Grade and school fixed effects
Our first robustness check is to estimate model (6) using OLS with grade and school fixed effects.
The idea is to treat the composition of students in a given grade within a school as quasi-random
and to exploit variation in student composition across cohorts within schools to isolate this quasi-
random variation in the friendship network formation process. Similar assumptions about cohort
variation are frequently made in the literature, see e.g. Angrist and Lang (2004), Bifulco et al.
(2011), Gould et al. (2004), Hanushek et al. (2002), Hoxby (2000), Lavy and Schlosser (2011) and
Black et al. (2013). The effect of peers are identified under the assumption that parents and their
children do not sort across schools based on differences between the demographic composition of
the child’s cohort and the average composition of the school.
    The outcome of this exercise, reported in the first column of Table 5, clearly shows that the
main results remain unchanged.14
    14
    In an alternative robustness check we exploit the network structure and include network fixed effects. The
estimated coefficients are more noisy in this specification but the results of the analysis are unchanged.


                                                     12
6.2    IV estimates
The potential issue we face is the possible endogeneity of friendships and thus friends’ mothers’
labor market outcomes. Indeed, networks could be formed because of spatial contiguity: people
who live in the same neighborhood are more likely to be in the same social network; they are also
facing the same environment, especially in terms of labor market opportunities (see e.g. Ihlanfeldt,
2006; Gobillon et al., 2007; Bayer et al., 2008; Hellerstein et al., 2011; Zenou, 2013).
    In order to address this concern, we use an instrumental variable strategy that exploits one
interesting feature of the data. Namely, the AddHealth contains longitude and latitude coordinates
of the residential location of each respondent in wave I. Thus we compute an indicator of female
working hours at the block level during teenage years to instrument for friends’ mothers’ hours
worked. This instrument can be justified on the basis of the high geographical mobility of young
adults in the US. The idea is that if a daughter changes residential location after she graduates from
high school, then the labor market characteristics prevailing in her parents’ block should influence
her working hours in adulthood only through the hours worked by her school friends’ mothers.
    The evidence on geographical mobility in the US supports this assumption. For example, based
on the 2007-2009 American Community Survey data, Qian (2012) reports that 84% of 25 to 29 year
old women (roughly corresponding to our sample of adult women) did not live with their parents.
In addition, based on the publicly available Census 2000 data, Qian (2012) documents that by
age 20 to 24 (roughly corresponding to our sample of women in wave III), approximately 70% of
women had left their parental home.15 We can also check directly whether this is also true in
our sample, albeit imperfectly since wave IV does not contain the relevant information. However,
wave III reports information on the distance in kilometers between current residential location and
residential location in wave I. This distance ranges from 0 to 8,000 kilometers, with an average of
183 kilometers (geo-coded information). Thus, we can compute the percentage of students who
moved away from their childhood home between wave I and wave III. We find that more than 70%
of women in our sample (who were 18 to 24 years old in 2001-02) lived more than 1.5 km away
from their (wave I) parental home at the time of the interview.16
    Our instrument is obtained by averaging the hours worked by the mothers among individuals
who reside in the same block as the daughter. Although the data does not contain the real census
block identification for confidentiality reason, it provides a generated code that allows us to identify
individuals living in the same block. We consider the entire sample of Addhealth wave I students
for which this information is available (both males and females).
    Our identification strategy relies not only on time differences between wave I and wave IV (a
depressed area may have not improved that much even in 20 years), but also on spatial differences
  15
    Both figures are from Table 1 in the Appendix of Qian (2012).
  16
    There is, of course, the possibility, that some of them return to their parental home between wave III and wave
IV. On the other end some of these women could leave the parental home between wave III and wave IV.

between the two waves.
   The results of this analysis are reported in column (2) in Table 5. The F-test for the first stage
shows that this instruments is strong. As can be seen, the estimation results remain unchanged.

6.3    Directed networks
Our theoretical model and, consequently, our empirical investigation assume that friendship rela-
tionships are symmetric, i.e. gij = gji . We examine the sensitivity of our results to this assumption,
i.e. to possible measurement error in the definition of the peer group. Indeed, our data make it
possible to know exactly who nominates whom in a network and we find that 12% of relationships
in our dataset are not reciprocal. Thus, instead of constructing undirected network, we also analyze
directed networks.
    In the language of graph theory, in a directed graph, a link has two distinct ends: a head
(the end with an arrow) and a tail. Each end is counted separately. The sum of head endpoints
count toward the indegree and the sum of tail endpoints count toward the outdegree. Formally, we
denote a link from i to j as gij = 1 if j has nominated i as his/her friend, and gij = 0, otherwise.
The indegree of student i, denoted by gi+ , is the number of nominations student i receives from
other students, that is gi+ = j gij . The outdegree of student i, denoted by gi− , is the number
                               P

of friends student i nominates, that is gi− = j gji . We can thus construct two types of directed
                                               P

networks, one based on indegrees and the other based on outdegrees. Observe that, by definition,
while in undirected networks the adjacency matrix G = [gij ] is symmetric, in directed networks it
is asymmetric.
    The results of the estimation of model (6) when the directed nature of the network data is taken
into account17 can be found in Table 5, column (4). Once again our results are unchanged.

6.4    Peer effects
Although our empirical analysis is driven by the theoretical model in Section 2, one empirical
concern could be that friends’ mothers’ behavior simply reflects friends’ behavior. If this is true,
then instead of testing a gender identity formation mechanism, we find evidence of peer effects. At
the very least, we could be overestimating the importance of “peers”.
   To further explore this point we add a standard peer effect variable to specification (6): hours
worked at time t + 1 by women who were in a girl’s friendship network during high school. We
  17
     We report the results that are obtained using outdegree. The results based on indegrees are not qualitatively
different.

also include network fixed effects (as captured by η k ), which control for network-level unobserved
factors.
    The last column of Table 5 (“spatial lag”) reports the estimation results. We find no evidence
of peer effects. Also, our main results are basically unchanged, but the cross term is estimated less
precisely.


7    Preferences vs. human capital production function
There is a concern that our findings can be explained by differences in maternal investment in
market-specific human capital rather than by maternal influences on daughter’s preferences. A
human capital production story would imply that mothers who work more hours also transfer to
their daughters a technology that makes them more productive in the labor market. If this were the
case, then we should observe that, everything else being equal, a daughter’s hourly wages should
be increasing in mother’s working hours. On the other hand, the “preference” story highlighted in
this paper should imply that daughters of mothers who work more hours are more likely to have
more egalitarian gender role attitudes.
    The literature provides evidence that intergenerational gender role attitudes are positively cor-
related. For example, based on NLSY data, Farré and Vella (2007) document a strong association
between a mother’s attitudes towards gender roles and daughter’s gender roles attitudes. They also
show that this cultural transmission influences female labor market decisions. Using General Social
Survey (GSS) data, we find evidence of a general positive correlation between a mother’s labor
force participation when the daughter was 16 years old and the daughter’s gender roles attitudes in
adulthood. More interesting from the point of view of this paper, we find that this is also true for
the cohort of women born between 1978 and 1984 (that is, the Add Health cohort). For this cohort,
we find that 51% of all women whose mother did not work when they were 16 years old agree with
the statement: “It is much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home
and the woman takes care of the home and family”. However, among women whose mother worked,
only 24% agree with the statement. There is a −2.6 difference in average hours worked between
women who agree with the statement vis a vis those who disagree with the statement. This is a
relatively large number, corresponding to 7% of average hours worked by the respondents in the

                                                             15
GSS sample. Interestingly, our estimates for the marginal effects of mother’s working hours and of
the social context are in the same ballpark.
    While this evidence suggests that the preference channel is important, it does not shed light
on the relative importance of the human capital vs. the preference mechanism. Fortunately, the
Add Health data allows for a more direct examination of the relevance of these two alternative
hypotheses. We can use information on hours worked and earnings to obtain an hourly wage
rate. Moreover, wave III (in 2001-2002) contains a key variable for this analysis. Individuals
(who are 18 to 24 years old at the time of the survey) were asked a question aimed to measure
their attitudes towards gender roles. The respondent had to indicate her level of approval to the
following statement (standard in the literature): “It is better for anyone involved if the man earns
more money and the woman takes care of home and family”. The answers were recorded on a 1 to
5 scale, with 1 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree. Based on this information we construct
a binary indicator of egalitarian gender role attitudes that is equal to one if the respondent either
disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement and is equal to zero otherwise.
    We then regress daughter’s hourly wages and the gender role attitude indicator, in turn, on
mother work hours and a full set of controls. The results of this exercise are reported in Table 6.
As shown in columns (1) and (2), we find that a daughter’s propensity to have egalitarian attitudes
towards gender roles is higher, the higher is the mother’s work hours. The point estimate is positive
and significant at the five percent level in the basic specification (column (1)) and it is significant
at the one percent level when we include the same set of controls as in column (3) in Table 2. On
the other hand, as shown in columns (3) and (4), we find that the daughter’s hourly wage is not
correlated with mother’s work hours. Taken together, these results suggest that our findings are
driven by a preference story rather than a human capital production story.

8    Conclusions
In this paper, we study the quantitative importance of early socialization for shaping women’s
gender identity and subsequent work choices. We find that both the same-sex parent’s working hours
and friends’ mothers’ working hours during adolescence are important determinants of gender roles
and labor supply decisions in adulthood. We also find evidence of cross-substitutability between
these two intergenerational channels.
   This paper uses work hours both as the outcome of interest and to measure socialization.
However, though widely used in this literature, weekly work hours are an imperfect indicator of
women’s choices regarding the career-family trade-off. For instance, as discussed in Goldin (2006),
women’s changing economic role has been associated with increasing women’s attachment to the
workplace and greater identity with a career. An interesting avenue of research would be to exploit


                                                  16
information on women’s field of study to examine the impact of early socialization on women’s
career choices. We leave this for future research.

Notes: Sample and sources are defined in the notes to Table 1. Column (1) reports the results of an OLS
regression with grade and school fixed effects. In column (2) friends' mothers' hours are instrumented using the
average hours worked by females in the residential block during teenage years. The interaction term is
instrumented using the interaction between mother's hours worked and our instrument. Angrist-Pischke
multivariate F test=291.52. Column (3) reports the results of a directed network specification. Column (4) reports
the estimation results of a spatial autoregressive model (equation (6)) where the peer effect variable is hours
worked by women who were friends during high school. We report 2SLS estimates (Lee, 2003, 2007). Robust
