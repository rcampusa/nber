Educational Homogamy and Assortative Mating Have Not Increased

December 2016
JEL No. J1,J12

                                         ABSTRACT

Some economists have argued that assortative mating between men and women has increased
over the last several decades, thereby contributing to increased family income inequality.
Sociologists have argued that educational homogamy has increased. We clarify the relation
between the two and, using both the Current Population Surveys and the decennial Censuses/
American Community Survey, show that neither is correct. The former is based on the use of
inappropriate statistical techniques. Both are sensitive to how educational categories are chosen.
We also find no evidence that the correlation between spouses' potential earnings has changed
dramatically.

1        Introduction

    Using standard reduced form techniques, economists have argued that, over the last
several decades, the United States has seen increased positive assortative mating by education
(Greenwood et al., 2014). Sociologists have reached the similar but distinct conclusion that
there has been an increase in educational homogamy, the tendency of men and women to
find mates with the same level of education (Schwartz and Mare, 2005; Mare, 2008).1 In
contrast more structural approaches in economics such as Chiappori et al. (2015), Chade and
Eeckhout (2016) and Siow (2015) have found little evidence for increased positive assortative
mating although Siow does find some support for increased educational homogamy. In this
paper, we reexamine changes in marital sorting and homogamy by education using standard
measures and conclude that there is no compelling evidence of an increase.
    Conclusions about changes in homogamy are sensitive to how educational groups are
defined. In essence, if all college graduates are grouped together, homogamy increased. If
we separate college graduates from those with a more advanced degree as is common in the
wage structure literature (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011), then, if anything, homogamy appears
to have declined.2
    The difficulty with the assortative mating literature is, in part, due to the sensitivity of
the result to the choice of categories, but it is also, to a greater degree, statistical. The ideal
statistic for addressing the degree of assortative mating would be a rank-order correlation
coefficient that works well when there are a large number of ties, as there are in the education
distribution. Unfortunately, none exists. However, if we use either a standard Pearson cor-
relation coefficient or standard rank-order statistics that correct for ties, we find no increase
in the correlation between husband’s and wife’s education regardless of whether we use 5, 6
or 12 categories of education. Only if we use a rank-order correlation coefficient that does
not correct for ties and five categories do we reach the conclusion that the correlation has

increased. We also show that examining the change in the coefficient from a regression of
wife’s education on husband’s education (or vice versa) is not informative.
   Because our analysis is simple and merely statistical, we are able, in some ways, to provide
a broader overview of changes in assortative mating and homogamy that complements the
work of Chiappori, Salanie and Weiss and of Siow. We use both the Current Population
Surveys and the decennial Censuses and American Community Surveys. We examine the
evolution of educational homogamy both within and between cohorts and, depending on the
question, examine changes over a period of up to fifty years.
   These findings are important for two reasons. First, there is a growing concern about
increasing income inequality (Esping-Andersen, 2007; Kenworthy, 2004) and its intergener-
ational reproduction (Chadwick and Solon, 2002). Family income disparity in the U.S. has
widened sharply over the last several decades (Levy, 1998). Between 1980 and 2009, the
share of aggregate income received by the lowest fifth families fell from 5.3 percent to 3.9
percent, while for the top five percent families it increased from 14.6 to 20.7 percent (U.S.
Census Bureau, Historical Income Tables, table F.2). Rising rates of assortative mating are
a potential explanation for some of this rise.
   Second, they cast light on our theories of marriage. In Becker’s (1974; 1981) theory
of marriage, likes marry likes when the characteristic is complementary but not when it is
substitutable. Education is likely to be complementary in consumption. But when women
are not in the labor force, they are substitutes: high-skill men should marry low-skill women
who then specialize in home production. Which of these two forces should dominate is un-
clear. But as women increasingly entered the labor force, the importance of complementarity
should have increased, a point made somewhat differently by Stevenson and Wolfers (2007).
Therefore, we would expect either educational homogamy or assortative mating (we discuss
the distinction below) or both to increase in the light of the growth in women’s labor force
participation.
   In addition, earnings differentials by education have increased, especially since the late


                                                 2
1970s (Goldin and Katz, 2000; Katz and Autor, 1999; Gottschalk, 1997; Katz and Murphy,
1992). To the extent that household income is used to purchase public goods such as quality
child-care, this, too, creates pressure for positive assortative mating. Fernandez et al. (2005)
establish this in an overlapping generations model and suggest a feedback mechanism between
income inequality across education groups and assortative marriage in which “..[an] increase
in inequality increases sorting by making skilled workers less willing to form households with
unskilled workers ...” which, in turn, further increases inequality in the next generation to
the extent that children inherit the educational characteristics of their parents.



2     Conceptual Background

    The purpose of the section is primarily pedagogical. We believe the results in this section
are known but underappreciated, at least by those who, like us, are not steeped in the
theoretical literature. Therefore we have eschewed the more standard section title, “Theory.”
We examine the relation among homophily, which we interpret as a property of tastes or the
utility function, and homogamy and assortative mating, which are the equilibrium outcomes
of a process that pairs mates. We refer anyone interested in a more thorough examination
of the literature to excellent reviews by Chade et al. (2016) and Browning et al. (2014).
    Consider two groups of equal mass, which we will call X and Y (although the reader
may wish to think of them as XX and XY ). For the moment, we will assume that each
individual i is endowed with a fixed amount of some characteristic, zi . For simplicity, we
will assume that the distribution of z within each group is uniformly distributed:


                                         zig ˜U (0, zg∗ )                                   (1)


with zy∗ > zx∗ .
    Let us now consider equilibrium matching in a case of strong homophily. Individuals
may match with exactly one individual from the other group, or they may choose to remain

                                                3
unmatched. The utility of an individual is given by


                                 Ui = V − (zix − ziy )2 if matched
                                                                           .                             (2)
                                             0               otherwise


    Note that there is no money in the example. In technical terms, utility is strictly not
transferable.3 Each individual prefers to match with someone with the same level of z but
not all will be able to do so.4 A proportion zy∗ − zx∗ /zy∗ of Y workers will clearly not be
                                                      

able to match with an X with the same characteristic because no such X exists. And the
same proportion of Xs at each level of z are “surplus” matches. These surplus individuals
will be sorted negatively so that within any match


                                              zix + ziy = zy∗                                            (3)


if V > zy∗2 .5
    It may seem surprising that an X with z = 0 matches with a Y with z = zy∗ . After all,
the former strictly prefers to match with a Y with zx∗ and values doing so more than does the
excess X with z = zx∗ who actually makes that match. But the Y with zx∗ strictly prefers the
latter match, and there is no mechanism that allows the unfortunate excess X with z = 0 to
convince him otherwise.6 Note that we have abstracted from the search process. To consider
costly search would take us too far afield, require us to choose a search technology and be
far more technical than is commensurate with our goal for this section. In general, we would
expect types on the long side of their market to consider searching in proximate markets on
which they are on the short side. Arcidiacono et al. (2016) provide one specification of such
a model.

   3
     Similar issues arise if there is some ability to transfer utility within marriage but the parties cannot
make binding commitments prior to marriage (Lundberg and Pollak, 2008, see).
   4
     The example thus violates the condition in Legros and Newman (2010) for positive assortative mating
even under strict nontransferable utility.
   6
     One can think of this in terms of the deferred acceptance algorithm which leads to a stable matching
equilibrium (Roth and Sotomayor, 1990).


                                                     4
   Our first point is a simple one: the matching pattern depends on the matching technology
as well as tastes. Let us modify our example somewhat. Assume that each individual is
endowed with some amount of money, m, measured in units of some private good and that
utility is linear in the private good. Then utility is transferable7 provided m is sufficiently
large, and therefore matching will be efficient so that

                                                     zy∗
                                             ziy =       zix ,
                                                     zx∗

and there will be a set of transfers of the private good between matched individuals that will
support the equilibrium.8
   We note that while we have presented the two cases as differing with respect to the
transferability of utility, they can also be interpreted as differing in the importance of ho-
mophily. As individuals put more weight on being matched with someone similar, the ability
of transfers to overcome their preferences diminishes.
   This leads to our second point: without a model of the matching process, we cannot
infer differences in homophily from differences in the extent of assortative matching. For an
example of a paper that uses an explicit model, see Chiappori et al. (2015).


2.1     Measuring Changes in Homogamy

   Now consider the question of whether homogamy is greater with or without transferable
utility in the example. Here we show our third simple point: our conclusions about whether
homogamy has increased or decreased can be very sensitive to our definition of “similar.” In
the example without transferable utility a fraction zx∗ /zy∗ of matches are exact in the sense
that zix − ziy = 0. With transferable utility, the set of matches with this characteristic has
measure zero. On the other hand, with transferable utility there is more homogamy in the


   7
      Legros and Newman (2007) provide more general conditions which allow for nontransferable, but not
strictly nontransferable, utility.
    8
      That efficiency requires strictly positive assortative mating is readily verified.


                                                     5
sense that
                                      ziy − zix ≤ zy∗ − zx∗ .

In contrast, the maximum gap without transferable utility is much larger. In practice, social
scientists who have measured homogamy by education have defined homogamous marriages
as those in which the educations of the partners lie in the same interval (e.g. less than high
school, high school, more than high school). The argument goes through with some changes;
which setting has more homogamy depends on the choice of categories.
   In the empirical work below, we show that estimates of whether and how homogamy has
changed are, indeed, sensitive to how we define education categories.
   Finally, we note that measured homogamy can be sensitive to shifts in the underlying
distributions of the characteristics. In either of our two cases, there is perfect homogamy if
zx∗ = zy∗ but homogamy is less than perfect otherwise. Thus again, we can observe a shift in
homogamy with no change in the underlying utility functions or matching technology.
   We will discuss below technical issues associated with measuring assortative mating in
real data. However, in the examples here, it is relatively straightforward. In the case where
utility is not transferable, the correlation, however measured, between zx and zy is imperfect
while it is perfect with transferable utility. Still, it is important to recognize that, at least
in the case of nontransferable or imperfectly transferable utility, the degree of assortative
mating can depend on the distributions of z.


2.2    Nonmarriage

   In our empirical work, we will, for the most part, ignore individuals whose marital status
is other than married. Here we simply point out that changes in who marries are not at a
very simple level consistent with increased homophily. When homophily is important and
generates homogamy, the groups in excess supply, ys with high z and xs with low z are the
least likely to get married. During our time period, women went from being a minority to



                                                6
being a majority of the college graduates (Goldin et al., 2006). As a consequence, we should
have seen a decline in the marriage rate of college-educated women. This would be reinforced
if homophily increased. In fact, the large decline in the marriage rate is at the bottom of the
female skill distribution, which is more consistent with the rising value of educated women
discussed in the introduction (see Figure 1).



3     Measuring Changes in Assortative Matching

    Many economists are less interested in why matching might have changed than in whether
it has changed since increased assortative mating would increase family income inequality.
It is important to know whether increased earnings inequality has been exacerbated or mit-
igated by changes in marriage patterns.
    In the previous section, we assumed that the underlying trait was uniformly distributed
for both Xs and Y s. As a consequence, with perfect assortative matching, the correlation
between the partners’ educations’ was also perfect. In reality, of course, there is no reason to
expect the education distributions to be drawn from the same family. Moreover, education
tends to be very lumpy.
    Although economists tend to use correlation measures such as the Pearson correlation
coefficient (r) or its square (R2 ), it is more natural to use measures based on rank. Assortative
matching is perfect if the individual with the highest value of z in the X group is matched
with the individual with the highest z among the Y s, the second highest in each group are
matched, and so on. Nothing in this description depends on being able to write ziy as a
linear function of zix .
    It may therefore be more appropriate to use a correlation measure designed for ordered
data and that does not rely on the interval properties of the data. The Spearman rank-
order correlation coefficient asks precisely how closely two variables are correlated when
they are rescaled by their rank. This metric is the most natural one for us to use because it



                                                7
corresponds strongly to the idea of correlation of ranks. Unfortunately, it does not perform
particularly well in the presence of ties, of which there are many in the data.
   Kendall’s τ (sometimes called τa ) asks, when comparing any two observations, whether
both variables are ranked the same way. In other words, if the husband in pair x has more
education than the husband in pair y, does the wife in x also have more education than the
wife in y. If the answer is that she has more education, the pair is concordant. If she has less,
it is discordant. τ is given by the ratio of the difference between the number of concordant
and discordant pairs to the number of pairs. However, if husbands x and y (or wives x and y)
have the same education, pairs can be neither concordant or discordant. Therefore, if there
are many ties, it is impossible to obtain a correlation near 1 or −1. When there are ties, τ
must be adjusted to take this into account. The adjusted statistic developed by Kendall is
τb . Unfortunately even this statistic does not have good properties when there are many ties,
as there are in education data. An alternative approach, Goodman and Kruskal’s γ, simply
drops ties and bases its estimate on those observations that can be ranked. This approach
has the advantage that if two variables are, in fact, perfectly rank correlated in the absence
of grouping, they will continue to be so when grouped.
   To cast some light on how the presence of ties and the changing distributions of husbands’
and wives’ educations affect the various measures, we took the distributions of their educa-
tions at age 30 in 1960 and 2010 and assumed that they were perfectly sorted. In other words,
all wives who were high school dropouts married husbands who were high school dropouts.
The excess male high school dropouts married women who were high school graduates, and
so on.
   How did the various measures fare? Despite the ordinality of the data and the large
number of ties, the standard Pearson correlation statistic does quite well, falling from .96
in 1960 to .93 in 2010 (table 1). Spearman’s ρ also shows a very high correlation, which
is identical to the Pearson statistic to two decimal places in both periods. In contrast, τa
performs poorly although it shows a similar absolute decline from .71 to .68. Once we correct


                                               8
for ties in the form of τb , the estimated correlations are only slightly lower (.93 and .88) than
those observed using Pearson’s r and Spearman’s ρ. By the design of the ‘experiment,’
Goodman and Kruskal’s γ is 1.00 in both periods.
   For completeness, we will present τa , but based on both their theoretical superiority and
better performance in our experiment, we focus on r, ρ, τb and γ.
   One approach that is sometimes used but should not be is to examine how regression
coefficients change over time. To see this, let us return to our example with transferable
utility and therefore perfect assortative mating. The regression of zy on zx is given by

                                                      zy∗
                                         zy = 0 +         zx .
                                                      zx∗

In this special case, the regression coefficient depends only on the relative magnitudes of the
top of the z distributions.
   More generally, the Pearson correlation coefficient is

                                                  σxy
                                            ρ=
                                                 σx σy

while the regression coefficient is

                                                σxy
                                          β =
                                                σx2
                                                σy
                                              =    ρ.
                                                σx

In other words, while an increase in the regression coefficient can reflect an increase in the
Pearson correlation coefficient, it can also reflect an increase in the variance of women’s
educational attainment relative to the variance of men’s education. A simple check is to
estimate the reverse regression since

                                                     σx
                                           βR =         ρ.
                                                     σy


                                                 9
We will see that, as they must, since the Pearson correlation coefficient is roughly constant,
regressing wife’s education on husband’s education and the reverse give opposite results.



4     Data

    We rely on two data sets for our analysis. Although we show results from both of our
data sources, our reconsideration of educational homogamy relies primarily on the March
Current Population Surveys from 1970 through 2010 as standardized by IPUMS-CPS. The
advantage of the CPS for this part of the analysis is that we can clearly attribute a break
in the level of homogamy to a change in the coding of the education variable. For this
part of the analysis, we limit the data to married non-interracial white and black couples in
which the wife was aged 35-44 at the time of the survey. We have replicated most of our
results using only white couples and get similar results (available upon request). Because
imputation flags for education are available only after 1987, for consistency we keep imputed
values. This gives us 324,717 couples. In addition because it is unclear what weights would
be correct, we provide unweighted estimates. However, our experimentation suggests that
the choice of weights has little effect on the results.
    For the analysis of assortative mating, for consistency with the prior literature, we rely
primarily on the 1960-2000 decennial censuses and the 2010 American Community Survey
as standardized by IPUMS-USA, but replicate the results using the CPS. We keep non-
interracial white and black married couples. We drop observations with any type of imputa-
tion for race, education, or wife’s age (flag variables for race and education are not available
for the 1960 census). Again we report unweighted results. We created the six-category mea-
sure of educational attainment using the following: fewer than 10 years of schooling; 10 to
11 years of schooling; 12 years/high school graduate; 1 to 3 years of college completed (some
college, no degree or associate degree); 4 years of college/Bachelor’s degree; more than 4
years of college (Master’s, professional, or doctoral degree). We created the twelve-category



                                               10
measure of educational attainment using the following recoding: No School completed, Nurs-
ery School, Kindergarten = 0 years; 1st through 4th grade = 2.5 years; 5th through 8th grade
=6.5 years; 9th grade = 9 years; 10th grade = 10 years: 11th grade = 11 years; 12th grade,
high school graduate, GED or Some college, but less than 1 year= 12 years; Some college,
no degree = 13 years; Associate degree or two years of college = 14 years; Three years of
college = 15 years; Bachelor’s degree = 16 years; Master’s degree, professional or doctorate
degree = 17 years.
   A subset of the basic matching information using the census data is provided in table 2
which shows the percentage with different combinations of education using six categories of
education among couples age 30-34. We will use these data primarily to examine assortative
mating. Nevertheless, we note that we do see a very small increase in homogamy between
1960 (the 1926-30 cohort) and 1990 (the 1956-60 cohort). There is a large increase between
1990 and 2000 (the 1966-1970) cohort which is then reversed between 2000 and 2010. As
noted above, we rely primarily on the CPS when we analyze homogamy. This is because cod-
ing changes across censuses are particularly problematic for the analysis of homogamy. From
1960 to 1980 educational attainment was measured using a question about years of schooling.
By contrast, in the post-1980 censuses and the ACS, a person’s educational attainment was
coded in a very different way, using a credential-attained question. Additionally, all samples
in and after 2000 contain the detailed category “Some college, but less than 1 year” which
appears to have been treated as “completed high school” in other years. The change in the
census question content introduces some discontinuities in the data series. Changes in sort-
ing patterns between 1980 and 1990, as well as between 1990 and 2000 should be interpreted
with some caution.

5.1    Educational Homogamy

    In this sub-section we examine the sensitivity of the pattern of homogamy to the use
of different grouping criteria. There are, in our assessment, potentially twelve categories
that can be determined consistently over the entire period. Moreover, there is no pair of
adjacent groups in which both husband and wife fall (e.g. both husband and wife are in
one of the two groups 5th or 6th grade education or 7th or 8th grade education) for which
wife’s education is not predictive of husband’s education. For example, among wives with
educational attainment of 5th through 8th grades and whose husband has a 5th through 8th
grade education, wives with a 7th or 8th grade education are more likely to be married to
a man with a 7th or 8th grade education than are wives with a 5th or 6th grade education.
The decision to combine categories depends largely on issues of sample size and introspection
about what are likely to be important social cleavages.
    We note that there was a substantial change in the distribution of education over the
period we study. In 1970, over half of wives age 35-44 were high school dropouts. Many of
these had less than a 10th grade education. Similarly over 60 percent of their husbands had
not completed high school and roughly one-quarter had less than a 10th grade education. In
contrast, only 2 percent of the wives and 8 percent of the husbands had more than four years
of college. From the perspective of 1970, it seems plausible that we should divide dropouts
into two groups but combine all college graduates.
    However, by 2010, the situation had changed substantially. Individuals with less than
a 10th grade education were relatively rare, about 5 percent of both husbands and wives,
and only about 3 percent of each group had a 10th or 11th grade education. In contrast, 14
percent of each group had gone beyond four years of college. From the perspective of 2010,
it seems plausible that we should divide college graduates into two groups but combine all
dropouts.


                                             12
    Following the sociological literature, we define homogamous marriages as those in which
husband and wife fall into the same education category. To test the sensitivity to choice
of categories of estimates of the trend in homogamy, we experiment with the four possible
decisions regarding combining or separating the two dropout categories and similarly for the
two college graduate categories.
    Before we do so, however, it is important to point out that, regardless of our choice of
categories, the scope for homogamous matches increased substantially between 1970 and 2010
because the education distributions had become much more similar. In 1970, 47.88 percent
of the wives were high school graduates with no additional education compared with only
34.83 percent of the husbands. This alone reduces the potential proportion of homogamous
marriages to 86.95%. Similar considerations, reduce this maximum to 84.63 percent for some
choices of categories. In contrast, in 2010, there is no large discrepancy in the proportion
of husbands and wives in any education category. Consequently, depending on the choice
of categories, between 94.33 and 94.63 percent of marriages could be homogamous. Under
these circumstances, it would not be surprising to see homogamy increasing even with no
change in preferences.
    Figure 2 shows the trends in homogamy for the four choices of categories. In is evident
that different education group definitions suggest different conclusions about the pattern
of homogamy. If we follow Schwartz and Mare and categorize educational attainment as
follows (Schwartz and Mare, 2005): ≺ 10; 10-11; 12-high school graduates; 13-15-have some
college; 16+-at least college graduates (i.e. we combine the high-education groups), the
trend (dashed line, triangle markers) shows a steady increase in the proportion of husbands
and wives with the same education levels, from 48 to 57 percent between 1970 and 2010.
However, if we separate those with a college degree from those with a more advanced degree9
(solid line, triangle markers), the previous conclusion no longer holds: homogamy seems to
have remained rather stable, a 2 percentage point increase across four decades almost all of
   9
     Six distinct groups: ≺ 10; 10-11; 12-high school graduates; 13-15-have some college; 16-college graduates;
and, 16+-post-graduates.


                                                      13
which is attributable to a jump around 1992 and therefore possibly due to the change in the
education variable in the Current Population Survey. Note that sharp jumps over a small
number of years are highly implausible. We are using 35-44 and thus losing and gaining
only about one-tenth of the age group each year. Barring very high rates of divorce and/or
remarriage, changes in homogamy should be gradual.
   Interestingly, homogamy, if anything, appears to have declined when the groups are
defined as is common in the wage structure literature (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011), separating
the college graduates from those having a more advanced degree, and merging the high school
dropouts (solid line, x markers): ≺ 12-high school dropouts; 12-high school graduates; 13-
15-have some college; 16-college graduates; and, 16+-post-graduates. This is considered
the most appropriate grouping reflecting the educational heterogeneity and the well-chosen
attainment levels with a socioeconomic significance when the fraction of college graduates
holding a postgraduate degree has dramatically increased over time (Card and Lemieux,
2001), while ≺ 10 category is shrinking among high school dropouts. Thus, by grouping
together all those with at least a college degree, studies overlook a significant source of
educational diversity and overrate the increase in homogamy over time. For completeness, a
series in which those that are at least college graduates are grouped together but those that
are high school dropouts are disaggregated is shown. Homogamy rates rise but modestly
(dashed line, x markers).
   We largely confirm the visual analysis with the regression results show in table 3. In each
case, we regress the homogamy measure on a time trend and a dummy variables for 1992
and later to allow for the possibility that the variable change increased measured homogamy.
In column 1, we collapse the two highest education categories and find no effect of the 1992
change but an increasing trend in homogamy of about one-quarter percent per year. In
contrast, when we do not combine these two categories, the coefficient falls by almost an
order of magnitude. The implied increase in homogamy over the forty years is less than two
percentage points. Most of the change can be attributed to a one-time modification of the


                                             14
Current Population Survey.
   When we combine the two groups of high school dropouts, we again find a large effect
of the question change, but our conclusion about the time trend is reversed. As might be
expected, combining both categories produces an intermediate result, with only a modest
upward trend in homogamy.


5.2    Assortative Matching over the Life Cycle and across Cohorts

   Table 4 shows the correlation between wives’ and husbands’ education using the measures
discussed earlier (Kendall’s τa and τb , Goodman and Kruskal’s γ, Pearson correlation r, and,
Spearman’s rank correlation ρ) for five cohorts and three age groups. In the upper panel, we
group education into six categories (≺ 10; 10-11; 12-high school graduates; 13-15-have some
college; 16-college graduates; and, 16+-post-graduates). Using all levels of education at the
lowest possible level of aggregation (twelve categories - Panel (b)) gives similar patterns of
correlation.
   The broad picture from the table does not support the conclusion that the correlation
between husbands’ and wives’ education has increased. The largest changes in the data are
an increase of .04 for 30-34 year old women between the 1926-30 and 1966-70 cohorts using
γ and a decrease of .05 for 50-54 year old women between the 1926-30 and 1956-60 cohorts
using γ, τb , and ρ.
   For 30-34 year olds, all five measures show a pattern of increasing correlation between
the 1926-30 and 1946-50 cohorts followed by a decline in the correlation between the later
cohort and the 1966-70 cohort. However, the changes are not large. The two rank-order
correlation measures that adjust for ties suggest an increase of .02 (τb and γ) while the
Pearson correlation shows an increase of .01 (r) over the full period, none of which is large.
And since all the measures can be influenced by changes in the distribution of education, we
conclude that there is little evidence of an increase in correlation over the entire period.
   For women aged 40-44 years, the results are largely similar. All measures show a modest


                                              15
increase in the correlation between the 1926-30 and 1946-50 cohorts and, a decline between
the 1946-50 and 1966-70. None of the correlation measures shows a large change over the full
period. Again, the most plausible measures τb , γ, ρ, and, r give no evidence of a long-term
trend, with one showing no trend over the period, one showing a decrease of .02 and two
showing a decline of .01. Given the limitations of the measures, we again conclude that there
is little evidence to support an increase in assortative mating across cohorts.
   When we look at the data for 50-54 year old women, a clear pattern emerges. Although
we can only follow this age group through the 1956-60 cohort, using every measure, we
detect a decline in the correlation between husbands’ and wives’ educations. These declines
are most notable using the preferred measures (τb : −.05; γ : −.05; ρ : −.05; r : −.04).
   Table 5 repeats the analysis using the data from the censuses and the 2010 ACS. We will
not repeat the summary of the table. With only relatively minor differences, the two data
sets reveal the same patterns.
   In recent generations, women with a college degree increasingly delayed marriage to older
ages, and to a greater extent, than women with either a high school degree or some college
(Goldin, 2004). Delayed marriages and rising divorce rates for much of the 20th century
(Stevenson and Wolfers, 2007) contribute to thicker marriage markets later in life. As such,
one might suspect differences in assortative mating over the life cycle. However, the earlier
cohorts also show considerable stability over the life-cycle. If anything, we see some increase
in assortative matching between 1970 and 1980 for the oldest cohort in table 4. All measures
increase slightly, generally by .01, but table 5, using the CPS shows slight decreases. In
contrast, using the censuses, there is some slight evidence of decreasing assortative matching
for the 1936-40 cohort between 1980 and 1990. All the measures of correlation fall but
the changes are very small, but again this does not hold up using the CPS. For the three
youngest cohorts, we see fairly consistent evidence of small declines in assortative matching
as the cohort ages from its early 30s to its early 40s. However, the declines are generally
modest (0.03). A similar pattern holds in the CPS.


                                              16
   Our results differ markedly from Greenwood et al. (2014) who find a sharp increase
in τa using five educational categories and 25-54 year olds from 1960 to 2002. We have
largely replicated their results on our cenus/ACS data. In our estimates this one measure of
correlation increases markedly from .32 to .37 from 1960 to 2010. However, r drops by .01;
γ drops by .08; τb drops by .02, and ρ increases by a mere .01.10


5.3       Regression and Reverse Regression

   We consider the regression between a wife’s educational level and her husband’s, as in
Greenwood et al. (2014). They regress wife’s education on husband’s education and find that
the coefficient on husband’s education has increased noticeably. We present similar results
in the first (and third) column of table 6, which shows the results of estimating the following
equation for married couple j, observed in year t:


                       eduw               h                           h
                          jt = c1 + α1 edujt + Σt=1970,...,2010 βt edujt + λt + 1jt ,      (4)


where eduw         h
         jt and edujt are the wife’s and the husband’s education,
                                                                 11
                                                                    respectively; husband’s
effect varies by year; and λt is a vector of year effects.
   However, as discussed above, since the coefficient on spouse’s education is the covariance
between the education levels divided by the variance of the right-hand-side spouse’s educa-
tion, the regression coefficient can increase if either the covariance of education increases or
the variance of the right-hand-side spouses education declines. Moreover, we have already
seen that ρ, the Pearson correlation between the spouse’s education levels, was roughly con-
stant over this period. Combining the constancy of ρ with the increase in β tells us that the
variance of husbands’ education increased relative to the variances of wives’ education.

       We estimated the equations using both six and twelve education categories.


                                                     17
      Therefore, if we regress wife’s education on husband’s education:


                    eduhjt = c2 + α2 eduw                      R    w     R
                                        jt + Σt=1970,...,2010 βt edujt + λt + 2jt ,             (5)


where the variables and parameters are defined analogously to those in (4), we expect that
β R will be decreasing over time, which is confirmed in the second (and forth) column of table
6.
      Table 7 replicates these results using the CPS. The results are, if anything, stronger.
      In sum, the regression results do not support the view that assortative matching has
increased.


5.4       Wages or Education?

      The increased wage inequality starting during the 1970s and the rapid increase in the
labor force participation of married women could have increased assortative mating on wages
even if there was no increase in sorting based on education. Measuring assortative mating
on wages is challenging because there is still significant nonparticipation by married women.
      Therefore we do not fully address this question. Instead we ask whether, given the neg-
ligible trends on sorting on education that we observe, increasing returns to education could
nevertheless have increased the correlation of wages. Note that assortative mating is essen-
tially an ordinal concept. Do the individuals with the highest values of some characteristic
marry each other? Changes in the distribution of the underlying characteristics do not change
sorting (except for issues related to ties). If the characteristics have no mass points and we
replace the characteristic, x, by exp (x) , the correlation between spouses characteristics can
change even if who marries whom does not.
      We undertake an exercise similar to Gonalons-Pons and Schwartz (2015) in which we
assign each spouse the mean earnings of workers his/her year/race/sex/education/age cell.12

     12
    In contrast to Gonalons-Pons and Schwartz, we do not condition on occupation which may be endoge-
nous to the matching outcome.


                                                  18
We perform this calculation using both six and twelve education categories. We then calcu-
late the Pearson correlation coefficient by age category (30-34, 40-44, 50-54) for 1960, 1970,
1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010 using the decennial Censuses and the ACS.
    Consistent with declining wage inequality between 1960 and 1970, we observe either a
decline in the correlation or no change whether we look within a cohort or across cohorts in
the same age range (see table 8). Between 1970 and 1980 and between 1980 and 1990, the
pattern is somewhat inconsistent. Between 1990 and 2000, we observe either an increase in
the correlation or no change. However, none of the observed changes appears to be large.
The largest absolute change in correlation we observe is using six education categories for
the cohort born in 1946-50 for which the correlation increased from .494 to .556 between
1980 when they were 30-34 and 1990 when they were 40-44.
    Thus we find little evidence of large changes in the correlation of spouses’ potential
earnings.



6     Conclusion

    Our results show clearly that with appropriate statistical techniques, there is no evi-
dence that assortative mating based on education has changed substantially over the last
fifty years. Evidence for increased homogamy is very sensitive to how we define education
categories. Overall, we conclude that there is little evidence to support the conclusion that
such homogamy has increased. The absence of an increase in assortative mating based on
educational attainment does not preclude increased assortative mating based on potential
earnings, but it would be somewhat surprising to find no increase in sorting on education
if there had been a dramatic increase in sorting on potential earnings. At the same time,
it is also important to distinguish between sorting, which is a largely ordinal concept, and
correlation which is cardinal. Changes in the distribution of wages can change the correlation
between spouses’ earning even in the absence of a change in sorting. We do not address this



                                             19
directly but do show that when we assign individuals the mean earnings of full-time/year-
round workers with similar characteristics, there do not seem to be large changes in the
correlation of wages.

Notes - The educational attainment distributions at age 30 by sex are derived from the 1960 American Census of Population,
and 2010 American Community Survey. Sample consists of white and black individuals. Given these distributions, we start
with a population of 100 individuals of each sex, and assuming perfect sorting build a hypothetical distribution of wives’ and
husbands’ education across the two cohorts (1930 and 1980). Finally, we compute the different correlations. r - Pearson’s r; γ
- Goodman and Kruskal’s gamma; τa and τb - Kendall’s tau a and b; ρ - Spearman’s rho. Six education categories: 0-9 years;
10 - 11 years; 12 years/High school degree (HS); Some college (SC); 4 year of college (CG); 4+ years of college (PC).
