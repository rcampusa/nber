           ASSESSING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF INFORMATION
     TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT IN U.S. MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES

                             ABSTRACT

     In this paper we report results of an empirical assessment

of the cost reducing impacts of recent dramatic increases in

stocks of "high—tech" office and information technology equipment

(0) using annual data from various two digit US manufacturing
industries over the 1952—1986 time period.

     While there are exceptions, on balance we find that in 1986,

estimated marginal benefits of investments in this 0 equipment

are less than marginal costs, implying over investment in 0

capital in 1986. Ihe sign of the estiaated elasticity of demand
for labor with respect to changes in the stock of 0 capital is

evenly divided in the fourteen industries, but whether positive

or negative, in all industries this elasticity increases in

absolute magnitude over time, indicating ever greater impacts of
0 capital on the demand for aggregate labor. Finally, our
estimates of the elasticity of technical progress with respect to

0—capital are very small in magnitude implying that increases in

o capital have only a small impact on technical progreaa.

1.    INTRODUCTION

       The last two decades have witnessed an explosion in the amount of Thigh

tech" computer power and inforatation technology equipment purchased by

American firms and businesses. Yet it has been difficult to establish that

the extent of such investments can ho rationalized in terms of realised cost

savings. Indeed, a common perception is that this dramatic increase in office

and information technology equipment has not had a commensurate impact on

firms' cost and productivity performance. As Martin N. Boily and Robert 3.

Gordon have described this situation ",.            efticin],   data show enormous

productivity   gains in   the sianufac tore     of ainputers,   but apparently ii trle

productivity improvement iii     theit   use.

       In this paper we report results obtained in a study based on the

economic theory of cost and production that atteapto to assess the shadow

value of office and information technology equipment in U.S. manufacturing

industries, that quantifies the effects of this equipment on the demand for

labor and other inputs, and that examines the relationship between changes in

the stocks of this equipment and technical progress.

       Precisely how one identifies and documents cost savings attained by

investments in computer power is not clear. Within a given establishment, for

cxaaplo, cost savings achieved in one division or line of business might be

offset by increased costs in another; further comptexities con emerge for

multi-establishment firms. Pcesunshiy, therefore, it makes more sense to look

for cost reductions at the overall firm level, or perhaps even at an aggregate

industry level. The lack of sufficiently reliable data at the iirei level,
      INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS AND PRODUCTIVITY CROWTR          Page 2 -
however, suggests that analyses of the    effects   of investment in computer power

might by necessity be confined to aggregate industry studies.

        At the industry level, official productivity statistics indicate that

over the last fifteen years the prcductivity growth record of US manufacturing

industries has been much better than that for non-manufacturing industries,2

due perhsps to difficult ptoblema in measuring output in con-manufacturing

industries, especially in the service sectori. If investments in office and

information technology equipment have been prcductive, and given that the

manufacturing industries have demonstrated core rapid productivity growth, one

could argue that one would he most likely to identify and measure the effects

ef office and information technology investments by examining the productivity

performance within and between various manufacturing industries.3 That is

what we attempt to accomplish in this paper.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follcwa. In Section II we

provide some further background discussion, in Section III we outline the

theoretical   framework, in   Section IV we present empirical findings, and in

Section V we aummarize and suggest avenues for further research.



II.     BACKCROUND

        A great deal of research and discussion has taken place en documenting

end interpreting the effects of the expiosico in computer power. For example,

Timothy Bresnahan [198€] has measured spillovers frcu mainframe computers in

financial services, Csry Loveman [t988[ has examined interactions between

information technology capital and lahor prndtictiv y growth at tiLe line-of-

business level of aggregation, grik 3ryojolfsson and associates [1989] have

examined    the effects of information techoology equipment on docontralization
 mnd firm size, H. Allan Hunt and Timothy L. Hunt      [1986]   and Paul Osteraan
 [1986] have analyzed the irpacts of ccuiputers on the employment of managers

                                                                           Page   3   -
and clerical personnel, and Leonard Dudley and Pierre Lasserre [1989] have

examined the effects of increased information on    inventory   costs and inventory

holdings. Wide-ranging analyses on the effects of increased office and

information technology eqoipsent have also been undertaken by Martin N. Baily

[1986], Baily and Alok K, Chakraharti [1968], Michael L. Dertooros, Richard K.

Lester and Robert N. Solow [1990], Stephen S. Roach [1987]. and hy Lester C.

Thorow [1987].

       Although each of these studies has focused on important and interesting

aspects °f the explosion of computer power, to the best of our knowledge none

baa attempted to quantify the actual marginal benefits (in our framework, the

shadow values) of investments in office and information technology equipaent,

and   then coepared thea with the marginal costs of such investments.      The

approach   we take in this paper is to do jost that . . compute marginal benefits
and marginal costs, compare thea, and assess hoo benefIts are revealed in
terms of decreased demands for labor, energy and/or intermediate materials.
       Before proceeding with a discussion oi our theoretical     framework, we

believe    it is useful to begin by documenting the dramatic changes in
investment behavior that US manufacturing firms have displayed in the last
decade. As a definitional matter, we define office and information technology
equipment 0 as a composite of "high-tech" equipment, imcloding office,
computing and accounting machinery, commonications equipment, scientific and
engineering   instruments, and photocopy and related equipment. We define
equipment R as non-D producers' durable eqofpment,   and structures i as non-

residential structures.

        In the first two columns of Table 1, aggregate capital-output ratios are

presented, where both capital and output are in 1971$, and aggregate K is a

simple aWe of stocks of E, S and 0. As is seen there, in all industries

except lumber and wood, the aggregate capital-output ratio has increased in

the    last decade implying that       manufacturing   industries have undertaken
substantial net        investment and capital deepening from 1976 to 1966.

         Net enly has the aggregate capital-output ratio increased since 1976,

but    the composition of the aggregate capital stock has also changed
substantially. In particular, in all manufacturing industries, the (non high-
tech) equipment share of the aggregate capital stock has fallen, while the
share    of high-tech office and information technology equipment has increased,

often dramatically, e.g. ,       in   clay the 0 share has increased from 6 to 391, in

furniture and fixtures from 2 to l3Z, in printing and publishing from 9 to

43%, and in transportation equipment from 7 to 37%. The share of structures

in total fixed capital stock decreased in 12 of the 14 industries, and

increased slightly in the remainng two.

         The increasing share of office and information technology equipnient in

manufacturing industries' total capital stock since 1976 reflects of course

the correspondingly increasing share of 0 in total investment. This is

demonstrated in the final three columns of Table 1, where it is seen that the

1986 share of 0 investment in total F + S + 0 inveateent is larger than the

corresponding share of 0 in the total E + S + 0 capital stock for all

industries except iron and steel. Moreover, in sose industries the 0 share of

total investment in 1986 is very large, e.g., 671 in clay and BOX in

machinery.

         In brief, the invcstnent and capital stock data indicate quite clearly

thnn    4.' a]mecfr   1 1 415 manufacturing   industries, not only has the aggregate

capital-output ratio increased implying enhanced capital intensity, but the

share of office and information technology equipment in the total capital

stock has also increased chraaarically since 1976.

         With this overview of data trends in mind, we now present a model in

which the impacts of these investments in 0 capital can be assessed

qoantitstively.

ill    THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

       To assess the impacts on costs and productivity of investment in office

and information technology capital (0), we employ the economic theory of cost

and production. More specifically, we begin by specifying a variable cost

function inclusive of adjustment costs, having the general form G(Y,t,x,Ax,p),

where x and Ax are 3x1 vectcrs denoting capital. stock levels and absolute

values of net investment in fixed inputs (E --                     producers'   durable equipment

other than 0, S --       non-residential           structures, and 0), p is a 3x1 vector of

variable    input prices (N              cncrgy M - - non-energy intermediate           matarials and
purchased    services, and L - -         lsbor)    ,   I is gross output, and t is      s time

counter    representing disembodied technical progress. The iocluaion of Ax in C
allows    for internal costs of sdjustaent on the capital assets.

         As a functional form for C, we erspioy the generalized Leontief varieble

cost function with non-constant rcurns to scaie, de.veioped and implemented

empirically by Harrison iSS6a,b,1999,1990]

prices of the three variable inputs (L, N and H), and                           and 5n depict the

remaining five arguments (y,t,AE,AS and hO).

         Six estimating equations are derived from this generalized Leontief

variable cost function. Specifically, three variable input demand equations

 are obtained by eaploying Shepherd's lziizua, v 30/8 where vt is the
      INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS AND PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH           -   Page   2-
variable cost-miniislzing demand for variable        input i. in   addition, three
investment equations are derived by specifying Euler equations that capture
the   investment response to the difference between the r&snCe market price k

and the shadow value ZR zk —                  for   each of the fixed inputs; the

implied rate of investment reflects oC course the effects of internal

adjustment costs. An additive disturbance term is appended to each of these

six equations, and the resulting disturbance vector is assumed to be

identically and independently normally distributed with mean vector zero and

variance-covarfance matrix A.

        The estimation method used is three-stage least squares (3SLS), with the

instrument (information) set consisting of I, beginning-ci-year capital stocks

for E, S and 0, end once-lagged values of V. E, 0, 5, L, N, N, p, p5 .                 LE,
as    and AU; the endogenous variables in this equation system are the variable

input quantities L, N and N, the investment quantities AN, AS and AD, and the

level of output A          Finally,   although the prices of variable inputs L' N
and       are assumed to be exogenous, in the Euler equations it is expectations

of future prices for L' 'N and            that are of relevance. For this reason,

these variable input prices are instrumented, ensuring that expectational

"surprises" are uncorrelared with the equation residuals, as is implied by the

rational expectations hypothesis 5

        Of particuiar interest to us in this paper is the shadow value of the

this   capital. P0 (the marginal cost); in long-run equilibrium, it would          also

                                         P.    It is   of course possible that the
benefits   from additional investoent Z exceeded the marginal cost P0, in which

case there would be incentives for additional net investment. On the other

hand, if firms have over-invested in office and information technology

equipment,   then the marginal benefits          must be   less than   the marginal coat
P0.    Presumably,   those people who argue that industries have over-invested in
office and information technology equipment implicitly are saying that 80
PD,

        Based on   this line of reasoning, it is useful to construct a measure

that compares benefits and costs, i.e., that takes the ratio of the shadow

value   to the ex ante rental price of 0. It turns out that such a benefit-cost
ratio   measure is a capital service flow analog to the capital asset aeasure

known as Tobio's q; this has been shown by, among others, Abel [1980] and

Mayashi [1982]. In our context, therefore, we compute Tobin's q (beneiit/

cost) ratios as

              9k S   zk1tk   k — 5, S and 0,                                              (3)

When q is greater (less) then unity, there is under- (over-) investment in

the kth capital asset, and there are inceotives for not investment

 (disinvestment); only when q = 1        --   when marginal benefits just equal

marginal costs --     is   the firm in long-run equilibriua (k — E, S and 0). These

 ratios are thetefure critically iaportant for evaluating the economic

 rationale underlying investment behavior and thus the "productivity" of these

 investment decisions. In the empirical section of this paper, we will report

 on our estimates of q by industry for selected years.

         A complementary measure of the inpect of invcstnont in office and

 information technology equipment is its effect on the productivity of other

 capital. In our context, we arc interested in the effect of increases in 0 on
      IINFOR}tATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS AND PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH            - Page   9 -

the marginal product of all other equipment.       Specifically, if -I92C/OEÔO ia
positive    (negative), then increases in 0 increase (decrease) the shadow value

of E, making it more (less) productive in reducing variable costs, suggesting

that E and U are substitutes (cnmplesients). To evaluate this derivativu

elasticity form, we define go as the elasticity at the shadow valun of

capital equipment with    respect   to an increase in   the   stuck uf office and

information technology equipment, and compute it as

               CEO   (-a2C/OgUO)JTc,                                                     (6)

where TC is total cost computed as the sum       of variable    costa plus fixed

costs, and where the fixed inputs are evaluated using shadow values.

       Another measure of the impact of office azid information technology

equipment on costs and productivity deals with effects on          demands for the

variable inputs L. N and N. If increases in 0 have a "neutral" effect on

cost-rainiaiiriog demands for L, N and K, then    changes     in 0 would affect deaands

for   these inputs equiproporrionally; on the other hand, if, for example.
increases   in 0 reduced human labor tiise   substantially, slightly decreased
energy usage and increased non-energy intermediate materials (say, through
increased use of paper) , thou changes in 0 would have non-neutral impacts on
demands for variable inputs. It is therefore of interest to construct an
elasticity    of the derived demand iot variable input i with respect to 0 as

            — (O/v1)*(8v1/dO)    (OJv)*(U2G/3pa0), i            L, N and N,             (5)

where the second equality results frois Shc'phard's lemma (v —
                                                                       BG/ap6)
Estimates of these elasticities will he presented in the following section of

this paper.

       The final measure we compute to evaluate the impact of office and

information technology equipment on costs and productivity refers to its

interaction with technical progress. Specifically, short-run techocial

progress can be evaluated by computing the partial derivative -3Gj3t, and then
      INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS AND PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH           - Page 10 -

the   effects of changes in the stock of office and inforsiation technology

equipment on technical progress can be calculated as -82G/8t80: in elasticity

form, we compute this impact of increases in 0 on technical progress growth as

                  —   (-32G/atao)/TU.                                               (6)

When £to is positive (negative), increases in the stock of 0 accelerate

(decelerate) the rate of technical progress ceteris paribus. Note also that

an alternative interpretation oi this elasticity can be obtained by reversing

the order of the derivatives, in which case one assesses how the shadow value

of capital (-80/30) is affected by technical progress (30/at).7



TV.     DATA AND EMPIRTCAL RESULTS

        Annual two-digit manuiacruring data, )952-1986, have been provided us by

Michael Harper of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, The data series on

L, N and H were constructed by BLS personnei using data fron rho Census of

Manufactures and the Annual Surveys ni Manufactures, and data series an

capital stocks and invesLaent for g, S and 0 are based on detailed industry

measures constructed by John A. Goraan John C. Musgrave and associates at the

Bureau of Econoeic Analysis.8 In particular, the category of capital we call

office and inforaatinn technology capital (0) consists of a Divisia index of

four asset codes in the Corman et al. data set: 14 --           office, computing and
accounting machinery; 16 -     - coiaaunicatinns   equipaent:   25 - - scientific and

 engineering instruaents; and 26 -. photocopy and related equipasni.

        Using tax snd depreciation dare series, Bit officials have also

 constructed annual rental price neasurss for the venous types of capital

 equipment end structures.9 We have modified their p post rentsl price

 computation ro obtain an ax ante msasure by incorporating Moody's Baa

 corporate bond yield as Lhe cx ante interest rate, and have set the capital

 gains term in the rradirionai Rall-Jorgensan rental price formulae to zero icr

computed

     We have estiosted parameters in the six-equation system for a number cf

two-digit manufacturing industries using the 3SLS estimation procedure, as

outlined above. Since the number of parameters estimated for each industry is

substantial, in this paper we do not report detailed paraiseter estimates by

induatry. Rather, we focus attentinn en the indicators of productivity

performance outlined in the previous section --   estinated   Tohin's q

(benefit/coet)   ratios for office and information technology equipment, the
elasticity of the shadow value of E with respect to 0, oiasticities of demands
for variable inputs with respect to increases in 0, and the interaction
between    technical progress and changes in the stock of 0. Ve begin with the

estimated Tebin's q values, reported itt Table 2 below.

      In the first four columns of Table 2, we report estimated Tobin's q

ratios at five-year intervals from 1971 to 1986, by industry. A number of

results are worth noting. first, in 1971 q was less than one in all but two

industries (where it was barely above nnity); the sample mean of the q's over

all fourteen industries in 1971 was 0.65.

      Second, after 1971 there appears to be considerably greater variability

in the q ratios for 0 capital. Values of q in 1976 range from 0.68 to 1,91,

in 1991 from 0,24 to 2,56, and in 1966 from -1.80 to 4.96. The two industries

with very large q's in 1986 are fabricated metals (q —    3.90) end machinery
(4.96). both of which were already investing heavily in 0 eqnip.aent, as was

shown in Table 1. The negative q values for 0 capital in 1966 in food

(-0,71), furniture and fixtures (-1.80) and instruments (-0.82) imply that

increases    in 0 capital resulted in an   increase in varlabie costs - - a    rather

surprising    finding.
        Third,   sample means of q for 1971, 1976, 1981 and 1986 over all fourteen

industries are 065 1,16, 0,9) and 0.90, respectively, while sample            means of
q when the the five "outlior"     industties ate deleted are 0.64, 0.98, 0.71 and
0.79.    These results imply, therefore, that were say, $1 invested      in each of
these   fourteen (or nine) industries in 1986, on average the returns to such

investments would nec be sufficiently large to justify the investment, for the

average reduction in costs would he $0.90 (for      all   industries), or $0.79

(excluding the five "sutlier" industries). Hence, while there are exceptions.

on balance there appears to he an everinvestisent in       0 capital in 1986 in the

sense that marginal benefits are less than marginal costs,

        In the final four coluens of Table 2, we present estimates nf the

elasticity of the ahodew value of (non high-tech) E capital with respect to

changes in the quantity of 0 capital. The signs of these clnstic.ities show no

clear pattern across induatrins, and elasticity estisiaies ate evenly divided

hetween   positive and negative   values. Horenver, in all industries except

lumber and wood, the value of tins elastic Ity     is   no greater than J.t in

absolule    value. We conclude,   therefore, that there. is little Interaction

between    the shadow value of 8 capital and the quantity of 0 capital. lu this
sense, the 8     and 0 capital inputs appear to be reasonably independent.

        We now move on to a discussion of the impacts of changes in 0 capital on

the   demands for labor, energy and non-energy intermediote materials. As in
shown in Table     3, the sign of the   estimated elasticity of   the derived demand

for   labor with   respect to 0 capital varies hy industry, with seven industries

having negative estimates (indicating a type of substitutahility between labor

and 0), and the other seven being positive (suggesting cnmplementarity). A

somewhat surprising finding here is that whether positive or negative, in all

industries this elasticity increases in absolute magnitude over time,

indicating    ever-greater impacts of 0 capital on the demand for labor. These
results    deserve further analysis, perhaps along the lines of disaggregating

labor into groups with varying degreea of education.

         In the middle four columns of Table 3, we examine interactions between 0

capital and the derived demand for energy. As is seen there, in eleven of the

fourteen industries, rhe estimated elasticity of demand for energy with

respect to 0 capital is positive, suggesting a type of energy-O capital

complementarity.     Ny contrast, in eleven of the fourteen industries, the
corresponding    elaa ticity for non- energy intermediate materials is negative,
suggesting anhstituability between 0-capital and these naterials.
         Our final calculations examine intereetinna between 0 capital and
technical progress. We begin in Table 4 by computing estimated rates of
technical progress by industry for 1976 and 1986, celcnlated hy simply
evaluating the derivative Ct — -(BC/3t)/TC. Results are presented in the
first two columns of Table 4. Note that in all industries except iron and
steel,    technical progress was positive, and in the electric machinery and
printing    and publishing industries it was particularly strong.
         In the final four columns of Table 4, we present estimmtos of the
elasticity of technical progress with respect to 0-capital, using Eq. (6) and
our 3SLS parameter estimates. In ten of the fourteen industries, this
estimated    elasticity is positive, implying that increases in O-capiial

accelerate    the rate of technical progress; in font industries, the reverse
result    Is obtained. It is worth noting that whether negative or positive,

these elasticities are all very small -- the largest is about iwo-tenths of

one percent.

      We   conclude, therefore, that there is little evidence to                suggest that
increases in office and information technology equipment have a substantial

acceleration    isipact on technical progress iCL US eanufac Luring industries; what
impact there is appears to be rather small.

V.     CONCLUDING REMARKS

       Our purpose in this paper has been to examine empirically the cost-
reducing impacts of recent dramatic increases in stocks of high-tech' office

and information iechnology equipment using annual data from various two-digit

U.S. manufacturing industries over the 1952-4986 time period. Our theoretical

framework is based on the theory of cost and production. The empirical

specification we employ is that of a dynamic factor demand medol, with labor,

energy and non-energy intermediate materials as variable inputs, and office

and information technology equipment (0), non-0 producers' dutsble equipment

(E) and non-residential structures (S) es quasi-fixed inputs. For each

industry, we coaputod the ratio of marginal benefits of 0 investment to

marginel costs, and also calculated a number of related elasticities.

       Our principal empirical findings can be summarized as follows. First,

our estimates of the benefit-cost (Tobin's q) ratios varied considerably aisong

industries (with increasing variability over Lime) ,   but    in 1986 the average

benefit-cost ratio across all industries was 0.90, and       if   five "outlier

industries were exciudod, this ratio fell to 0.79. It is worth noting hors

that rho denominator of the benefii-coet ratio is a rental price of capital,

which in our empirical formulation had the expected capital gains term set to

 zero. Since the price of 0 equipment fell steadily and considerably over the

 1952-86 time period, one might argue that an expectation of declining prices

 should   be incorporated into the benefit-cost calculation. Had we incorporated
 the capital gains (in this case, capital lassos) tens into the rental price
 formula, the denominator of the benefit-cost ratio would have been latger, and
 thus the ratio would have been cven snaller, We conclude, therefore, that
 while there are exceptions, on balance there appears to have been an

ovcrinvostmcnt    in 0 capitai in 1986 in the sense that marginal boncfits are

less than marginal costs.

        Second, our estinstos of the elasticity of the shadow value of       non high-
tech capital   with respect to chsngos in   the   quantity of 0 capitol vary in   sign
across industries, hut are always vory saal I iii absolute magnitude. This
suggests that these two inputs are reasonably independent.
        Third, rho sign of the estimated elasttctty of demand for labor with
respect to changes in the stock of 0 capital is evenly dividod in the fourrecn
Industries,    but whether positive or negative, in all industries this

elasticity    increases in absolute magnitude over tine, indicating ever greater
impacts of 0 capital on the demand for labor. We believe that further
analysis, pethaps involving the disaggregation of labor by education and
cccnpation, may provide further hoper tant information on the impact of 0
capital on employment patterns.
        fourth,   in eleven of the fourteen industries, the estirated elasticity

of   demand for energy with respect to changes in the stock of C capital is

pcsitivc   (suggesting a type of energy-C capital conplomsntarity) , while the
corresponding elasticity for interisedi.ete materials is negative (indicating a
type of materisls-O capital substitutability).
      Finally, we have computed the estimated rate of technical progress, and
the elasticity of technical progress with respect to 0-capital. There is
little evidence to     suggest that increases in   0 capital hays a substantial
impact on technical progress in US     manufacturing industries; what impact there
is   appears to be rather small.

2See, for example. the quarterly reports "Productivity and Costs issued by
the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.

31t is worth noting here, however, that when the U.S. Bureau of the Census
obtains data from manutacturing establishments the only data it collects is
on its production activities; in particular, the Census data does not include
date from central office operations, marketing activities, etc. This implies
that when one employs Census data, aa we do in this study, we coniine
ourselves to examining the effects of office and information technology
equuipmenr on production activities.

4Note that although Y is permitted to be an endogenous explanatory variable,
there is no equation explicitly determining Y.   For an alternative formulation
in which Y is also explicitJy siodeled, see Morrison [1989,1990].

5For further discussion, see Hansen and Singleton [1982], and for an empirical
implementatton, Pindyck and Rottshcrg 11983].

6Curvature restrictions on the technology require that the variable cost
function be decreasing and concave in x, implying that, among other -
restrictions, it must be the case that 324/30 > 0.

7For further discussion of these two interpretations, see Morrison [i988bJ
It should also be noted that this elasticity takes into account the effects of
scale economies and the presence of quasi-fixed inputs. For futther
discussion, see Morrison [l989[

BLS publications are found in harper et al. [19891.

101n the BLS data base, the depreciation rates for each asset follow a
hyperbolic pattern and are not necessarily constant over time; depreciation
rates for the N, S and 0 composites also vary across industries arid time due
to changes in the composition of the stocks, In fact, however, the
depreciation rates tend to be very stab1c over tioe tot each assct. For 1986,
the capital stock-weighted average depreciation rates for N in the machinery,
chemicals and iron and steel iridustrics are approximately 6, 8 and 6%,
respectively, for S they are all about 4%, and tot 0 the weighted-average
depreciation rates for these three industries are 17, 15 and 14%,
 respectively.

      each sector, the y,v. 7TV and ITT terms were sot to zero. In several
 sectors, additional cnnsLraints were imposed, and in some cases the saisple
 period was adjusted slightly, it is worth noting, however, that iii virtually
 oil cases the concavity condition for 0 capital was sstisficd at each
 observation - - a surprising and iortunate result.
