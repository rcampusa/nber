1 Introduction
This paper develops and implements a framework for quantifying the gains to inter-
national trade in risky nancial assets. We focus on the incremental gains to trade
in risky assets over and above the consumption-smoothing bene ts of unrestricted
borrowing and lending. To develop our framework, we consider consumption and
portfolio choice in a dynamic model with many agents, many assets, incomplete mar-
kets and heterogeneity in the exposure to risky nontraded assets. To implement the
framework, we t the model to the rst two moments of domestic and foreign asset
returns and the covariance between asset returns and national output innovations.
Our analysis intersects with much previous work on international risk sharing, port-
folio allocation and the puzzlingly large return premia on equities and other risky
securities.
    As Van Wincoop (1999) and others show, there are sizeable unrealized gains to
consumption risk sharing among countries. This conclusion raises a question: How
large are the feasible gains to international risk sharing from a properly structured

                                          1
portfolio of existing nancial assets? We nd that the feasible gains are sharply
limited by the incompleteness of nancial markets. While feasible risk-sharing gains
are nontrivial, they are modest and substantially smaller than the gains from complete
international risk sharing.
    Notwithstanding this conclusion, we also show that standard portfolio theory im-
plies enormous gains from trade when asset returns are calibrated to observed risk
premia. These gains are many, many times larger than the international risk sharing
bene ts found in our study or others. In fact, for several countries in our study the
annual gains from trade in risky assets exceed national income! The huge theoretical
gains arise from the returns to taking on market risk, not from risk-sharing bene ts.
Because these implied gains are implausibly large, they are a puzzle for the theory.
    This gains-to-trade puzzle, as we call it, is closely related to the equity premium
puzzle identi ed by Mehra and Prescott (1985) and subsequently studied by legions
of researchers. The gains-to-trade puzzle emerges when we interpret observed asset
                1


returns as the outcome of a free-trade regime, and we compute the counterfactual
autarky equilibrium implied by the theory. Because standard dynamic equilibrium
theory implies small risk premia, it also implies very large gains in moving from the
(counterfactual) autarky equilibrium to the (observed) free-trade equilibrium.
    The gains-to-trade puzzle can be restated in portfolio choice terms for an investor
who faces exogenously given asset returns. That is, when calibrated to observed asset
returns, the theory implies enormous gains from including risky assets in the average
investor's portfolio. In addition, the theoretically optimal level of risky asset holdings
for the average investor are an order of magnitude larger than observed holdings.
This portfolio puzzle emerges in dramatic fashion even when we limit the portfolio
choice menu to domestic equity. Unlike its close relatives, the gains-to-trade and
equity premium puzzles, the portfolio puzzle does not hinge on an equilibrium theory
of asset pricing behavior. Rather, given observed asset returns, the puzzle is that the
level of risky asset holdings implied by the theory greatly exceeds observed holdings.
Furthermore, the theory implies implausibly large foregone gains for the majority of
the population that has modest holdings of risky nancial assets.
    In an e ort to address the various puzzles and re-assess the gains to trade in
risky nancial assets, we modify the theoretical model to treat limited participation
in asset markets. Many empirical studies document limited participation in asset
markets, and several recent studies suggest that limited participation holds promise
   1 Standard dynamic equilibrium models, when calibrated to a reasonable degree of risk aversion,
imply an expected return premium on equity securities that is much smaller than the equity premium
observed in the data { hence, the equity premium puzzle.

for explaining observed risk premia. We nd that limited participation goes a long
                                            2


way toward simultaneously addressing the equity premium and gains-to-trade puzzles.
It also delivers a more sensible perspective on the gains to international trade in risky
  nancial assets and the feasible gains to international risk sharing.
    Our analysis also sheds light on the large body of evidence against the hypothesis
of international risk sharing. This evidence has inspired many e orts to quantify
                                   3


the potential gains from international risk sharing. Studies in this vein compute the
welfare bene ts of full risk sharing among countries relative to autarky or observed
consumption allocations. Van Wincoop (1999) reviews fourteen recent studies along
these lines and analyzes why they di er in the estimated magnitude of the gains. He
identi es the speci cation of the stochastic process for national output as a key factor
in this regard. In particular, given reasonable values for risk aversion and the risk-
free interest rate, studies that allow for a nonstationary output process nd sizeable
potential gains from international risk sharing.         4


    Like Van Wincoop, we read this body of work to say that the potential gains from
international risk sharing are large { and largely unrealized. As others have observed,
                                                                       5


this assessment raises the question of why the potential gains from international risk
sharing are not more fully realized.
    Incomplete nancial markets provide one candidate explanation. That is, the -
nancial instruments required to share risk internationally may not be available. We
provide direct evidence on this point by quantifying the extent to which selected
  nancial assets span the space of shocks to national output growth rates. Our em-
pirical approach involves regressions of national output innovations on nancial asset
returns for portfolios comprised of domestic and world bond and equity indexes, a
commodity price index and forward positions in foreign exchange markets. These
assets can be traded at low cost in well-developed nancial markets.
    Little previous work on international risk sharing examines the covariance be-
tween nancial asset returns and output innovations, although it is a central object
in portfolio-based approaches to international risk sharing. For example, this co-
   2 For example, see Basak and Cuoco (1998), Constantinides, Donaldson and Mehra (1998), Brav,
Constantinides and Gezcy (1999) and Vissing-Jorgenson (1999).
   3 Lewis (1999) provides an excellent synthesis of work in this general area.
   4 Van Wincoop (1999) also draws on evidence about long term growth behavior in DeLong (1988)
to argue that a random walk or rst-order autoregression in growth rates is a more appropriate
speci cation than a stationary process or one that imposes cointegration between national and
world outputs.
   5 While the evidence clearly rejects the full risk-sharing hypothesis, it is much less hostile to the
view that high-frequency movements in national consumption are consistent with unrestricted trade
in risk-free bonds. See, for example, Obsteld (1989), Kollman (1995) and Canova and Ravn (1996).


                                                   3
variance plays a key role in the theoretical analysis of Baxter and Jermann (1997).
However, their empirical implementation considers returns on hypothetical assets that
represent claims to the income streams generated by domestic capital stocks. As we
show in section 2, much capital income is not securitized, so that the portfolio strate-
gies envisioned by Baxter and Jermann are infeasible. This same point applies with
even greater force to the numerous studies that treat all forms of wealth, including
human capital, as marketable. In reality, only a small fraction of wealth is securitized.
Hence, an evaluation of portfolio-based approaches to international risk sharing calls
for a direct investigation of the covariance between national output innovations and
  nancial asset returns. To the best of our knowledge, Botazzi et al. (1996) is the only
previous study of international risk sharing to provide evidence on this issue.
    From the vantage point of our theoretical model, the goodness of t in a regression
of output innovations on asset returns measures how e ectively national output risk
can be hedged by a properly structured asset portfolio. The theory tells us exactly how
to construct the optimal portfolio as a function of the following objects: the covariance
between national output innovations and asset returns, the size and persistence of
national output innovations, the rst two moments of asset returns, the risk-free rate
of interest and the level of risk aversion.
    The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 considers some evidence on the im-
portance of nontraded wealth and the correlation between returns on traded and
nontraded assets. Section 3 sets forth our theoretical model of consumption, port-
folio choice and trade in risky nancial assets. The theoretical analysis shows how
to quantitatively address the issues raised above. Next, section 4 describes the data
on nancial asset returns and country-level measures of output and price de ators.
Using these data, section 5 investigates the covariance between output innovations
and nancial asset returns. Section 6 draws on empirical results in Sections 4 and
5 and theoretical results in Section 3 to compute portfolio allocations and the gains
from trade under the assumption of full participation in asset markets. Section 7
considers limited participation in asset markets, and Section 8 concludes.

2 Some Evidence Regarding Nontraded Wealth
Most previous work on international risk sharing assumes that nancial markets span
the space of national output shocks. Baxter and Jermann (1997), who emphasize the
nonmarketable nature of human capital, nevertheless assume that the set of nancial
assets available worldwide perfectly spans human capital risks. As a result, all wealth
is e ectively marketable in their analysis. Botazzi et al. (1996), in another study on

                                           4
the international sharing of labor income risks, also assume perfect spanning.
    This spanning assumption ts poorly with several pieces of evidence. First, direct
estimates nd a low correlation between returns on nonmarketable human wealth
and returns on nancial assets. Under the assumption that labor income growth
follows a random walk, Fama and Schwert (1977) nd a near-zero correlation between
aggregate equity and human capital returns in the United States. Botazzi et al. (1996)
consider several countries and also nd low correlations with returns on a broader
portfolio of domestic assets. Davis and Willen (2000) consider the correlation between
returns on nancial assets and human capital for synthetic persons de ned in terms of
sex, birth cohort and educational attainment. The correlations with aggregate U.S.
equity returns for these persons are centered near zero. In addition, the R values in       2


regressions of labor income innovations on a larger portfolio of asset returns seldom
top ten percent. Even the returns on proprietary business wealth do not appear to be
highly correlated with nancial asset returns. In this regard, Heaton and Lucas (2000)
report a value of .14 for the correlation between the growth rate of U.S. proprietary
business income and the stock market rate of return.
    Second, only a small fraction of wealth is securitized. Labor earnings, which
acount for roughly seventy percent of national income, are not securitized. Outside
the United States and a few other countries, only a modest fraction of business wealth
is securitized. And, for the most part, (equity claims on) real estate assets are not
securitized.
    Table 1 provides some crude quantitative evidence on this matter. For selected
countries, we estimate the percentages of business wealth and total wealth in the
form of risky nancial securities as of 1980 and 1990. We measure securitized wealth
as the market capitalization of corporate equity and debt securities outstanding at
the end of the indicated year. We measure business wealth as the present value of
                                     6


future business income ows, discounted at the average annual rate of return on the
country's stock market from 1980 to 1996. For 1981 through 1995, we use realized
business income in the present value calculations. For later years, we use projected
values assuming that business income grows at the same rate after 1995 as from 1980
to 1995. To measure total wealth, we multiply business wealth by the reciprocal of
         7


   6 Since it represents a securitized claim on future taxing capacity, one might argue for the inclusion
of government debt in the measure of securitized wealth. Alternatively, one can argue that the
return on (short-term) government debt is insensitive to shocks to the present value of future taxing
capacity. Government debt can facilitate intertemporal consumption smoothing in this case, but it
does not expand opportunities to share consumption risks associated with wealth shocks.
   7 Thus our procedure gives approximately the same answer as capitalizing a country's average
realized business income at a discount rate equal to the di erence between its realized stock market


                                                   5
capital's share of national income.
     The calculations and data underlying Table 1 can be criticized on several grounds,
but there is no escaping the basic message: Securitized wealth accounts for a very
small fraction of total wealth, perhaps around 10 percent for a few countries and less
for others. The evidence in Heaton and Lucas (2000) suggests that roughly half of
U.S. business wealth is securitized. We have not explored the reasons for the larger
ratio of securitized assets to total business wealth in their study, but the discrepancy
suggests that our gures for traded wealth in Table 1 may be too low. However, even
if securitized assets account for half of total business wealth, a gure for capital's
share of national income of .3 implies that securitized assets account for less than 15
percent of total wealth.  8


     The countries considered in Table 1 are among the most nancially developed in
the world. So, it is safe to presume that easily marketable assets account for even
smaller percentages of business and total wealth in most other countries. Indeed, for
most countries in the world, risky nancial securities probably account for less than
5 percent of total wealth. Given this state of a airs, it would be rather remarkable if
the available set of nancial assets spanned the risks inherent in non- nancial assets.
     Of course, this spanning condition could hold, even when nancial securities ac-
count for a small fraction of total wealth. For example, if a single factor drives most
of the variation in returns on nancial and non- nancial forms of wealth, it matters
little that most wealth is not securitized. More generally, if the same factors drive
the returns to nancial and non- nancial wealth, then non nancial wealth is e ec-
tively marketable. While logically coherent, this argument has limited practical force
in view of the low correlations between returns on nancial assets and non- nancial
assets.
     As a nal point, if shocks to national income are spanned by available nancial
assets, we expect to nd very high R values in regressions of national output inno-
                                          2


vations on domestic and foreign asset returns. The empirical evidence reported in
Section 5 says otherwise.
     In summary, the evidence runs sharply counter to the perfect spanning assumption
that underlies most previous work on international risk sharing. Motivated by this
evidence, the next section develops a theoretical model of consumption and portolio

3 A Model of Portfolio Choice and Trade in Risky
  Assets
This section develops our theoretical analysis. Our key assumption is that investors
have exponential utility, which implies constant absolute risk aversion in the face of
wealth shocks. Exponential utility leads to closed-form expressions for consumption,
portfolio allocations, equilibrium asset returns and the gains to trade in a setting with
many agents, many assets, incomplete nancial markets and heterogeneity in exposure
to undiversi able risks. We also rely on normality of asset returns and endowment
shocks, but this assumption is less essential. It can be relaxed while preserving the
ability to derive closed-form solutions.    9


    Most dynamic analyses of consumption, portfolio choice and equilibrium asset
pricing rely heavily on analytical or numerical approximation techniques to obtain
solutions. This is especially true in the analysis of rich environments like ours that
consider incomplete markets, many assets, many agents who di er in risk exposures
and (in Section 7) limited participation in nancial markets by some agents. In
contrast, our approach relies on exponential preference speci cations to obtain exact
closed-form analytical solutions that are easy to compute and easy to interpret.
    Our approach, too, is an approximation. In particular, exponential utility can be
interpreted as a local approximation to preferences that display constant relative risk
aversion. In calibrating the theoretical model, we assume that all agents have the same
degree of relative risk aversion, and we approximate the corresponding exponential
utility function using a country's per capita income level at the midpoint of our sample
period. We could also approximate around the expected growth path of per capita
income by allowing the risk aversion parameter in the exponential utility function to
vary over time. However, in view of the modest average growth rates experienced by
the countries in our sample (see Table 2 below), we opt for the simpler approach that
speci es absolute risk aversion to be constant over time.
    Like most work on international risk sharing, we consider an endowment econ-
omy. We model the world economy as containing many countries, each of which is
     10


populated by many individuals who receive stochastic endowments of a single con-
sumption good. We do not explicitly treat nontraded goods in the formal analysis,
but the model can be interpreted to cover two special cases: perfect substitution be-
tween internationally traded and nontraded goods, or additive separability between
   9 For example, see Gron et al. (2000).
  10 Better risk sharing can lead to a more eÆcient allocation of factor inputs in a production
economy. Obstfeld (1994) pursues this theme in the context of international risk sharing.

traded and nontraded goods. Our empirical work treats both cases.                    11


    To reduce the notational burden, we assume that each country is populated by
a xed set of individuals who live forever. It is straightforward, but tedious, to
consider overlapping generations of individuals with nite life spans. Since life-cycle
                                                                                     12


considerations play no essential role in this study, we opt for the simpler in nite-
horizon formulation.
    Our theoretical analysis and empirical investigation are directed to the gains from
trade among countries. These gains make up only part of the bene ts to domestic
residents from trading risky foreign assets. In particular, trade in foreign assets
can expand risk sharing opportunities within countries, whether or not the foreign
assets are useful for risk sharing between countries. To evaluate the within-country
consumption risk-sharing bene ts of trade in foreign assets, it would be necessary to
investigate the covariance between foreign asset returns and that part of individual-
speci c income innovations that cannot be hedged using domestic nancial assets.

3.1 The economy
The world economy contains H investors indexed by h and G countries indexed by
g . A country is a collection of investors h 2 g . Each person lives forever and has
preferences de ned over current and future consumption of a single good.

but it is probably not a rst-order issue.

3.2 Theoretical Results
This section establishes that:
    Consumption is the annuity value of a broad de nition of wealth. This implies
      that consumption innovations are linear in innovations to income and portfolio
      returns.
    We can decompose demand for risky assets into a `risk-exploitation' component
      that depends on excess returns and risk aversion and a `hedging' component that
      depends on the covariance between nonmarketable asset values and returns on
      risky nancial assets.
    International trade in risky assets depends on the di erence between the autarky
      price of risk and the world price of risk. A country will go (long) short in an
      asset if the autarky price of risk is below (above) the world price.
                                                   10
    Gains from trade rise in the square of the di erence between autarky and world
      prices of risk.
    We can decompose the gains from trade into three components: a `hedging ben-
      e t' that measures the potential reduction in the variance of national income
      made possible by an asset; a `hedging cost' that measures the change in ex-
      cess returns resulting from a hedge position; and a `risk premium bene t' that
      measures the gains to taking on market risk.
    Our rst proposition converts a complex dynamic programming problem into a
simple annuitization exercise. We use a broad wealth measure called `generalized
wealth' that incorporates future non- nancial income, future wealth uncertainty, fu-
ture excess returns on risky assets and the di erence between an investor's subjective
discount rate and the risk-free interest rate. Proofs to the propositions appear in

    Thus, under our assumptions, consumption is simply the annuitized value of gen-

Equation 3 illustrates portfolio choice. All else equal, investment in a risky asset
is increasing in the return (ER ;t ) and decreasing in absolute risk aversion (Ah),

the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth (a) and the covariance between
nonmarketable wealth and the return (cov Y~th; R~ ;t ). The size of the asset position

                                    
is also decreasing in risk (var R~ ;t ).1

    To analyze international trade in risky assets, we borrow a device from classical
trade theory { the Law of Comparative Advantage. We will show that equation 3
                                                                      14


implies a law of comparative advantage that relates net national demand for risky
  nancial assets to the di erence between the price of risk (i.e., Sharpe ratio) in world
markets and the price of risk under autarky.
    First, we de ne autarky.
De nition 1 Under \autarky", a country can trade the consumption good and freely
engage in international borrowing and lending, but it cannot trade risky assets interna-
tionally.
Note two important things about our de nition of \autarky." First, it only applies to
risky assets. We assume that countries face the same riskless rate under autarky and
free trade. Second, our de nition of autarky does not prohibit within-country trade
in risky nancial assets.      15


     It will be helpful to spell out certain relationships between asset prices and re-
turns
        across trade regimes. By de nition, the gross return on asset j is Rj;t =
                                                                                        ~
  ~j;t + d~j;t =j;t , where d~j;t is the payo at t, and ~j;t is the ex-dividend asset price

                                                                                        

  15 This has no e ect on net national demand. As we mentioned before, our empirical work considers
country-level data, so we cannot address within-country risk-sharing bene ts in this study. For some
calculations of the within-country risk-sharing bene ts of nancial assets, see Davis and Willen

The numerator depends only on the dividend process and the riskless rate, both of
which we assume to be invariant across trade regimes. So, asset prices and returns
are related across trade regimes as follows:

    Now, to illustrate the analysis, consider the case of a single risky marketable asset.
Let  = std (R~ ;t ) be the standard deviation of returns on the asset at world prices

(i.e., under free trade). Summing equation (3) across agents in country g, we can
express national demand for the asset under free trade as a function of the world

Thus the gains from trading risky assets are increasing in the size of the di erence
between world and autarky Sharpe ratios, regardless of the sign. For example, when
there is only one risky nancial asset, the per capita bene t of international trade for

    In a classical mean-variance setting, an investor is endowed with a lump of wealth,
so that the no-trade price of risk is zero. Hence, in the classical setting the gains from
trade can be calculated in terms of the observed Sharpe ratio, S , on a new asset
without reference to the asset's autarky Sharpe Ratio, S g . Implicitly, S g = 0 in the
classical setting.  17


    To more fully understand the gains from trade in risky assets, expand the quadratic
expression (S S g ) and substitute in the equation for the autarky Sharpe ratio:

This expression additively decomposes the gains from trade into three pieces. The
risk premium bene t is proportional to the square of the reciprocal of absolute risk
aversion. The \hedging cost" is the change in excess returns that results from min-
imizing the variance of consumption. If the world Sharpe ratio on the asset and its
covariance with domestic non- nancial wealth are both positive, this e ect reduces
the gains from trade. However, if the covariance is negative, the \cost" will be neg-
ative, and this term will add to the gains from trade. The \hedging bene t" re ects
the lower variance of consumption available from hedging shocks to Y g . This term
is always positive. However, the hedging bene t need not exceed the hedging cost.
That is, it is not always optimal to hedge a position, even if it is possible to do so.
    The following proposition generalizes this result to the multi-asset case.
Proposition 4 (Decomposition of Gains from Trade) Under the assumptions and con-
ditions of Proposition 3, the gains from trade for country g can be decomposed as follows:

4 Data Description and Output Speci cations
4.1 Output and Price De ators
For output and consumption measures, we rely on the UN System of National Ac-
counts (SNA), which contain data disaggregated by broad industry categories. We use
the industry breakdown to construct measures of tradable consumption and GDP, as
described in Appendix B. We consider annual observations from 1970 to 1995, which
is the time period covered by our data on asset returns.
    Nominal GDP and consumption measures are initially expressed in local currency
units. As the de ator for total (tradable) GDP, we use the ratio of nominal to real nal
(tradable) consumption expenditures of resident households. Appendix B provides
                                                                       18


details. After de ating each nominal GDP measure by its respective price de ator, we
convert local currency units to U.S. dollars at contemporaneous exchange rates. For
easy comparisons, we express real output measures in 1990 dollars. We convert real
output to per capita values using population data from the International Monetary
Fund's International Financial Statistics (IFS).
    The stochastic process for output in our theoretical model implies an empirical
speci cation in natural units rather than logs. In practice, we carry out our empirical
investigations using measures in both natural units and natural logs.
    We initially set out to t simple ARIMA models for each country's per capita
output measures. However, with very few exceptions, one cannot reject the hypothesis
that the rst-di erenced output and log output measures are serially uncorrelated in
our sample period. Hence, we speci ed each national output process as a separately
estimated random walk with drift. Table 2 reports parameter estimates for these
                                         19


random walk speci cations and p-values for the null hypothesis of no serial correlation
in the di erenced values. Using the national output innovations implied by these
speci cations and a risk-free interest rate of 2.5 percent per year, we construct the
innovations to Y~tg for each country g and year t.

4.2 Financial Asset Returns
We consider returns on nancial assets that represent broad claims and that trade
at low cost in liquid nancial markets. In particular, we allow each country to trade
a composite world equity index, a composite world government bond index and a
  18 Consumption of private non-pro t organizations is ignored.
  19 We experimented with linear time trends in the random walk speci cations for tradable and total
output, but only two countries (Canada and Greece) had trends that were statistically signi cant
at the 10 percent level.

                                                16
commodity index. In addition, we allow each country to take a position in the foreign
exchange market for its own currency, as explained below. Where data are available
                                                                    20


over the entire 1970-95 sample period, we also allow each country to trade domes-
tic equity and government bond indexes. Data on asset returns come from several
sources, as described in Appendix B.
    Asset returns for the composite world indexes are initially denominated in dollars.
We convert these returns into local currency units using period-end exchange rates,
and we convert the local currency payo into a real consumption payo using the
price de ator for the country's total (or tradable) consumption. These de ators also
serve to convert nominal returns on domestic equity and bonds into real returns. The
nominal dollar return on the commodity price index is simply the annual log di erence
in the index value, which we convert to a real domestic consumption payo in the
same way as with world equities and bonds. Since the exchange rate conversions and
price de ators di er among countries, returns on a given asset also di er by country.
    We also consider the return on a forward position in the foreign exchange market.
Subject to data availability, we construct the forward position as log F Rt;t =SRt , +1       +1

where F Rt;t is the forward rate against the U.S. Dollar on the last trading day of
             +1

year t for the last trading day of year t + 1, and SRt is the spot rate on the last
                                                               +1

trading day of year t + 1. An investor who takes a long position in domestic currency
then reaps a positive (negative) payo when the forward rate is greater (less) than the
corresponding spot rate. We constructed the forward position payo in this way for
Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United
Kingdom. For other countries, we constructed the payo to a rolling position in
three-month-ahead forward exchange contracts as explained in Appendix B.
    Tables 3 - 5 report summary statistics on domestic real returns for each country
and asset considered in this study. As Table 3 shows, mean returns on the world
equity and bond indexes di er considerably among countries because of movements
in real exchange rates. For example, the mean real return on the world index in long
term government bonds is 6.8 percent per year for an Icelandic investor (in units of
his domestic consumption good) but a comparatively paltry 1.2 percent per year for
a Japanese investor. Similarly, the mean real return on the world equity index is
10.9 percent for the Icelandic investor but only 4.3 percent for the Japanese investor.
These large di erences in mean returns on the same asset underscore the importance
of measuring country-speci c rates of return when studying the gains to international
trade in risky nancial assets.
  20 Returns on corporate bonds turned out to be highly collinear with returns on long-term govern-
ment bonds, so we dropped corporate bonds from further study.


                                                17
    Table 4 reports real returns on own-country equity and bond indexes. Mean
domestic returns on the own-country equity index range from 5.3 percent in Italy to
13.9 percent in Sweden. For most countries, annual returns on the own-country equity
index are substantially more volatile than domestic returns on the world equity index.
Own-country equity holdings are more risky in this sense, despite the added exposure
to real exchange rate movements implied by a foreign equity position. However,
in most countries returns on own-country government bonds are less volatile than
domestic returns on the world bond index.
    Table 5 shows that annual returns on the commodity index are nearly as variable
as the world equity index, but mean commodity returns are negative. This result
suggests that a commodity exporting country can hedge a large portion of national
output risk at attractive terms by adopting a short position in the commodities mar-
ket. In contrast, mean returns on a long position in domestic currency against the
U.S. dollar are positive, but modest.
    For each asset and country, we calculated the Ljung-Box Q statistic for the null
hypothesis of no autocorrelation in domestic real returns. These tests show almost
no evidence against the null with respect to own-country and world equity and bond
returns. This pattern suggests that our assumption of no predictable movements in
expected returns does little violence to the data on bond and equity returns. How-         21


ever, as Table 5 shows, there is considerable evidence against the null hypothesis of
serially uncorrelated returns for the commodity price index and the exchange rate
position. Neither our theoretical model nor empirical speci cations allow for pre-
          22


dictable movements in the expected returns on risky assets. This issue is potentially
important for the gains from trade in risky nancial assets, but it is beyond the scope
of this paper.

5 Covariance between Output Innovations and As-
  set Returns
Table 6 reports regressions of log output innovations on domestic equity and gov-
ernment bond returns based on the simple random walk output speci cations. The
  21 Several studies that consider longer samples and more re ned testing procedures nd evidence
of predictable movements in expected returns on U.S. equities. See Chapter 7 in Campbell, Lo and
MacKinlay (1997).
  22 Because there is a large common component across countries in the returns on the commodity
index and foreign exchange positions, it is not appropriate to interpret each regression as providing
independent evidence against the null.


                                                 18
chief message in this table is clear: own-country asset returns are nearly uncorrelated
with innovations in total and tradable output in most countries. Adjusted R values              2


exceed 10 percent for only 3 or 4 of 14 countries, and they never exceed 17 percent.                   23


This message is quite similar to results in Bottazzi et al. (1996), who consider the
correlation between labor income innovations and domestic asset returns.
     A secondary message in Table 6 is that output innovations tend to covary posi-
tively with own-country equity returns and negatively with own-country bond returns.
The modest explanatory power in these regressions comes principally from the bond
asset, not the equity asset. To gauge the magnitude of the covariances, consider the
case of Austria. According to Table 6, the regression coeÆcient on the Austrian bond
index is -0.086 with a t-statistic of 2.0. Conditional on the Austrian equity return, a
13 percent real return on the Austrian bond index (one standard deviation above its
mean according to Table 4) corresponds to an output innovation of about 1.1 percent.
For most other countries, the point estimates imply smaller covariances.
     Results are highly varied for larger asset portfolios that expand the regressor list
to include returns on world equities, world bonds, the commodity price index and the
foreign exchange position. Table 7 shows results for innovations in total log output,
and Table 8 considers innovations in the log of tradables output.                24


     For the expanded asset portfolios, the adjusted R values exceed 25 percent for sev-
                                                                2


eral countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium and Finland using either output measure
and Canada using the tradables measure. No single asset accounts for the improved
  t in these regressions, but the commodity price and foreign exchange positions play
an important role for many countries. Conditional on other asset returns, 7 of 14
countries exhibit a statistically signi cant positive covariance between national out-
put innovations and returns on a forward foreign exchange position. The commodity
index is statistically signi cant in the traded output regressions for 8 of 18 countries.
     In summary, these regression results support three inferences. First, the returns on
broad domestic equity and bond positions are nearly uncorrelated with innovations in
national output and tradables output. Second, for many countries, international trade
  23 Unreported regression results for output measured in natural units are very similar and, in fact,
tend to show slightly poorer ts.
  24 Our regression speci cations consider foreign asset returns of the form, Rf (SRt;t+1 =SRt ),
                                                                                        t+1

where Rtf+1 is the return in foreign curency units. We could instead consider fully hedged returns of
the form, Rtf+1 (F Rt;t+1 =SRt ). Appendix B shows that a speci cation with fully hedged returns is
equivalent, up to a linear approximation, to our speci cation. Our speci cation has two additional
attractions. First, it allows investors to adopt arbitrary long or short positions in the foreign exchange
market, which might be useful for hedging domestic output shocks or for exploiting the forward
premium in the foreign exchange market. Second, our approach conserves on degrees of freedom
when there are multiple assets.

                                                   19
in risky nancial assets can considerably expand the scope for hedging national output
risks. Third, international trade in risky nancial assets does not allow countries to
fully hedge national output risks. Put di erently, available nancial assets do not
appear to span the space of national output shocks.

6 Trade in Risky Assets with Full Participation
We now compute optimal portfolio allocations and quantify the gains to international
trade in risky nanical assets. All calculations assume a riskless real interest rate of
2.5 percent per year, so that R = 1:025. We set the expected returns on risky
                                  0

assets and the covariance matrix of returns to their sample values, but we consider
the sensitivity of our main results to alternative assumptions about the size of the
equity premium. Unless noted otherwise, we use a relative risk aversion level of 3.
To calibrate the implied absolute risk aversion coeÆcients, we multiply the relative
risk aversion level by the reciprocal of a country's per capita real income in 1983, the
midpoint of our sample period.

6.1 Portfolio Allocations
As a rst exercise, we calculate the optimal portfolio for investors who hold domestic
equity as the only risky nancial asset. The restriction to domestic equity in this
exercise simpli es the presentation but is not essential for the points at hand. We
relax this restriction when we compute the gains from trade.
    We calculate portfolio allocations and related quantities for the case of perfect
substitution between traded and nontraded goods and for the case of additive sepa-
rability. We also consider two alternatives regarding the covariance between output
innovations and equity returns. One alternative uses the sample covariance between
the country's output innovations and its equity returns. In line with the regression
results in section 5, the sample covariances are small or even negative. We also con-
sider a second alternative in which we reset the covariance so that output innovations
are perfectly correlated with own-country equity returns.
    Tables 9 and 10 report results for the perfect substitution and additive separability
cases, respectively. The rst column in each table shows the Observed Sharpe Ratio
for own-country equity returns based on the summary statistics reported in Table 4.
The Autarky Sharpe Ratios report the price of risk for domestic equity implied by
the theory (Proposition 2) under the assumption of no international trade in risky
assets. The Optimal Equity Position and the Hedge Portion for the average investor

                                           20
are calculated according to the portfolio allocation formula in Proposition 1, assuming
that investors trade domestic equity at observed prices. The \average investor" means
one who has the same absolute risk aversion and the same covariance between income
and asset returns as the corresponding values speci ed for the investor's country.
    Several results stand out in Tables 9 and 10:
    Autarky Sharpe Ratios are near zero for every country when using the sample
      covariance between output innovations and equity returns. This is the well-
      known equity premium puzzle implied by standard dynamic equilibrium theory.
      Like Campbell (1999, Table 5), we nd that this puzzle holds in every country
      we consider, not just the United States.
    The discrepancy between the Observed and Autarky Sharpe Ratios narrows
      when we assume that output innovations are perfectly correlated with equity
      returns, but the gap remains very large. Thus high correlation between returns
      on nonmarketable assets and traded equity claims reduces the the implied equity
      premium, but it does not make the puzzle go away.
    According to the theoretically optimal portfolio, the average investor adopts a
      very large long position in own equity in every country. Using the Estimated
      Covariance, this long position amounts to roughly half a million 1990 dollars per
      person in the United States. This equity position is simply gargantuan relative
      to the holdings of the typical household ( see, e.g., Heaton and Lucas, 2000). It
      is also an order of magnitude larger than the per capita value of the U.S. stock
      market.  25



    This huge equity position re ects the desire to exploit the large observed risk
      premium on equities. To see this point, note that the Hedge Portions are
      uniformly modest in magnitude when we use the Observed Covariance. The
      Hedge Portions are large and negative under the Perfect Correlation assumption,
      especially in the case of perfect substitutes, but the Optimal Equity Position
      remains positive and quite large in every country save Italy.
    Tables 9 and 10 highlight the enormous gap between the Optimal Equity Position
implied by the theory and observed holdings of risky securities. This portfolio puzzle
can be interpreted as the ip side of the equity premium puzzle. To see this point
directly, recall from Proposition 2 that the optimal holdings of domestic equity are
  25 The market value of equities held by U.S. households at the end of 1999 is 13.3 trillion dollars
(Poterba, 2000, Table 1). Dividing this gure by 270 million persons yields a per capita equity
holding of about 49,000 dollars.

                                                21
proportional to the di erence between the Observed Sharpe Ratio and the Autarky
Sharpe Ratio. We use data to compute the Observed Sharpe Ratio, but we rely on
theory (and data) to compute the Autarky Sharpe Ratio. Because the theory delivers
small values for the equilibrium price of risk, it also implies large long positions in
domestic equity.
   Another way to appreciate these puzzles is to consider the relationship between
the Autarky and Free-Trade Sharpe Ratios implied by the theory. Suppose, for the
sake of discussion, that output innovations are imperfectly correlated across countries
and that equity represents a claim to GDP. Then, provided that risk tolerance levels
are not too dissimilar across countries, the theory implies that the Autarky Sharpe
Ratio for domestic equity exceeds the corresponding Free-Trade Sharpe Ratio for every
country. However, we nd the opposite relationship when we interpret the Observed
         26


Sharpe Ratios as the outcome of free trade in risky nancial assets. The theory fares
no better if we reinterpret the Observed Sharpe Ratios as autarky outcomes, because
then the theoretical Sharpe Ratio is much smaller then the observed ratio in every
country.

6.2 The Gains from Trade
Tables 11 and 12 report the annual gains from trade in risky assets, expressed as a
percentage of per capita income, for the average investor in each country. In calcu-
lating these gains, we set expected returns and the covariance matrix of returns to
their sample values. We also set the covariance between output innovations and asset
returns to their sample values. As before, we consider two alternatives regarding the
treatment of traded and nontraded goods.
    The welfare measures in Tables 11 and 12 answer two conceptually distinct ques-
tions. First, what are the gains to the average investor in each country caused by a
switch from autarky to free trade in risky nancial assets? Second, how large are the
gains that accrue to a single investor, with average characteristics, who expands his
portfolio choice menu to include domestic and foreign risky assets? The rst question
involves a change in regime regime and, hence, its answer rests on a theory of equi-
librium. The second question pertains to individual decision making at exogenously
determined asset prices and, hence, its answer requires only a theory of portfolio al-
location. We can interpret the welfare entries in Tables 11 and 12 as answers to both
of these questions, so long as we bear in mind that one interpretation rests on an
  26 If one country is much more risk tolerant than others, then its Sharpe Ratio may be smaller
under autarky than under free trade. However, the theory still predicts larger Sharpe Ratios under
autarky for the other countries.


                                               22
equilibrium theory of asset pricing while the other does not.
   We decompose the gains to trade along two dimensions. One dimension involves
the set of assets included in the investor's portfolio choice menu. That is, we compute
the gains to international trade for investors who trade only domestic equities and
bonds, and we also compute the marginal bene ts of trading foreign assets (world
equity and bond indexes, the commodity index and the foreign exchange position).
The second dimension makes use of Proposition 4 to decompose the gains into three
pieces. The hedging bene t (HB) re ects the variance reduction achieved by the
hedge portfolio. The hedging cost (HC) is welfare reducing when the optimal hedge
                  27


portfolio involves a short position in assets with positive excess returns. The risk
premium (RP) bene t re ects the gains to adopting a long position in risky assets in
order to exploit excess returns. In other words, it captures the rewards to taking on
market risk.
   We now summarize the main points contained in Tables 11 and 12.
    The theoretical gains to international trade in risky nancial assets are enor-
      mous. Consider Australia as an example. Under additive separability (Table
      12), the annual gains to trading domestic equity and bonds amount to 27.7
      percent of income for an average Australian investor. The incremental bene t
      of trade in foreign assets amounts to another 28.4 percent of annual income.
      For several countries, the opportunity to trade risky nancial assets is worth
      more to the average investor than per capita national income.
    These huge gains re ect enormous bene ts from exploiting the return premium
      on risky assets. Of course, the calculations that deliver these huge gains re ect
      particular assumptions about risk aversion, asset returns and participation in
       nancial markets. We explore the sensitivity of the welfare results to these
      assumptions below.
    While the pure hedging bene ts of trade in risky assets are tiny in comparison
      to the risk premium bene ts, they are not trivial. They amount to one-half
      percent of income or more for most countries under perfect substitutability,
      and somewhat less under additive separability.
    For many countries, the hedging cost is negative. This means that the aver-
      age investor's hedge portfolio is an asset fund with a positive excess return.
      Put di erently, it means that trade in risky assets o ers the opportunity for
  27 The HB term captures only the between-country component of risk-sharing. It does not capture
any within-country risk-sharing bene ts a orded by trade in risky foreign (or domestic) assets.

      the investor to reduce overall income and consumption variability while also
      increasing expected income and consumption.

6.3 International Risk Sharing
We now focus on the issue of international risk sharing. As discussed in the Introduc-
tion, previous work nds that potential gains from international risk sharing are large,
and largely unrealized. According to Van Wincoop (1999) and Athanasoulis and Van
Wincoop (2000), the annual gains to full international risk sharing are roughly 1-2
percent of GDP for wealthy countries and three or four times as much for a broader
set of countries.
    One possible explanation for the failure to achieve these gains is that nancial
markets do not span the space of national output innovations. If the spanning re-
quirement fails in a serious way, then feasible gains to international risk sharing are
considerably smaller than potential gains. The results in Section 5 (Tables 7 through
9) con rm that incomplete nancial markets sharply limit the risk sharing gains from
a properly structured portfolio of nancial assets. This inference follows because the
R-squared values are far below unity in regressions of national output innovations
on asset returns. Thus much of the stochastic variation in national output lies out-
side the span of assets. In this sense, incomplete nancial markets are part of the
                          28


explanation for limited international risk sharing.
    However, three aspects of Tables 11 and 12 imply that market incompleteness is
at best a partial explanation for the lack of international risk sharing. First, as we
remarked above, the hedging bene ts that can be achieved by a properly structured
asset portfolio are nontrivial. While a formal analysis of the issue is beyond the scope
of this study, the feasible hedging bene ts in Tables 11 and 12 appear larger than
the risk-sharing gains achieved in practice. Perhaps transactions costs in nancial
markets can account for the failure to achieve hedging bene ts of the magnitudes
reported in Tables 11 and 12. However, the hedging bene ts become much larger if,
following Baxter and Jermann (1997), we assume that national output innovations
are highly positively correlated with domestic equity returns.
    Second, for many countries the cost of hedging national output innovations greatly
exceeds the bene ts. These costs take the form of negative excess returns on the hedge
portfolio. Consider the example of Australia in the perfect substitution case (Table
11). The lower variance of consumption and wealth a orded by the hedge portfolio
  28 Of course, one can argue that we fail to consider the \right" assets. We do not dismiss the
possibility that other nancial assets might o er additional hedging opportunities, but our asset
menu includes the leading candidates that can be traded in liquid markets.


                                              24
is worth 1.3 percent of income for the average Australian investor. But the cost of
achieving this variance reduction amounts to 5.0 percent of income.
    This aspect of our results shows that the failure to achieve greater international
risk sharing is related to the puzzlingly large return premia on risky assets. Consider
the situation for a country with an equity premium of several percentage points and a
modest positive correlation between national outut innovations and domestic equity
returns. The average investor in such a country can achieve some hedging bene ts by
adopting a short position in domestic equity, but only at the cost of large negative
excess returns. Given this situation, the average investor adopts a long, not short,
position in domestic equity, unless he is extremely risk averse. If the equity premium
were very small, as implied by standard dynamic equilibrium theory, then the hedging
costs would also be very small, and the investor would instead adopt a short position
in domestic equity. Thus the puzzling lack of international risk sharing is connected
to the puzzling large return premia on risky assets.
    Third, Tables 11 and 12 show that standard portfolio allocation implies enormous
bene ts of investment in risky nancial assets, domestic and foreign. These huge
gains predominantly re ect the returns to taking on market risk, not the bene ts of
hedging. Most real-world investors do not adopt portfolios that lead to the bene ts
reported in Tables 11 and 12. Given the size of these bene ts, it will be a challenge
to rationalize the failure of investors to behave according to the theory by appealing
to the costs of transacting in nancial markets.
    In summary, our analysis identi es three distinct reasons for the lack of interna-
tional risk sharing. First, the spanning requirement for nancial markets fails in a
serious way, which sharply limits the gains from a portfolio-based approach to inter-
national risk sharing. Second, for many countries the cost of using nancial assets
to hedge national output shocks exceeds the bene ts. This fact partly re ects the
puzzling large return premia on risky assets. Third, investors do not behave in the
manner implied by standard portfolio allocation theory. The unrealized gains of op-
timal portfolio allocations are enormous, according to the theory.

6.4 Sensitivity to Risk Aversion and the Equity Premium
We now consider the sensitivity of our welfare results to assumptions about risk
aversion and the equity premium. To streamline the presentation, we return to the
simple case for which the portfolio choice menu includes only one risky asset, domestic
equity.
   Figures 1 and 2 show how the bene ts of trade in domestic equity vary with risk
aversion and the size of the equity premium. The gures show the GDP-weighted
                                          25
average welfare e ects, as a percentage of income, for the 18 countries in our sample.
We compute the welfare gains under the assumption of perfect correlation between
natonal output innovations and domestic equity returns, but the gures are also
informative about the near-zero correlation case that holds in our sample. Given a
zero correlation between output innovations and equity returns, the hedge portfolio
vanishes, so that we can read the total bene ts of the optimal portfolio from the
\Risk Premium Bene t".
    The gures show that the bene ts of an optimal equity position are very large
unless risk aversion is much greater than three, or unless the equity premium is much
smaller than historical returns suggest. Given historical equity premia, perfect corre-
lation between returns and output innovations and perfect substitutability between
traded and nontraded goods, it takes a risk aversion level in the neighborhood of 10
to push the bene ts of the optimal equity position below one percent of income. It
takes much greater risk aversion to push the bene ts down to modest levels, if we as-
sume low correlation between returns and output innovations or additive separability
bwetween traded and nontraded goods.
    Even a relative risk aversion level of 10, let alone 30 or 40, is very diÆcult to
reconcile with other ndings in the literature on international risk sharing. The con-
sumption and output-based research summarized by Lewis (1999) and Van Wincoop
(1999) nds international risk sharing gains on the order of a few percent of GDP for
relative risk aversion levels in the neighborhood of 3. If relative risk aversion levels are
in fact several times larger than 3, then so are the gains to international risk sharing
implied by this work. Unrealized gains of such large magnitudes are highly implau-
sible. Hence, we conclude that high risk aversion alone cannot rationalize the set of
puzzles related to international risk sharing, portfolio allocation and asset pricing.
    The gures also show that the gains from an optimal portfolio position decline
rapidly with the equity premium. Given uncertainty about the true equity premium,
this result implies that Tables 11 and 12 may substantially overstate the welfare ben-
e ts of an optimal portfolio and the gains to international trade in risky nancial
assets. Likewise, Tables 9 and 10 may substantially overstate the size of the optimal
long position in equities. However, Figures 1 and 2 also imply that overstated equity
premia cannot be the full explanation for the portfolio puzzle and the gains-to-trade
puzzle. Suppose that true equity premia are only 60 percent as large as the historical
premia, and consider the most favorable case for the theory { perfect substitution
between traded and nontraded goods and perfect correlation between output inno-
vations and equity returns. Under these assumptions and a relative risk aversion of
three, the bene ts of an optimal equity position still exceed 7 percent of income. Re-

                                            26
laxing the perfect correlation or perfect substitution assumption implies even larger
bene ts. Hence, we conclude that overstated risk premia cannot rationalize the set
of puzzles related to international risk sharing, portfolio allocation and asset pricing.

7 Limited Participation
Much recent work in nance and macroeconomics stresses that most households have
little or no risky asset holdings, and that stock ownership is highly concentrated.
Poterba (2000), for example, reports that the top 5 percent of households ranked by
stock ownership hold 86.1 percent of all common stock. By contrast, the 5 percent
of households ranked by home ownership account for only 50.1 percent of housing
equity. Human capital is also much less concentrated than stock ownership. In
       29


light of these facts, researchers have explored the possibility that concentrated eq-
uity ownership and limited participation in nancial markets may resolve some asset
pricing puzzles.  30


     Following this lead, we show that limited participation goes a long way towards
simultaneously addressing the equity premium and gains-to-trade puzzles. Recall
from Proposition 2 that, according to the theory, a country takes a long net position
in its own equity if the autarky Sharpe ratio for its domestic equity is lower than the
corresponding world Sharpe ratio. In Section 6 we showed that the autarky Sharpe
ratios under full participation are dramatically smaller than observed Sharpe ratios.
Proposition 3 tells us that this large gap implies large gains from trade.
     We now consider how limited participation a ects autarky Sharpe ratios and,
consequently, the gains to trade in risky nancial assets. Recall from Proposition 2
that the autarky Sharpe ratio in the one-asset case is
                                        h                  i

 nd that pricing assets using the consumption behavior of stockholders rather than the population as
a whole provides more realistic asset prices. Saito (1995), Basak and Cuoco (1998), Constantinides,
Donaldson and Mehra (1999) and Heaton and Lucas (1999) consider general equilibrium models
with various forms of restricted participation and also generate more realistic asset prices.

    Comparing equations (12) and (13), we see that limited participation a ects the
Sharpe ratio in three ways. First, if mean absolute risk aversion among traders is lower
than the population average, then limited participation lowers the autarky Sharpe
ratio (term (1)). Second, rather than spreading the risk of nancial assets across
the whole population, limited participation concentrates it among traders (term (2)).
Third, if the traders' covariance of non- nancial wealth with the risky asset is higher
than the covariance for the population as a whole, the Sharpe ratio will be higher,
too.31


    To illustrate how limited participation bears on the equity premium and gains-to-
trade puzzles, we calibrate equation (13). We consider the U.S. economy and make
the following assumptions. First, we assume that "traders" own all risky nancial
assets, which we take to be either 5 or 15 percent of total national wealth. Second, in
calibrating absolute risk aversion to a relative risk aversion of three, we assume that
the remaining wealth is equally distributed among all agents, including traders. It
follows that the percentage of total wealth owned by traders in our calibration equals
95 + 5 or 85 + 15. Third, we assume that the market value of risky nancial assets
amounts to 50,000 dollars per person. Fourth, based on Table 4, we set the standard
deviation of equity returns to 17.6 percent. Finally, we set the covariance between
equity returns and non- nancial wealth for traders to zero.
    Given these assumptions, Figure 3 shows how the autarky Sharpe ratio and the
gains from trade vary with the participation rate,  . The welfare bene ts of trade
in the top panel are scaled by total population, so it is necessary to divide by the
participation rate to obtain the welfare bene ts per trader.
  31 Davis and Willen (2000) nd that the covariance between human capital and equity returns rises
with education. Other studies nd that asset market participation rises with education. Together,
these two pieces of evidence suggest that the third e ect of limited participation raises the Sharpe
ratio. We do not include this e ect in our calculations below.


                                                28
    The lower panel of Figure 3 shows that limited participation has a powerful e ect
on the Sharpe Ratio when participation rates are low. In thinking about how to gauge
the appropriate participation rate, it is useful to recall the discussion of Tables 9 and
10 in Section 6.1. Only a small percentage of households have risky asset holdings
anywhere near the magnitudes implied by the theory, although a much larger fraction
of households have modest holdings of risky assets (e.g., Heaton and Lucas, 2000).
However, households with small risky asset holdings are not \participating" in the
sense implied by the theory, and they are certainly not exposed to equity risk to
any substantial degree. The upshot of these remarks is that a value of  in the
neighborhood of .1 is a reasonable choice. This choice corresponds to a 14.5 or 23.5
percent gure for traders' share of total wealth. A value for  in this neighborhood
leads to a big increase in the theoretical Sharpe Ratio, relative to the full participation
benchmark, although it is still well below the observed U.S. Sharpe Ratio.
    The top panel of Figure 3 shows that the gains from trade fall o very rapidly as
we reduce the participation rate. In fact, as we move away from full participation,
the gains from trade decline more than in proportion to the decline in participation.
This result can be understood by recognizing the two channels through which limited
participation reduces the gains from trade. First, there is a direct mechanical e ect
of lower participation. People who do not participate in asset markets cannot partake
in the gains from trade. Second, as equity holdings become more concentrated among
fewer investors, the autarky Sharpe Ratio rises, which reduces the gains available to
any particular investor. In the neighborhood of  = :1, the gains from trade in risky
assets are rather modest.

8 Concluding Remarks
We nd enormous gains from trade when asset returns are calibrated to observed
risk premia and all agents participate in asset markets. This gains-to-trade puzzle is
closely related to the celebrated equity premium puzzle. In particular, for reasonable
degrees of risk aversion, the huge theoretical gains to trade arise from the rewards to
taking on market risk, not from the bene ts of international risk sharing.
    While the two puzzles are related, they are also distinct. One can rationalize
the equity premium puzzle in standard models by assuming very high risk aversion.
However, this "solution" merely alters the form of the gains-to-trade puzzle, because
highly risk averse investors perceive very large rewards to international risk sharing.
So the gains-to-trade puzzle remains.
    In an e ort to address the puzzles, we consider a version of our theoretical frame-

                                            29
work with limited participation in the markets for risky nancial assets. We show that
limited participation goes a long way to addressing the equity premium and gains-
to-trade puzzles, given a reasonable degree of risk aversion and empirically plausible
values for the participation rate, the rst two moments of equity returns and other
quantities. This result suggests that limited participation is a promising avenue for
explaining the equity premium and gains-to-trade puzzles, but more research on this
topic is clearly warranted before reaching any strong conclusions.
    Our analysis also sheds light on the puzzling lack of international risk sharing.
Van Wincoop (1999), among others, makes a compelling case that the potential gains
to international risk sharing are sizeable, but largely unrealized. We identify three
distinct reasons for limited international risk sharing. First, the requirement that
  nancial markets span the space of national output shocks fails in a serious way. This
failure sharply limits the gains from a portfolio-based approach to international risk
sharing. Second, for many countries the cost of using nancial assets to hedge national
output shocks greatly exceeds the bene ts. This fact re ects the puzzlingly large
return premia on risky assets, and it suggests that a full resolution to international
risk sharing puzzles requires the development of more successful asset pricing theories.
Third, investors do not behave in the manner implied by standard portfolio theory.
This point is usually cast in terms of "home bias" in observed asset portfolios relative
to the internationally diversi ed portfolios predicted by the theory.
    We do not resolve the home bias puzzle, but we point out that standard portfolio
theory also implies a puzzlingly high level of risky asset holdings relative to the ob-
served holdings of the average investor. Furthermore, the theory implies implausibly
large foregone gains for the majority of the population that has modest holdings of
risky nancial assets. We think this puzzle has a simple resolution. Speci cally, few
investors have enough liquid wealth to adopt the risky asset positions implied by the
theory, nor can they borrow at the risk-free rate. If borrowing rates are comparable to
the expected return on equities, for example, then the apparent excess returns o ered
by equity vanish, and so do the large gains from a theoretically optimal portfolio.
While this explanation is not deep, it helps understand limited participation in risky
asset markets. Of course, households that do not participate in asset markets cannot
pursue a portfolio-based approach to international risk sharing.

9 Appendix A. Proofs to Theoretical Propositions
Proof: (Proposition 1) Davis and Willen (2000) provide a constructive proof in
the nite-horizon case that converges to the consumption and portfolio allocation
solutions stated in Proposition 1 as the horizon goes to in nity. It can be shown di-
rectly that the in nite-horizon solutions satisfy the Euler Equation, sequential budget
constraints and transversality condition. The text shows this in the one-asset case
for the portfolio allocation rule. 
Proof: (Proposition 2)The text proves the one-asset case. The multi-asset case is
a straightforward generalization.
    To prove Proposition 3, we need the following two Lemmas.
Lemma 1 (Variance decomposition of generalized wealth) Under conditions 1, 2
and 3, the weighted-average variance of generalized wealth in country g can be decom-
posed as follows:
     1    X
                       ~
              aAh var GW
                                h
                                     
                                           = H1g aAh var Y~ h E Y~ hjR~ + aA1 g S0S;
                                                X                    
                                                                                                                (14)

where Y~ h E Y~ hjR
                  ~ is the residual in a projection of the endowment present value on
contemporaneous asset returns.
Proof: Consider the one-asset case. The multi-asset case is a simple generalization.
Substituting in the optimal solution, we get:

Lemma 2 Consider an economy with assets R         ~ z = CR~ x where C is any square, non-
singular (J  J ) matrix. An individual's portfolio will have the same cost and distribution,
regardless of whether he faces R~ z or CR~ x.
Proof:Let a 'z' subscript denote moments with respect to assets R~ z and so on. It is
easy to see that: z = CxC0, z = C x. The excess returns will be: ERz = CERx
and the excess return on the optimal portfolio will be ER0z !hz = A ER0z z ERz              1
                                                                                             h

ER0z z g . Substituting in the expressions above, we get the same excess return as
           1


in the untransformed economy. Similarly substituting into R~ 0z !hz = A R~ 0z z ERz             1
                                                                                                 h

   For multiple assets, replace the new asset with its orthogonal projection. By
Lemma 2 this has no e ect on the consumption outcomes. Then follow the above

    Unfortunately, the breakdown of Furniture and Household Operation category
into subcategories is not available for some countries, so we classify the entire cat-

                                        36
egory as tradable. The same is true for the broad category of transportation and
communication. We sometimes lack the ner breakdown for food as well, although
all of its subcategories are tradable.
    For some countries, the SNA provides several overlapping constant-price consump-
tion series each indexed to a di erent base year (all are xed-weight quantity indices).
In these cases we chain link the di erent constant-price series together, using the most
recent weights available. The table B.3 below lists the sample of countries and the
range of years used for each series - nominal GDP, nominal consumption, and real
consumption. For the real consumption series, we also list the base years used for
each country and the range of years used for each base year.
    The footnotes to table B.3 indicate that there are quite a few countries where
some of the more nely disaggregated tradables consumption categories are miss-
ing. In these cases we use the more highly aggregated consumption categories in the
tradables/nontradables classi cation.

gated breakdown of category (1) when calculating computing the average world price
level and country weight. Also missing category (4B).

13. Data is available on the more nely disaggregated breakdown from 1985-1995
only. We use the broader tradables categories when constructing the country weight.

10.2 Financial Data
10.2.1 Stock Returns
Stock returns data are from Morgan Stanley Capital International, extracted from
the Ibbotson's database. The database contains data on the national stock indices of
14 out of the 18 countries in our sample, as well as a value-weighted \world" stock
index containing the stock returns of about 22 nations. The time series generally
begin in 1970. We use the total returns series, which include dividend reinvestment.
10.2.2 Government Bond Returns
Long-term goverment bonds are also from Ibbotson's, and are calculated using data
on yields from the IMF. We use the total returns series, which include capital appre-
ciation as well as coupon payments. The database contains total returns series for 11
                                         38
out of the 18 countries in our sample; the time series generally start in 1957.
   Ibbotson's does not produce a world return series for government bonds, and
unfortunately, we were unable to obtain data on the market value of outstanding
long-term government bonds to contruct a proper value-weighted index. We construct
a \world" value-weighted government bond return using the market value of total
government debt as the value weight. We convert from local currencies into dollars
using period-end exchange rates. The data on the market value of government debt
comes from the IMF's IFS. The world bond return is constructed in dollar terms,
before it is converted into each country's local currency and de ated.
10.2.3 Commodity Prices
The Goldman Sachs commodity price index is extracted from DRI (pneumonic GSCIX@1960
and GSCIX in the @INDEX/DATA module). As noted in the text, the nominal rate
of return is simply the log di erence between the price of the index on the last day
of the previous year minus the price of the index on the last day of the current year.
10.2.4 Short Term Interest Rates
Data on short term rates are from the IFS. If available, we use data on the treasury
bill interest rate. If not available, we use the money market rate or discount rate.
10.2.5 Exchange Rates
We obtained data on spot exchange rates from IFS. The data on one-year-ahead
forward exchange rates are from the Harris Bank weekly review obtained from Chris
Telmer at http://bertha.gsia.cmu.edu/ les/fx/. These data are available for 8 of the
18 countries in our sample (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, and the UK.) For 6 additional countries (Australia, Austria, Denmark,
Finland, Norway, and Sweden), we obtained data on three-month-ahead forward rates
from DRI. The mnemonics follow the pattern LB@CXXX from the @IMF module,
where XXX is the country number - 193 for Australia, for example,

spot rate of exchange at the end of quarter q in year t, and let rt;q be the three-month

11 Appendix C. Hedged Versus Unhedged Returns
   in the Regression Speci cations
The regressions in Tables 7 and 8 specify returns on world bonds, world equities and
commodity prices in unhedged form. By including the returns on a forward position in
the foreign exchange market as a separate regressor, these regressions are equivalent,
up to a linear approximation, to a regression that speci es foreign asset returns in
fully hedged form.
    To see this point, consider our speci cation with one risky foreign asset plus the
return on the forward position.                  32

    We can now see that the same variables entering this equation also enter into
the linear approximation to the equation we estimate. There are some additional
covariance terms in this equation, but if those terms do not vary much over time, they
will be swept into the constant. (Condition 3 in our theoretical model assumes that
all higher moments are time invariant.) Thus our speci cation approximately nests a
speci cation with fully hedged returns on foreign assets. However, our speci cation
also allows the coeÆcient on F Rt;t =SRt to di er in an arbitrary way from the
                                           +1         +1

coeÆcient on Rtf , unlike a speci cation that imposes full hedging.
                +1

    Two other points are worth mentioning. First, the linear approximation formulas
suggest that we should include SRt =SRt as a separate regressor in our speci cations.
                                          +1

However, the returns on this position and the forward position, F Rt;t =SRt , are               +1   +1

highly collinear (correlations ranging from .95 to .98 across countries), so we do
not include them. Second, according to the theory an investor generally wants to
include risky assets in hedged and unhedged form. But specifying the regression
equations in this way would use up additional degrees of freedom and probably lead
to imprecisely estimated slope coeÆcients. Our speci cation can be interpreted as a
linear approximation to this more general speci cation, but it conserves on degrees
of freedom.

     Notes:
       1. Data on rates of return are from Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI). Market capitalization values are from the
          Ibbotson's database. Stock market capitalization values are from the Financial Times, and corporate bond capitalizations
          are from Salomon Brothers. See Section 4 and Appendix B for a description.
       2. Capital's share is business income as a percent of net domestic product less indirect business taxes. Business income is
          business gross operating surplus net of depreciation. These data, which we describe more fully in Section 4 and Appendix
        B, are from the UN System of National Accounts.
     3. We measure business wealth as the present value of future business income ows, discounted at the country's average
        annual stock market rate of return from 1981 to 1996. We use observed values of business income through 1995 (1994 for
        Germany and Sweden). For later years, we use projected values based on the assumption that business income grows at
        the own-country average rate from 1981 to 1995.
     4. We measure total wealth as business wealth times the reciprocal of capital's share of national income in the same year.
     5. The last four columns report the market value of business equity and debt securities at year end as a percentage of business
        and total wealth in 1980 and 1990.

       1. Table entries report the mean drift and the standard deviation of the innovations for random walk speci cations t to
          various measures of per capita real output. The output measures in natural units are expressed in 1990 U.S. dollars. See
          the text for an explanation of how we de ated nominal output series and converted to dollars.
       2. The Ljung-Box Q test for autocorrelation is taken out to 6 lags. The p-value is the marginal signi cance level in a test of
          the null hypothesis of no serial correlation in the rst di erence of the output measure. Unreported results for per capita
          output in natural units are very similar.

  1. The annual percentage return on the commodity price index is computed as
     the world return in dollars converted to local currency using contemporaneous
     exchange rates, and de ated by the country's consumption price de ator for all
     goods.
  2. The annual percentage return for the foreign exchange position is a domestic
     real return. See the text for an explanation of how this return is calculated.
  3. The Ljung-Box Q test is taken out to 6 lags.

     Note:
       1. Each country's output and traded output regression is separately estimated by OLS.

       2. Heteroscedasticity-corrected standard errors (in parentheses) are computed from the covariance matrix,
                  1              1
          (X 0X ) X 0 X (X 0X ) , where is the diagonal of uu0, and u is the vector of OLS residuals.
       3. Data are not available over the entire sample period for all countries.

Notes:
  1. The Observed Sharpe Ratio is calculated as the average real return on
     domestic equity (Table 4) minus a riskless real return of 2.5 percent, divided
     by the standard deviation of returns on domestic equity (Table 4).
  2. The Autarky Sharpe Ratio is calculated according to Proposition 2. It equals
     the product of the slope coeÆcient in a regression of output innovations on
     own-country equity returns and the standard deviation of own-country equity
     returns.
  3. The Optimal Equity Position and the Hedge Portion are calculated according
     to Proposition 1. The calculations treat domestic equity as the only risky
     asset traded by the investor. The expected returns on equity and their
     standard deviations are set equal to sample values.
  4. Results based on the "Estimated Covariances" rely on sample covariances
     between national output innovations on own-country equity returns. Results
     based on "Perfect Correlation" set the covariance so that national output
     innovations and domestic equity returns are perfectly correlated.
  5. All investors are assumed to have a relative risk aversion level of 3. See the
     text for a description of how absolute risk aversion coeÆcients are calibrated.
