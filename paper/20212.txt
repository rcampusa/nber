                                             ABSTRACT

Prior research has shown that exogenous shocks to the demand for medical products spur additional
product development. These studies do not distinguish between breakthrough products and those that
largely duplicate the performance of existing products. In this paper, we use a novel data set to explore
the impact of the introduction of Medicare Part D on the development of new biotechnology products.
We find that the law spurred development of products targeting illnesses that affect the elderly, but
most of this effect is concentrated among products aimed at diseases that already have multiple existing
treatments. Moreover, we find no increase in products targeting orphan disease or those receiving
either fast track or priority review status from the FDA. This suggests that marginal changes in demand
may have little effect on the development of products with large welfare benefits.

1. INTRODUCTION

        The profits of pharmaceutical firms receive a large amount of attention and have caused many

in the popular press and policymaking community to propose various policies to limit them (e.g.

Rome, 2013). Critics claim that firms selling branded drugs under patent protection set prices at many

multiples of marginal costs, excessively exploiting both their monopoly power and the inelastic

demand for these often life-saving products. Industry defenders counter that high prices are necessary

to offset expensive and uncertain research and development, and that if profits were to fall, incentives

for future innovation would suffer. Danzon (2000) provides the quintessential defense of the industry:

“[a]ny form of price regulation, including the setting of uniform prices within the United States or

cross-nationally, would discourage innovation.” Similarly, discussing the re-importation of low-price

pharmaceuticals to the United States, Bast (2004) wrote “increasing importation means cutting off the

stream of investment that makes this system sustainable. It means fewer new lifesaving drugs.”

        Many studies bolster the arguments of pharmaceutical industry supporters by documenting a

causal relationship between expected profitability, primarily from changes in market size, and new

products. Some of these studies find a link between demand and research activity (Ward and Dranove,

1997; Kyle and McGahan, 2012; Blume-Kohut and Sood, 2013; Finkelstein, 2004) while others find

that higher expected profits result in a greater number of products actually reaching market (Acemoglu

and Linn, 2004; Finkelstein, 2004; Cerda 2007; Dubois et al., 2014).

        Industry critics counter that most recently approved new drugs are little more than slightly

modified versions of existing products whose development costs far outstrip any benefits (e.g. Spector,

2005; Angell, 2012). Marcia Angell, former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, has been an

outspoken critic stating “[i]n fact, the big drug companies now concentrate mainly on … producing

variations of top-selling drugs already on the market (emphasis added) —called ‘me-too’ drugs. There is very

little innovative research in the modern pharmaceutical industry, despite its claims to the contrary”


                                                     1
(Angell, 2010). According to Angell and other industry critics, restrictions on industry prices and

profits will not harm welfare even if they deter new product development, because they will largely

affect this “me-too” innovation.

         Prior research connecting demand and research investments does little to address the concerns

of these industry critics because the studies generally fail to determine whether the marginal products

are actually “innovative,” i.e. they make positive contributions to social value, or simply represent rent-

seeking by private firms. For example, Acemoglu and Linn (2004) found an increase in new molecular

entities targeting conditions with growing patient populations which they suggest represents new

innovation. However, they do not distinguish between new molecular entities that represent genuine

welfare-improving therapeutic breakthroughs and those that are simply “variations of top-selling drugs

already on the market.” As an illustration of this point, consider the first anti-cholesterol statin drug

Lovostatin. This product uses a radically different biochemical pathway which makes it far more

effective than prior cholesterol reducing drugs and might be considered more innovative, and offer a

larger increase in welfare, than the subsequent ten statin drugs to reach the market, all of which

effectively use the same pathway. 1 Since each subsequent statin was a new chemical entity, Acemoglu

and Linn’s classification would broadly consider each to be equally innovative.

         We contribute to this debate by examining how biotechnology firms responded to the creation

of Medicare Part D (hereafter Part D) – a large expansion of pharmaceutical insurance coverage for

elderly Americans. Blume-Kohut and Sood (BKS; 2013) found that Part D increased research

investments in the overall pharmaceutical sector. However, much like the previous literature, BKS did

not distinguish between the type of firm (i.e. traditional pharmaceutical or biotechnology), the type of

pharmaceutical (i.e. small molecule or biologic), or any other measure of the potential welfare

1 These drugs inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is a key building block for cholesterol. We recognize that
several early statin drugs were in development at the same time; it is difficult to say that any one of these was more
innovative than the others. But the ongoing “patent racing” may have involved greater expenditures in drug development
than was socially optimal. New statin drugs more closely fit the model of research described by Angell.

contributions of the new products. Without these distinctions, it is possible that most of the research

activity identified in BKS provides little social value because it involves the me-too small molecule

products frequently cited by critics of pharmaceutical firms. We overcome this limitation by classifying

research activity using several measures of the novelty of the innovation.

         This is not merely an exercise in taxonomy. At the broadest level, new pharmaceutical

products can improve health and/or decrease prices, both of which provide value to consumers but

have far different welfare consequences. If research investments in the pharmaceutical sector are

aimed at “me-too” products then they primarily represent business stealing. If the demand in the

product category is inelastic, as is the case with many pharmaceuticals, this business stealing may lower

prices without meaningfully increasing welfare. However, if investments result in novel products that

improve health, they will increase welfare – though much of the increase may initially be captured by

pharmaceutical firms through monopoly prices charged while the product is under patent. 2

         It is not surprising that previous work has failed to systematically classify individual products

based on their contribution to social value. 3 Trusheim, Aitken and Berndt (2010) state, “[i]t is difficult

if not impossible to quantify reliably, objectively and unambiguously the extent to which new

biopharmaceuticals embody significant innovation and address unmet medical needs.” This difficulty

stems, at least in part, from the fact that drugs can be novel across two broad attributes. First, a

product could be a true innovation in molecular development and therefore represent scientific

advancement. Products in this category are by definition not simply variations of existing products.

Second, products could expand treatment applications by targeting conditions that previously had few


2 Some studies have found evidence of health benefits from aggregate research and development spending on
pharmaceuticals (e.g.,Budish, Roin and Williams, 2013). However, there is little evidence of the benefits from the change in
investment activity following a marginal increase in demand.
3 One partial exception is Finkelstein (2004), which considers the effect on research activity from expanded public health

vaccination policies – a setting that by definition involves the creation of products for which there are already treatments.
Even in this more limited setting, Finkelstein can concentrate on the question of the innovative nature of new products
and finds no evidence of new pre-clinical studies or patent filings for vaccines. This provides some of the first suggestive
evidence that the new clinical trials do not necessarily reflect large technological advances or improvements in therapy.



                                                              3
or no existing options. Products exhibiting such therapeutic innovation likely have the most immediate

effect on welfare. However, scientific advancements may also contribute to welfare for conditions with

some existing treatments by offering novel pathways for patients that do not respond to available

options. In addition, progress in basic science could facilitate the future development of products that

target untreated conditions. New products that are neither meaningful scientific advancements nor an

expansion of treatment applications primarily represent business stealing with little welfare

improvement.

         Of course, each new product represents varying degrees of scientific advancement and

therapeutic innovation, which makes classifying them on a product by product basis quite difficult. In

our analysis, we take two steps in that direction. First, we concentrate on products developed by

biotechnology firms. The firms in our sample distinguish themselves from traditional pharmaceutical

firms by primarily using biological technologies and/or targeting conditions that have an unmet

medical need (Thompson Reuters, 2014). As we explain in Section 3, biological technologies

(biologics) are, almost by definition, scientific advancements to some degree. They certainly are not

“variations of top selling” small molecule drugs already on the market and, by the nature of the

science, they are not even simple variations of each other – i.e. one cannot easily create a new biologic

through a simple manipulation of an existing one. 4 As a product category, biologics are also more

likely to represent therapeutic innovations. For example, these products are more likely than small

molecule products to target orphan diseases which are designated by the FDA as relatively rare

diseases that lack existing treatments (Trusheim, Aitken, and Berndt, 2010). In addition to biologics,

many biotechnology firms also research and produce a limited number of small molecule products

targeting unmet medical needs such as hepatitis C (Gilead’s Sovaldi) and multiple sclerosis (Biogen


4The exception is “biosimilars,” which are equivalent to generics for small molecules and are a new and emerging market.
Unlike generic drugs, biosimilars are not exact copies of the branded product but instead represent a close approximation.
The degree of similarity is a source of great debate (Schellekens, 2004).



                                                             4
Idec’s Tecfidera). We are unable to separately identify all small molecule products in our sample, but

note that they are a minority of the products in our sample.

         By demonstrating a specific link between demand and research into biologicals, we can provide

initial evidence that profitability drives the development of products that are likely to be scientifically

innovative. We also consider whether profitability drives development of therapeutically innovative

products, by distinguishing between those biotech products that are “first to treat” a condition

(henceforth FTTs) and those that augment the arsenal (henceforth AAs). Though there will be

exceptions, it is likely that FTT drugs provide greater welfare benefits than AAs. For example, contrast

Gilead’s small molecule product Sovaldi with Sanofi’s biologic product Zaltrap. Sovaldi provides the

first cure for hepatitis C and represents a large welfare increase, which Gilead is set to capture through

very high prices that are unlikely to greatly limit demand. In contrast, Zaltrap treats metastatic colon

cancer, which is treated to a similar degree by several existing products such as Avastin, Erbitux,

Stivarga, and Vectibix. Perhaps as an indication of its relatively small welfare contribution, Sanofi’s

revenues from Zaltrap put it far short of blockbuster status. 5

         We acknowledge that the FTT versus AA distinction may fail to capture some aspects of

therapeutic innovation. Therefore, we also consider whether marginal demand shocks encouraged

socially valuable products as indicated by three designations awarded by the FDA during the

development and review process: orphan drug designation, fast track status, and priority review. As

mentioned earlier, orphan drugs treat rare conditions lacking existing cures. The FDA grants fast track

status to drugs undergoing clinical trials that promise to provide treatment for conditions for which no

other drug works as well. Similarly, the FDA grants priority review to promising drugs that have

completed clinical trials and await final approval. Together, these three designations are intended to

promote the development of products that improve welfare.

5Zaltrap’s first year sales were well below $50 million (Hall, 2013). In contrast, Sovaldi is on track to be the highest
grossing pharmaceutical in the first year after approval (Rockoff, 2014b).



                                                               5
         We find that following the passage of Part D there was a relative increase in clinical trial

activity for biotech products aimed at diseases that have a higher Medicare market share (MMS), i.e.

diseases that are more prevalent among elderly Americans. Figure 1 shows the number of clinical trials

by whether a disease has an above or below median MMS. Prior to the passage of Part D, clinical trial

activity was very similar across these two categories. However, after the passage there is a marked

increase in clinical trials for products aimed at drugs with a higher MMS. The number of clinical trials

for above-median MMS drugs peaks in 2008 and then declines. A similar decline is seen for below-

median MMS drugs suggesting that this was primarily a secular change, perhaps as a result of the broad

decline in the macroeconomy. These results are generally similar to the pattern for the more traditional

pharmaceutical sector contained in the data used by BKS. Previous research has shown that biologics,

a major component of the product portfolio for the biotech firms in our sample, are generally more

scientifically and therapeutically innovative than small molecule products. Therefore, our results

suggest the increase in expected profits did more than simply spur the development “me-too”

products.

         As we discuss in Section 2, the extent to which expansions in market size can spur therapeutic

innovation is unclear, as scientific barriers may outweigh any marginal increases in profitability.

Figures 2 and 3 preview the results of these analyses. Figure 2 contains the number of indications

entered to clinical trials by above or below median MMS status for diseases with at most one existing

treatment (i.e. FTTs). 6 Both categories have a large and similar number of clinical trials each year

before Part D. There is no change in this pattern following the passage of Part D. This suggests that

scientific rather than market barriers are the constraint on investments in FTTs. In contrast, Figure 3

contains the number of clinical trials by year for diseases with five or more existing treatments (i.e.


6 In our data, each observation is a unique targeted condition and clinical trial pair. Thus each clinical trial can have more
than one observation in our data. For readability, throughout this paper we will describe this unique pairing as a “clinical
trial.”



                                                               6
AAs). Prior to the passage of Part D there was little difference in the level or trends in clinical trial

activity based on MMS. Beginning immediately after the insurance expansion there was a marked

increase in the number of clinical trials for products aimed at diseases with an above median MMS.

Figures 2 and 3 suggest that research activity for AAs is far more sensitive to demand shocks than for

diseases with FTTs. We find thematically similar results when we look at FDA designations of a

product’s innovativeness.

       Taken together, our results provide a far more nuanced view of innovation in the

pharmaceutical sector than is offered by either supporters or critics of the industry. In the biotech

sector, a category dominated by firms believed to be creating a greater proportion of generally

innovative products, we see a clear response in research activity following a demand shock. This

demonstrates that, at the broadest level, financial incentives do more than simply reward pure copy-cat

firms. However, our results also suggest that, at least over the first decade, marginal changes in

demand do not appear to spur new clinical trial activity for diseases that currently have few to no

treatment options. It is possible that it takes longer than a decade to generate the science necessary for

new clinical trials for truly novel therapeutic breakthroughs. However, it is important to note that our

indicator of research investments, the first clinical trials for humans, is fairly early in the drug

development process. At a minimum, our results show that if Part D did spur the new science

necessary for FTT drugs, it will take a long time for consumers to realize the benefits.

       In the rest of this paper we describe the innovative process for pharmaceuticals and how

responses to demand shocks could reasonably differ based on the number of existing treatments. We

then provide a summary of the biotechnology sector and the Medicare Part D program. In Section 5

we describe our data and in Section 6 we present our evidence on the change in clinical trial activity

following the passage of Medicare Part D. In Section 7 we conclude.




                                                    7
2. THE INNOVATIVE PROCESS FOR PHARMACEUTICALS

There are many paths to pharmaceutical innovation. The traditional model of “big pharma” firms is to

employ scientists across a range of disciplines who may work on projects based on areas of science

(e.g., cell biology) or application (e.g. cardiovascular disease.) Many of these firms give their scientists

some freedom to pursue their own projects (Stern, 2004). 7 Smaller firms, including many biotech

companies, are often either spun off by bigger companies or started by academics whose research is

usually funded by government grants.

         Traditionally, large pharmaceutical firms have committees that allocate resources to projects

that score well on both scientific merit and expected profits. Small firms may or may not be primarily

driven by pure scientific merit, but must eventually secure tens of millions of dollars if they are to push

their discoveries through the drug approval process. Most small firms achieve this outcome by either

selling their patents to bigger companies, partnering with more established firms to navigate the

regulatory process, or obtaining private equity funding. We conclude that regardless of the size or the

type of firm and whether research is outsourced or performed in-house, the expected profits of a

product help determine whether it makes its way to the market. These profits can be obtained either

through a large price-cost margin and/or high sales volume. The margin is determined by a number of

factors including the efficacy of the product compared to the next most effective treatment. The

volume is determined by the size of the target patient population and the number and similarity of

substitute products.

         While potential profits are a clear driver of research spending, a more subtle question is

whether, at the margin, changes in potential profits equally affect research investments for all types of

products. Consider first that firms allocate their research and development dollars to two broadly

7In more recent years, large pharmaceutical firms have increasingly relied on purchasing drugs developed at other, often
smaller, firms. In 2012, 33 percent of the drugs under development at the top 10 pharmaceutical firms were originally
developed at another firm. This was an increase from 16 percent in 2002 (Rockoff, 2014a).



                                                            8
different product types: (1) “breakthrough” therapeutic innovations that offer a dramatically different

treatment compared to existing products and (2) “me-too” products that mimic existing treatments or

offer only incremental improvements in outcomes. 8 As we now explain, a firm’s investment decisions

for these two product types should not necessarily react similarly to marginal changes in expected

profits.

           First, there is a case to be made that top scientists producing breakthrough research are

motivated by more than just potential profits. Academic scientists, as well as leading corporate

scientists given free time to pursue their own ventures, may be attracted by the nature of the problem

and not just market prospects. 9 At the same time, the applied research performed by profit seeking

companies often relies on the insights gained from government-funded basic research, which Ward

and Dranove (1997) show is more responsive to medical need than market potential.

           Even if all researchers only attempt to maximize profits, there are other reasons why the

responsiveness of research spending to market demand could be different for FTTs and AAs.

Consider that most research programs are very lumpy – firms must often commit tens of millions of

dollars to a specific project. At the same time, scientific “know how” is also lumpy. Whether through

experience or patents, some firms may be well positioned to develop breakthrough products in specific

areas, while others have little or no hope of doing so. As a result of these factors, the profit potential

for products that address untreatable conditions may be so large that those firms with the necessary

scientific know-how have already committed to these projects, and small increases in market size do

little to spur additional investment either by those already engaged in research or by those on the

sidelines. And even if prior treatments exist, a new treatment that represents a truly novel pathway

could be sufficiently differentiated so as to be highly profitable, regardless of market size. Of course,

8 In reality, firms face a continuum of products across these two extremes but for the purposes of this example considering
these two extremes best illustrates the differences in the investment decision facing firms.
9 Stern (2004) shows that corporate scientists give up wages to enjoy the freedom to pursue their own research objectives.

Presumably, they would not have to sacrifice wages if their own objectives were aligned with their company’s objectives.



                                                             9
there are always disease categories where a small increase in market size is sufficient to encourage

additional research, but it may be that most untreated or undertreated disease categories are

inframarginal so that the barrier to breakthrough innovation is not market size, but technical feasibility,

which may take considerable time to overcome. 10 If this is the case we should expect to see a delayed

response in research activity for FTT innovations. In the limit, however, scientific barriers may be so

high that marginal changes in demand are not sufficient to generate the necessary breakthrough

research. 11 To address this point, in the results below we examine the evolution of the change in

research activity over time. Finding an immediate change in clinical trials suggests that the new

products did not result from newly developed basic science but likely came from existing science

which was not sufficiently profitable before Part D.

         Now consider a large market where scientific barriers are low and there are many existing

treatments. The decision to develop a new product in such markets can be considered in the same light

as the traditional decision by firms to incur fixed costs so as to enter competitive markets. (In this case,

the fixed costs represent the costs of developing a sufficiently different product to avoid patent

concerns and obtaining regulatory approval). An increase in market size here would create a roughly

proportional increase in profits. We should therefore see a near proportional increase in firm

investments in the development of AAs, with the only limitation being expectations of future price

reductions that accompany additional entry, a limitation that diminishes in magnitude with each

successive entrant.


10 For truly marginal disease categories, absent a particular policy intervention, there should be no meaningful research
activity before or after the demand shock. For very small disease categories, additional government policies such as the
Orphan Drug Act attempt to stimulate investment through offering Tax Credits. Yin (2008) found that these credits did
increase investment activity for the largest categories of orphan diseases but not for those with limited revenue potential.
However, it should be noted that the recent high prices for new innovations for oncology and other conditions have
demonstrated that even very small markets can be profitable. Consider the case of Pfizer’s targeted pharmaceutical Xalkori.
This drug is targeted at a sub-population that comprises only 5 percent of lung cancer patients. While the targeted patient
population is quite small, the annual cost of this drug is $115,000.
11 It should be noted that we are investigating a relatively early period in drug development and not finalized products

reaching market. Therefore, attempts at new treatments that are unsuccessful will be included in our data.



                                                            10
        We examine both aspects of innovativeness (i.e. scientific advancement and therapeutic

availability) by first considering all biotech products in the research pipeline. We then classify these

products based on the number of available alternative treatments for the targeted diseases. We

consider FTT innovations to be those aimed at conditions with at most one existing treatment. While

this is a fairly restrictive definition, it is one where the outside pharmaceutical option for treatment is

clearly quite limited. We consider AA innovations to be those aimed at categories with five or more

existing treatments. While it is true that there could still be large welfare gains from products in these

categories, the incremental gains are likely tempered by the availability of alternative treatments.

        While we believe that this approach captures important dimensions of innovativeness not

examined in BKS and other prior studies, we acknowledge Trusheim, Aitken, and Berndt’s (2010)

proviso about the difficulty of measuring the social value of new products. While our measures of are

far from perfect, we note that any of the drugs that target conditions for which there are almost no

existing treatments, are likely to be innovative to at least some degree. However, some of the products

that we label as AA may actually be highly innovative and offer great welfare gains. To address this

point, we also consider that the FDA has a process that is “intended to facilitate and expedite

development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life threatening

condition (emphasis added)” (FDA, 2013). These products qualify for either fast track or priority review

(among other programs) which we argue serves as a regulatory marker for socially valuable innovation.

This is true even for products targeting conditions that with existing treatments if these products represent

a meaningful improvement in efficacy. Therefore, we exploit these designations as indicators of socially

valuable products in our empirical analysis.

3. THE BIOTECHNOLOGY SECTOR

         There is no agreed upon definition of a biotechnology firm. Broadly, they are firms that have

emerged after a series of scientific innovations in the late 1970s. One of the first and most well-known

biotechnology firms is Genentech, which was formed after a scientific breakthrough in the production

of insulin and as of 2009 is a wholly owned subsidiary of the global pharmaceutical firm Roche (Revers

and Furczon, 2010). Since that time a large and robust industry has evolved with a common

denominator across the firms being both a far more extensive use of biological technologies rather

than traditional chemical synthesis methods and a greater focus on unmet medical needs for both

small molecule and biologic products.

         A primary distinction between traditional pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms is the latter

disproportionately produces biologic rather than small molecule products. While often linked under

the heading of biopharmaceuticals, small molecule products and biological products are actually quite

different in both their development and composition. Discussing the difference, Trusheim, Aitken,

and Berndt (2010) note that “[b]iologics and small molecules are usually considered substantially

different types of products—perhaps as dissimilar from each other as they themselves are from

medical devices.” At a scientific level, biologic products are far larger in size and more complex than

traditional small molecule products and cannot reasonably be fully chemically synthesized. Instead,

biologics are effectively grown from living organisms and therefore are almost certainly not likely to be

simple copies or minor modifications of existing small molecule products. 12


12Evidence of this fact can be seen in the difficulty in creating even biosimilars, or generic biologics, that match the
efficacy and performance of the branded product. Belsey et al. (2006) commented, “[a]s protein drugs are produced by cells
in culture or whole organisms, which are inherently more variable than chemical synthesis methods, establishing
bioequivalence of a protein produced by another manufacturer requires a rigorous assessment of quality, safety and
efficacy. In light of the difficulties with establishing bioequivalence, generic biologics are termed ‘biosimilars.’” Hirsch and
Lyman (2011) state, “the production process of each biologic is proprietary, and therefore cannot be perfectly replicated;
even if the process was duplicated, it would be unlikely to result in an identical product because of variations in areas such
as vectors, cell line development, and bioreactor conditions.”




                                                              12
        The biologics market remains relatively new with its first product introduction occurring in the

1980s. Since that time, biologics have tended to demonstrate properties associated with innovative

products such are targeting conditions for which there are currently few existing treatments.

Grabowski (2008) said, “[o]ne of the key indicators of drug quality or novelty was first-in-class

introductions, and NBEs [new biological entity] had a significantly higher likelihood of being a first-in-

class or novel therapy compared with NCEs [new chemical entity].” Similarly, Grabowski, Cockburn,

and Long (2006) said, “[i]t is also relevant that many biologics have been ‘niche drugs’ targeting rare

conditions and small numbers of patients.” It’s important to recognize that some of the novel

therapies offer new treatment options for individual suffering from diseases with treatments to which

they do not currently respond. These products would create social value. We also note, however, that

many biotechnology firms no longer exclusively manufacture biologics. Indeed, some of the biotech

products in our data, such as Zavesca for Gaucher’s disease and Racivir for HIV/AIDS, are small

molecule products. Even so, growth in the pipeline of biotech firms is likely indicative of new

products with scientific novelty.

        We also consider whether biotech firms are developing innovative products based on

treatment availability and other indicators of social value. As discussed above, we begin by considering

the existing number of treatments for the targeted disease. We then move onto considering three FDA

designations of novelty: orphan drug status, fast track, and priority review. Products receiving orphan

drug designations are intended to treat conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 patients and qualify for

research and development tax subsidies. The FDA gives “fast track” designation to speed approval of

drugs aimed at serious conditions and filling an unmet need, which is defined as “as providing a

therapy where none exists or providing a therapy which may be potentially better than available

therapy” (FDA, 2013). Candidates receiving fast track authority are eligible for more frequent

conversations with the FDA and a more flexible regulatory process. Finally, priority review is a



                                                   13
regulatory designation for drug candidates that would offer “significant improvements in the safety or

effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to

standard applications” (FDA, 2013). For both fast track and priority review the goal is to speed the

regulatory process without any change in the scientific requirements for approval.

   Prior research links biological research to these FDA indicators of innovativeness. Grabowski et al.

(2006) found that during 1983–2001, biotech firms accounted for two-thirds of the research on

orphan drugs…although they represented fewer than half of FDA approvals.” Trusheim, Aitken, and

Berndt (2010) find evidence that biologics are more innovative across all three of these metrics but the

strongest support comes for targeting orphan disease categories.




4. MEDICARE PART D

Medicare is the United States social insurance program that primarily covers individuals over the age of

65. First created in 1965, this program originally covered some portion of the costs for physician and

hospital services, but offered very limited provide coverage for pharmaceuticals. As pharmaceutical

spending grew so did political pressure to extend Medicare coverage. This resulted in the passage of

Medicare Part D as part of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Prior to this point, it was unclear

whether there would be a prescription drug benefit added to Medicare and certainly little information

about its eventual form. Part D became effective in 2006. In our analysis, we therefore consider 2003

as the date where firms would first change their investment decisions. However, we are cognizant of

the uncertainty about the impact of Part D on the industry prior to its implementation and therefore

present results where we allow the change in the firm’s investments evolve over time.

       The implementation of Part D caused an immediate increase in pharmaceutical insurance

coverage for seniors. In 2006 there were nearly 26 million elderly individuals covered by the expansion.

This number grew to over 30 million by 2011, the end of our sample period. Perhaps more

                                                  14
importantly for the investment decisions of pharmaceutical firms, this increase in insurance coverage

also caused an increase in pharmaceutical use among this population (Ketcham and Simon, 2008; Yin

et al., 2008).

        One concern for pharmaceutical firms may be that the increase in utilization might be

accompanied by a decrease in prices resulting from government monopsony power. However, the

structure of Part D makes this unlikely. Unlike other government programs such as the Veterans

Administration, Part D is run by a series of private insurance programs (similar to the health insurance

exchanges under the Affordable Care Act). In addition, the law explicitly prohibits the Center for

Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from directly bargaining with pharmaceutical firms. Duggan

and Scott Morton (2010) found that enrollees in Part D paid higher prices and increased their

utilization of prescription drugs compared to when they were uninsured. This suggests that Part D

represents a substantial positive profit shock for pharmaceuticals targeted at conditions with a large

number of elderly patients.

        Prior to Part D, Medicare only offered limited pharmaceutical coverage through the Medicare

Part B medical benefit. While there are many regulations regarding whether and how drugs were

covered, in general Part B applied to drugs that were administered as part of a physician office visit if

the drug was purchased and administered by the physician. Drugs purchased at retail pharmacies were

generally not covered. There could be a concern that the biologics we study are more likely to be

administered by a physician and therefore coverage for these products may have been unaffected by

the passage of Part D. However, many biologics are covered under both Part B and Part D depending

upon the treatment application and the source of purchase. For example, we identified the top 5

highest selling biologic drugs in 2009-2012 and found that all 5 were covered to some degree under




                                                   15
Part D. 13 Similarly, there were 14 drugs over this time period that were in the top 10 in at least one

year, and 13 of those 14 had some Part D coverage. 14 This included oncology products such as Avastin

and Rituxan. The vast majority of these products were also covered by Part B, however, with Part B

covering the majority of claims.

         Once products have completed the FDA review process and are ready for market, firms have a

generally good sense of whether they will be primarily covered by Part B or Part D. However, it is

important to draw a distinction between this ex post knowledge and what firms know ex ante. We

examine the decision to undertake research into new products and therefore the ultimate outcome

with respect to insurance coverage at that time is subject to a great deal of uncertainty for biotech

firms.

         In this way our research setting is different from investigating the decision of firms with

respect to pricing or formulary placement. In our setting, the passage of Part D increased certainty for

firms regarding the potential insurance coverage of new products aimed at conditions with a large

potential elderly population. Specifically, following the passage of Part D biotech firms had a much

greater expectation that any product they developed for conditions with a high Medicare market share

would have a larger number of fully insured elderly patients than before the passage of Part D. It

should also be noted that in recent years a growing proportion of oncology product have been small

molecule products and not biologics (IMS, 2014). This shift in product type could itself be a result of

this increased certainty from the passage of Part D.

14 Some of this coverage comes through “brown bagging” where patients purchase biologics at a retail specialty pharmacy

using Part D and then have these drugs immediately administered in an outpatient setting. Given the differences in cost
sharing between the two programs, this strategy can limit the out of pocket costs for patients and therefore might increase
demand for individuals who could not afford out of pocket costs for these drugs under only Part B.

5. DATA

     Examining the role of demand shocks on investments in innovation in the biotechnology sector

requires data from a variety of sources. In this section we detail our data sources for describing clinical

trial activity, the change in the market size as a result of Medicare Part D, and the number of available

alternative treatments.


5.A. The Biotech Pipeline

     While some studies such as Acemoglu and Linn (2004) and Dubois et al. (2014) consider new

drugs reaching the market, given the timing and nature of biotech research, there are several reasons

why we believe in our setting it is more appropriate to follow BKS and examine the research pipeline.

First, the decision to move forward with clinical trials is based on the current and future investment

climate. In contrast, as a result of the length of clinical trials, the actual introduction of new products

represents decisions based on mainly on past economic environments. 15 Given that Part D was

enacted only a decade ago, many of the biotech products that reached the market in the “post” period

would have been funded in the “pre” period, making it difficult to identify the effect of the law.

Second, examining only new products would generate a survivor bias in our estimates of innovative

activity, i.e. we would only see successful innovation. Third, only small number of biotech products

have been approved by the FDA subsequent to the passage of Part D. Restricting our study to

approved products would limit our statistical power.

     We examine the research pipelines of biotech firms that have pursued FDA approval for their

biomedical drug candidates. We obtained data on 251 self-identified biotech firms from Thompson




15Obviously firms retain the right to not market products that have completed clinical trials but are no longer economically
profitable because of other changes. However, the ability to bring a product to market requires a decision to invest in the
candidate over a decade prior.



                                                            17
Reuters RECAP, a consulting firm specializing in biotech business intelligence. The firms that are

included in the data are described by Thompson Reuters (2014) as:

       “self identified as biotechnology firms from their inception, were largely financed through
       venture capital and public equity in their early years, tended to focus on pursuit of new,
       untested technologies (i.e., recombinant DNA, monoclonal antibodies, and novel molecular
       targets) and unmet medical needs (rather than developing ‘me-too’ or second generation drugs)
       to a greater degree than ‘traditional’ pharmaceutical companies.”

   The sample includes very large biotech firms such as Genentech, Amgen, and Gilead, as well as

many young, single-compound firms such as Alba Therapeutics and Osteologix. Importantly, these

historical data include pipelines of firms that have exited the market through bankruptcy, as well as

those that have been acquired by traditional pharmaceutical firms such as the small biotech firm

Pharmasset which developed Sovaldi and was subsequently purchased by Gilead. Thus, our data

provide a broad picture of biomedical innovation, pursued both by independent companies and

subsidiaries of large pharmaceutical companies. The dataset includes information such as the start date

of clinical trial activity, the disease targeted by the drug candidate, whether the drug was granted an

Orphan Drug Designation (ODD), fast track status, or priority review.

   Our data contains 1,466 biotech-originated drug candidates that began clinical testing on humans

between the industry’s birth in the 1970’s and 2012. It is reasonable to assume that the clinical trial

stage (as opposed to approved products) is where we are most likely to detect a change in firm

behavior during the relatively short time period after the passage of Medicare Part D. This is

particularly true given that clinical trials for biologics have been found to take longer on average than

those for small molecule products (Grabowski, 2003).

   During the development process for new products ievery drug candidate has a single primary

indication, which is the targeted disease that was designated when the candidate first entered Phase I

clinical testing. Drug candidates can also designate a secondary indication for a different disease. This

could be done at any time during clinical trials. As an illustrative example considered the case of



                                                   18
Tiagabine, which is marketed under the brand name Gabitril. This candidate was originally introduced

to our sample with a Phase I trial in 2002 targeting anxiety. Having successfully completed this stage, a

secondary indication for insomnia was directly introduced to Phase II trials in 2005. Another example

would be Rilonacept, which is marketed under the brand name Arcalyst. This drug has a primary

indication targeting rheumatoid arthritis in 2001, but then received developed secondary indicators for

cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes in 2004 and gout in 2007. RECAP data contain both primary

and secondary disease indications. Figure 5 presents the distribution of clinical development starts

within 1998-2011. 16

         We limit the scope of candidate introductions in the RECAP data to 1998-2011. This

restriction results in 1,211 drug candidates with a total of 2,026 indications (approximately 60% of

which are primary) targeting 488 different diseases across 20 broad therapeutic areas. Our primary

RECAP dataset is at the indication level, with each observation representing a unique candidate-

targeted disease interaction. The distribution of targeted diseases is presented in Figure 4 and has

remarkable resemblance to that reported by the independent research of Ernst & Young (2012), which

is also presented in the figure and aims to describe the overall state of the industry.

         As can be seen in Figure 4, while each therapeutic area has some clinical trial activity,

approximately half of our indications target cancer. There are 99 different cancer conditions in the

data, but 5 of these cancers (solid tumors, lung, prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer) account for

approximately 40 percent of the cancer products. At the other extreme, 48 of the 99 cancer conditions

are targeted by a single candidate (e.g. islet cell carcinoma, mesothelioma, medullary thyroid cancer and


16 Comparing the RECAP data to publicly available information, we found some degree of error in these dates. In some
cases the RECAP dates for the introduction of new indications were actually the dates for alternative events such as the
date of in-licensing, IND filing, or even just the acquisition of the original developing firm by another entity. Where
necessary we correct these dates using data from www.clinicaltrials.gov and, in some cases, on the phase-specific average
lengths reported by Dimasi et al. (2003). This was accomplished in the following manner. First, we replaced the project
start date in the RECAP file with data from clinicaltrials.gov when these data were available and indicated an earlier start
date. Second, when data were not available on clinicaltrials.gov we used the average clinical trial lengths reported in DiMasi
et al. (2003) and that the trial process was carried out sequentially.



                                                             19
gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma). Given the large presence of cancer conditions in our clinical trial

data, we also present results excluding this therapeutic area. Finding similar results among the non-

cancer sample suggests that our results are not driven by a confounding shock such as a scientific

development in the process of developing cancer treatments.

         Given that our measure of the demand shock from the passage of Part D is at the ICD-9 level,

we match our 488 diseases in the RECAP data to the 241 corresponding ICD-9 codes. This allows us

to link each indicator to a measure of the Medicare orientation for the targeted disease, the

construction of which we now describe. Following this process our final dataset is at the condition-

year level.


5.B. Medicare Market Share

         We account for the differential market effects of the passage of Medicare Part D by estimating

the percentage of patients with a particular disease who are covered by Medicare. We create the

variable Medicare Market Share (MMS) using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey

(MEPS), a large, representative sample describing the utilization of prescription drugs, medical

services, and insurance.

         We use the MEPS yearly conditions and insurance files from 1998-2003 to construct the MMS

variable. The first of these reports the conditions suffered by each respondent in each year of the

sample. The second reports the type of insurance coverage held by the respondent throughout the

year. Between these two datasets we generate the share of Medicare covered individuals for each ICD-

9 code. We then averaged across these 6 years to get the MMS variable used in our analysis. 17



17Our measure of MMS is similar in spirit to Duggan and Scott-Morton (2010). One key difference is that their analysis
focused on prices at the brand name drug level and therefore their measure of MMS was based on the percentage of
Medicare patients using the drug prior to the passage of Part D. Given that our analysis is at the condition level, we instead
use the MEPS conditions file. This allows us to account for individuals with a condition that did not purchase a
prescription medication due to their lack of prescription insurance coverage.



                                                             20
Therefore, our measure of MMS represents the information available to biotech firms in the year that

Part D was passed.

         The distribution of MMS that we obtain from the MEPS makes intuitive sense with respect to

the epidemiological characteristics of Medicare enrollees. That is, those diseases that are commonly

associated with older people tend have a higher values of MMS. For example, MMS equals zero for

indications such as infertility, smallpox, and Japanese encephalitis. Around the median of MMS are

indications such as ischemic stroke, bronchiectasis, pain management, and spinal chord injury. Finally,

at the top of the distribution there are indications such as lung cancer, Parkinson’s disease, heart

failure, and (with the highest MMS) Alzheimer’s disease. Figure 6 displays the (Kernel) distribution of

MMS scores of the indications in our sample.


5.C. The Novelty of New Drug Candidates

         As discussed above, one potential measure of the social value of new products is whether they

are a therapeutic innovation. We define this dimension based on the number of treatment options

that exist for each indication in our sample. These alternatives include both biologic and non-biologic

products that received FDA marketing approval. To determine the number of available treatments we

obtained drug approval dates the FDA “Orange Book” and the Center for Biologic Evaluation and

Research (CBER). From specialized websites we then obtained data describing each drug’s approved

indications and usages. 18 We are only able to obtain the approval date for the primary indication and

we assign this date to all indications for the product. 19

     Figure 7 gives the distribution of existing alternative treatments for our disease categories in 1998,

2003, 2008 and 2011. In each of the years, the vast majority of diseases have either zero or one


18 We relied on three government-sponsored webstites: DailyMed (dailymed.nlm.nih.gov), MedlinePlus
(http://www.nlm.nih.gov/) and Drugs@FDA (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda)
19 This creates a small upward bias in the recorded number of competitors at any point in time. Given that we classify

diseases based on the maximum number of treatment available at the close of our sample this does not affect our results.



                                                          21
alternative treatment. It should be noted that this is not a patient weighted measure and the diseases

with larger caseloads are more likely to have a large number of existing treatments. As would be

expected given the progress of technology over time, the number of conditions with existing

treatments declines from 1998 to 2011. Similarly, there is an increase in the number of diseases that

have five or more existing treatments. We classify the number of existing alternative treatments based

on the maximum number of treatments available during our sample. We do this because all or nearly

all of the firms in our sample would have had access to data similar or better than ours, and therefore

would have knowledge of the entire industry research pipeline. Thus, each firm knows reasonably well

whether its candidate is a FTT or an AA. While there are exceptions (e.g., the first firm to start clinical

trials may reasonably believe it is FTT), we have no systematic way of parsing the data to deal with

these exceptions. Not surprisingly, the number of small molecule alternatives is positively correlated

with both the number of patients reporting the conditions in the MEPS and in the total amount of

pharmaceutical spending

    We also examine three regulatory indicators of innovation: orphan drug status, priority review, and

fast track. Our data contain information on whether a drug candidate has received one of these

designations. In total there are 214 orphan drug designations, 136 fast track, and 62 products which

receive a priority review designation in our sample. Given that these designations are sometimes

granted later in the development process, it should not be surprising that the rate of designations is

lower for drugs that have more recently entered clinical trials on humans. In our data below, we

consider a composite category that indicates whether any of these three designations was granted to a

candidate. We obtain qualitatively similar (though statistically less powerful) results when we separately

consider each designation. These are presented in an online appendix.

6. EFFECT OF MEDICARE PART D ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
   EFFORTS IN THE BIOTECHNOLOGY SECTOR

   We begin by considering the overall impact of Part D on the development of products targeting

diseases of the elderly. Our initial analysis of this aggregate response follows in the general spirit of

BKS’s earlier work. We then consider how the change in research activity varies by the number of

existing treatments. Finally we examine the impact on drugs receiving FDA designations.




6.A. Effect of Part D on Overall Research Activity

    Figure 8 shows the Kernel distributions of the MMS of new candidates by time period. Over our

sample, there is a meaningful shift towards candidates with a higher MMS – the pattern we would

expect if Part D caused firms to shift their investment activity towards newly covered drugs. To

quantify the magnitude of these graphical relationships, we turn to a regression analysis where we

estimate a poisson quasi-maximum likelihood model of the following form:

       NewIndicationsit  f (  1MMSi  2 PostPartDt  3 PostPartDt  MMSi  t  d ) (1)

where MMSi is the Medicare Marketshare of condition i, PostPartDt is an indicator variable equal to 1 in

the years after the passage of Medicare Part D (i.e. 2004-2011), λt is a year fixed effect, and ηd is a

disease or therapeutic area fixed effect depending on the specification. We will also evaluate the

pattern of changes after Part D by estimating specifications of equation (1) which break this time

period into three equal parts. Standard errors allow for arbitrary correlation between observations in

the same therapeutic area. One concern with our data is that there are a large number of conditions

that have no clinical trial activity in any one year. Therefore, we also provide estimates from a zero-

inflated negative binomial model.

   The coefficient of interest is β3, which represents the change in the clinical trial activity for drugs

after the passage of Medicare Part D based on their MMS. Under the assumption that there was no

relationship between MMS and investment activity prior to 2003, this represents the causal effect of

                                                   23
Medicare Part D on firm investment activity. In addition to the graphical evidence of the pre-trends in

Figure 1, we will also test the validity of this identifying assumption by estimating a placebo regression

using data prior to the passage of Part D.

   Table 2 contains the estimated coefficients for equation (1). Column (1) contains our estimates

including therapeutic area fixed effects. This estimate suggests that following the passage of Part D in

2004, there is a statistically significant increase in the number of drugs targeting conditions with high

levels of MMS, relative to those targeting conditions with low levels of MMS. To provide some

context of the magnitude, consider the average drug in our sample has a MMS of 0.33 percentage

points and that the mean number of clinical trials per condition per year is 0.3. Therefore, the marginal

effect at the mean for this coefficient is an approximately 0.044 increase in the number of indications

per condition per year. While this may appear small in magnitude, recall that many conditions have

only one product in trials throughout our entire sample. Column (2) contains the estimates controlling

for disease rather than therapeutic area fixed effects. The estimated coefficient is larger than, but not

statistically different from, those from the model containing therapeutic area fixed effects and the

marginal effect at the mean is 0.054. Finally, column (3) contains the zero-inflated negative binomial

model. These estimates are slightly larger than the estimates in columns (1) and (2) with a marginal

effect at the mean of 0.065.

   The estimates in column (1) – (3) suggest a meaningful change in the research investments in the

years after the passage of Part D. Columns (4) – (6) explore how this change evolved over time. The

Poisson estimates in columns (4) and (5) show a jump in investment activity in 2006 and a further

increase in the subsequent years. This is generally consistent with the graphical evidence in Figure 1.

The zero inflated negative binomial results suggest a more immediate effect that is then relatively

constant over time. The increase in the first three years across all columns is consistent with BKS, who

suggest that pharmaceutical companies have already developed scientific knowledge that is not

sufficiently profitable prior to the passage of Part D. Following the change in expected profitability,

firms could choose to move these existing but previously unprofitable scientific technologies into

                                                   24
clinical trials. As we discussed above, these types of marginal technologies are likely less socially

valuable.

    While the graphical relationships and regression estimates suggest a change in research activity

following 2003, there could be a concern that this is simply the continuation of a secular trend away

from drugs targeting conditions suffered by younger individuals – perhaps because of a demographic

shift as a result of the aging baby boomer population. To address this question, we first revisit Figure

1, which shows the number of clinical trials per year based on whether the indication targets a disease

that has an MMS above or below the median level from 1998-2011. If the estimates in Table 2 were

driven by secular pre-trends, then we should see this in the data prior to 2003. However, that is not the

case. Prior to the passage of Medicare Part D, indicated by the dashed vertical line, there was very little

difference in level or trend between these clinical trial activities for these two products. After the

passage of Part D there is a marked increase in the number of clinical trials for drugs with higher MMS

values. In every year after 2004, there are more clinical trials for indications targeting diseases with

MMS scores that are above the median.

    To further address this concern, Table 3 contains the estimates from a placebo specification of

equation (1) where the indicator variable for PostPartDt is equal to 1 for the years 2001-2003. All

observations after the 2003 are removed from the data. Therefore, the coefficient on the interaction

term measures the change in research activity between 2001 and 2003 compared to earlier time

periods. Given that there was little clear evidence that Congress would develop and pass a prescription

drug benefit, we do not expect any pre-passage anticipatory behavior. However, if our main estimates

are simply the result of a gradual shift in the market, we should find generally similar results from this

specification. Across all of the columns the estimates on the interaction term are negative, small, and

statistically insignificant. This supports a causal interpretation of our main estimates in Table 2.

    Recall that cancer treatments represent a large percentage of our sample and we may be concerned

that there was another event such as a change in the science of developing cancer drugs that was

coincident with the passage of Part D. In addition, there could be a concern that cancer drugs are

                                                     25
often covered under Part B and therefore the creation of Part D may not represent much of a profit

shock. Though it should be noted that many biotech companies manufacture oral oncology treatments

that would be expected during the development process to be covered under Part D. For both

reasons, we re-estimate our main regressions excluding cancer drugs. Setting Part B aside, we do not

know whether research into cancer is more or less responsive to changes in market size, so we cannot

say whether our estimated effect of Part D for non-cancer products should be larger or smaller than

the effect for all products. Even if we consider that some of these drugs may only be partially covered

by Part D, the high prices for these products may create a large change in expected profits from these

partially covered cancer drugs that are larger than for other fully covered products.

    We present both graphical and regression evidence for the non-cancer products. Figure 9 contains

the same information as Figure 1 for a sample containing no cancer treatments. Prior to the passage of

Part D, products in this sample with an above-median MMS had fewer clinical trials in each year than

those with a below-median MMS. These products groups followed very similar trends in each year and

in each year except for one there are more trials for below-median MMS drugs. Following the passage

of Part D, products with an above-median MMS saw an increase in clinical trials and in every year

except for one had more clinical trials than products with a below-median MMS. Table 4 contains

estimates from equation (1) for a sample that does not contain cancer treatments. The results are

remarkably similar in magnitude to those obtained from the full sample but due to the smaller sample

are less precisely estimated.




6.B. Number of Existing Alternatives

    We have demonstrated that the response to Part D documented in BKS is present in the

biotechnology sector and is therefore not simply the result of a series of “me-too” small molecule

pharmaceutical products produced by traditional pharmaceutical firms. But although biologics as a

group are scientifically innovative, those targeting previously underserved conditions are therapeutic


                                                   26
innovations that likely have larger welfare benefits. Similarly, even some of the products targeting

diseases with existing treatments may offer benefits to individuals for whom existing treatments are

ineffective. In this section and the next, we look for differential responses to Part D using various

measures of novelty and innovativeness.

    As discussed earlier, we expect that the response to Part D may be concentrated among products

that target conditions for which there are already many alternatives. We therefore now contrast how

Part D spurred innovation of FTT versus AA products. Recall that we define FTTs to be those

candidates treating conditions for which there are at most one existing alternative, whereas AAs treat

conditions for which there are greater than five alternatives. These represent starkly different levels of

treatment availability. Figures 2 and 3 show that there was a marked increase in research for AAs but

little change for FTTs. We now turn to regression analysis to more precisely estimate these

relationships.

    In Table 5 we report estimates of equation (1) for samples based on the number of alternatives.

Column (1) – (3) contain estimates for the FTT sample. The coefficients on the interaction term are

near zero and statistically insignificant. This demonstrates that following the passage of Part D there

was no detectable change in the pipeline of biotech drugs targeting untreatable conditions that

disproportionately affect the elderly. This suggests that research activity for these categories is not

sensitive to marginal changes in expected profits. While this does not rule out effects on innovative

activity from changes in expected profits, it does demonstrate that the innovation will be unlikely to

come in the form of new treatments for diseases without existing options.

    Figure 3 suggests that AAs were most responsible for the increase in research activity following the

passage of Part D. The estimates in columns (4) - (6) of Table 5 confirm this graphical relationship; the

coefficients on the interaction term are all large, positive, and statistically significant. To gauge the

magnitude of the Part D effect on AA innovation, consider the estimate in column (5), which controls

for disease specific fixed effects. The average number of clinical trials per condition-year in the AA



                                                   27
sample is 0.65. Therefore, the marginal effect at the mean for AAs is 0.18 indications per condition per

year.

    Table 6 presents results of the previous regressions but breaks the post-Part D period into three

sub-periods. Once again, we find no evidence of changes in clinical trial activity for FTT products.

However, the investment activity for AA products in the years following the passage of Part D grows

in magnitude and is statistically significant at a p-value of 0.01 after 2006. This relatively fast increase

for products with many existing treatments provides further evidence that these are likely not large

scientific breakthroughs, because this suggests that this is technology that existed and was moved into

a clinical trial and not new basic science that emerged in response to Part D.


6.C. Regulatory Indicators of Innovation

    To further examine the innovative nature of the investment response to demand shocks, we turn

to FDA designations of innovation. As discussed above, our data contain indicators for whether a

product has received orphan drug designation, priority review, or fast track status. Given the relative

rarity of these designations, we create a single variable equal to 1 if any drug candidate received one of

these designations. We begin with a graphical exploration of this relationship. Figure 10 contains the

number of conditions with at least one product receiving an FDA designation of innovation over time.

Prior to the passage of Part D, products with an above-median MMS had more of these designations

in each year. However, between 1998 and 2003 the difference between these two categories narrowed.

Following the passage of Part D, the difference in the number of designations narrowed further and

was nearly equal by the end of the sample. This figure suggests that after the passage of Part D there

was a decrease in the number of FDA designations for products targeting above-median MMS

diseases compared to those targeting below-median MMS diseases. However, it appears that this

change represents the continuation, or possibly the acceleration, of a pre-existing downward trend.

    We next estimate a logit specification of equation (1) with this indicator variable as the dependent

variable. We also include a control for the number of new products introduced that year. Column (1)

                                                    28
of Table 7 contains the estimated coefficients from this model. The coefficient on the interaction term

suggests that products with a higher MMS were less likely to receive one of the three designations for

innovativeness. On its own, this coefficient suggests that the passage of Part D may have shifted firm

investments away from innovative products. Such an effect is theoretically possible given that the

increase in investment activity following Part D could increase expected competition and decrease

expected profits even for novel products. However, it could also be the case that this decline is simply

the continuation of pre-existing trends for this outcome. To examine this possibility, column (2)

contains the estimate from a falsification test using data prior to the passage of Part D. The estimated

coefficient on the interaction term is approximately the same size as in column (1).

     Taken together, this evidence suggests that products with a higher MMS had a declining number

of FDA indications of innovativeness before and after the passage of Part D. As a result, the statistically

significant coefficient in column (1) appears to be the continuation of a pre-existing trend. This

suggests that Part D did not cause a decrease in investment into products deemed innovative by the

FDA or cause a break from this pre-existing trend. In other words, Part D did not differentially spur

investment activity for products that received an FDA designation.



7. CONCLUSION

         The expansion of pharmaceutical insurance for the elderly in the United States caused an

increase in clinical trial activity in the biotechnology sector. This suggests a strong link between

expected profits and research investments. To provide some sense of the magnitude of these findings,

we consider the estimated change in revenue from Part D suggested by Duggan and Scott-Morton

(2010). Based on these estimates, the average product in our sample should expect a revenue increase

of approximately 9 percent. 20 Our estimates show that Part D increased clinical trials for the average


20For a drug with a 100 percent Medicare Market Share, Duggan and Scott-Morton predict a 27 percent increase in
revenue (though it should be noted that this estimate is statistically insignificant). In our sample, the mean MMS is 33

product by approximately 18 percent. This suggests an elasticity of clinical trials with respect to the

expected change in market size of approximately 2. This implied elasticity is less than the estimate in

BKS which ranged from 2.4 to 4.7 for Phase I clinical trials as well as the estimate of 3.5 in Acemoglu

and Linn (2004). Our smaller elasticity likely results from the combination of two factors. First,

products from biotechnology firms may be more difficult to develop than the average product.

Second, these products may be more likely to be partially covered by Part B and therefore the profit

shock from Part D may be smaller than for the average product with a similar MMS.

         An open question is whether these new products represent welfare improvements or rent

seeking by pharmaceutical firms. At the broadest level, the biotechnology sector has been found to be

generally innovative and the complexity of the products suggests that it is difficult to make small

changes to the product to generate a “me-too” product. In fact, the complexity of these molecules

makes it more difficult to even make generic versions of these products. Therefore, new products

emerging from this sector are more likely to represent some form of scientific advancement rather

than only the me-too products cited by many critics of the pharmaceutical industry.

         Our results are quite different when we examine whether the new products spurred by Part D

provide innovative treatments or treatment pathways as measured by the absence of existing

treatments for the same conditions and by FDA designations of novelty. We find no evidence that the

passage of Part D caused the emergence of innovative products across these dimensions. The research

activity following a demand shock is primarily for products targeting conditions with five or more

treatments. For these products we estimate an implied elasticity of clinical trials to change in revenues

of 3.3 – far closer to the estimates of the earlier literature. In addition, we see no evidence of an

increase in products receiving FDA designations.

         It could be that breakthroughs of these kinds take longer to develop than incremental

innovations. This is particularly true if biotech firms have a cache of potential products that are

percent suggesting an expected revenue increase of approximately 9 percent. It should be noted that given the potential for
partial Part B coverage for biotech products this may be an overestimate of the effect of Part D on revenue in our sample.

marginal unprofitable before a small change in market demand and their immediate response to a shift

in demand is to bring these products “off the shelf.”           While there is no systematic method of

calculating the time from basic science to human trials, we do note that we examine a relatively long

window after the passage of Part D and that there are prominent examples of compounds being

identified and reaching human trials in far less time. For example, the hepatitis C cure Solvaldi

discussed earlier was primarily the result of the work of Michael Sofia at Pharmasset. Sofia joined the

firm in 2005 and Sovaldi entered clinical trials five years later (Gounder, 2103). Similarly, Merck’s

insomnia treatment Suvorexant moved from first concept to clinical trials in four to six years (Parker,

2013). While these provide only anecdotal evidence, they do demonstrate that the time period we

consider after Part D is sufficient for some socially valuable products to reach market. That being

said, we realize that we cannot rule out the possibility that over an even longer horizon more

innovative products could enter clinical trials as a result of this marginal demand shock.

          As the debate about the rate of growth of health care spending in the United States continues

it will almost certainly continue its focus on the profits earned by pharmaceutical firms. For example,

the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is currently not allowed to exploit its market power to

negotiate lower prices for drugs purchased by Medicare Part D. Examining the prices paid by other

government agencies without this restriction, such as the Veterans Administration, suggests that this

change would lead to lower prices and profits. Our results suggest that this would decrease the number

of new biotechnology products available for individuals suffering conditions with a large elderly

patient share. That being said, it also appears that this would have limited effect on the emergence of

new products for conditions with few existing treatments or those deemed by the FDA to require a

swift approval process. Future work should examine whether the new treatments following Part D that

target conditions with many existing options represent a welfare increase rather than simply lower

prices.

          It is also important to note that our estimates represent the causal effect from a marginal change

in expected profits. We posit that the reason why there is little effect from this change on true

                                                     31
scientific breakthroughs is that these products are always profitable and therefore research investments

in them are inframarginal with respect to changes at the margin in profits. Another possibility is that

the scientific barriers are largely impenetrable and firms will not attempt to overcome them without

substantially higher profit potential than what was conferred by Part D. Thus, large changes in profits

from a single payer health system, a dramatic reduction in patent length, or some form of compulsory

licensing would likely have far different effects.
