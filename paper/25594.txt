JEL No. H11,Q53

                                          ABSTRACT

The quality of governance depends on public sector worker productivity. We use micro data from
China to document that judges are less productive on polluted days. Building on the insights of
Alchian and Kessel (1962), we discuss the role of organization design and the incentives of
public versus for profit organizations in designing a workplace that reduces the productivity costs
of local disamenities. We find that the public sector productivity elasticities are larger than
published estimates of the private sector productivity elasticities with respect to pollution.

1. Introduction

   Government quality plays an essential role in promoting long run economic growth and
building up trust in institutions. Economists have faced the challenge of measuring differences in
government quality. One novel empirical strategy used mislabeled mailed letters to see which
governments around the world were most likely to notify the mailer of the “mistake” (Chong et al.
2014). The quality of government service mainly depends on the skill and the effort devoted by
government employees.

   Both heat and pollution can reduce the public sector’s short run productivity. These effects are
likely to be larger in the developing world relative to developed nations. Recent research in
environmental economics has documented that both private sector agricultural workers and indoor
workers perform worse when it is more polluted and hotter outside (Adhvaryu et al. 2014; Chang
et al. 2016; Chang et al. 2019; Graff Zivin and Neidell 2012; He et al. 2019; Somanathan et al.
2018).

   We examine the effects of pollution and heat on public sector worker productivity in China by
measuring the decision time for a judge to rule on a given case. A longer deliberation period creates
congestion and delays. We observe the decisions made by 135,924 judges in 9.7 million criminal
and civil cases adjudicated during the years 2014 to 2016. These judges work in 337 different
prefectures. Judges are highly educated people who are well compensated. China’s cities feature
extremely high levels of pollution and the summers are quite hot and humid. We use this variation
to study the workplace performance of China’s judges. We find that China’s judges are more
susceptible to outdoor pollution relative to outdoor heat. Our estimates of the summer
heat/productivity gradient suggests that air conditioning offsets the vast majority of the
temperature effect.

   Our estimates of air pollution’s effect on public sector productivity in China contribute to an
emerging literature. Obradovic et al. (2018) ﬁnd adverse weather conditions signiﬁcantly reduce
the number of police stops and diminish the probability of a visit from a health inspector. Heyes
and Saberian (2019) examine 207,000 asylum court cases in the United States and document that
higher outdoor temperatures increase the likelihood that judges do not grant asylum.
                                                                                                    2
      Using estimates from the recent literature measuring the productivity effects of pollution, we
compare our public sector results to these recent private sector productivity estimates. Building on
the insights of Alchian and Kessel (1962), we argue that organizational design is an important (and
understudied) mediating force in determining the effects of climate and pollution on worker
productivity. As we discuss below, the private sector features a residual claimant who has strong
incentives to anticipate the productivity impacts of pollution and heat exposure.



2. Worker Exposure to Heat and Pollution

      An urban worker’s exposure to pollution and heat depends on her time allocation over indoor
and outdoor activities and how her residence and workplace is designed and what self-protection
technologies are used. Given the predictability of pollution and heat in China, workers can invest
in self-protection to reduce their exposure (Moretti and Neidell 2011, Sun et al. 2017). Self-
protection products include air conditioning, home air filters and outdoor masks.

      For profit firms have strong incentives to internalize their workers’ lost productivity brought
about by pollution and heat. If a firm’s manager is aware of the causal effects of heat and pollution
on productivity, then the firm will be more likely to incur the upfront costs to engage in worker
risk reduction (Ehrlich and Becker 1972). 1 If firms choose to invest little in workplace comfort,
then in a competitive labor market, such firms will have to pay a wage premium (“combat pay”)
or risk losing workers (Rosen 2002). 2 If workers work at a firm that chooses to provide little
worksite protection, then such workers can invest more in household protection to help them to
reduce their exposure to heat and pollution when they are not at work.


1
    Graff-Zivin and Kahn (2016) model the adaptation decision of a for profit firm that internalizes the productivity
    effects of heat exposure. This firm is aware of the causal effects of heat and recognizes the marginal benefits
    of investing in offsetting technology. In their model, firms differ with respect to their productivity. They solve
    for the marginal firm that is just indifferent between bearing a fixed cost to acquire costly adaptation friendly
    products such as air filters an air conditioners. The most productive firms are the most likely to adopt this
    technology. They study the implications of this decision rule for how the industry’s aggregate output is
    affected by outdoor heat.
2
    Owners of shopping malls and suburban residential development internalize the externalities taking place
    within the physical boundaries of their property (Henderson and Mitra 1996, Pashigian and Gould 1998). They
    have strong incentives to address negative spillovers and to maximize positive synergies taking place within
    their space.

                                                                                                                    3
      This discussion suggests that private sector workers, especially if the labor market is
competitive, will be better protected from heat and pollution exposure. An alternative point of
view, advanced by Alchian and Kessel (1962), emphasizes the quiet life of government service
that governments can spend “other people’s money” on upgrading workplace amenities. By
upgrading workplace attributes, public sector workers might be better protected against
environmental risks. 3 In China, the public sector faces no incentive to cut costs and it has a set
budget. Government officials are known to receive generous side compensation such as greater
job security, better pensions, and cheap apartments in expensive cities such as Beijing. Also, when
governments provide health-care or higher education at subsidized prices, Chinese officials’ access
to these services for themselves and their families brings substantial financial gains. Building on
the core argument of Alchian and Kessell (1962), those who seek the “quiet life” may receive
better work conditions in the Chinese public sector featuring fewer working hours and less stress
than their private sector counter-parts. Ultimately, it is an empirical question whether pollution
and heat have equal effects on the productivity of public and private sector workers.



3. The Judicial Labor Market in China

      Our empirical work studies the productivity of highly educated public sector workers in China.
In China, the civil service is a very popular sector for young people who value its job security and
benefits. People want to be judges because it is stable safe work and it offers government housing
and it is not a stressful life. As indicated in the following Table A1, judges work shorter than




3
    “Public utility managements, whether or not they are also stockholders, will engage in activities that raise costs
     even if they eat up profits. Management will be rational (i.e., utility maximizing and efficient) if it uses
     company funds to hire pleasant and congenial employees and to buy its supplies from salesmen who have
     these same virtues. They cost more, of course, but how does the regulatory commission decide that these are
     unjustifiable expenditures—even though stockholders would prefer larger profits (which they aren't allowed
     to have) and customers would prefer lower product prices? Office furniture and equipment will be of higher
     quality than otherwise. Fringe benefits will be greater and working conditions more pleasant. The managers
     will be able to devote a greater part of their business time to community and civic programs. They will reap
     the prestige rewards given to the "statesman-businessman" class of employers. Vacations will be longer and
     more expensive. Time off for sick leave and for civic duties will be greater. Buildings and equipment will be
     more beautiful.” (Alchian and Kessel 1962).

                                                                                                                    4
private sector workers with similar human capital work. The civil service pays relatively low
salaries. 4

      Before the entrance exam, the employing agency first checks that candidates have met the
minimum requirements (e.g., age, education, and Party membership) and then sends those who
qualify and receive approval to sit for the exam.5 Upon passing the exam, each applicant will
further undergo two years of training before being appointed as an acting judge and then gradually
move up a hierarchical ladder. His/her first career post is an appointment to one of the local courts
as a chief judge. Some of the best judges are appointed to the higher level courts.

      A judge’s annual evaluation depends on a broad set of performance scores during within-court
competitions between colleagues for promotion to vacancies within the courts. In order to motivate
judges to work harder, many courts publish the unvarnished quantitative rankings of each judge
within a court. This creates a tournament where judges are competing against each other (Lazear
and Rosen 1981). In 2011, the Supreme People’s Court (the SPC) issued an official document to
guide the assessment of judges’ court performance. 6 The key criteria used are the absolute number
of cases completed or handled, the appeal rate and remand rate for retrial. 7

      Longer case durations will lead to fewer cases being handled or completed within a given year.
Below, we will test how outdoor heat and dirty air affects a judge’s deliberation time. The average
judge in our sample is exposed to dirty air and hot days on 34.1% of the days he/she works. The



4
    Chan and Ma (2011) posit that although the basic pay of civil servants is lower than that of the workforce in
    other sectors, the total compensation for civil servants is higher than the pay for workers in many other sectors.
    Ko and Han (2013) analyzes the differences in job motivations between public and private job seekers based
    on a survey of 329 students from 4 Chinese elite universities. They find that university students who possess
    a higher level of public service spirit, value high social status and pursue less stressful life prefer to choose
    public sector jobs. There is no statistical evidence to support that female students are more likely to choose
    public jobs than are male students.
5
    The exam has become fiercely contested in recent years. In 2018, 1.66 million job seekers had been approved
    to sit for the exam, and an average of 58 applicants applied for each post and competition for some posts is
    particularly intense (see http://ah.huatu.com/zt/gkrstj/ for more data in details). The exam of application for
    judge officers requires that all applicants have at least four-year college education in legal studies, or non-
    legal studies with professional legal training.
6   The Chinese document can be found at http://www.court.gov.cn/zixun-xiangqing-2298.html.
7
    The current promotion policy is lack of priority target with veto power. Judges generally will therefore not lose
    their jobs based on their performance on one criterion, especially if mistakes only occur in a small proportion
    of cases handled. However, judges are still motivated to avoid possible mistakes. For example, when judges
    are appealed against, they make trouble for the court leaders. These “troublemakers” would leave a bad
    impression on the directors, which would adversely affect their career prospects.
                                                                                                                    5
marginal effect of such disamenties on productivity is large enough to affect promotion rates. 8
This discussion highlights that judges have strong career concerns to reduce the impact of pollution
and heat on their productivity and they must be aware of the causal relationship.



4. The Empirical Framework

      We seek to measure how a judge’s case duration is affected by pollution and heat. The length
of time taken is an interesting outcome variable because it measures cognition and the ability to
make decisions.

      Our main empirical specification is presented in equation (1):

                           𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽4 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
               +𝛾𝛾𝑗𝑗 + 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑡𝑡 + 𝜑𝜑𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                                                              (1)

where Yijscdt is the case duration (between the date when a case was assigned to a judge and the
date when the right case was adjudicated by that judge) of case i, belonging to crime type s,
assigned to the judge j sitting in court c on sentencing day d of year t. PijCT (or WijCT) is the daily
average reading from air pollution (or meteorological) stations located within prefecture C where
judge j worked on case i over the case duration T. By observing the judicial decisions across many
locations allows us to capture the effects of acute exposure to pollution and heat on the case i’s
duration (see Table A2). In equation (1), we use the fluctuation in daily maximum temperature and
air quality to identify the effect of heat and pollution on case duration. Given that we do not observe
each judge’s private self-protection effort, it is important to note that the marginal productivity
effects we estimate are net of any adaptation investments by the individual or the entity that
designed the building where the judge works.

      The physical attributes of China’s courthouses merit some discussion. The workplaces in
China’s public sector have been required to be standardized since 1987 when the National
Development Reform Commission first issued the Government Office Space Standards. The

8
    Hot days are defined as those days when daily maximum temperatures are warmer than 26 degrees Celsius (79
     degrees Fahrenheit), which are known to trigger an avoidance response (Graff Zivin and Neidell 2014;
     Seppanen et al. 2016). Polluted days are defined as those day when ambient PM2.5 exceed the World Health
     Organization safe limit (i.e., 25 μg/m3 24-hour mean).
                                                                                                                            6
standards applied to government office accommodation occupied by all general government
agencies and were revised three times in years 1996, 1999 and 2014 respectively. As required, the
standards for lighting, acoustics, ventilation, and central heating and cooling systems shall be
applied to enhance the work environment and to support a sustainable design objects. In 2003, the
Supreme People’s Court specifically issued China Court Facilities Standards (CCFS) defining the
minimum space and the functional, technical, and security requirements for the design of court
facilities. 9 The revised standards were endorsed in 2011 and additionally regulates the courtrooms
to cap air-conditioning at certain degrees both in summer and winter. 10 Though the CCFS aims at
providing good quality space for each judge to work in, considerable variation exists due to the
differences in court funding in different regions.

    To the best of our knowledge, there was no air filtration system installed in China’s courtrooms
to reduce air pollution exposure before 2019. People are more likely to invest in self-protection
when they anticipate high levels of ambient pollution (Moretti and Neidell 2011). To address this
issue, MijCT is added and defined as the daily average Baidu search index on “mask” of prefecture
C where judge j worked on case i over T. The value of M is positively correlated with people’s
search volume for the key word “mask” in a prefecture on a given day. Thus, it captures the
contemporaneous aggregate interests on mask purchase in a prefecture. This mask variable is not
at the individual level of a judge. Instead, it is a geographic aggregate variable that captures the
area’s overall average self-protection against pollution dynamics.

    In estimating equation (1), we recognize that are likely to be other case-level factors that
influence the timing of the case settlement. To make the criminal cases more comparable, Xijscdt is
included as a vector of covariates including both legal (e.g., offense severity and prior record) and
extra-legal factors (e.g., attitude of defendants in courtroom) that might predict the criminal case
duration (see Table 2 for the variables we use as controls). To mitigate endogeneity concerns, a set
of fixed effects are also added in our regressions. The vector γi contains the judge-specific fixed
effects to control for the idiosyncratic tendencies of each judge. Since judges may have different


9
  The design criteria are applicable to new court building projects and court renovation projects or building
   system upgrades in existing court buildings.
10 As required in the 2011 CCFS, in the winter, the air conditioning system should be able to maintain the

   building temperature at no more than 20 degrees Celsius. In the summer, air conditioning should maintain an
   indoor temperature at no less than 26 degrees Celsius.
                                                                                                            7
sentencing policies for different crimes, crime type fixed effects θs are added as further controls.
The vector δt includes the year fixed effect. φct is a vector of county by month fixed effects that
allow for different seasonal patterns by county (e.g., the seasonal variation of wind direction). εijscdt
is an error term. To address the potential heteroscedasticity and serial correlation, we cluster the
standard errors at the judge level. As a robustness exercise we will show that clustering by judge-
year and court-month has little effect on the results.

      By estimating Eq. (1), we also test for several dimensions of heterogeneity. Recent
experimental economics research has documented that the capacity to engage in sophisticated
thinking is reduced by pollution (Chew et al. 2018). We are able to test this hypothesis because we
have classified the court cases by their degree of complexity. Cases featuring greater complexity
requires a higher level of mental acuity for its resolution (Rohwedder and Willis 2010). We test
whether the decision time in these cases is longer on hotter and more polluted days. We test for
this by adding two proxies for case complexity in X. The first is a dummy variable equal to one if
a verdict mentions that that case was handled via the simple procedures, and zero otherwise. The
second is the total number of word count of each verdict.

      In studying the relationship between judicial performance and pollution and heat factors,
China’s justice system’s features allow us to avoid several identification challenges. First, within
the same lower court, each defendant’s case is in principle randomly assigned to a judge who
presides over the trial, plea bargaining, and sentencing process. 11 The judge is also unaware of the
details of the upcoming cases. Second, in terms of case duration, it takes on average months since
the filing of the claim to case resolution. Despite adjudications being made indoors, the judge in
charge would conduct on-site investigations to determine the real reasons for the litigation. They
might be exposed to heat and pollution both indoors and outdoors before they make the final
decisions. Third, individual judges have a high degree of personal discretion and independence in
the way in which they evaluate files. 12 Finally, given the extremely heavy caseload on the judge's


11   The Chinese document can be found at http://www.court.gov.cn/zixun-xiangqing-13520.html.
12   China’s legal system is a civil law system, as opposed to a common law system, with only statutory law.
     Judges' decisions are usually not accompanied by written legal opinions explaining their reasoning. Moreover,
     judicial decisions do not have any legally binding precedential effect on other cases. Thus, the interpretations
     by the Supreme People’s Court are important guides for judges. However, many interpretations are replete
     with vague passages that provide neither predictability nor transparency. Therefore, judges have a great deal
     of flexibility in implementation.
                                                                                                                   8
docket, judges only sit in one courthouse. Trial court decisions are generally final because appeals
are only available on limited bases, occur infrequently, and seldom lead to reversal in China. 13



5. Data

      Our main data source is online transcripts of judicial decisions. 14 These documents first
become available online in late 2013 in a handful of courts, and coverage widened over time. We
collect over 9.7 million criminal and civil cases adjudicated between 2014 and 2016 by 135,924
judges across China. The final dataset used in this paper consists of approximately 61.8 percent of
all criminal first instance cases and 27.2 percent of civil first instance cases adjudicated over the
years 2014 to 2016 (see Table 1 for more information).



                                       *** Insert Table 1 about here ***



      Air pollution data are published daily by the China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection.
The data for 2013 to 2018 cover 1,497 monitoring stations across all 337 prefectures. Weather data
are collected from China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System (http://cdc.cma.gov.cn/).
Those data contains daily readings from 820 weather stations in China during the 2013 to 2018
period. The pollution and meteorological variables are aggregated to the prefecture level by
averaging the daily readings of all the monitoring stations within a prefecture. Less than 10% of
the observations were dropped due to missing meteorological and pollution information.

      The remote sensing fire points come from the MODIS active fire product in the Fire
Information for Resource Management System at NASA. The MODIS active fire product detects
fires in 375m pixels that are burning at the time of satellite overpass under relatively cloud-free

13   In our sample, the appeal rate against the verdict of the court of first instance is about 10.6%, and 17.7% of
     judgments on appealed verdicts were reversed or commuted. These percentages are highly consistent with
     those (i.e., 11.1% and 18.3% respectively) documented in China Law Yearbook 2015-2017.
14
     In the late 2013, the Supreme People’s Court promulgated Regulations on Publishing Verdicts of Peoples’
     Courts Online. According to this document, verdicts of peoples’ courts at various levels should be published
     online except for those (1) involving state secrets or individual privacy; (2) involving juveniles; (3) resolved
     through mediation; and (4) other “improper” situations. See http://wenshu.court.gov.cn/ for the data source.
                                                                                                                   9
conditions using a contextual algorithm. We aggregate the original hourly data into daily data at
prefecture level. The Baidu Index used in this paper is a data product analogous to Google Trends,
which measures the search frequencies of the selected terms. We collect daily Baidu Index data on
the Chinese keyword “kouzhao” (mask) in the 337 matched prefectures with the judicial data in
2013-2018.

      The criminal sentencing data are used in our baseline regressions primarily because the cases
are numerous and the outcomes are easy to classify. The documents typically include several
paragraphs that sketch the arguments made by the litigants and the ruling of the judges. For each
criminal case that is prosecuted, a record is made of key case details including the defendant’s
characteristics (e.g., juvenile defendants), case traits (e.g., crime type), severity of crimes,
outcomes (e.g., sentence length), the court in which sentencing occurs, name of the judge, and so
on. In order to circumvent any potential confounding effects that may arise from multiple
convictions or offenses, we exclude cases with more than one count of conviction and single events
with more than one-person offense. 15

      Table 2 provides the definition and basic summary statistics of all variables used in this paper.
In terms of case duration, for each criminal case handled in the basic court, it takes on average 36
days since the filing of the claim to case resolution. Figure A1 further provides the density
distribution of the criminal case duration, the primary outcome of our interest. As anticipated, the
distribution is positively skewed in that many criminal court cases are settled relatively early on,
within 60 days.

6. Empirical results on the Performance of Judges

6.1 Baseline Estimates




15   We remove observations with erroneous dates (too far in the past or in the future).
                                                                                                     10
     The basic results are summarized in Table 3. 16 Column 1 presents results based on including
a set of fixed effects and weather controls. The results show both heat and air pollution prolong a
case’s duration. In columns 2-4, we add additional controls. This significantly increases the
explanatory power of the regressions. The impact of heat and air pollution on case handling time
is robust to the inclusion of the additional variables. In column 3, we present our preferred
specification with the Baidu Mask Index as an additional control. We find that a 1% increase in
PM2.5 leads to 19.8 % increase in the case handling time. These findings based on data from China
are qualitatively similar to the findings of Hayes and Saberian (2019) based on U.S justices’
decisions in asylum hearings. In contrast to their study, we test whether pollution and heat increase
the judicial decision time. This is our proxy for public sector worker productivity. 17

     The adverse impact of PM2.5 was not widely known to the Chinese populace before 2013. 18
Beginning in 2013, the Chinese prefectures started to monitor and publish daily levels of PM2.5.19
By the end of 2014, all prefectures were posting real-time disclosures of daily PM2.5 levels. To
warn residents how bad it is on any given day, the seriously polluted cities were required to launch
a four-color alert system by the end of 2014 when more cities announced their first-ever red alert
for heavy smog. 20 In column 4 of Table 3, we add an interaction term between log (PM2.5) and
Post2014 (i.e., a dummy variable which takes a value of 1 if the year is 2015 or 2016 and 0
otherwise). The statistical significance of the interaction terms indicates that the judges have gotten


16
    The empirical results using PM2.5 from 7AM to 7PM rather than over the full day are similar in both sign,
   magnitude, and statistical significance. Of the legal variables included in the regressions, all have a statistically
   significant influence on the judge’s ruling time. These results are available on request.
17 In Hayes and Saberian’s study (2019), an immigration judge typically determines multiple cases indoors on

   a given day. Our sample includes all types of criminal and civil cases. A judge typically takes a few days to
   make the final decision on a case. Meanwhile, despite adjudications being made indoors, some judges in
   charge would conduct several on-site investigations to determine the real reasons for the crime. Therefore, our
   targeted judges might be more exposed to heat and pollution before they make the final decisions. Finally,
   China’s legal system is a civil law system, as opposed to a common law system, with only statutory law, not
   case law. Judges' decisions are usually not accompanied by written legal opinions explaining their reasoning.
   Moreover, judicial decisions do not have any legally binding precedential effect on other cases. Thus, the
   interpretations by the Supreme People’s Court are important guides for practicing procurators, lawyers, and
   judges. However, many interpretations are extremely elusive.
18 One evidence is that before 2013, the Baidu Index on “PM ” was close to zero indicating that the Chinese
                                                                  2.5
   population was generally unaware of this pollutant.
19 In 2013, 74 Chinese prefectures started publishing data on PM
                                                                      2.5 levels.
20 The alert system is with red being the highest pollution level, followed by orange, yellow and blue. The yellow

   alert and above will trigger a series of compulsory emergency responses including the suspension of
   construction operations, the restriction of heavy pollution vehicles or the suspension of production in
   smokestack industries.
                                                                                                                     11
better at adapting to PM2.5 over time now that they are aware of the threat starting in 2015.
However, the size of this estimated coefficient is relatively small. This suggests that even in recent
years that judges have had limited success in offsetting their pollution exposure.

      In columns (1-4) in Table 3, we view the temperature variable to be a control variable. In
column (5), we test for the non-linear relationship between temperature and the decision time. We
categorize each day’s maximum temperature into the following categories; <5°C (the reference
category), ≥ 5°C (41°F) but <12°C (53°F), ≥ 12°C but <28°C (82°F), ≥28°C but <32°C
(89°F), and ≥32°C. These cut points represent the approximate 10th, 25th, 75th and 90th percentiles
of the empirical temperature distribution for those prefecture-dates from which we have
observations in our sample. 21 We find an asymmetric relationship between temperature and
decision time. The decision time at 5-12 degrees Celsius is 18.4% higher than at the reference
temperature range.        This decision time steadily climbs until 28 degrees Celsius, and then falls at
even higher temperatures. This pattern is consistent with the claim that China’s government
effectively uses air conditioning during times of high outdoor temperature and this indoor cooling
is associated with an improvement in a judge’s workplace performance. 22

6.2 The Effects of Heat and Pollution by Judge Age and Case Complexity

      In recent years, economists have explored the role of cognition in decision making. Some of
this research is related to lifecycle savings behavior and studies the cognitive dynamics of older
people (Rohwedder and Willis 2010; Smith et al. 2010). This literature tests whether older people
make worse decisions. A second literature examines how pollution affects decision making in
complex laboratory experiments (Chew et al. 2018).




21
     Models with smaller size bins for temperature yield strikingly similar results.
22
     In most of Chinese cities, the outdoor temperature bar for air conditioning in summer is set at 28 degrees
     Celsius. According to the heating policy, Northern China enters its heating season when the average daily
     temperature falls below 5 degrees Celsius.
                                                                                                            12
      In this section, we use our rich micro data to explore how pollution and heat affect decision
times for young and older judges and we explore how a case’s complexity affects the marginal
effects of heat and pollution. Columns 1-2 of Table 4 present our heterogeneity results by judge
age. We find that older judges are more influenced by heat and pollution. This finding is consistent
with the existing literature (Teitelbaum, 2006; Cristensen and Szmer, 2012). In columns 3-6, we
divide the full sample by case complexity. We find that it takes judges more days to make a
decision on complex cases when it is hot and polluted outside. 23 These results are consistent with
recent experimental research by Chew et al. (2018) who find that “a haze-induced increase in risk
aversion may induce workers to exercise greater care thereby reducing their work pace in order to
minimize the rate of defects and the variability of their compensations”.



                                    *** Insert Table 4 about here ***



      In Table 5, we have also explored how pollution and heat affect the probability that a case is
appealed by the defendants or is remanded by the higher courts. We view these as indicators that
the judge did not perform well in adjudicating the trial. We find that the probability of both
outcomes is marginally increased when the judge is exposed to more pollution. This finding is in
accord with our case complexity findings. Judges appear to have more trouble making “good
decisions” when exposed to more pollution.



                                    *** Insert Table 5 about here ***



6.3 Additional Results

      To further explore our identifying assumptions, we report a battery of robustness checks. As
discussed before, a judge’s court performance is annually evaluated. Thus, there might be an


23
     Table A3 shows the asymmetric inverted U-shaped relationship between temperature and decision time for
     these different groups.
                                                                                                        13
aggregate time constraint such that the judge must allocate time with an eye on meeting his
obligations within a year. To further allow for autocorrelation in a judge’s decisions in each year,
we cluster the standard errors by judge-year in column 1 of Table 6. In some local courts, judges
also could receive monthly internal newsletters assessing the relative court performance of
individual judges. Therefore, individual judges’ self-evaluation against peers in the same court
might also influence judges’ decisions. In column 2 of Table 6, the standard errors are clustered
by court-month. In the above both two cases, the level of significance of the estimated coefficients
is unchanged. 24

      In column 3, we present the results limiting our sample to those top five common offences (see
Table A4). Column 4 excludes “less active” judges who adjudicated less than 100 cases throughout
the time of study. We find very similar evidence under these sample restrictions. In column 5 of
Table 6, we replace PM2.5 measures with Air Quality Index (AQI). 25 Again, our results remain
consistent. Heat and air pollution may be measured with errors due to sporadic monitoring stations.
In column 6, we focus on courts within 10km of their corresponding both air quality and
meteorological monitoring stations. The results show a similar effect in terms of statistical
significance and magnitude.

      Ideally, we would observe the particulate level each day where the judge lives and works.
Instead, we observe the air pollution level at the prefecture level. Variation in air pollution within
a city on a given day raises issues of classical measurement error. To address this concern, for each
prefecture, we calculate the daily total number of fire points within its administrative boundary. 26
Then we calculate its value mean during the case duration as an IV for PM2.5. As indicated in
column 7, Cragg-Donald (CD) Wald F-statistic for weak identification is much larger than the

24
     The level of signiﬁcance of the estimated coeﬃcient is also unchanged when the standard errors are clustered
      by judge and by prefecture.
25
     In 2013, an AQI was developed by collecting daily values of pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
      dioxide, carbon monoxide, suspended particulates less than 10 μm in diameter (PM10), fine particulates
      (PM2.5), and ozone, all measured at the monitoring stations. This is a notable shift from the previous measure
      (air pollution index, or API), which only focused on primary pollutants such as SO2, NO2, and PM10. All 337
      prefectures were required to disclose their once classified air quality data by 2015. The AQI scale ranges
      from 0 to 500. It is further divided into six ranges 0-50, 51-100, 101-150, 151-200, 201-300, and 301-500
      which are categorized as good, moderate, unhealthy for sensitive groups, unhealthy, very unhealthy, and
      hazardous, respectively.
26
     In China, a large amount of the crop straws has been burned without being recycled or processed. The burned
      proportion of straws is about 4 times more than the world average. The straw burning could lead to very high
      concentrations of pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10).
                                                                                                                 14
most stringent Stock-Yogo critical value of 16.38, which indicates that our IV is not week. The
coefficient becomes larger in magnitude while remaining statistically significant at the 1% level
as compared to the OLS estimates.

      To draw a general conclusion regarding the heat and air pollution effects on case duration, in
Table A5, we further examine that to what extent the results generalize to other judicial settings.
Our results indicate that a judge’s exposure to heat and dirty air will take him more time to finalize
the judicial decisions.



7. Heat and Pollution’s Effects on the Productivity of Other Government
      Sectors

      We recognize that our empirical work has focused on the productivity of an elite subset of
public sector workers. In this section, we present additional evidence on the productivity of
China’s public sector based on two other indicators. We collect the message data from the official
portal of people.cn where the government bulletin board (the biggest one in China) enables local
leaders nationwide (i.e., party chiefs and governors) to communicate with netizens. This bulletin
board is formally responsible for responding to citizen complaints, requests, suggestions and
consultations to government agencies or municipalities. We use the number of days it takes the
government to complete a service from the time the request is posted on the bulletin board as the
second proxy for the public sector worker productivity. Second, in 1983, China set up the first
12345 hotline as a single point of contact for requesting all non-emergency city services and is
available to both residents and visitors. 27 Dialing 12345 in a city connects a caller to the local
government switchboard where trained frontline operators will route the calls to the specific agents


27
     Alternatively, citizens should call 110 when they face the emergency and need helps from the governments.
     The 12345 hotline operates 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. It is in analogous to the 3-1-1 service supported
     in many communities in the U.S. and Canada.
                                                                                                                  15
according to the customized rules to run the operation. 28 We use the number of days it takes the
12345 hotline to complete a service from intake to resolution as another indicator of public sector
worker productivity. 29

     Table 7 presents our empirical results. We estimate a version of equation (1) where we change
the dependent variable to reflect the length of time to respond to requests. The estimates presented
in column (1) imply an elasticity of 0.243 for PM2.5, and a unit increase in daily maximum
temperature increases the service time by 0.468 percent. 30 Column 3 presents estimates of the
same regression, but with 12345 calls as the outcome indicator. The service time is quite elastic
with respect to PM2.5. The estimated heat effect is positive but statistically insignificant. In
columns (2) and (4) we find evidence of an inverted U shape between service time and outdoor
temperature. When it is extremely hot outside, service time is quicker than when it is merely hot
outside. This suggests that air conditioning is helping these public sector workers to be productive.
In Table 7’s columns (5) and (6), we test whether the demand for government services is higher
on more polluted, hotter days. Perhaps surprisingly, we find little evidence of a large effect of
pollution on the demand for government services.



                                     *** Insert Table 7 about here ***



     In Table 8, we compare our pollution elasticities to other estimates reported in the literature.
In general, our PM2.5 elasticities for the public sector judges are larger than other estimates reported
based for private sector firms in China or U.S estimates. The outdoor farm worker elasticity in the
U.S is close to our estimated elasticity but this highlights the limited ability exhibited by the
Chinese public sector to offset the pollution challenge.




28
   For example, call center managers will send tasks to the municipal general office that will delegate the tasks
   by assigning tags to their team agents based on their skill sets, and the area of expertise.
29 Though almost all prefecture city governments have opened the 12345 hotline, many only publish few

   examples on their official portals. We therefore restrict our data to cases from each city’s website (80 ones in
   total) at least documenting over 1,000 ones per year (see Figure A2 for the spatial distribution of our sample
   prefectures).
30 Restricting our sample to cities with more observations does not appreciably change our estimate.

                                                                                                                16

8. Conclusion

   During polluted days, judges in China do not perform as efficiently. We find that a 1% increase
in PM2.5 leads to a 19.8 % increase in the case handling time. Such judges have trouble ruling on
more complex cases and are more likely to make decisions that are appealed and over-ruled. The
public sector’s productivity is less affected by extreme heat and this suggests that air conditioning
has been effective in offsetting this challenge. These findings contribute to the emerging
environmental economics literature exploring the productivity costs for urban workers due to
environmental exposure. Given China’s high levels of pollution and hot summers, this setting
offers substantial variation to test how educated elite civil servants adapt to extreme conditions.

   In contrasting our public sector estimates with some recent private sector estimates, we find
that our implied elasticities are larger than the private sector elasticities. While we acknowledge
that we examined just one sector of the Chinese government, we believe that our findings open up
the possibility of exploring the general Alchian and Kessell (1962) hypothesis that the public sector
uses “other people’s money” to provide high quality workplace work conditions. Future research
should study how organizational design and labor market competition affects the empirical “cause
and effect” relationship between pollution, climate and work place productivity.

All our results in this paper are estimated on the final sample and thus our results
should be interpreted with this sample in mind. The initial data processing removes:
(1) cases without judge's name; (2) cases missing the exact date when they were
assumed jurisdiction; (3) cases with erroneous dates (i.e., too far in the past or in the

Notes : In column 1, the percentage of hot days in a month is defined as the
percentage of days with daily maximum temperature over 80 degrees Fahrenheit at
prefecture level during that month. In column 2, the percentage of hot days in a
month is defined as the percentage of days with daily average temperature over 80
degrees Fahrenheit across at prefecture level during that month. In column 3, the
percentage of polluted days in a month is defined as the percentage of days with
daily average AQI over 100 at prefecture level during that month. In column 4, the
percentage of polluted days in a month is defined as the percentage of days with
daily average PM2.5 over the World Health Organization safe limit (i.e., 25 μg/m
                                                                                 3
