Household Leverage and the Recession of 2007 to 2009

                                               ABSTRACT

We show that household leverage as of 2006 is a powerful statistical predictor of the severity of the
2007 to 2009 recession across U.S. counties. Counties in the U.S. that experienced a large increase
in household leverage from 2002 to 2006 showed a sharp relative decline in durable consumption starting
in the third quarter of 2006 – a full year before the official beginning of the recession in the fourth
quarter of 2007. Similarly, counties with the highest reliance on credit card borrowing reduced durable
consumption by significantly more following the financial crisis of the fall of 2008. Overall, our statistical
model shows that household leverage growth and dependence on credit card borrowing as of 2006
explain a large fraction of the overall consumer default, house price, unemployment, residential investment,
and durable consumption patterns during the recession. Our findings suggest that a focus on household
finance may help elucidate the sources macroeconomic fluctuations.

       Understanding the sources of deep recessions is the holy grail of macroeconomics. The

most recent recession has produced a sharp increase in unemployment and a large decline in

GDP (Figure I, top two panels). What factors explain the current economic downturn? This paper

focuses on the role of household leverage. We show that household leverage measured as of

2006 is an early and powerful statistical predictor of cross-sectional county-level variation in

household default, house price, unemployment, residential investment, and durable consumption

from 2007 to 2009. Any realistic macroeconomic theory of the 2007 recession must be consistent

with the time-series and cross-sectional patterns documented in this paper.

       The aggregate U.S. evidence highlights the potential importance of household leverage.

The bottom panel of Figure 1 shows the unprecedented increase in the U.S. household debt to

income ratio during the years prior to the recession. In 2007, the household debt to GDP ratio

reached its highest level since the onset of the Great Depression. The initial indicators of

economic difficulty, namely a rise in household defaults and a decline in house prices, were also

related to household leverage. These trends began as early as the second quarter of 2006, a full

five quarters before the initial increase in the unemployment rate. The components of GDP that

initially declined in 2007 and early 2008 were fixed residential investment and durable

consumption—two components that most heavily rely on the willingness of households to obtain

additional debt financing.

       While aggregate patterns are suggestive, it is difficult to reach definitive conclusions on

the link between household leverage and the economy based on aggregate data alone. For

example, it is possible that the decline in house prices and the increase in defaults in 2006

reflected an anticipation of future unemployment. Or perhaps the household-leverage component

of the recession, while occurring early in the downturn, is far less important than the credit crisis



                                                  1
of September and October of 2008. More generally, the linkages across the economy make it

difficult to conclude based on aggregate evidence alone what factors contributed the most to the

severe recession of 2007 to 2009.

       Our focus on cross-sectional variation across U.S. counties in the severity of the

recession helps to overcome some of the difficulties associated with aggregate data. There is a

large degree of such variation across counties. For example, Saint Lucie County in Florida

experienced an increase in the unemployment rate of 6.6% from 2006 to 2008. In contrast, Harris

County in Texas, where Houston is located, had a rise of only 1.2% in the unemployment rate.

Our empirical methodology examines patterns across U.S. counties to explore why some

counties have experienced a much more severe recession than others.

       We sort counties according to the increase in the household debt to income ratio from

2002 to 2006, and we refer to counties with large (small) increases in leverage during this period

as high (low) leverage growth counties. We find that the recession both began earlier and became

more severe in high leverage growth counties relative to low leverage growth counties. The top

10% leverage growth counties experienced an increase in the household default rate of 12

percentage points and a decline in house prices of 40% from the second quarter of 2006 through

the second quarter of 2009. In contrast, the bottom 10% leverage growth counties experienced a

modest increase of 3 percentage points in the default rate and a 10% increase in house prices.

       Auto sales and new housing building permits reveal a similar pattern. By the third quarter

of 2008, auto sales in the top 10% leverage growth counties declined by almost 40% relative to

2005. In contrast, auto sales in the bottom 10% leverage growth counties were actually up almost

20%. From 2005 to 2008, new housing building permits declined by almost 150% in high

leverage growth counties while declining only 50% in low leverage growth counties. To the best



                                                2
of our knowledge, we are the first to examine durable consumption and residential investment

patterns across U.S. counties during a recession, and the first to show the link between household

leverage and the decline in these variables.

       The final measure of economic activity we examine is the unemployment rate. Similar to

the pattern in auto sales, the unemployment rate increased in high leverage growth counties

much earlier than low leverage counties. From the fourth quarter of 2005 to the third quarter of

2008, the unemployment rate climbed 2.5 percentage points in the top 10% leverage growth

counties; in contrast, the bottom 10% leverage growth counties experienced no change in

unemployment.

       The evidence suggests that both the timing and the severity of the recession were related

to the increase in household leverage from 2002 to 2006. Counties that experienced a large

increase in their debt to income ratio before the onset of the downturn were precisely the

counties that experienced the sharpest decline in durable consumption and the largest increase in

unemployment. We also show that the correlation between leverage growth and the severity of

the recession is robust to county-level control variables for demographics, cyclicality, and

industrial composition.

       While counties with low leverage largely escaped the recession up to the third quarter of

2008, auto sales drop and unemployment skyrocket in both high and low leverage growth

counties from the fourth quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of 2009. In other words, the

growth household leverage from 2002 to 2006 is not correlated with the severity of the downturn

across U.S. counties during the last three quarters of the recession.

       In the last section of our analysis, we examine what factors other than household leverage

growth from 2002 to 2006 are correlated with acceleration of the recession from the fourth



                                                  3
quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009. We find that the severity of the downturn in these

three quarters is correlated with an alternative measure of household leverage: household

exposure to short term credit, as measured by the credit card utilization rate as of 2006. High

credit card utilization rate counties experienced a sharper drop in auto sales from the fourth

quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of 2009. This coincides with a sharp reduction in

credit card availability that occurs simultaneously with the financial crisis in September and

October of 2008.

        Our findings suggest that households faced a one-two punch during the recession. From

the fourth quarter of 2006 to the third quarter of 2008, an over-levered household sector facing

mounting defaults and falling house prices pulled back on durable consumption and experienced

higher unemployment rates. From the fourth quarter of 2008 onwards, credit-card dependent

consumers reduced consumption as credit card availability was cut dramatically.

        We assess the statistical magnitude of the household leverage effect by using our

estimated regression coefficients to predict the severity of the recession across the household

leverage distribution. Using this methodology, we find that the growth in household leverage

from 2002 to 2006 and household dependence on credit card borrowing as of 2006 are

quantitatively sufficient to statistically explain the entire rise in household defaults, the drop in

house prices, and the drop in auto sales. Our factors also explain about a fifth of the overall rise

in unemployment. The reduced explanatory power for unemployment is a natural outcome of the

fact that goods consumed in one location are often produced in different locations, therefore

naturally lowering the correlation between local consumption and production shocks.1

  For example, reduced recreational vehicle (RV) sales in Los Angeles County due to household leverage may lead
to a sharp increase in unemployment in Elkhart County, Indiana, even though Elkhart County has low household
leverage.

                                                       4
           Overall, our findings suggest that household balance sheets are a crucial component of

explaining macroeconomic fluctuations. The idea that household debt instigates and exacerbates

economic downturns goes back to Fisher (1933), and is reiterated in subsequent research by

Mishkin (1978), King (1994), Leamer (2007, 2009), and Glick and Lansing (2009, 2010)).

Leamer (2007, 2009) points out that eight of the past ten recessions were preceded by substantial

problems in housing and consumer durables. Our paper provides the first micro-level cross-

sectional evidence based on the 2007 to 2009 recession of the link between household balance

sheets and an economic downturn.2

           Our empirical findings should also serve as a useful metric for guiding theoretical work

on understanding business cycle fluctuations. Standard DSGE models of business cycles often

ignore the role of financial markets (see Tovar 2008). While this has changed more recently (see

e.g. Christiano et al 2007), the emphasis has been on firm and bank level, not household level3.

           Our work on the other hand points to the potential importance of household balance

sheets in explaining macroeconomic fluctuations. While more research is needed to determine

whether household leverage was a catalyst of the recession or an amplification of other variables,

such as technology or monetary shocks, any explanation of the recession of 2007 to 2009 must

be consistent with the strong correlation between household leverage and subsequent economic

outcomes in the cross-section of U.S. counties.

           Our results are closely related to the persistent business cycle fact that residential

investment and durable consumption are strong leading indicators of business cycles. This

finding deserves closer scrutiny by theoretical work. While many macro models predict that

investment is a leading indicator of business cycles, most have difficulty in explaining why

    In a concurrent analysis, Glick and Lansing (2010) find similar results in the cross-section of western countries.

    Iacovello (2005) is an important exception.

household investment should leads business investment over the business cycle. This difficultly

is recognized by Jonas Fisher (2001) as a “potent challenge to real business cycle theory”.

       The rest of the study proceeds as follows. In the next section, we provide aggregate

evidence on the importance of household leverage. In Section 2, we describe the county-level

data and provide summary statistics. In Section 3, we focus on the relation between leverage

growth from 2002 to 2006 and economic outcomes from 2006 to 2009. Section 4 explores

alternative hypotheses and shows how credit card-reliant borrowers responded to the financial

crisis of the fall of 2008. Section 5 presents our magnitude estimation, and Section 6 concludes.



Section 1. Household Leverage and the Real Economy

A. The Origins of Household Leverage

       What factors led to the dramatic expansion in household leverage from 2001 to 2007?

This is the central question of two of our previous studies. In Mian and Sufi (2009a), we argue

that the advent of subprime mortgage securitization represented a credit supply shock that

provided new home purchase financing for a segment of the population that traditionally was

unable to obtain mortgages. We are agnostic on the source of the credit supply shock—it is likely

that government programs (Leonnig (2008)), moral hazard on behalf of originators and servicers

of securitization pools (Keys, Mukherjee, Seru, and Vig (2010), and the enormous capital

inflows into the United States (Obstfeld and Rogoff (2009)) all played some role. We present

evidence that the credit supply shock led to an increase in house prices, which led to an

important collateral feedback effect: once collateral values increased, lenders were willing to

lend even more to households (Kiyotaki and Moore (1997)).




                                                 6
         In Mian and Sufi (2009b), we focus on existing homeowners who owned their homes

before the credit supply shock. We find that existing homeowners responded to house price

growth by borrowing heavily against the increase in the value of their home equity. We find that

homeowners borrowed 25 to 30 cents on every dollar of home value appreciation, and that this

home equity-based borrowing channel accounts for a substantial fraction of the increase in

homeowner debt from 2002 to 2006.

         To summarize, two related factors are responsible for the rise in household leverage

between 2001 and 2007. First, an expansion in the supply of credit (as opposed to a productivity

driven demand side shock) pulled new buyers into the housing market, pushing house prices up

in the process. Second, the increase in house prices and low interest rates enticed existing

homeowners to extract cash from their home equity.

B. Household Leverage and the Real Economy

         Following the historic rise in household leverage, the top panel in Figure 2 shows that

beginning in the second quarter of 2006, default rates began to rise and house prices began to

fall. As early as the second quarter of 2007—two months before the beginning of the current

recession—default rates were already above the levels they had reached in the 2001 recession.

By the second quarter of 2009, the default rate neared 10%, which is twice as high as any point

since 1991. Total delinquent debt as of the second quarter of 2009 was $1.7 trillion.4

         The process of household de-leveraging began in the second quarter of 2008 (lower

panel). Households cut back on consumption as the personal savings rate reached 5.2% in the

second quarter of 2009 - the highest it has been in over a decade. As early as the fourth quarter of

4
  Throughout, the household default rate refers to the default rate on all household debt, including housing- and non-
housing-related debt. In our sample as of 2006, housing-related debt (mortgages and home equity lines) is on
average 80% of total debt across U.S. counties. Further, a regression of housing-related default rates on total default
rates yields and R2 of 0.98. In other words, most of the variation across counties in household default rates is driven
by variation in housing-related default rates.

                                                           7
2007, debt growth began to moderate. From the fourth quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of

2009, total household debt declined for three straight quarters—something that had not

previously occurred in the past 60 years for which quarterly data are available.

       Why did mortgage defaults begin to rise and house prices begin to fall in the middle of

2006? This question is beyond the scope of our analysis, but we offer three potential reasons.

First, rising interest rates likely played a role in reducing house prices by lowering the relative

advantage of homeownership (Mayer and Hubbard (2008)). Second, lending standards on

mortgages deteriorated to such a degree that mortgages originated in 2006 experienced

shockingly high default rates almost immediately after origination (Demyanyk and Van Hemert

(2008)). Third, even small increases in default rates may have shut down securitization markets,

leading to an amplification effect on default rates as households were unable to refinance.

       One thing is certain: the rise in mortgage defaults and collapse in house prices preceded

the aggregate rise in the unemployment rate. Figure 3 shows that the increase in default rates (top

panel) and decrease in house prices (bottom panel) started five quarters before any increase in

the aggregate unemployment rate.

       Figure 4 shows the decline in real activity. Starting in the first quarter of 2006, residential

fixed investment growth began to plummet. By the fourth quarter of 2007, residential fixed

investment had declined almost 50% from its 2005 level. In contrast, non-residential fixed

investment showed robust growth until the third quarter of 2008. The middle panel of Figure 4

shows a similar pattern for durable consumption, which leveled off in 2007 before experiencing

sharp declines through 2008. Non-durable and service consumption remained strong until the

end of 2008.




                                                  8
       The bottom panel of Figure 4 shows monthly retail sales; as it shows, the drop in durable

consumption (motor vehicles, and furniture and appliances) began very early in the recession.

The drop in auto sales was particularly large—from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth

quarter of 2008, auto sales dropped by 30%. The drop in non-durable consumption both began

later and was far less severe.

       Figure 4 shows that the initial part of the economic downturn was driven by declines in

durable consumption and residential investment. This is common in post World War II

recessions (Leamer (2007, 2009)). The early drops in these two GDP components during the

2007 to 2009 recession occurred simultaneously with an extremely large increase in household

defaults. Given the importance of credit in the purchase of durable goods and housing, there is a

suggestive link between deterioration of household balance sheets and the early decline in

durable and housing consumption.

       While the aggregate patterns are suggestive of a link between household leverage and the

recession, we urge caution in the interpretation of the evidence. A main disadvantage of

aggregate data is the inability to distinguish between competing hypotheses that imply similar

time series patterns in aggregate activity. For example, residential investment and durable

consumption may have declined given expectations of future unemployment increases. In the

next section, we begin our analysis of the cross-section of U.S. counties to provide further

evidence on the link between household leverage and the 2007 to 2009 recession.



Section 2. County-Level Data and Summary Statistics

       We build the county-level data set from a variety of sources. Information on household

debt, default rates, and credit scores comes from Equifax zip code level aggregates. Data on



                                                 9
house prices come from the FHFA MSA level house price indices, which are subsequently

matched to counties. Zip code level income information is available from the IRS, and zip code

level demographics are from the 2000 Decennial Census. More information on these data sets is

available in the appendix of Mian and Sufi (2009a). The zip code level data in Equifax are

aggregated to the county level by weighting each zip code by the fraction of all consumers with a

credit report in the county living in the zip code. The IRS and Census zip code level data are

aggregated to the county level using the number of households in the 2000 census as weights.

        There are four new county-level data sets that we do not employ in our previous studies.

The first includes auto sales data from R.L. Polk. Polk is an automotive intelligence company

that provides detailed auto sales data to a variety of customers. The data are collected by

examining new vehicle registrations at the county level. The data are available from 2004 to

2009 at a quarterly frequency, and they cover every county in the United States.5 County-level

unemployment data are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, who provide quarterly

unemployment rate data for all U.S. counties. We use county business patterns data from the

Census Bureau to construct industry composition of employment for each county. The business

patterns data records payroll and employment data by industry for each county and is available

with a three year lag. New housing permits also come from the Census Bureau.6

        While there are 3,138 counties in the U.S., we restrict our attention to the top 450

counties in the U.S. by population. These are counties with at least 50,000 resident households,

which cover 70% of the U.S. population and 82% of the aggregate debt outstanding as of the end

of 2005. Since our focus is on county-level analysis in this paper, we drop the very small

counties that add significant measurement error. All of our results are unchanged if we include

small counties, but give them their appropriate statistical weight by weighing by county

population.7

         Every state and the District of Columbia are represented by the counties in our sample,

with the exception of Wyoming. To get a sense of the counties included, we list in the Appendix

Table every fifth county in our final sample, where the counties are sorted inversely according to

the change in the debt to income ratio from 2002 to 2006 (i.e., counties with the largest increase

in the debt to income ratio are listed first).

         Table 1 presents summary statistics for the final sample of 450 counties. The key variable

of interest in our study is the increase in the debt to income ratio across counties from 2002 to

2006. The average debt to income increase across counties from 2002 to 2006 was 0.8. The

average debt to income ratio as of 2001 was 2.2 with a standard deviation of 0.5, which implies

that the increase from 2002 to 2006 was more than one full standard deviation of the 2001 level.

         The average increase in the default rates of counties from the fourth quarter of 2006 to

the second quarter of 2009 was 0.043, which is almost three times as large as one standard

deviation of the 2006 level. House prices collapsed from 2006 to 2009, with the average decline

across counties in our sample of 14%. House price data are only available for 123 counties; this

reflects the limits of the coverage of MSAs by FHFA.

         Table 1 also shows that auto sales plummeted by an average of 32% from the fourth

quarter of 2006 to the second quarter of 2009. Over the same time period, the unemployment rate

increased by an average of 5.4 percentage points, which is more than 4 times a standard

  The results using the full sample and equally weighting counties are qualitatively similar but are smaller in
magnitude. This is consistent with higher measurement error in very small counties. Consistent with this
explanation, the R2 of equally weighted regressions using the full sample are only between 1/3 and 1/2 as large as
the R2 of population weighted regressions using the full sample.

county business patterns across the 450 counties in our sample.



Section 3. Household Leverage and the Real Economy: County-Level Analysis

       In this section, we examine how household leverage growth in a given county from 2002

to 2006 is correlated with the timing and severity of the recession in the county from 2006 to

2009. As we show, counties with the largest increases in household leverage experienced the

earliest and most severe downturns in economic activity.

A. Methodology

       There are five county-level economic outcomes we evaluate: mortgage default rates,

house price growth, auto sales, new housing building permits, and unemployment. The goal of

our methodology is to see how the increase in leverage from 2002 to 2006 in a given county is

correlated with these county-level outcomes during the recession. We first split the sample into

high and low leverage growth counties. High leverage growth counties are counties in the top

10% of the distribution of the increase in the debt to income ratio from 2002 to 2006. For

example, Merced County in California experienced an increase in its aggregate debt to income of

2.3 from 2002 to 2006. Low leverage growth counties are counties in the bottom 10% of the

same distribution. For example, Tarrant County in Texas experienced almost no increase in its

debt to income ratio from 2002 to 2006. Once we split the sample into high and low leverage

growth counties, we present figures that plot each economic outcome from the fourth quarter of

2004 to the end of the sample. This technique shows both the timing and severity of the

downturn in high versus low leverage growth counties.




                                                12
        Our second approach is to present figures that contain the county-level scatter plot of the

change in each economic outcome during the recession against the rise in leverage that preceded

the recession. For example, for each county, we plot the increase in the unemployment rate from

the fourth quarter of 2006 to second quarter of 2009 against the rise in household leverage from

the fourth quarter of 2002 to the fourth quarter of 2006.

        Third, for each outcome, we present a series of first difference regressions with county-

level control variables. The following equation represents the general form of the first difference

specifications:

                  06 4_09 2                        02 4_06 4     Γ                               (1)

where EconomicOutcome06q4_09q2 represents the change in the outcome (house prices, default

rates, unemployment, and auto sales) for county i from the fourth quarter of 2006 to the second

quarter of 2009, LeverageGrowth02q4_06q4 represents the increase in the debt to income ratio

in county i from the fourth quarter of 2002 to the fourth quarter of 2006, and ControlVariables is

a set of cyclicality, demographic, and industrial composition measures for county i. In estimating

specification (1), we weight by the total number of households in the county as of 2000 to

account for the fact that variables measured over smaller populations have larger variance. We

also report unweighted regression results in all our tables. Standard errors in all specification are

clustered at the state level.

        In the regression specifications, we choose to measure household leverage growth up to

2006 because it reflects when the household leverage cycle shifted from expansion to

contraction. As Figure 2 above shows, the decline in house prices and the increase in household

defaults began in 2006. Although the recession did not formally begin until the fourth quarter of

2007 according to the NBER, we choose to measure economic outcomes from the fourth quarter

of 2006 because default rates increased rapidly and house priced declined sharply in 2007. All

                                                 13
results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar if we measure outcomes from the fourth

quarter of 2007. Further, as mentioned above, we plot all outcomes for high and low leverage

growth counties from 2004 onwards in order to show the exact timing of economic outcomes.

       In most of our empirical tests, we take the variation across counties in leverage growth

from 2002 to 2006 as given. In other words, we do not attempt to discern why some counties

experienced sharper increases in household leverage than others. This issue is addressed in our

previous studies. In both Mian and Sufi (2009a) and Mian and Sufi (2009b), we show that an

aggregate credit supply shock beginning in 2002 shifted the demand for housing across the

country. The degree to which house prices increased in respond to this housing demand shock

depended crucially on the slope of the housing supply curve. In counties with relatively elastic

housing supply, house prices were relatively steady as home-builders responded to the demand

shock by constructing more homes. In counties with relatively inelastic housing supply, house

prices increased given the difficulty in constructing more homes to meet new demand.

       As a corollary, as counties with inelastic housing supply experienced sharper increases in

house prices, existing homeowners aggressively borrowed against the value of their homes

(Mian and Sufi (2009b)) and new homeowners were forced to take out larger mortgages to buy

more expensive homes (Mian and Sufi (2009a)). The primary measure of housing supply

elasticity we use in the previous studies comes from Saiz (2008), who constructs his measure

based on geographical and topographical constraints on house construction.

       The impact of housing supply elasticity on leverage growth is quite strong: a county level

regression of the increase in the debt to income ratio from 2002 to 2006 on the Saiz (2008)

measure of housing supply inelasticity shows a strongly positive correlation with an R2 of almost




                                                14
0.2. This motivates our final test of the relation between leverage growth and economic

outcomes, which is the following instrumental variables specification:

                   06 4_09 2                       02 4_06 4       Γ                        (2)

                02 4_06 4                                      Θ                            (3)

Where equation (3) represents the first stage in which leverage growth is regressed on the Saiz

(2008) measure of housing supply inelasticity. The second stage is identified using the predicted

values of LeverageGrowth02q4_06q4 for each county. We examine the exclusion restriction in

great detail in our previous work, and we come to the conclusion that differential patterns in

economic outcomes in the IV specification above come through house price growth and its effect

on household leverage.

B. Default Rates and House Prices

       Figure 5A shows differential patterns for default rates and house prices for high versus

low leverage growth counties. Counties that experienced the largest increase in their debt to

income ratio from 2002 to 2006 saw a tremendous rise in household default rates. Beginning in

the second quarter of 2006, the household default rate in high leverage growth counties began to

skyrocket. By the second quarter of 2009, the default rate increased by 12 percentage points for

these counties. In contrast, default rates in low leverage growth counties began to rise later and

experienced only a modest increase by 2009. By the end of the sample period, the default rate is

almost 10 percentage points higher in high leverage growth counties relative to low leverage

growth counties.

       The patterns in house price growth are similar. Low leverage growth counties completely

avoided the housing downturn. High leverage growth counties were hammered. Starting in 2006,

house prices began to plummet in counties that had experienced the largest rise in the debt to



                                                 15
income ratio from 2002 to 2006. From 2005 to the second quarter of 2009, house prices dropped

a stunning 40% in high leverage growth counties.

       Figure 5B shows the scatter plots for the change in these two outcome variables from

2006 to 2009 against the increase in household leverage from 2002 to 2006. As they show, the

increase in household leverage before the recession in a given county strongly predicts the

severity of the subsequent default and housing crisis within the same county. The magnitudes are

very large: the regression line implies that a one standard deviation increase in leverage growth

from 2002 to 2006 leads to a 2/3 standard deviation increase in subsequent default rates and a 2/3

standard deviation decline in subsequent house price growth.

       Tables 2 and 3 present the first difference regression analogs to the scatter plots, and they

show that the correlations in Figure 5B are robust to the inclusion of control variables. In column

1 of Table 2, the change in the debt to income ratio from 2002 to 2006 is strongly correlated with

the increase in default rates from 2006 to 2009. This single variable gives an R2 of 0.45, which is

extremely high for a first-difference cross-section regression. Column 2 presents the coefficient

estimate after weighting the observations by the number of households in the county as of 2000.

       In columns 3 and 4, we include a variety of control variables that increase the adjusted R2

substantially. The inclusion of control variables actually increases the size of the coefficient on

leverage growth. Column 5 presents the IV estimate where the change in the debt to income ratio

is instrumented using the Saiz (2008) measure of housing supply inelasticity. The IV estimate is

considerably larger than the OLS estimate, which may be may be driven by two factors. First, the

IV could be correcting for some measurement error in leverage growth. Second, to the extent

some of the increase in leverage is driven by real permanent income shocks, it would tend to

reduce ex-post differences between high and low leverage growth counties. For example, if high



                                                 16
leverage growth were driven by an accurate expectation of higher income growth in future, then

leverage growth will not be correlated with high default rates. Since our housing supply elasticity

instrument is uncorrelated with such permanent income shock differences (see Mian and Sufi

2009b for evidence), the IV specification corrects for the endogeneity problem.

       The coefficient in column 1 of Table 3 shows the strong negative correlation between

leverage growth from 2002 to 2006 and subsequent house price growth. The univariate

specification yields an R2 of 0.62. As before, the inclusion of control variables improves the fit

of the regression, but has almost no effect on the relation between leverage growth and house

price growth. As with default rates, the IV estimate is larger than the OLS estimate, although the

coefficient is not estimated precisely.

C. Auto Sales, New Housing Permits, and Unemployment Rates

       In Figure 6A, we plot the differential patterns in auto sales, new housing building

permits, and unemployment rates for high versus low leverage growth counties. Counties that

experienced the largest increase in their debt to income ratio from 2002 to 2006 saw a severe

contraction in auto sales very early in the downturn. By the first quarter of 2008, auto sales

dropped 20% relative to their 2005 level in high leverage growth counties. In contrast, auto sales

were actually up in low leverage growth counties in the first quarter of 2008. In the third quarter

of 2008, auto sales dropped in both high and low leverage growth counties, but the drop in high

leverage growth counties was much more severe. Interestingly, all counties saw auto sales

plummet in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. We return to this latter fact in

Section 4.

       The middle panel of Figure 6A plots the differential patterns for new housing permits.

High leverage growth counties experienced a much earlier and more severe downturn in new



                                                 17
housing permit growth. At the end of 2007, new housing permits declined in counties

experiencing a large increase in leverage from 2002 to 2006 by 75%. The decline in counties

experiencing no increase in leverage from 2002 to 2006 was only 20%. The differential only

increased from 2007 to 2008.

        Perhaps the most important measure of recession severity is the unemployment rate. The

right panel of Figure 6A shows that the rise in unemployment began much earlier in high versus

low leverage growth counties, and the subsequent increase in unemployment was much more

severe. As early as the middle of 2007, the unemployment rate had increased more sharply in

counties that had experienced the largest increase in their debt to income ratios from 2002 to

2006.

        While the unemployment rate is relatively constant in low leverage growth counties

through the third quarter of 2008, it increases sharply from the third quarter of 2008 to the

second quarter of 2009. This is similar to the pattern in auto sales. In other words, while

household leverage is strongly correlated with auto sales and unemployment through the third

quarter of 2008, all counties experience dramatic declines in auto sales and dramatic increases in

unemployment during the last part of the recession.

        Figure 6B presents the scatter plots of the relation between leverage growth from 2002 to

2006 and the change in auto sales, new housing permits, and unemployment from 2006 to 2009.

The plots show a negative correlation between leverage growth and subsequent auto sales growth

and leverage growth and subsequent new housing permit growth. The right panel shows a

positive correlation between leverage growth and subsequent increases in unemployment. The

scatter plots show a significant amount of unexplained variation, which we examine in the next

section.



                                                 18
        Table 4 presents coefficients from the first difference specification of auto sales growth

from the fourth quarter of 2006 to the second quarter of 2009 regressed on leverage growth from

2002 to 2006. The coefficient estimate in column 2 implies that a one standard deviation increase

in leverage growth from 2002 to 2006 in a county was associated with a ½ standard deviation

decrease in auto sales from 2006 to 2009. The inclusion of control variables reduces the

magnitude slightly, but the effect is still large and statistically significant. The IV specification in

column 5 yields a coefficient estimate that is substantially larger, but less precise.

        Table 5 replicates the specifications with the growth in new housing building permits

from 2006 to 2008 as the left hand side variable. The coefficient in column 2 implies that a one

standard deviation increase in leverage growth from 2002 to 2006 leads to a 1/3 standard

deviation decrease in new housing permit growth from 2006 to 2008. The inclusion of control

variables does not affect the estimate. The IV specification produces a larger coefficient, but it is

measured less precisely.

        The results on new housing building permits raise a possible “real estate construction”

channel through which household leverage affects real economic activity: the housing boom in

high leverage growth counties led to higher employment in real estate construction from 2002 to

2006, and the resulting downturn is a natural response as this sector shrinks. The coefficient

estimate in column 6 disputes this hypothesis. The estimate implies that high leverage growth

counties experienced less residential housing construction during the housing boom than low

leverage growth counties.8 This is consistent with our previous research that shows that a credit-

induced housing demand shock led to more building in elastic counties (Mian and Sufi (2009b)).

In addition, the employment share in construction and real estate as of the end of 2006 is


8
 In an unreported specification, we include census, 2001 economic condition, and 2001 industry share control
variables in the column 6 specification and find similar results.

                                                       19
included as a control variable for all economic outcomes, and this control variable does not affect

the estimated coefficient on leverage growth in any specification.

       Table 6 presents coefficients from the first difference specification of the unemployment

rate change from 2006 to 2009 regressed on leverage growth from 2002 to 2006. The coefficient

estimate in column 2 implies that a one standard deviation increase in leverage growth from

2002 to 2006 led to a 1/3 standard deviation increase in the unemployment rate during the

recession. The inclusion of control variables has almost no effect on the magnitude. The IV

estimate is even larger than the OLS estimate.

       Taken together, these results show that a county’s expansion in household leverage from

2002 to 2006 is a powerful statistical predictor of the severity and timing of the economic

downturn across U.S. counties. Counties which had experienced the largest increase in their

household debt to income ratios were precisely the counties that saw auto sales plummet and

unemployment rates increase the most.



Section 4. The Credit Crisis and the Deepening of the Recession

       Household leverage growth from 2002 to 2006 in a county is a strong predictor of the

decline in economic activity from the second quarter of 2006 to the third quarter of 2008.

Counties with modest increases in debt to income ratios from 2002 to 2006 experience almost no

decline in auto sales or increase in unemployment during the early part of the recession.

However, as Figure 6A above shows, both high and low leverage growth counties experience a

dramatic decline in auto sales and a dramatic increase in unemployment from the third quarter of

2008 to the second quarter of 2009. In this section, we explore the potential relation between

these patterns, the financial crisis, and consumer reliance on credit cards.



                                                 20
A. Credit card utilization rates

        Figure 7 presents evidence on the evolution of credit card and home equity patterns from

2005 through 2009. Availability under credit lines is a useful measure of credit supply given

evidence that total available access on a credit line reflects a bank’s willingness to lend (see

Gross and Souleles (2002)). While the size of a credit line can also reflect consumer demand, the

utilization rate (total line less borrowed portion) can offer suggestive evidence of whether supply

or demand is driving variation in credit limits. If a decline in credit limits leads to a sharp rise in

utilization rates, then the decline in credit limits is more consistent with a shift in credit supply

than credit demand. As the top left panel shows, credit card availability increased dramatically

during the early part of the recession from the fourth quarter of 2006 to the third quarter of 2008.

In other words, while home equity and mortgage credit markets became significantly tighter in

the early part of the recession, credit card availability was expanding.

        As the middle left panel shows, high leverage growth counties took advantage of these

increased limits by borrowing heavily on credit cards during the early part of the recession.

Recall that these same counties experienced a sharp increase in defaults and unemployment and a

sharp decrease in house price growth, residential investment, and auto sales during this same

time period. The sharp relative growth in credit card debt from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the

third quarter of 2008 for high leverage growth counties was either a last attempt to avoid

defaults, or a final draw down on credit cards before inevitable bankruptcy.

        As the top left panel shows, the financial crisis in the fall of 2008 led to a sharp reversal

in credit card availability. All counties faced a dramatic reduction in credit card availability,

which is consistent with a large negative aggregate credit supply shock.




                                                   21
         As shown in Figure 6A above, both high and low leverage growth counties experienced a

sharp decline in auto sales and a sharp increase in unemployment after the third quarter of 2008.

How is the large negative consumer credit supply shock shown in Figure 7 related to this

pattern? To answer this question, we sort counties based on credit card utilization rates as of the

fourth quarter of 2006. Counties with high credit card utilization rates are assumed to be more

reliant on short-term unsecured consumer credit.9

         The top panel of Figure 8 presents the correlation between the credit card utilization rate

as of 2006 and the decline in auto sales from the third quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of

2009. There appears to be a negative correlation, although there is a substantial amount of noise.

The bottom panel examines the unemployment rate increase from the third quarter of 2008 to the

second quarter of 2009. There is a very weak positive correlation between credit card utilization

and the subsequent increase in unemployment.

         Table 7 presents results relating the credit card utilization rate to changes in economic

outcomes during the recession. As column 1 of Table 7 shows, the credit card utilization rate is

not related to auto sales growth from the fourth quarter of 2006 to the third quarter of 2008. In

other words, our initial measure of household leverage appears to be the dominant force early in

the recession. In column 2, we examine auto sales growth for the entire recession; the credit card

utilization rate as of 2006 is strongly correlated with the decline in auto sales when we examine

the entire recession. The magnitude of the coefficient implies that a one standard deviation

increase in credit card utilization rates as of 2006 is associated with a 1/3 standard deviation

decrease in auto sales. Household leverage growth from 2002 to 2006 continues to be correlated

with the decline in auto sales during the recession. Column 3 includes control variables; the

9
 The correlation across counties between the increase in the debt to income ratio from 2002 to 2006 and the credit
card utilization rate as of the fourth quarter of 2006 is statistically significantly negatively correlated. As a result, we
are able to separately test the household leverage growth channel from the credit card reliant-consumer channel.

                                                            22
magnitude of the credit card utilization rate declines, but it remains negative and statistically

significant at the 10% level.

       In columns 4 through 6, we examine whether credit card utilization rates as of 2006 os

related to the drop in housing permits or the increase in unemployment. Unlike the evidence on

auto sales, we find little evidence of a correlation between credit card utilization rates and

housing construction or unemployment. In other words, there is a large fraction of unexplained

variation in housing permit growth and unemployment growth, especially after the third quarter

of 2008.

B. Alternative channels

       In this section, we consider other factors that may have been important in explaining the

cross-sectional severity of the recession across U.S. counties. It is important to emphasize that

alternative channels must be able to explain the cross-sectional patterns we observe.

       Whenever a financial crisis occurs simultaneously with a severe recession, there is a

possibility that financial market difficulties have an accelerator effect through business credit

availability and investment (Bernanke and Gertler (1989)). Indeed, the results in the previous

subsection suggest a financial accelerator effect through consumer credit supply. However, one

potential argument against our household leverage channel is a local financial accelerator effect:

household defaults in a given county led to difficulties in the local banking sector which in turn

led to a contraction of business credit. The channel was not households cutting back in the face

of enormous debt burdens and reduced credit availability; instead, financial difficulties in the

local banking sector led to the economic downturn.




                                                 23
        We examine the local financial accelerator hypothesis in Table 8.10 In columns 1 through

3, we isolate the sample to 52 counties that have banks in the county with less than 10% of their

total deposit base in the county. In other words, these counties have almost exclusively national

banks that are unlikely to have large exposure to the household defaults within the county.

Among these national bank counties, we see the exact same relation between the increase in

household leverage from 2002 to 2006 and economic outcomes from 2006 to 2009. It is difficult

to argue that local banking markets are driving the effect in these counties, given that the banks

are major national players.

        In columns 4 through 6, we include explicit control variables for charge-offs and net

income for the banks that have branches in the county. The inclusion of such control variables

does not change the coefficient estimates on leverage growth from 2002 to 2006. These results

are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the effect of household leverage on county-level

outcomes is due to a local financial accelerator operating through the business sector.

        More generally, a common argument for the severity of the recession of 2007 to 2009 is

an aggregate contraction of credit to businesses. We are skeptical of this view for a number of

reasons. First, non-residential business investment was the last main component of GDP to move

in the cycle. As Figure 4 above shows, investment in equipment in software did not register a

major decline until the fourth quarter of 2008, and the reduction in investment in structures did

not begin until the first quarter of 2009. While the drop in investment in the last part of the

recession may have been due to harsh credit conditions, it is just as likely that businesses cut

investment in response to the dramatic reduction in consumption.

  Deposit data by county for each bank is constructed using the FDIC Summary of Deposit data. Data on charge-
offs and net income is from Call Report data.

                                                      24
         Second, businesses were in a much healthier financial situation than consumers as of the

third quarter of 2008 when the credit crisis began. Indeed, the corporate debt to income ratio

increased only moderately leading up to the recession (Mian and Sufi (2009b)). A large body of

research documents how businesses used large revolving credit facilities extended during the

credit boom to mitigate the impact of the credit crunch (Ivashina and Scharfstein (2009), Gao

and Yun (2009), Chari, Christiano, and Kehoe (2008)). Survey evidence also suggests that there

was absolutely no evidence of a credit crunch to small businesses through September 2008

(Dunkelburg (2008)).

         Third, while consumer defaults have skyrocketed above any level in recent history, direct

measures of corporate distress were relatively low compared to the 2001 recession, even in the

heart of the credit crunch in the fall of 2008. Figure 9 shows the fraction of public firms that are

in violation of a financial covenant in any debt agreement (top panel) and the fraction of public

firms in payment default of debt agreements (bottom panel).11 For the 2008 fiscal year (which

covers firms filing their 10-K at any point from July 2008 to June 2009), the fraction of firms

that violated a financial covenant is much lower than during the recession of 2001. While

corporate defaults did eventually skyrocket in the second quarter of 2009, these defaults occurred

very late in the recession. As of the fourth quarter of 2008, corporate defaults were much lower

than during the years around the 2001 recession. Both covenant violation and default patterns

suggest that firms faced less distress than they did in the relatively mild recession of 2001.



Section 5. How Much of the Recession Does Our Model of Household Leverage Explain?




11
  The covenant violation data are described in detail in Nini, Smith, and Sufi (2009). The corporate default data are
from Moody’s Default and Recovery Database.

                                                         25
        The severity of the 2007 to 2009 recession is reflected in four aggregate facts: (i) there

was an extraordinary rise in household defaults from 4.1% to 9.7%, (ii) homeowners experienced

a 21% drop in house prices, (iii) consumers pulled back sharply on durable consumption, which

we proxy for with the 36% drop in auto sales, and (iv) the unemployment rate jumped from 4.2%

to 9.8%.12

        How much of these four factors can the growth in household leverage from 2002 to 2006

and the level of consumer reliance on credit card borrowing as of 2006 explain? In other words,

can the cross-sectional variation in these two measures of household leverage explain most of the

aggregate fluctuations listed above?

        A simple answer to this question is given by the predicted fluctuations for counties that

score very low on our two measures of household leverage.13 For example, if household leverage

growth from 2002 to 2006 were the only factor responsible for the dramatic increase in defaults,

then we would predict zero increase in defaults for counties with no growth in leverage from

2002 to 2006. Using this methodology, our first factor – the growth in household leverage from

2002 to 2006 – accounts for almost the entire increase in household defaults and the entire

decline in house prices. This can be seen in column 2 of Tables 2 and 3 where the constant in

univariate regressions is very close to zero and precisely estimated.14

        The constant in column 2 of Table 4 suggests that the leverage growth from 2002 to 2006

alone is not sufficient to explain the entire drop in auto sales from the end of 2006 to 2009. The

regression predicts a 15% drop in auto sales even in counties for which there was no increase in


12
   All of these numbers are calculated using our sample.
13
   By using predicted values, this magnitude assessment ignores unexplained (residual) variation. In other words, we
compare magnitudes by using the economic outcomes that our model predicts for counties with varying degrees of
household leverage, and ignoring any “unexplained” variation not predicted by our model.
14
   Counties in the lowest leverage growth decile have a change in the debt to income ratio from 2002 to 2006 just
above zero. The constant therefore represents an in sample prediction for these lowest decile leverage growth
counties.

                                                        26
household leverage. Given an average drop in auto sales of 36%, this estimate implies that our

first factor cannot explain 42% (= 15/36) of the overall drop in auto sales.

         However, the specification reported in column 2 of Table 7 shows that adding our second

factor – the credit card utilization rate as of 2006 – significantly adds to our predictive power of

explaining the auto sales decline. How much of the overall decline in auto sales can our two

combined factors explain? This question can be answered by looking at the predicted auto sales

decline for counties that score low on both household leverage growth and the credit card

utilization rates. Counties in the bottom decile of household leverage growth from 2002 to 2006

and credit card utilization rate in 2006 have mean values for these two variables of 0.166 and

0.198, respectively. Using the coefficient estimates from column 2 of Table 7, the predicted auto

sales decline for a county in the lowest decile of both our factors is 3.5% (= -0.281*0.166-

3.051*0.198+0.616). In other words, our model predicts almost no change in auto sales in the

absence of the observed changes in leverage growth and the credit card utilization rate.15

         Comparatively, our measures of household leverage within the model cannot explain as

much of the aggregate rise in unemployment. For example, the estimates in column 2 of Table 6

imply that even counties with no increase in household leverage from 2002 to 2006 would have

seen a rise in unemployment of 4.7%. Household leverage growth therefore explains only 1.1%

of the 5.6% increase in aggregate unemployment. The estimates in column 6 of Table 7 show

that the credit card utilization rate does not add much power in explaining the rise in

unemployment.




15
  We focus on the lowest decile counties, because we prefer to avoid out of sample predictions. We should point out
however, that household leverage growth and credit card utilization rates are strongly negatively correlated with a
correlation coefficient of -0.31. Nonetheless there exist counties that lie in the intersection of bottom deciles for the
two factors.

                                                           27
       However, the limitation of our cross-sectional measures of household leverage in

explaining the aggregate rise in unemployment should not be seen as a failure of household

leverage itself. Our earlier results – as well as aggregate patterns - show that a large part of the

decline in GDP is driven by a drop in consumption, and in particular durable consumption. The

drop is much more pronounced in areas that were more levered, either in terms of leverage

growth or dependence on credit card borrowing. However, production of consumer goods is

often not in the same county where consumers are located. As a result, we would naturally

expect unemployment to be more evenly distributed across the country, even if household

leverage is the underlying cause of the rise in unemployment. For example, a decline in auto

sales due to high leverage growth in Florida and California would naturally lead to higher

unemployment in other states such as Alabama and Michigan.

       As a cautionary note, our exercise is not meant to argue that household leverage

“predicts” recessions. Instead, we examine only one recession. In this recession, our cross-

sectional statistical model predicts that the increase in mortgage defaults and the decline in house

prices and durable consumption would have been largely avoided had counties had low measures

of household leverage as of 2006.



Section 6. Conclusion

        Understanding economic fluctuations is a central goal of macroeconomics. Our results

suggest that the sharp increase in household leverage from 2002 to 2006 is closely linked to the

2007 to 2009 economic recession. Other factors in the financial markets—such as banks’

liquidity, the Lehman bankruptcy, and policy uncertainty—may have contributed to the size of

the downturn. However, our evidence lends support to the hypothesis that the initial economic



                                                  28
slowdown was a result of a highly-leveraged household sector unable to keep pace with its debt

obligations.

       Our results are consistent with the following interpretation: As homeowners realized that

house price appreciation was no longer sufficient to roll over existing debt, they borrowed

aggressively from their existing unsecured credit limits, started to default, and, most importantly,

cut back on durable consumption. These patterns began around the middle of 2006, well before

the financial market turmoil of August 2007 or the deeper meltdown of the fall of 2008.

       Our interpretation of the evidence is consistent with two other studies that rely on cross-

sectional variation in household leverage. King (1994) examines GDP growth across western

countries in the 1990 to 1991 recession and finds evidence that countries with higher household

debt to GDP ratios before the recession had more severe declines in GDP. Glick and Lansing

(2010) conduct a similar exercise for the 2007 to 2009 recession and find similar results. The

similarity of the cross-sectional evidence in these three different settings is strongly indicative of

a close link between household leverage and economic downturns. The weight of the evidence

suggests the need for more theoretical and empirical research on this potential channel.

The left panel presents the correlation across U.S. counties of the increase in the household debt to income ratio from 2002Q4 to 2006Q4 and the decline in auto
sales from 2006Q4 to 2009Q2. The middle panel presents the correlation of the increase in the household debt to income ratio from 2002Q4 to 2006Q4 and the
growth in housing permits from 2006 to 2008. The right panel presents the correlation across U.S. counties of the increase in the household debt to income ratio
from 2002Q4 to 2006Q4 and the increase in unemployment rates from 2006Q2 to 2009Q2. All y axis variables are winsorized at the 1% level. The sample
includes 450 counties with at least 50,000 households as of 2000.

High leverage growth counties are defined to be the top 10% of counties by the increase in the debt to income ratio
from 2002Q4 to 2006Q4. Low leverage growth counties are in the bottom 10% on the same measure. The panels of
this figure present evidence on home equity and credit card limits, draw-downs, and utilization rates from 2004Q4 to
2009Q2 for high and low leverage growth counties.

The regression in columns 2 through 5 are weighted by the number of households in the county as of 2000. Column
5 reports coefficients from the second stage of an IV specification where the change in the debt to income ratio from
2002 to 2006 is instrumented with housing supply inelasticity of the county as constructed by Saiz (2008). Standard
errors are clustered by state.

The regression in columns 2 through 5 are weighted by the number of households in the county as of 2000. Column
5 reports coefficients from the second stage of an IV specification where the change in the debt to income ratio from
2002 to 2006 is instrumented with housing supply inelasticity of the county as constructed by Saiz (2008). Standard
errors are clustered by state.

                       Consumer Credit Constraints and the Deepening of the Recession from 2008Q3 to 2009Q2
This table presents coefficient estimates of the effect of credit card utilization rates on auto sales and unemployment. Column 3 (4) restricts the sample to firms in
the bottom (top) decile counties of the change in debt to income from 2002 to 2006 distribution. The specification reported in column 3 includes the following
control variables: the unemployment rate as of 2001Q4 and 2006Q4, the fraction of population that is black, the fraction of homeowners, the fraction with a high
school education or less, and the fraction of employment in construction, real estate, finance, retail and export industries. All regressions are weighted by the
number of households and standard errors are clustered by state.

                     Can the Effect of Household Leverage on Recession Severity be Due to Local Banking Effects?
The coefficient estimates reported in columns 1 through 3 are from specifications that isolate the sample to counties where the banks have less than 10% of their
deposits within the same county. Columns 4 through 6 report coefficient estimates from specifications that include measures of bank performance within the
county. All specifications are weighted by the number of households in the county as of 2000. Standard errors are clustered by state.
