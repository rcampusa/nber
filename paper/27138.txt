                                          ABSTRACT

We study the effects of the temporary federal paid sick leave mandate that became effective April
1st, 2020 on ‘social distancing,’ as proxied by individuals’ physical mobility behavior gleaned
from cellular devices. The national paid leave policy was implemented in response to the
COVID-19 outbreak and provided many private and public workers with up to two weeks of paid
leave for own or family illness or dependent care. We study the impact of this policy using
difference-in-differences methods leveraging pre-FFCRA county-level differences in the share of
workers likely eligible for FFCRA benefits. We find that FFCRA increased the average number
of hours at home, and reduced the share of the individuals likely at work. In particular, comparing
the county with the lowest to highest FFCRA exposure, we find that the average daily hours at
home per day increased 4.2% while the average hours not at home per day and working decreased
by 7.7% and 6.1% post-policy.

1. Introduction

         As of October 2nd, 2020 there were over 34 million confirmed global cases of the novel

coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and more than one million deaths (World Health Organization

2020b). The United States, the focus of our study, accounts for 21% of confirmed cases and

20% of deaths globally. COVID-19 is a viral disease caused by infection with the virus SARS-

CoV-2. Infected individuals are contagious for a period of up to 14 days and before displaying

symptoms (e.g., dry cough and fever), thus increasing the importance of strategies to enable sick

workers to remain at home.

         Currently, there is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19. 1 Thus, public health measures are

therefore the primary means to mitigate disease spread. The World Health Organization suggests

that individuals infected with or exposed to COVID-19 self-isolate for 14 days, and all people

(symptomatic and non-symptomatic) practice social distancing. A study using Israeli data

collected in the lead-up to the COVID-19 outbreak shows that 97% of adults report that they

would comply with a government mandate to self-quarantine if their wages were compensated,

but compliance falls to 57% without compensation (Bodas and Peleg 2020), suggesting the

importance of financial protection for effective containment of COVID-19.

         The U.S. does not have a universal, national paid sick leave (PSL) policy. Thus, how

effectively the country may be able to advance a meaningful mitigation strategy based on

isolation among infected individuals is unclear. Indeed, working while sick is common in the




1
  At the time of writing, there are ongoing clinical trials for potential vaccines and therapies. See, for example, the
World Health Organization (2020c) listing of potential vaccines. Early data suggests that the drug Remdesivir may
reduce mortality risk and time to recovery (National Institutes of Health 2020; Beigel et al. 2020). On May 1st,
2020, the Food and Drug Agency approved through an emergency use authorization Remdesivir to treat hospitalized
COVID-19 patients with severe disease and on August 28th, 2020 the Agency expanded this approval to include all
hospitalized adult and pediatric patients, regardless of disease severity (Food and Drug Administration 2020).

                                                          2
U.S.: pre-COVID-19 survey data suggest that 90% of workers report coming to work while sick

(Accountemps 2019), possibly due to fear of income or job loss.

         In response to the surge in confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, the U.S. federal

government adopted a temporary national PSL policy: the Families First Coronavirus Response

Act (FFCRA) on March 18th, 2020 (116th Congress of the United States 2020). This Act, which

became effective April 1st, 2020 and will sunset at the end of 2020, compels many private and

public employers to offer up to two weeks of temporary emergency sick leave to workers for

COVID-19-related treatment, isolation, childcare due to school/daycare closures, or care for

dependents impacted by COVID-19. The objective of this Act is to provide financial support to

stay home for those with COVID-19 or caring for children/dependents during the pandemic, and

ultimately reduce disease spread within the population.

         We provide the first evidence on the impact of the federal FFCRA on ‘physical mobility’

measured using GPS tracking of cellular devices. Specifically, we consider cellular device

movements that plausibly reflect the time individuals spend in their homes and at work. We

view these variables as proxies for individuals’ social distancing and quarantining behaviors, in

particular the ability to stay at home from work when sick, watching children whose school or

daycare is closed due to COVID-19 reasons, or when caring for a dependent who is sick. 2 We

exploit the fact that ‘essential workers’ – e.g., healthcare workers and those working in food

services – are exempt from FFCRA benefits and that the share of such workers varies across U.S.

counties. This variation allows us to estimate a modified difference-in-differences style (DD)

model that leverages differential treatment ‘doses’ based variation in the share of the county


2
 In particular, we consider our measures to be proxy measures for social distancing, but not physical distancing,
which is the requirement to stay at least six feet apart from those outside your household. Social distancing
encompasses more than just physical distancing and one may engage in physical distancing, but not social
distancing. In our data, this kind of behavior would be captured as a violation of social distancing.

                                                          3
workforce that is employed in an ‘essential’ job. The intuition of this empirical strategy is that

counties with higher shares of non-essential workers pre-FFCRA should be more exposed to the

policy than counties with lower shares. We find that FFCRA increases the average number of

hours at home, and reduces the average hours away from home and the share of people likely at

work (i.e., away from their home for eight or more hours per day). In particular, post-FFCRA

comparing the county with the lowest share of non-essential workers in our data to the county

with the highest share of non-essential workers, the average number of hours at home increases

(compared to pre-FFCRA values) by 4.2% while the average number of hours away from home

decreases by 7.7% and the share of individuals away from home for more than eight hours per

day declines by 6.1%. These results are confirmed through event-study comparisons -- the

differences between highly exposed counties and counties with limited exposure are none-

existent prior to policy, and increase starkly after the policy start date, and through placebo

testing against 2019 data and numerous other robustness checks.

       The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly outlines the related literatures on

PSL mandates and COVID-19. FFCRA is discussed in Section 3. Data, variables, and methods

are described in Section 4. Results are listed in Section 5 and Section 6 concludes.

2. Related literature

2.1. PSL mandate effects

       Several studies examine the effect of PSL mandates on labor market outcomes. Many of

the early studies focus on Europe, where mandates have been in place for longer relative to

newer state and local mandates in the U.S. Mandated PSL generosity in Sweden and Italy

increases work absences (Henrekson and Persson 2004; Scognamiglio 2019). Puhani and

Sonderhof (2010), Ziebarth and Karlsson (2010), and Ziebarth and Karlsson (2014) investigate



                                                  4
German legislation that decreased sick pay from 100% to 80% of wages for two years, and then

reinstated wages to 100%. Sick days decreased by 2.4 days during the two-year period in which

PSL benefits were less generous (Puhani and Sonderhof 2010), and 6% to 8% more workers

reported taking no days off work during this time (Ziebarth and Karlsson 2010). Finally, one

study finds that sickness leave payments incentivize the length of sickness absence, with higher

wage replacement rates increasing absences (Böckerman, Kanninen, and Suoniemi 2018).

       In the U.S., studies find that PSL mandates increase PSL coverage, especially for workers

in industries historically lacking such benefits (Maclean, Pichler, and Ziebarth 2020; Callison

and Pesko 2020). These mandates do not reduce employment, wages, or non-mandated benefits

(Maclean, Pichler, and Ziebarth 2020; Pichler and Ziebarth 2020). However, PSL mandates

increase workplace absences overall (Maclean, Pichler, and Ziebarth 2020; Callison and Pesko

2020; Schneider 2020; Colla et al. 2014; Ahn and Yelowitz 2016), and several studies are able to

evaluate heterogeneity in which types of workplace absences increase post-mandate. Stearns and

White (2018) find that PSL mandates adopted in Connecticut and Washington, DC increase

illness-related work absences, but do not increase work absences for non-illness reasons (e.g.,

childcare). Callison and Pesko (2020) do not find evidence that PSL mandates increase work

absences nationally for own illness, but the authors document increases in leave-taking for a

broader group of absences including child care problems or other personal/family obligations,

and these effects were disproportionately higher for households with children. One possible

explanation is that PSL mandates are used to care for a sick child. Additionally, Callison and

Pesko (2020) find evidence that PSL mandates reduce presenteeism (i.e., working while sick) by

4.5 percentage points (ppts). A study shows that the Washington state PSL mandate reduces

presenteeism by eight ppts for workers in the retail and food service industries (Schneider 2020).



                                                5
       A few studies examine the effect of PSL mandates on measures of health or healthcare

utilization. The temporary decrease in the generosity of German PSL mandate reduced

hospitalizations and hospital visits but had no effect on self-reported health (Puhani and

Sonderhof 2010). Similarly, restoring the PSL mandate generosity had no effect on self-reported

health satisfaction (Ziebarth and Karlsson 2014). Pichler and Ziebarth (2017) use high-

frequency Google influenza data in the U.S. to show that population-level influenza-like disease

rates (as measured by searches related to the illness or its symptoms) decrease after workers gain

access to PSL following mandate adoption, suggesting PSL mandates have positive spillover

effects by preventing the disease spread. In a follow-up study using administrative data on

physician-certified influenza, Pichler, Wen, and Ziebarth (2020) confirm this finding.

2.2. Analyses of COVID-19 and associated policies

       There is a rapidly emerging literature evaluating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and

associated policies on economic and health outcomes. Fully describing this literature is beyond

the scope of our study. Instead, we mention a few studies that investigate the effect of the

pandemic and legislation this virus has precipitated on social distancing-related behaviors. We

also refer readers to an excellent review of COVID-19 studies by Brodeur et al. (2020).

       An early study finds that the full lockdown of Wuhan, China (the city in which the virus

was first identified) reduced the flows of people into, out of and with Wuhan, thus reducing

infections outside of that city (Fang, Wang, and Yang 2020). Another study using Chinese data

finds that mandatory, but not voluntary, social distancing is effective in flattening the pandemic

curve (Chudik, Pesaran, and Rebucci 2020).

       A U.S. study uses aggregate human mobility and location trends published by Google for

the month of March 2020 to explore the effect of six different types of orders: statewide stay-at-



                                                 6
home order, other stay home orders, non-essential business closure, large gatherings ban, school

closure, and restaurant/bar limits (Abouk and Heydari 2020). State-wide stay-at-home orders

appear to have the largest effect on reducing mobility.

       Sehra et al. (2020) use Google data and demonstrate that reductions in mobility (captured

by the movement of cellular devices) are associated with a lower incidence of COVID-19 cases

after five, ten, and 15 days. Effects are particularly pronounced in areas that continued to have

high rates of mobility to retail establishments and workplaces, and on transit systems.

Conversely, localities with higher rates of individuals staying in residential areas experience

lower confirmed COVID-19 case growth.

       Several studies use SafeGraph data (the same data that we use in our analysis) to assess

the impact of policies and area-level demographics on social distancing. Income and high-speed

internet predict people’s ability to obey social distancing directives (Chiou and Tucker 2020).

People living in areas with more Republicans engage in less social distancing behaviors that

residents in other areas (Allcott et al. 2020; Andersen 2020). Gupta et al. (2020) estimate that a

state or county policy change or informational event each reduces mobility by 2% to 8%, with

policies of a more information nature explaining in total up to half of the declines in mobility

experienced from early March to early April 2020.

       Friedson et al. (2020) show that California’s stay-at-home order – the first such policy in

the U.S. – was effective in encouraging people to remain in their homes. The policy also

reduced COVID-19 cases and deaths, but lead to job losses. Early stay-at-home orders and those

adopted in high population-density localities appear to be the most impactful (Dave, Friedson,

Matsuzawa, and Sabia 2020). Courtemanche et al. (2020) use administrative data to show that

Kentucky’s stay-at-home order reduced the number of confirmed cases in that state relative to



                                                 7
other Southern and Midwest states. Lyu and Wehby (2020) estimate the effects of state-level

mandates that require individuals to wear face coverings or masks when in public; covering the

face can reduce disease spread, in particular when social distancing is not feasible. The authors

demonstrate that mandates reduce the number of cases by 2.0 ppts three weeks post-mandate.

       Several studies examine the impact of large public gatherings on disease spread. There is

heterogeneity in COVID-19 effects with some gatherings increasing confirmed cases (Dave,

Friedson, McNichols, et al. 2020) and others not leading to substantial changes (Dave, Friedson,

Matsuzawa, Sabia, et al. 2020). Public gatherings differ in terms of social distancing and mask-

wearing – both among gathering participants and non-participants (i.e., local residents), and

along with other factors that may impact disease spread, leaving to heterogeneous effects.

       Overall, studies suggest that government policies that target social distancing policies

(e.g., staying at home) and mask wearing in public places reduce disease spread. Further,

voluntary actions by individuals also play an important role.

3. U.S. paid sick leave and policies

3.1. PSL coverage in the U.S., and state and local paid sick leave mandates

       Providing PSL benefits have largely been left to employers in the U.S. In March 2019,

76% of civilian workers had access to PSL through their employer, ranging from 73% among

private workers to 91% of government workers (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020a). The average

number of PSL days available to workers was eight days per year in 2019 (Bureau of Labor

Statistics 2020b), thus less than the recommended 14 days of self-quarantine recommended

following exposure to an individual infected with COVID-19.

       These averages conceal substantial heterogeneity in access to PSL (see Appendix Table

1; based on tabulations listed in Bureau of Labor Statistics (2020a)). The PSL coverage rate is



                                                8
94% among workers in management, business, and financial occupations while the rate is 59%

among workers in construction, extraction, farming, fishing, and forestry occupations. 86% of

full-time workers have access to PSL and 43% of part time workers have access, and coverage

rates are 94% among the highest 10% of wage earners and 31% among the lowest 10% of wage

earners. The coverage rate among large employers (500 or more workers) is 91% while the

coverage rate is 64% among small employers (50 or fewer workers). 3

        The general pattern that emerges from Appendix Table 1 is that workers in ‘good jobs’ –

i.e., prestigious, full-time, and high wage jobs at larger employers– are more likely to have

access to PSL than other workers. As documented by Maclean, Pichler, and Ziebarth (2020),

coverage rates are particularly low in the food preparation and serving occupations (25%), and

retail trade (53%) and accommodation and food services (27%) industries. Low coverage rates

in these segments of the labor market are troubling in the context of disease spread given the

substantial face-to-face contact between workers and clients involved in such jobs.

        Beginning with San Francisco, California in February 2007, 34 U.S. localities have

passed mandates to expand access to PSL among workers, see Appendix Table 2 (A Better

Balance 2020). 4 Eleven of the mandates are at the state-level. All PSL policies are employer

mandates. While the specifics vary across PSL mandate, in general the mandates to date require

workers to work for a specified period of time with the employer before gaining eligibility to the

benefit. Most mandates compel private employers to provide approximately seven days of PSL

annually, unused days can be rolled over to the next calendar year. There are exemptions to PSL



3
  Using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), Callison and Pesko (2020) find below the mean
PSL coverage rates for workers in the agriculture/forestry/fishing, construction, arts/entertainment, and
accommodation/food services industries.
4
  Other localities have proposed PSL legislation. For example, on August 31st, 2020 the Governor of Pennsylvania
called for that state’s General Assembly to pass PSL legislation (https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/gov-wolf-
calls-for-paid-sick-and-family-leave-for-workers/; last accessed October 2nd, 2020).

                                                       9
mandates. Small employers are often exempt, and some mandates exclude entire industries. Of

note, the benefits conferred by state and local PSL mandates -- up to seven days (A Better

Balance 2020) -- are likely not sufficient to allow for effective isolation in the context of

COVID-19. Further, many workers may not have worked at their employer long enough to have

accrued a meaningful amount of PSL and/or workers may have ‘used up’ PSL pre-pandemic as

anticipating the severity of COVID-19 was not likely feasible.

3.2. FFCRA

        FFCRA compels certain private employers with less than 500 workers and some public

employers to offer temporary paid leave to workers (Federal Resgister 2020). 5 FFCRA applies

to the gig economy (e.g., Uber) but exempts many small employers with fewer than 50 workers.

Qualifying reasons for PSL include: (i) worker is subject to a Federal, state, or local quarantine

or isolation order; (ii) a healthcare professional has recommended that the worker self-

quarantine; (iii) the worker is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or similar symptoms and is

currently seeking a diagnosis from a healthcare professional; (iv) the worker is caring for an

individual(s) subject to (i) or (ii); and (v) the worker is caring for a child whose school or

daycare is closed, or whose childcare provider is not available for reasons related to COVID-19.

Early estimates suggest that FFCRA will cover 17% to 47% of U.S. workers (Glynn 2020).

        FFCRA provides eligible workers who are unable to work because they are in quarantine

or are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and seeking a diagnosis with two weeks (up to a

maximum of 80 hours) of PSL at the worker’s regular rate of pay or the applicable minimum

wage (whichever is higher), up to a maximum of $511 per day. Workers who are caring for

children whose schools or daycares have closed due to COVID-19 or who are tending to


5
  We are not aware of data on the number of individuals who have taken up FFCRA benefits. We suspect that the
lack of data is attributable to the newness of this policy.

                                                      10
dependents with COVID-19 are eligible for two weeks (up to a maximum of 80 hours) of PSL at

two-thirds of the worker’s regular rate of pay, or the applicable minimum wage, up to $200 per

day. Employers initially pay the benefits, but later receive federal reimbursable tax credits

(Internal Revenue Service 2020). There is no accrual period for FFCRA benefits.

           Additional benefits are available to some workers who have worked for the employer for

more than 30 days under The Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act (EFMLEA),

which predates COVID-19 and extends Title I of the Family and Medical Leave Act, an Act that

provides unpaid leave to qualifying workers. Such workers are eligible for an additional ten

weeks of paid expanded family and medical leave at two-thirds the worker’s regular rate of pay

if the worker is not able to work due to COVID-19 symptoms and/or must care for a child whose

school or daycare is closed, or childcare provider is not available (Department of Labor 2020).

Employers must post notices in the workplace such that employees know about the benefit.

           Thus, FFCRA is arguably more generous, in terms of covered workers and benefits, than

state and local PSLMs described in Section 3.1. However, the federal Act is temporary, is

limited to COVID-19 sickness and responsibilities, arguably affects different workers and

employers than the PSL mandates, and is implemented during a global pandemic. Thus, the

extent to which we can extrapolate from previous PSL work to FFCRA is unclear.

           Of particular relevance to our study, ‘essential workers’ are exempt from receiving

FFCRA benefits (Federal Resgister 2020). President Trump, through an executive order, used

the Defense Production Act to compel essential workers to continue to work during the pandemic

and thus such workers are not eligible for FFCRA benefits. The Department of Labor (DOL) has

not explicitly defined an ‘essential worker.’6 Within the FFCRA legislation, the DOL states that



6
    The DOL uses the term ‘essential responder.’ We use the common colloquial term ‘essential worker.’

                                                         11
essential workers are individuals who ‘(1) interact with and aid individuals with physical or

mental health issues, including those who are or may be suffering from COVID-19; (2) ensure

the welfare and safety of our communities and of our Nation; (3) have specialized training

relevant to emergency response; and (4) provide essential services relevant to the American

people's health and wellbeing’ (Federal Resgister 2020). The DOL delegates the exact definition

of essential workers to states: ‘Therefore, the definition allows for the highest official of a state

or territory to identify other categories of emergency responders, as necessary’ (Federal

Resgister 2020). As we discuss in Section 4.3, we use a definition of essential workers

developed by Blau, Koebe, and Meyerhofer (2020), and leverage differences across counties in

the share of the workforce that is likely classified as a non-essential worker. 7

           FFCRA is designed to provide paid leave for both workers who become infected with

COVID-19 (or have good reason to believe that they may be infected) and workers who must

care for dependents impacted by COVID-19 (e.g., children who cannot attend school due to

closures and/or who are themselves ill with the virus). We are not able to study the reasons why

physical mobility – which we observe as a cellular device in a particular location – may change

post-FFCRA. Thus, we cannot assess – if we observe changes in device locations – whether

individual behaviors are altered by FFCRA. Nonetheless, we contend that any reductions are

useful in mitigating COVID-19 spread. On the one hand, if an individual with COVID-19 (or

who has good reason to believe she is infected with the virus) is able to stay home from work,

this change should directly allow the individual to comply with CDC guidelines and thus reduce

spread. Similarly, if an individual is caring for a dependent with COVID-19, that individual is

exposed to the virus through the dependent and staying home from work should reduce spread.



7
    We note that employers with less than 50 workers or 500 or more workers are also exempt in from FFCRA.

                                                        12
Finally, allowing a parent/guardian to take time away from work without losing pay can prevent

a child whose school or daycare is closed due to COVID-19 from being placed in an alternative

care setting (e.g., with a babysitter outside the household); reducing such interactions with ‘new

people’ outside the immediate household is recommend by CDC to minimize the spread of

COVID-19. For these reasons, we suspect that reductions in physical mobility that we consider

could allow, to varying degrees, the U.S. to establish a more effective COVID-19 response.

4. Data, outcome variables, and methods

4.1. SafeGraph Inc.

           We use aggregated, high frequency geolocation data from SafeGraph Inc. (a company

that aggregates anonymized location data from numerous cellular applications) covering the

period covering March 13th, 2020 through April 30th, 2020 on a daily basis. 8 We exclude earlier

days in March given that multiple policies were adopted and information related to COVID-19

became available during this period. March 13th, 2020 was also the date on which President

Trump declared a national emergency (Federal Emergency Management Agency 2020) and

potentially reflects a meaningful change in the understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic among

Americans. We close the study period on April 30th, 2020 as several states began the process of

re-opening their economy in early May 2020 (The Council of State Governments 2020).

However, as we show in robustness checking (Section 5.7), our results are not sensitive to

alternative study start and end dates.

           SafeGraph data cover over 20 million cellular devices and are freely available to

researchers. These data allow us to accurately locate individual cellular devices and track the

share of devices that leave the home area in near real-time, and are therefore ideal for our study.

SafeGraph identifies locations for a device using a GeoHash-7 encoding algorithm that covers

the globe with a grid that is approximately 500 feet per side. Devices are included in the sample

if SafeGraph can identify a home location for the device, which requires a device to be on and

consistently present at a location during nighttime hours for a six week period. Because

SafeGraph data are based on users of cellular applications who have opted in to location sharing,

the number of devices in the sample changes over time. 9 Given our short study period, the

above-noted six week requirement, and the kinds of applications that provide location data, we

do not expect that the sample of cellular devices to be a function of FFCRA implementation.

         SafeGraph excludes Census block group information with fewer than five active devices

on a given day. We aggregate the number of active devices in each county, the average time

devices remained at home or away, 10 and the fraction of devices that were away for eight or

more hours, from census block groups to the relevant county. To isolate FFCRA effects, in our

main analysis we use counties that were not covered by a PSL mandate prior to FFCRA (A

Better Balance 2020). Appendix Table 2 lists localities with a pre-FFCRA PSL mandate. The

study sample includes 2,757 counties and county equivalents out of a total of 3,143 in the

country; we do not differentiate between counties and equivalents. 11 We observe each county in

each of the 48 days in our study period, thus the sample is balanced, but we exclude weekends as

most work and school/daycare activities occur within the standard work week (although as we

show in robustness checking in Section 5.7, results are not sensitive to including such days).


9
  Examples of application types include weather and mobile retail applications. As such devices are likely actively
transmitting their locations throughout the day if a device is moving.
10
   SafeGraph reports median hours. Given this data reporting structure, we calculate mean time at home and away
from binned data using the midpoints of the bins.
11
   One may view counties with a pre-FFCRA PSL mandate as a potential comparison group that could be leveraged
in a reverse DD specification (Gruber 1994). However, the pre-FFCRA policies are quite different in terms of the
workers covered, conditions for which the benefits can be used, duration of benefits, accrual period, and the fact that
state and local PSL mandates are permanent pieces of legislation while FFCRA is a temporary policy which expires
at the end of 2020. For these reasons, we are not confident in estimating such a reverse DD specification.

                                                          14
4.2. Outcomes

        We consider three physical mobility outcomes. We view these outcomes as proxies for

the ability to remain at home while sick and/or caring for dependents during COVID-19, all of

which should help mitigate the spread of the disease. While ideally we would specifically

measure time at work for individual workers, such data are not available at the high-frequency

level, and in a very recent time period, required for our empirical strategy (see Section 4.3).

        The measures we consider are based on movement of cellular devices within U.S.

counties and may therefore not fully reflect physical mobility patterns of individuals. 12 We

measure the average number of hours per day that the cellular device spends (i) at home and (ii)

not at home in each county. We also examine the share of devices that are not at home more

than eight hours per day; we select eight hours as this duration plausibly captures a work or

daycare/school day, both of these behaviors could be impacted by FFCRA as the policy provides

benefits for parents/guardians who are caring for children not at daycare/school or who are

sick. 13 Thus, while we use terms such as ‘individual’ when discussing our results, we note that

we are in fact tracking cellular devices which are, presumably, carried by an individual.

        We note that our variables that relate to time away from home do not necessarily isolate

time at work and such time could be used for other activities conducted away from home (e.g.,

healthcare needs, shopping). We suspect that, after conditioning on social distancing policies

and other controls (see Section 4.3), we are able to, at least partially, net out other behaviors.


12
   For example, if an individual does not take their cellular device with them when they left their home for work,
then we will not capture this working behavior and instead we would, erroneously code this individual as at home.
We cannot envision any reason why the propensity to carry a cellular device, vs. leaving the device at home, should
be correlated with FFCRA implementation over our relatively short study period. We note that in an earlier version
of this manuscript we used alternative proxies. Previously SafeGraph constructed a measure they deemed ‘time at
work.’ However, this measure is now viewed by SafeGraph as unreliable due to an error in how visit duration (time
spent at one location) is calculated. Hence, we no longer examine this outcome.
13
   Individuals must be 13 years or older to be included in the SafeGraph sample. Thus, elementary and middle
school students are not included in the sample, but high school and college students may be included.

                                                        15
Further, other activities should not be expected to change discretely on the FFCRA effective

date. Our measure that captures cellular devices that are away from the home more than eight

hours per day is constructed to mimic a standard working day. Nonetheless, we acknowledge

that our measures may capture other non-work activities that take place away from the

SafeGraph-defined home. For example, traveling to the hospital to see a sick child or dependent.

4.3. Methods

        To estimate FFCRA effects, we estimate a modified DD-style model (Alpert, Powell, and

Pacula 2018; Courtemanche et al. 2017; Powell and Pacula 2020; Finkelstein 2007; Beheshti

2019; Powell, Alpert, and Pacula 2019; Argys et al. 2020; Park and Powell 2020). This model

leverages variation in treatment intensity that is attributable to differences in pre-treatment

characteristics across counties. The intuition is that we should observe a larger effects of

FFCRA, in terms of our physical mobility measures, in counties which at baseline had higher

shares of non-essential workers pre-FFCRA as these are the workers who are potentially eligible

for policy benefits. Put differently, there is likely to be more policy ‘bite’ in such counties as a

greater share of the workforce is eligible for FFCRA benefits.

        In particular, we interact an indicator for the post-FFCRA period (April 1st, 2020 through

April 30th, 2020) with the share of workers in a county employed in a ‘non-essential worker’ job

in the first quarter of 2019 using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of

Employment and Wages (QCEW). The QCEW captures the near universe of establishments in

the U.S. An establishment as: ‘A single physical location where business is conducted or where

services or industrial operations are performed.’ A limitation of our approach is that we use

establishments rather than workers themselves to proxy non-essential workers. 14 While not an


14
  While the QCEW contains some information on the number of workers, there is substantial suppression at the
county-industry level due to privacy concerns. Hence, we cannot use this information.

                                                      16
ideal proxy, we note that this approach is common in the COVID-19 literature to date (Brodeur

et al. 2020). Essential workers are not eligible for FFCRA benefits and counties with greater

shares of non-essential workers should be more exposed to the policy and, correspondingly if

FFCRA impacts our proxies, should experience larger changes in outcomes post-policy. The

DOL has not established a definition of essential workers, but instead provides a high-level

description and leaves the final decisions on how to define this construct to states. There is

heterogeneity across states (but not across counties within a state) in the effective definition. In

our main analysis, we follow the definition outlined by Blau, Koebe, and Meyerhofer (2020),

although our results are robust to using an alternative definition. 15

         The regression model for our modified DD-style model is outlined in Equation (1):

(1)     𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 = 𝜋𝜋0 + 𝜋𝜋1 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡 ∗ 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 − 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠 + 𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 𝜋𝜋2 + 𝐷𝐷𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 𝜋𝜋3 + 𝛿𝛿𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜂𝜂𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡

Where 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡 is the post-FFCRA indicator and 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 − 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠 is the fraction of non-

essential worker establishments in county 𝑐𝑐 in state s the first quarter of 2019. 𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 is a vector of

state-level COVID-19-related policies (public school closures, stay at home orders, non-essential

business closures, and prohibition on in-restaurant dining (Raifman 2020)) and 𝐷𝐷𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 is a vector

of county-level weather variables, 16 the latter of which likely impact our physical mobility

measures independent of an pandemic. 𝛿𝛿𝑐𝑐 and 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 are county and day fixed-effects, respectively.

𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 − 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠 is time-invariant and thus we do not include the main effect as this variable

is perfectly collinear with county fixed-effects.

         We estimate least squares regression. The data are weighted by the county population.

We cluster standard errors at the county level (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan 2004).

         Given that we leverage county-level variation in non-essential workers, discussing the

type of worker affected by FFCRA is worthwhile. Blau, Koebe, and Meyerhofer (2020)

carefully examine demographics of essential and non-essential workers. Non-essential workers

(vs. essential workers) are slightly more likely to be male, have similar wages, are more likely to

be racial or ethnicity minority, and have lower education. Further, the authors note that there is a

similar distribution of non-essential and essential workers across broad occupational groupings.

5. Results

5.1. Summary statistics and trends

         Table 1 provides summary statistics in the pre-FFCRA period. The average number of

hours at home and away from home are 9.3 and 4.6 respectively. We note that these two

variables do not sum to 24 hours. The difference is attributable to devices that are either not

turned on or not transmitting location data for all 24 hours of the day, and measurement error

since SafeGraph reports time at home and time away in ranges. 17 29.1% of individuals in a

county are away from home more than eight hours per day and 65.2% of establishments are non-

essential. Pre-FFCRA, 21.4% of county-days are under a public school closure order and 4.7%

are under a stay at home order. Similarly, over this time period, in 5.8% and 18.1% of county-



17
   Time at home is reported in buckets of one hour or less, one to six hours, six to 12 hours, 12 to 18 hours, and more
than 18 hours. Time away from home is reported in buckets of 20 minutes or less, 21 to 45 minutes, 46 minutes to
one hour, one to two hours, two to three hours, three to four hours, four to five hours, five to six hours, six to seven
hours, seven to eight hours, eight to nine hours, nine to ten hours, ten to 11 hours, 11 to 12 hours, 12 to 14 hours, 14
to 16 hours, 16 to 18 hours, 18 to 20 hours, 20 to 22 hours, 22 hours or more.

                                                          18
days non-essential business are ordered closed and in-person restaurant dining is prohibited.

While there is no other policy that occurred nationwide on April 1st, 2020 that might confound

out effects, controlling for state social distancing policies allows us to arguably better isolate

FFCRA effects. Weather controls indicate that our data span a relatively dry period, with

moderate levels of humidity and typical spring weather.

       Figures 1A and 1B report variation in non-essential worker establishments. The share of

non-essential worker establishments varies across U.S. counties (Figure 1A). We note that

several states have low shares of non-essential workers while others have higher shares. Indeed,

the two states that arguably appear to be the most discordant border each other: California and

Oregon. Apart from these states, the distribution of non-essential worker establishment does not

show a strong geographic trend, with most states including counties with both very high and very

low shares of such establishments. Indeed, adjacent counties within the same state often have

very different levels of non-essential worker establishments. 33.6% of the establishments in

Fresno county California, for example, are non-essential, while in neighboring Mono county,

California we classify 85.3% of establishments as non-essential. Figure 1B depicts a histogram

of the share of non-essential worker establishments, the distribution is roughly bell-shaped but

does display a modest right skew. The range of values is 23.1% to 92.1% non-essential worker

establishments. The average share of non-essential worker establishments across quartiles is as

follows: 55.4%, 63.8%, 68.0%, and 74.1%. Thus, the 4th quartile has a 33.8% higher share of

non-essential worker establishments than the 1st quartile.

       Trends in our three outcome variables over our study period are reported in Figures 2A,

2B, and 2C. We report the difference between 2020 and 2019 for each variable (we use




                                                  19
comparable dates in each year 18) and aggregate to the weekly level to smooth out noise inherent

in high-frequency data. We report trends for the full sample, counties in the 1st quartile of the

non-essential worker establishment distribution, and counties in the 4th quarter of the non-

essential worker establishment distribution. The intuition for examining the 1st and 4th quartiles

is that our design is based on the premise that counties with higher shares of non-essential

worker establishments should be more exposed to FFCRA than those counties with lower shares.

We can test this hypothesis by examining unadjusted changes for the 1st and 4th quartiles. Across

all three measures we observe a sharp change on April 1st. In particular, the average number of

hours a home increase, the average number of hours not at home decrease, and the share of

individuals away from home for more than eight hours per day decline. The changes occurring

on April 1st are largest for counties in the 4th quartile of the non-essential worker establishment

distribution, this pattern of results offers suggestive evidence in support of our research design:

FFCRA effects are largest in the most exposed counties.

        Appendix Figures 1A and 1B report trends over time in the U.S. in confirmed COVID-19

cases and deaths. These figures display several patterns related to our study. First, both

confirmed cases and deaths are increasing over time. Second, our study period (March 13th,

2020 to April 30th, 2020) falls within a relatively early period of the pandemic. Thus, our

findings are likely local to this period when, while both outcomes were rising rapidly, total

confirmed cases and deaths were much lower than they are at the time of writing.

5.2. Effect of FFCRA on physical mobility




18
   We construct comparable dates using epidemiological weeks—the number of weeks that have elapsed since the
first Sunday of a week containing at least four days of a given year—and the day of the week. For example, April
1st, 2020 is the Wednesday of the 13th epidemiological week; the corresponding date in 2019 is April 3rd.

                                                        20
       Results based on our baseline specification are reported in Table 2. We observe that for a

hypothetical county that moved from having 0% non-essential worker establishments to 100%

non-essential worker establishments, average hours at home increased in the post-FFCRA

period, while the average hours not at home and the share of devices not at home for more than

eight hours per day in the post-FFCRA period decreased. We do not observe such a county in

our data and thus transform the coefficient estimate to reflect a pattern that we do observe in

real-world U.S. counties (see Figure 1A). In particular, we scale our estimates by 0.689, this

reflects the difference in exposure in the county with the lowest (23.1%) and the county with the

highest (92.1%) share of non-essential worker establishments in 2019 quarter 1. Using this

transformation, we find that FFCRA leads to a 0.44 hour or 26.6 minute increase in average time

at home, a 0.33 hour or 19.8 minute decrease in average time away from home, and a 1.6 ppt

decrease in the share of devices away from home eight more hours per day. In relative terms

(calculated by comparing the coefficient estimates to the pre-FFCRA sample means), our

findings imply 4.2%, 7.7%, and 6.1% changes in the three outcomes respectively. FFCRA has

been estimated to affect up to 47% of the U.S. workforce (Glynn 2020) and during our study

period the share of Americans with COVID-19 was relatively low (see, for example, Appendix

Figures 1A and 1B for confirmed cases and deaths over time), which could contribute – in

combination with other factors such as school closures, fear of losing a job, and limited

knowledge of a new benefit -- to the relatively small effect sizes that we estimate.

       We also report two alternative transformations in all regression tables that display

coefficient estimates generated in Equation (1): (i) a one standard deviation (SD) increase in the

share of non-essential worker establishments and (ii) moving from the 10th (56.1%) to 90th

(74.0%) percentile of the non-essential worker establishment distribution (see Figure 1B). We



                                                 21
report these alternative transformations for transparency given that there is no standard approach

to scaling of which we are aware. These transformations, necessarily, imply smaller changes in

outcomes post-FFCRA as we are comparing more similar counties.

        During our study period, states were active in implementing social distancing policies.

Similar to other studies in the literature (see Section 2.2), we observe that state-level social

distancing policies generally increase time at home and decrease time away from home, with

some variation in terms of both the magnitude and statistical significance across policies. 19

5.3. Internal validity

        We next probe the robustness of our design to various threats to identification. First, we

explore the ability of our data to satisfy parallel trends. Second, we investigate the importance of

unobserved confounders. Finally, we conduct falsification exercises to ensure that we are not

erroneously capturing the effect of some other policy or factor that was also adopted nationwide

on April 1st, 2020; of note we are not aware of any such policy or factor.

Parallel trends: We estimate a modified event-study model to explore the ability of our data to

satisfy the parallel trends assumption that is necessary for DD-style models to estimate causal

effects. In particular, we interact the county pre-FFCRA share of non-essential worker

establishments with indicators for the weeks beginning March 18th, 25th, April 1st, April 8th, April

15th, April 22nd, and April 29th. We select the week of March 18th as the omitted category as it is

the earliest period in our sample (Lovenheim 2009). Otherwise, the event-study equation is

identical to Equation (1). Results are reported graphically in Figures 3A, 3B, and 3C; note these

figures depict the coefficient estimates and are not scaled in any way. Broadly, these figures



19
   We observe no clear pattern of results from interactions between FFCRA and social distancing policies (not
reported but available on request), suggesting no conclusive evidence on whether FFCRA enhanced the
effectiveness of these policies.

                                                        22
suggest that counties with higher and lower shares of non-essential worker establishments

followed similar trends pre-FFCRA. However, beginning on April 1st, 2020, counties with

higher shares of non-essential worker establishments experience sharp increases in average hours

at home, and decreases in average hours not at home and the share of individuals away from

home eight or more hours per day. This pattern of results suggests that our data can satisfy

parallel trends and that FFCRA effects are observable precisely at the effective date.

Unobserved confounders: We conduct a test to explore the importance of unobserved

confounders. We report results excluding time-varying controls from Equation (1). If results

change when we include and exclude the time-varying controls, this pattern of results suggests

that unobservable confounders do not drive our findings (Altonji, Elder, and Taber 2005). Our

coefficient estimates are not appreciably different with or without controls (Table 3).

Falsification: W conduct two falsification tests to further probe our design. First, we estimate

Equation (1) using data from 2019, we us the same dates but one year prior to the pandemic.

Note that we cannot control for state-level social distancing policies as they were not in place in

2019, otherwise the specification is identical to Equation (1). If we are able to replicate our

findings in the earlier year, this pattern of results would call to question the internal validity of

our design. Results are listed in Table 4: coefficient estimates are small in magnitude (6.3% to

8.7% of the comparable our main estimates which are reported in Table 2) and are not

statistically different from zero.

           Second, we randomly re-shuffle our treatment variable across counties and dates, and re-

estimate Equation (1) 100 times, thereby generating 100 placebo estimates. 20 We compare our

main coefficient estimate to the distribution of placebo estimates, if we are capturing the ‘true’



20
     In our re-assignment of the treatment variable, the treatment is assigned to a date.

                                                             23
FFCRA effect rather than some other co-occurring policy or factor that changed on April 1st,

2020, then our main coefficient estimate should be an outlier. We report results graphically in

Figures 4A, 4B, and 4C, we present a scatter plot (Panel A) and a histogram (Panel B) of the

estimates. In all three figures, our main coefficient estimate is an outlier.

Assessment of internal validity: We view our testing of the design as providing suggestive

evidence that are main coefficient estimates are not attributable to a violation of parallel trends,

unobserved confounders, or some other policy or factor that occurred nationwide on April 1st,

2020. Thus, we proceed with use of the DD-style estimator.

5.4. Heterogeneity in FFCRA effects across education, race/ethnicity, and industry

        While COVID-19 has affected all of the U.S., particular groups have been especially

hard-hit., e.g., rates of cases and deaths have been very high among African Americans

(Villarosa 2020). Similarly, as documented in Appendix Table 1, workers in less desirable jobs

are less likely to have access to PSL through their employer, we therefore expect FFCRA effects

to be larger among this group of workers.

        To explore hypotheses related to disparate impacts, we interact the FFCRA with the share

of the county that does not have college degree, is African American, is other race, is Hispanic,

and works in a blue collar occupation 21 using data from the 2014 to 2018 American Community

Survey. 22 We de-mean the county-shares for ease of interpretation. Results are reported in

Table 5. Broadly, we find limited evidence of heterogeneity in FFCRA effects across counties

with different demographic profiles. An exception is that counties with higher shares of non-

college educated groups are more impacted by the policy, the elevated impact in such counties is

potentially attributable to lower levels of PSL pre-FFCRA for such individuals.

5.5. Interactions between FFCRA and pre-FFCRA PSL mandates

         As discussed in Section 2.1., 34 localities across the country had a PSL mandate in place

prior to FFCRA. We exclude counties covered by a pre-FFCRA PSL mandate in our main

analysis to allow for clean identification of FFCRA effects. While the benefits conferred by

FFCRA are arguably quite different from those made available by the PSL mandates, we

hypothesize that localities with a mandate in place prior to FFCRA may be better able to support

effective implementation of the federal Act. On the other hand, with access to PSL pre-FFCRA,

workers in such counties may have less need for additional PSL through FFCRA. To explore

this question, we interact our ‘bite’ variable with an indicator for a pre-FFCRA PSL mandate.

         Prior to exploring heterogeneity in treatment effects across counties with and without a

pre-FFCRA PSL mandate, we first include those counties with such a mandate in the sample and

re-estimate Equation (1). Results are reported in Table 6 and are not appreciably different from

our main findings (Table 2). Coefficient estimates are slightly smaller in size, but the 95%

confidence intervals overlap substantially and thus we are reluctant to overstate differences.

Table 7 reports results based on the interacted models. The primary variable of interest

(𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 ∗ 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 − 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠 ) carries coefficient estimates across specifications that are very

similar to our main results (Table 2). The coefficient estimate on the interaction between

(𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡 ∗ 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 − 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐,𝑠𝑠 ) and indicator for a pre-FFCRA PSL mandate is not statistically

distinguishable from zero in any of the specifications. Collectively, these results do not suggest

that counties with a pre-FFCRA mandate are differentially impacted by the federal policy.

5.7. Robustness and extensions


                                                         25
        We next conduct a series of robustness checks to ensure that our results are stable, and

we examine the impact of FFCRA on confirmed COVID-19 cases. We find that our results do

not appreciably change across the different specifications and samples, thus we summarize this

analysis and note what we view as particularly important findings.

        While FFRCA became effective April 1st, 2020 the DOL did not begin to officially

enforce the policy until April 18th, 2020. Thus, between April 1st and April 17th, employers did

not face a penalty for non-enforcement. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no

evidence that employers did not conform with FFCRA during this period. 23 To explore the

empirical importance of enforcement, we include an interaction term between an indicator for the

period April 18th to April 30th, 2020; this is the period in which we expect the effect of the policy

to be most substantial as FFCRA is in place and DOL is actively enforcing the policy. The main

effect coefficient estimates are similar to our core results (Table 2), but the interaction terms with

the April 18th to April 30th, 2020 indicator suggest that FFCRA effects increased when the DOL

began to enforce the policy. In particular, post-April 18th, 2020 average time at home increases

by 33.5 minutes, and average time not at home decreases by 26.2 minutes while the share of

individuals not at home more than eight hours a day increases by 2.3 ppts (Appendix Table 3). 24

We also define the FFCRA ‘effective’ date as April 18th, 2020 (Appendix Table 4). We test

whether the signing of FFCRA by President Trump on March 18th, 2020 can be viewed as having

an impact, perhaps by sending a signal to employers and workers on the importance of staying

home while sick or caring for dependents. To implement this test, we treat March 18th, 2020 as

the ‘effective date.’ Results (reported in Appendix Table 5) do not suggest strong signaling

   We take the sum of the main effect and the interaction term coefficient estimate.

effects: coefficient estimates are smaller than those reported in Table 2 and are not statistically

distinguishable from zero.

        We combine SafeGraph data from March 13th to April 30th in 2020 and the equivalent

period from 2019, 25 and conduct an alternative DD model (Appendix Table 6). We do not use

variation in non-essential worker establishments in this analysis, instead we conduct a standard

DD analysis. In this specification, observations in 2020 comprise the treatment group and

observations in 2019 comprise the comparison group; April 1st to April 30th in both years

comprise the ‘post’ period; and observations observed between April 1st, 2020 and April 30th,

2020 comprise the treatment*post indicator. Results were not appreciably different to our main

results when using this alternative modelling strategy.

        We also apply an interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) to study FFCRA effects

(Appendix Table 7). Broadly, ITSA parametrically constructs a counterfactual trend for the U.S.

had FFCRA not been adopted, then compares the actual and counterfactual trends to estimate

treatment effects. The ITSA results suggest that FFCRA effects lead to a discrete change in

social distancing outcomes and that effects may decline over time. For example, at the time of

policy adoption, average time away from home decreases by 0.51 hours (30.4 minutes) and this

change dissipates by 0.8 hours (5.0 minutes) per week day. 26 We have added a control for the

enforcement period in the ITSA model (results available on request). Findings, similar to results

listed in Appendix Table 3, suggest that effects are enhanced when the DOL enforces the policy,

but after some time to begin to decline. Thus, we do not interpret our findings from our ITSA

specification to be discordant with results reported in Appendix Table 3.

  2019 data cover the period from March 15th to May 2nd.

  In an earlier version of this manuscript we emphasized the ITSA findings. Based on feedback from helpful
readers, we have elected to focus on the DD-style model in the current version.

                                                       27
       We add controls for the first confirmed COVID-19 case and death in the state and county,

these variables may convey new information regarding the seriousness of the pandemic to

Americans (Appendix Table 8). We also interact our treatment variable with an indicator for the

first confirmed case per 10,000 county residents (Appendix Table 9). The main coefficient

estimates are not appreciably different from our core results (Table 2) and the coefficient

estimate on the interaction with cases per 10,000 residents is imprecise. An exception to this

pattern is observed in the average hours at home specification: the interaction term coefficient

estimate in this case is roughly the same size as the main coefficient estimate, suggesting that

part of the effect of FFCRA on staying home accrues once COVID outbreaks occur in an area.

       Our results are stable across alternative sample periods. We use a longer pre- and post-

FFCRA period (Appendix Table 10): February 1st, 2020 through July 17th, 2020. We also zero in

on the effective date by using a shorter post-treatment time period: March 13th, 2020 through

April 15th, 2020 (Appendix Table 11). The longer period arguably allows us to explore how

effects may vary as time passes and the pandemic proceeds, which is useful because

(presumably) as more individuals become sick they are more likely to take advantage of FFCRA

benefits and knowledge of the policy among both workers and employers likely increases over

time. However, a cost of using the longer study period is that (as noted earlier in the

manuscript), many states began re-opening their economies in May, 2020 which could confound

effects. On the other hand, while zeroing in on the FFCRA effective date potentially offers the

cleanest design (as a shorter study period arguably allows for us to mitigate secular changes in

the pandemic in March and April, 2020), we lose the period in which the DOL began to enforce

the policy and cannot allow for learning about the policy to occur. We include weekends

(Appendix Table 12), we exclude these days in our main analysis as work and school/daycare



                                                28
responsibilities tend to occur during the work-week for most individuals. Nonetheless, our

findings are stable – although we note not identical – across alternative study periods.

         As noted earlier in the manuscript, to date the DOL has not provided a specific definition

of essential workers. In our main analysis, we rely on a definition developed by Blau, Koebe,

and Meyerhofer (2020). Next, we use a definition proposed by Tomer and Kane (2020), and re-

estimate Equation (1). Results, reported in Appendix Table 13, are not appreciably different.

         We cluster standard errors at the day level (Appendix Table 14) and use

heteroscedasticity robust standard errors (Appendix Table 15). We also estimate unweighted

regression (Appendix Table 16). In our main analysis, we emphasize variation in treatment

effects generated by non-essential worker shares pre-FFCRA. Another dimension of

heterogeneity in exposure to the policy is employer size: employers with 50 or less or 500 or

more employers are exempt (Glynn 2020). Next, we use County Business Patterns (CBP) data

from the U.S. Census (which covers the week of March 12th). The most recent data from the

CBP is 2018. 27 We construct the share of establishments exempt based on size in each county

and interact that share with our non-essential worker share variable. We report results in

Appendix Table 17. Results are very similar.

         We next investigate the impact of FFCRA on confirmed COVID-19 cases. To do so, we

use data from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center and construct the

logarithm of the number of new cases in the next seven days in each county-day of our study

period. We use the future seven days that staying at home cannot impact past confirmed cases.

Before reporting our main specification, we report an event-study in Appendix Figure 2. Pre-


27
   As noted earlier in footnote 13, employer size is very limited at the county level in the QCEW, hence we do not
use this information in our primary specification. The Census Bureau infuses noise into the worker variable –
roughly 67% of the observations have ‘medium’ or ‘high’ noise – which leads us to report this analysis as a check
rather than in our main specification.

                                                         29
FFCRA counties with different levels of non-essential worker establishments appear to have

followed the same trend in confirmed cases. Appendix Table 18 reports results based on

Equation (1). We observe a decline of 59.6% 28 in the next week’s new number of cases post-

FFCRA (comparing the counties with the lowest and highest shares of non-essential workers in

our sample). While our coefficient estimate implies a large effect size, our confidence intervals

are somewhat wide and the upper tail of our 95% confidence interval implies a 27.8% decrease.

6. Discussion

           On January 30th, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus

2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and

on March 11th, 2020 the organization officially declared it a global pandemic (World Health

Organization 2020a). The COVID-19 pandemic has caused large losses in lives and decreased

morbidity, and severely and adversely affected labor markets. In addition, the pandemic has

reignited discussions of perceived inadequacies in U.S. social policy, including a lack of a

national, universal PSL mandate (Cain Miller 2020).

           We offer the first evidence on the impact of FFCRA on physical mobility (presence at

home and at work), a proxy for social distancing which is a key component in CDC guidelines

for mitigating the pandemic through public health efforts as, to date, there is no established

medical treatment or vaccine. By providing many public and private sector workers up to two

weeks of PSL to those who are sick (whether confirmed as COVID-19 infected or not) and/or

must care for children who cannot attend school or daycare due to pandemic-related closures, or

tend to sick family members, FFCRA represents the first national PSL policy in the U.S.

Importantly for our study, ‘essential’ workers are not eligible for FFCRA benefits. This



28
     We calculate this number as follows: percent change = exp(-1.316*0.689)-1.

                                                         30
exemption offers us a plausibly exogenous source of variation. In particular, we use pre-FFCRA

variation across U.S. counties in the share of non-essential workers and apply a modified

difference-in-differences methods that leverages this variation. The intuition of this empirical

approach is that counties with lower shares of non-essential workers should be more exposed to

FFCRA and thus experience a larger ‘dose’ of treatment. We combine high frequency data

based on more than 20 million cellular devices’ (individuals’) GPS locations to track physical

mobility measured at the county-level with this DD-style approach to estimate FFCRA effects on

proxies for social distancing.

       Following the federal Act, those individuals are more likely to stay home and less likely

to work. In particular, post-FFCRA, comparing the county with the lowest share of non-essential

workers to the county with the highest share of non-essential workers in the U.S., the average

number of hours at home increases (compared to pre-FFCRA values) by 4.2% while the average

number of hours away from home decreases by 7.7% and the share of individuals away from the

home for more than eight hours per day declines by 6.1%.

       Our findings contribute to three policy-relevant literatures. First, our work adds to the

literature that explores the impact of PSL mandates in the U.S. Our work complements previous

work, which has focused on state and local mandates, by examining an Act that affected the

nation. In addition, unlike existing PSL mandates, FFCRA is a temporary Act that is designed to

offer immediate, but tailored, support to workers and their families, and society at large, during

an unprecedented outbreak of a highly infectious disease. Second, we add to the recent surge in

economic research on government responses to infectious disease. A theme in this literature is to

study the impact of policies that encourage social distancing. In that spirit, we consider how

providing workers with financial support impacts social distancing.



                                                 31
        Our study has limitations. Our proxy variables have many shortcomings in terms of

reflecting the medically advised social distancing concept we would ideally study (i.e., staying

home from work when infected with COVID-19 or having a credible perception of exposure to

someone infected with COVID-19). Another important caveat is that we are not able to isolate

why individuals take leave: to recover from COVID-19 or to care for dependents. Future work

from surveys that discern the reasons for staying away from work would enable further

understanding regarding the mechanism through which leave policies might affect future

COVID-19 cases. However, as we discussed earlier in the manuscript, increases in time at home

and decreases in time away from home likely impacted by FFCRA are all likely conducive to

better mitigation of COVID-19 spread through social distancing policies established by the CDC.

        Despite limitations, we offer crucial timely first evidence on the impact of FFCRA on

physical mobility, a proxy for social distancing, a behavior that is critical if the U.S. is to adopt a

meaningful public health policy that can mitigate disease spread. Since the aim of this temporary

PSL law is to reduce externalities in workplace illness and to reduce caregiver burdens,

understanding whether workers responded by decreased time in the workplace and increased

time at home is vital first step to assessing the effects of the law.
