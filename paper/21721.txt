This paper attempts to quantitatively identify the factors that drive wealth dynamics in the U.S. and
are consistent with its observed skewed cross-sectional distribution and social mobility. We concentrate
on three critical factors: a skewed and persistent distribution of earnings, differential saving and bequest
rates across wealth levels, and capital income risk. All of these factors are necessary for matching
both distribution and mobility, with a distinct role in inducing wealth accumulation near the borrowing
constraints, contributing to the thick top tail of wealth, and affecting upward and/or downward social
mobility.

1         Introduction

Wealth in the U.S. is unequally distributed, with a Gini coefficient of 0.78. It is skewed to
the right, and displays a thick, right tail: the top 1% of the richest households in the United
States hold over 33% of wealth. At the same time, the U.S. is characterized by a relatively
fast social mobility, with a Shorrocks mobility index in the range of 0.67 − 0.88.1
        This paper attempts to quantitatively identify the factors that drive wealth dynamics in
the U.S. and are consistent with the observed cross-sectional distribution of wealth and with
the observed social mobility. We first develop a macroeconomic model displaying various
distinct wealth accumulation factors. Once we allow for an explicit demographic structure,
the model delivers implications for social mobility as well as the cross-sectional distribution.
We then match the moments generated by the model to several empirical moments of the
observed distribution of wealth and social mobility matrix. Indeed distinct wealth accumula-
tion factors have qualitatively different effects on social mobility, which then helps to identify
their relative importance in driving wealth dynamics, as e.g., certain factors that deliver the
thick tails of the wealth distribution also imply too little intergenerational mobility relative
to the data.2
        Many recent studies of wealth distribution and inequality focus on the relatively difficult
task of explaining the thickness of the upper tail. We shall concentrate on three critical
factors previously shown, typically in isolation from each other, to affect the tail of the
distribution, empirically and theoretically. First, a skewed and persistent distribution of
stochastic earnings translates, in principle, into a wealth distribution with similar properties.
A large literature in the context of Aiyagari-Bewley economies has taken this route, notably
    1
     Formally,
            P for a square mobility transition matrix A of dimension m, the Shorrocks index given by
         m−      ajj
               j
s(A) =     m−1       ∈ (0, 1) , with 0 indicating complete immobility. The U.S. range is from mobility matrices
across 5 years from Klevmarken et al. (2003) for 1994-1999 (see Table 9, p. 342), and generational transitions
estimated by Charles and Hurst (2003) using 1984-89 cohort for parents, Tables 2 and 5.
   2
     See Hubmer et al. (2015) for a related exercise. This paper is not yet available and hence we refer to
later drafts for a detailed discussion of similarities and differences; however, like the rest of the literature, it
does not look at intergenerational wealth mobility.

Castañeda et al. (2003) and Kindermann and Krueger (2015).3 Another factor which could
contribute to generating a skewed distribution of wealth is differential saving rates across
wealth levels, with higher saving and accumulation rates for the rich. In the literature
this factor takes the form of non-homogeneous bequests, bequests as a fraction of wealth
that are increasing in wealth; see for example Cagetti and De Nardi (2006), and the recent
work of Piketty (2014) discussing the saving rates of the rich directly. Finally, stochastic
returns on wealth, or capital income risk, has been shown to induce a skewed distribution of
wealth, in Benhabib et al. (2011); see also Quadrini (2000) which exploits stochastic returns
of entrepreneurs to the same effect.4 While all these factors contribute to produce skewed
wealth distributions, their relative importance remains to be ascertained.
       Other possible factors which qualitatively would induce skewed wealth distributions but
which we do not address directly include a rate of return on wealth which increases in
wealth and a precautionary savings motive for wealth accumulation. A dependence of rates
of return on wealth would have similar effects as differential savings rates. We do not include
this factor in our analysis since it has not been empirically documented in U.S. data; see
Saez and Zucman (2016) who study returns on large public portfolios. A precautionary
savings motive could also contribute to explaining the thick tail of the wealth distribution.
In fact , the precautionary motive, by increasing the savings rate at low wealth levels under
borrowing constraints and random earnings, works in the opposite direction of savings rates
increasing in wealth. We do not exploit this channel for simplicity, assuming that life-cycle
earnings profiles are random across generations but deterministic within lifetimes.
       Our main results document that all of the three factors we study, stochastic earnings,
differential savings rates, and capital income risk, are necessary for matching both distribu-
   3
     Several papers in the literature include a stochastic length of life (typically, “perpetual youth”) to
complement the effect of skewed earnings on wealth. We do not include this in our model as it has manifestly
counterfactual demographic consequences: the rich are those agents who turn out to live relatively longer,
as a (modeling) consequence have children later in life, and leave larger estates.
   4
     This factor is also related to stochastic heterogeneous discount factors or heterogeneous stochastic impa-
tience adopted by Krusell and Smith (1998). However, such discount factors are non-measurable and hence
we prefer to restrict our analysis to capital income risk.


                                                      3
tion and mobility. Furthermore, our analysis allows us to distinguish the contributions of
these factors in driving wealth accumulation. Each of them has a distinct role. Stochastic
earnings avoid poverty traps and allow for upward mobility near the borrowing constraints
as random returns on capital or capital income risk have relatively small effects at low levels
of wealth. Saving rate differentials help match the top tail but they reduce social mobility
as the rich get richer accumulating at higher rates. Stochastic returns on wealth, or capital
income risk, also contributes to the thick top tail while allowing for social mobility, especially
in terms of speeding up downward mobility.
        The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 lays out the theoretical framework.
Section 3 explains our quantitative approach and data sources we use. Section 4 shows the
baseline results with the model fit for both targeted and un-targeted moments. Section
5 presents several counterfactual exercises, where we re-estimate the model shutting down
one factor at a time. Section 6 reports on our attempt to extend the analysis allowing for
non-stationarity of the wealth distribution and to measure the transition speed our model
delivers. Section 7 concludes.



2         Wealth dynamics and stationary distribution

Most models of the wealth dynamics in the literature focus on deriving skewed distributions
with thick tails, e.g., Pareto distributions (power laws).5 While this is also our aim, we more
generally target the whole wealth distribution and its intergenerational mobility properties
by building a simple micro-founded model - a standard macroeconomic model in fact - of
life-cycle consumption and savings. The model exploits the interaction of the three factors
identified in the Introduction that tend to induce skewed wealth distributions: stochastic
earnings, differential saving and bequest rates across wealth levels, and stochastic returns on
    5
    We only discuss here those models which are directly relevant to our present analysis, referring to
Benhabib and Bisin (2015) for an extensive survey of the theoretical and empirical literature on the wealth
distribution.


                                                    4
wealth. These factors also have different implications on wealth distribution and mobility.
    Each agent’s life span is finite and deterministic, T years. Every period, consumers choose
consumption c and accumulate wealth a, subject to a no-borrowing constraint. Consumers
leave a bequest at the end of life and get a warm-glow utility. The per-period utility from
consumption, u(c), and bequests, e(a), are CRRA. Their functional forms, respectively, are

                                             c1−σ                    a1−µ
                                    u(c) =        ,    e(a) = A           .
                                             1−σ                     1−µ

    Wealth accumulates from savings and bequests. Idiosyncratic rates of returns r and life-
time labor earnings profiles {wt }Tt=1 are drawn from a distribution at birth, possibly correlated
with those of the parent, deterministic within each generation life.6 We emphasize that r and
{wt } are stochastic over generations only, not within the life cycle. Lifetime earnings profiles
are hump-shaped, with low earnings early in life. As a consequence, borrowing constraints
limit how much agents can smooth lifetime earnings.
    Let Vt (at ) denote the discounted expected utility of an agent with wealth at at the
beginning of period t. The agent’s maximization problem, written recursively, then is


                              Vt (at )        =           max u(ct ) + βVt+1 (at+1 )
                                                          ct ,at+1

                            s.t. at+1         =           (1 + r)(at − ct ) + wt ,

                                         0 ≤ ct ≤ at , f or t ∈ [0, T ]
                                                          1
                        VT +1 (aT +1 )        =             e(aT +1 )
                                                          β

The agent faces no uncertainty within his life span, hence no expectation is taken in the
   6
     Assuming deterministic earning profiles amounts to disregarding the role of intra-generational life-cycle
uncertainty and hence of precautionary savings; see Keane and Wolpin (1997), Huggett et al. (2011), and
Cunha et al. (2010) for evidence that the life-cycle income positions tend to be determined early in life.

maximization problem. The solution of the recursive problem can be represented by a map


                                           aT = g (a0 ; r, w) ,


which we use to construct the intergenerational wealth dynamics process.
   Let apex n denote the generation. The process for the rate of return on wealth and
earnings processes over generation n, (rn , wn ) is a finite irreducible Markov Chain with
transition P (rn , wn | rn−1 , wn−1 ) such that (abusing notation):

                                                                   
                                P rn | rn−1 , wn−1       = P rn | rn−1 ,
                                                                       
                               P wn | rn−1 , wn−1        = P wn | wn−1


Also, the life-cycle structure of the model implies that the initial wealth of the n’th generation
coincides with the final wealth of the n − 1’th generation:


                                            an = an0 = an−1
                                                        T .




We can construct then a stochastic difference equation for the initial wealth of dynasties,
induced by the stochastic process for (rn , wn ), and mapping an−1 into an :

                                                                 
                                         an = g an−1 ; rn , wn ,


where the map g(.) represents indeed the solution of the life-cycle consumption-saving prob-
lem.
   It can be shown that under our assumptions, the map g can be characterized as follows:

if µ = σ, g (a0 ; r, w) = α(r, w)a0 + β(r, w);

            ∂2g
if µ < σ,   ∂a02
                   (a0 ; r, w) > 0.


                                                     6
In the first case, µ = σ, the savings rate is independent of wealth. If instead µ < σ differential
savings rate emerge, increasing with wealth. In the first case the intergenerational wealth
dynamics is then governed by a linear stochastic difference equation in wealth, which has
been closely studied in the math literature; see de Saporta (2005). Indeed, if µ = σ, the
distribution of earnings is not too thick,7 and (α(rn , wn ), β(rn , wn )) satisfy the restrictions
of a reflective process (see Benhabib et al., 2011 for details), the tail of the stationary
distribution of wealth, an , is independent of the distribution of earnings and asymptotic to
a Pareto law,
                                           P r(a > a) ∼ Qa−γ ,

σ constant, µ < σ, a stationary distribution might not exist; but if it does,


                                          P r(a > a) ≥ Q(a)−γ .



3       Quantitative analysis

The objective of this paper, as we discussed in the Introduction, consists in measuring
the relative importance of various factors which determine the wealth distribution and the
social mobility matrix in the U.S. The three factors are stochastic earnings, differential
savings, and capital income risk. These are represented in the model by the properties of the
dynamic process and the distribution of (rn , wn ) and by the parameters µ and σ, which imply
differential savings (the rich saving more) when µ < σ. We assume in the following analysis
however that rn and wn are independent, though each is allowed to be serially correlated.
    7
     This statement is not circular: the precise condition is that the tail of earnings be less thick than the
tail implied by capital income risk under no earnings; see Grey (1994) and Hay et al. (2011).




                                                      7
3.1     Methodology

The main assumption of the quantitative exercise is that the wealth and social mobility data
observed in the U.S. are generated by a stationary distribution. We extend the analysis to
                                                                                          8
possibly non-stationary distributions in Section 6 as a robustness check.
    We estimate the parameters of the stochastic process described in the previous section
using a Method of Simulated Moments (MSM) estimator: we fix (or externally calibrate)
several parameters of the model ; we select some relevant moments as target in the estimation;
and we estimate the remaining parameters by matching the targeted moments generated by
the model and those in the data. Specifically, we fix σ = 2, T = 36, β = 0.97 per annum.
We also fix the stochastic process for individual earnings profiles (estimated from the PSID)
and its transition across generations following Chetty et al. (2014).9 The moments we target
are (i) the bottom 20%, 20 − 39%, 40 − 59%, 60 − 79%, 80 − 89%, 90 − 94%, 95 − 99%,
and top 1% wealth percentiles; and (ii) the diagonal of the social mobility Markov chain
transition matrix for the bottom 25%, 25 − 49%, 50 − 74%, 75 − 89%, 90 − 94%, 95 − 99%,
and top 1% states. We estimate µ, A, a five-state Markov Chain grid for rn , and a restricted
form of the transition matrix consisting in leaving diagonal elements free and imposing equal
probabilities off the diagonal.10 In total, therefore, we target 15 moments and we estimate
12 parameters.
    Let θ denote the vector of the parameters to be estimated. Let mn for n = 1, . . . , N = 15
denote a generic empirical moment and dn (θ) be the corresponding model moment that is
   8
     Very few studies in the literature deal with the transitional dynamics of wealth and its speed of transition
along the path, though this issue has been put at the forefront of the debate by Piketty (2014). Notable and
very interesting exceptions are Gabaix et al. (2015), Kaymak and Poschke (2015), and Hubmer et al. (2015).
Our preliminary results in Section 6 are encouraging, in the sense that the model seems to be able to capture
the transitional dynamics with parameters estimates not too far from those obtained under stationarity.
   9
     The data in Chetty et al. (2014) refers to the 1980-82 U.S. birth cohort and their parental income. We
only use their data for the transition matrix of our earnings process. Originally, it is a 100-state Markov
chain: each percentile of income distribution. We reduce it to a ten-state Markov chain; see Appendix B for
the deciles, the transition matrix, and a detailed discussion of several issues with our measure of individual
income.
  10
     This is just to reduce the number of parameters we need to estimate. We also experimented with
exponentially decreasing off-diagonal cells, and results are very similar.

simulated for given parameter vector θ. We simulate the entire wealth process of 100, 000
individuals, and we minimize the deviation between each targeted moment and the corre-
sponding simulated moment. For each moment n, define


                                        Fn (θ) = dn (θ) − mn .11

The MSM estimator is


                                       θ̂ = arg min F(θ)0 W F(θ).
                                                  θ


where F(θ) is a column vector in which all moment conditions are stacked, i.e.


                                     F(θ) = [F1 (θ), . . . , FN (θ)]T .

    We choose an identity matrix for the weighting matrix in the baseline, W = IN . The
objective function is highly nonlinear in general, therefore we employ a global optimization
routine following Guvenen (2016) for the MSM estimation. Further details on the estimation
can be found in Appendix A.
    We discuss identification in Section 5 through counterfactual re-estimations, shutting
off the wealth accumulation factors one at a time. Intuitively, however, the two preference
parameters, in particular µ, determine the degree of heterogeneity in saving rates driven by
the bequest motives. The farther µ deviates to the left of σ, the more heterogeneity we have
among agents’ saving rates. The five parameters for the r grid values and the corresponding
probabilities along the transition matrix diagonal are crucial for generating not only different
wealth accumulation, hence inequality, but also the social mobility across generations.12
  11
     Note that all our moments fall between [0, 1], thus we are not too worried about large variation in the
scales of moments.
  12
     Note that we feed the earnings process directly from the data into the estimated model.




                                                      9
3.2    Data

We discuss our careful choice of data for the targeted moments first, turning then to the
labor earnings data.
Targeted moments. Matching the model and data generated moments requires wealth
distribution and social mobility data. We take wealth distribution data from the Survey
of Consumer Finances (SCF) 2007 (before the Great Recession). Figure 1 displays the
histogram for the wealth distribution, truncated at 0 on the left and ten million dollars on
the right. Here the variable is net wealth, defined as the sum of net financial wealth and
housing minus any debts. The wealth distribution is very skewed to the right. We take the
fractile shares from the cleaned version in Dı́az-Giménez et al. (2011) for [bottom 20%, 20 −
39%, 40 − 59%, 60 − 79%, 80 − 89%, 90 − 94%; 95 − 99%, top 1%] and report them in the
first row of Table 3.

Notes: Data source is the 2007 SCF. Net wealth is defined as the sum of net financial wealth
and housing. We restrict the sample to between 0 and 10 million net wealth in this figure,
but when we calculate the wealth fractile shares we do not apply those restrictions.


   As for wealth transition across generations we take the six-year transition matrix (1983-



                                             10
1989) in Kennickell and Starr-McCluer (1997) also computed from SCF data.13 The states of
the matrix are [bottom 25%, 25−49%, 50−74%, 75−89%, 90−94%, top 2−5%, top 1%].
The main reason for using this estimate is that it is the only estimate to our best knowledge
that has a state for the top 1% wealth share in its transition matrix.14
       We transform the matrix into a 36 years transition (by raising it to the power 6), and
obtain:

Observe that there is quite a lot mobility in wealth holdings across one generation already.
In the estimation we are only matching the diagonal of the above matrix.
Labor earnings data. We use ten deterministic life-cycle household-level earnings profiles
at different deciles, estimated from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and drawn
in Figure 2. We use household-level labor earnings, and do not distinguish between single or
couple households. We relegate more details of the data choice and estimations to Appendix
B.
  13
    Note that the 1983-1989 SCF is a panel data on a smaller scale.
  14
    The qualitative implications regarding social mobility in Kennickell and Starr-McCluer (1997)’s estimates
are robust: the matrix obtained by Klevmarken et al. (2003) with the PSID data is qualitatively similar; see
Appendix C where the matrix is reported. Most importantly, the matrix estimated by Charles and Hurst
(2003) to capture the intergenerational transmission in wealth exploiting information contained in the PSID
about parent-child pairs is also similar; we discuss this point in detail in Section 4.3.

Notes: Data source is the PSID household earnings cleaned by Heathcote et al. (2010).
Earnings are in thousand dollars. In the actual quantitative exercise we replace negative
earnings levels for the first decile (first column) with a small value (0.001), as our theoretical
model does not allow for borrowing hence no negative positions of wealth.



4          Estimation results

The baseline estimation results are reported in Table 2. The targeted simulated moments of
the estimated model are reported and compared to their counterpart in the data in Tables
3-4. Some independent evidence which bears on the fit of the model is discussed in Section
4.3.


4.1         Parameter estimates

Several features of the estimates are important. The upper part of Table 2 shows the esti-
mates for the preference parameters. Note that the estimate of µ, the elasticity of the CRRA
utility for bequests, is 1.1860, which is significantly lower than 2, the assumed elasticity of
the CRRA utility for consumption. Therefore µ < σ and as we noted, savings out of wealth
increase with wealth itself: the rich save proportionally more than the poor. In other words,
our estimates point to the existence of the differential saving factor as a component of the

                                                13
observed wealth dynamics in the U.S.15 Of course, the strength of the bequest motive has to
be evaluated jointly with the intensity parameter A as well. Here we have a low estimated
A of 0.0312.

Notes: [] indicates fixed parameters; () indicates standard errors computed with numerical
derivatives for the parameter estimates. σ is the CRRA elasticity of consumption, µ is the
CRRA elasticity of bequest, and A is the intensity of bequest. β is the annual discount factor,
and T is the number of working periods. The return process follows a standard Markov chain.
The values for the r grid is for an annual return. The whole matrix is reported in Appendix
A. The objective value in the baseline is 0.0295. All the above notations remain the same
throughout parameter estimates tables in the remainder of the paper.


    The bottom part of Table 2 lays out the estimates for the rate of return process.16 The
first two rows report the values estimated for these five states together with standard errors,
the next two rows report the probabilities on the diagonal of the transition matrix, while the
last row reports the corresponding probabilities for the stationary distribution of the Markov
chain. The rate of return estimate should be interpreted as annual, growth detrended, real,
and after-tax. Its mean is 3.35%, and its standard deviation is a 2.73%. While the estimate
  15
     As we noted, differential saving can in principle, for a theoretical standpoint, make it impossible for a
stationary distribution of wealth. But our estimates are predicated on the assumption that such distribution
exists. In practice this must limit the possible strength of this factor. We will gauge at this issue better
when we discuss counterfactuals in the next section.
  16
     Recall that we set the process as a Markov chain with five states - we do not impose any restriction
on the process, such as assuming an AR(1) or any other distributional assumptions, in order to allow for
sufficient freedom in the estimation.



                                                     14
of the mean appears reasonably in line with previous direct estimates, the standard deviation
is substantially smaller. This is the case for instance when our estimates are compared with
the return estimates by Case and Shiller (1989) and Flavin and Yamashita (2002) on the
housing market, by Campbell and Lettau (1999), Campbell et al. (2001) on individual stocks
of publicly traded firms, and by Moskowitz and Vissing-Jørgensen (2002) on the standard
deviation of rates of return to private equity and entrepreneurship. Such comparisons require
however great caution. We assume in fact that r stays constant throughout each agent’s
lifetime, therefore disregarding the whole variation across the life-cycle. The rate of return
we estimate should be ideally be compared with the permanent components of individual
returns across generations.17 Interestingly, the rate of return process we estimate is close to
i.i.d. across generations. This is shown by the fact that, in the stationary distribution, the
probability for each state is estimated close to 0.2.18
       Most of the parameters are estimated quite precisely with a t statistic greater than 2. To
elaborate, the curvature parameter µ is statistically very significant and, though the bequest
intensity parameter A is not, the bequest motives are jointly significant. Likewise, while
a very small subset of the r grid values or probabilities are statistically insignificant, the
parameters for the whole process are jointly significant.


4.2       Model fit

The simulations of our estimated model seem to capture the targeted moments quite well.
  17
    Inter-generational return data is hardly available, with the exception of administrative data collected in
Norway currently studied by L. Guiso and L. Pistaferri.
 18
    Note however that we impose the off-diagonal elements in the estimated transition matrix to be equal.

   While this is apparent in Tables 3-4, we also report the fit for the targeted moments
in Figures 3-4 to facilitate the reading. The first figure plots the empirical wealth share
from the 2007 SCF (in dashed blue) against the simulated shares from the model (in solid
red). Due to the borrowing constraint, in our simulation agents display non-negative wealth
holdings throughout their lifetime, and thus the simulated wealth distribution is less skewed
than the data’s. We match the top 1% share right on spot, yet somewhat miss the second
top cell for the next 1 − 5%.

example, the first bar of the second group refers to the (2, 1) elements of the matrix. The
red hollow bars are model simulated moments, while the blue shaded bars are for empirical
moments.


                                                                     17
   Figure 4 plots the fit for mobility moments. Recall that we only explicitly target the
diagonal elements of the Markovian transition matrix. We plot the whole matrix in this
figure in order to get a sense how well we do on the (non-targeted) off-diagonal cells.
   Careful reading of the figures indicates that we match the diagonal pretty well, and do
a reasonable job for the off-diagonals. The last cluster, corresponding to the 7th row of the
matrix, is the hardest to match. These are the probabilities of people in the top 1% either
staying within the top 1% or falling down to other positions of the distribution. There is a
lot of movement in the data: the probability of staying is a mere 8.3%, while the probability
of moving down to the bottom 25% is a non-negligible 11.2%. Our simulated probability of
staying is 12.2%, close enough to the empirical one; yet our estimate for the probability of
falling down to the bottom is almost twice its empirical counterpart.


4.3    Independent evidence

We discuss here independent evidence which bears on the fit of the model with regards to
savings, bequests, and wealth mobility. These are essentially moments we have not explicitly
targeted, against which it is interesting to check how our estimates fare.
Savings. In order to highlight the effect of the bequest motive on savings, we calculate
the (non-targeted) savings rates for different wealth fractiles in our simulation and compare
them with the empirical values calculated by Saez and Zucman (2016) using 2000-2009 data
on wealth accumulation with the capitalized income tax method; see Table 5. Synthetic
saving rates (defined by grouping everyone within a certain wealth fractile and calculating
the ratio between changes in total wealth and total income of this group) are increasing with
wealth levels both in the data and in our simulation. While the simulation misses the saving
rate of the top 10 − 1%, it does reasonably well for the top 1% and the bottom 90%.

Bequests. The distribution of bequests in our model maps closely the stationary wealth
distribution. It is also consistent with the distribution of actual and expected bequests in
various micro-level data. For example, Hurd and Smith (2003) use the HRS to characterize
such distributions and find the bequests are very skewed, just as the cross-sectional wealth.
       A crucial implication of our estimates is that the savings rate, part of which is driven
by the bequest motive, is increasing in wealth.19 To examine whether this feature is also
a characteristics of the data, we examine the age profile of wealth. Figure 5 plots the
wealth profiles for the U.S. population above age 55 based on the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS). The three lines correspond to (from bottom to top) 25%, median, and 75%
percentiles of the wealth distribution. We see that indeed retirement savings do not decline
along the age path, and that this pattern is more accentuated for the 75% percentile, as our
estimates imply.20
  19
     The bequest motive stands on relative solid grounds: it is well documented that retirees do not run down
their wealth as predicted by the classical life-cycle consumption-savings model (Poterba et al., 2011).
  20
     Our model does not have a role for accidental bequests. Therefore, while the literature on retirement
savings distinguishes between precautionary saving motives for uncertain medical expenses (De Nardi et al.,
2010), uncertain and potentially large long-term care expenses (Ameriks et al., 2015a), family needs (Ameriks
et al., 2015b) and the genuine bequest motive, we necessarily lump all these into aggregate bequests.

Wealth mobility. The mobility matrix we use from Kennickell and Starr-McCluer (1997) is
based on estimates from a six-year panel data, not necessarily representing intergenerational
mobility. As explained previously, we choose this matrix because its Markov chain has a state
for the top 1% wealth share. However, we ask here whether our estimates are similar to other
intergenerational wealth mobility matrix in the literature. In particular, we compare our
results with the intergenerational wealth mobility matrix estimated by Charles and Hurst
(2003) with the PSID panel data. They have a five-state Markov chain, with each state
                                                                                            21
representing each quintile share of the wealth distribution:
  21
    Charles and Hurst (2003) report two versions of the matrix estimates, adjusting logs of parental and
child wealth by conditioning on different sets of variables. We use the one in which conditioning is limited
to age, which is more consistent with our model.

It should be noted that this transition matrix is a doubly stochastic matrix by construction,
as the states are even percentiles. As a consequence, the implied stationary distribution will
be uniform, 0.2 in each cell. The transition matrix estimated by Charles and Hurst (2003)
over only one generation is relatively close to the uniform stationary distribution, which
suggests a high intergenerational wealth mobility: people are churning quite fast in their
wealth ranking across generations.
   Our model simulations generate the following corresponding transition matrix which is

5        Counterfactual estimates

In this section we perform a set of counterfactual estimations of the model, under restricted
conditions. More in detail, we perform three sets of counterfactuals, corresponding to shut-
ting down each of the three main factors which can drive the distribution of wealth: (1)
capital income risk, (2) differential savings rates, and (3) stochastic earnings.
       The objective of this counterfactual analysis is twofold. First of all we aim at gauging
(and possibly, measuring) the relative importance of the various mechanisms we identified
as possibly driving the distribution of wealth. We also attempt at a better understanding
of which mechanism mostly affects which dimension of the wealth distribution and mobility.
Second, we interpret the counterfactuals as informal tests of identification of these mecha-
nisms, lack of identification implying that shutting down one or more of the mechanism has
limited effects on the fit for the targeted moments.


5.1       Re-estimation results

We examine the counterfactual estimates in detail in the following. In the counterfactual
with no capital income risk, we re-estimate the model under a constant rate of return. The
estimated parameters are in Table 8, the simulation moments in Table 6-7, Line 2.22 The
differential savings factor does not substitute for capital income risk, as the higher estimated
µ implies. However the saving rate is higher due to a higher relative preference for bequests
reflected in the estimate for A. Nonetheless, the model now misses completely in matching
the top 1% of the wealth fractiles, which is reduced to about 1/6th of the baseline (and the
data). The simulated wealth distribution becomes less skewed but does not entirely collapse,
  22
    The standard errors for the parameters in the counterfactual re-estimations tend to be large. In other
words, the surface of the objective function is flat under the counterfactual restrictions, while it is not in
our baseline estimation. This indicates that i) all the three factors are necessary to deliver an overall good
match for the targeted moments; ii) when we shut down one of the factors, the other two end up being close
substitutes in producing the overall (not as good) fit. We nonetheless base some of our comments on the
point estimates.



                                                     22
it has less mass on the top 10% and more of the bottom 80%. The match in mobility is also
off: the top 1-5% has a too low a probability of staying and the bottom 25% too high.
       In the counterfactual with homogeneous saving rates, we set µ = 2, that is, we set the
curvature parameter of the bequest utility equal to the curvature of consumption utility, so
that agents with different wealth save at the same rate. The estimated parameters are in
Table 9, the simulation moments in Table 6-7, Line 3. In terms of the estimates, preferences
for bequests are jacked way up, so as to increase the (now constant) saving rate in the
economy. Once again, the model misses to match the top 1% of the wealth fractiles, which
is reduced (though less than in the counterfactual with constant rate of return of wealth) to
about 1/5th of the baseline (and the data). Apart from the last percentile, the simulated
wealth distribution is not really less skewed, displaying even excessive mass on the top 60%.
The match in mobility is reasonably good.
       In the counterfactual with no stochastic earnings, we set a constant labor earnings profile.
We experiment with both a low and a high profile.23 The estimated parameters are in Table
10-11, the simulation moments in Table 6-7, Line 4-5. The differential savings mechanism
now, in either case, substitutes for the stochastic earning factor, as the lower estimated µ
implies. On the other hand the preference for bequests decreases in the low profile case.
While the low w counterfactual completely misses the wealth distribution, which is way less
skewed than the data, the high w does not do badly, and even the top 1%, while lower
than in the baseline and the data, is better than in all the other counterfactuals. A possible
interpretation of these results is that it is the level of the wage, in particular the low wage,
which creates a problem with the ability of the model to generate the observed wealth
distribution, because the poor get stuck and cannot afford to save. When the wage is high,
even if it is constant and not stochastic, the poor can afford to save and move up to better
populate the right tail, and the fit for the targeted moments of the wealth distribution is
  23
    The high earnings profile is the 3rd highest one (the top two yield a nonstationary distribution) and the
low earnings profile is the median one.



                                                     23
much better. The match in mobility is also not good. Interestingly, when w is low, the
staying probability of the top 1% is way too low (actually 0), while it is way too high (more
than three times that in the data) when w is high.

   In summary, all the factors we study in our quantitative analysis, stochastic earnings,
differential savings, and capital income risk, are crucial for generating the thick right tail
of the wealth distribution and sufficient mobility. A high constant w reduces the fit the
least. We cautiously interpret this result to imply that the stochastic earning mechanism
is the least important in driving the observed distribution of wealth. Furthermore, each of
the factors seems to have a distinct role. Stochastic earnings avoid poverty traps and allow
for upward mobility near the borrowing constraints as random returns on capital or capital
income risk have relatively small effects at low levels of wealth. Saving rate differentials help
match the top tail but they reduce social mobility as the rich get richer accumulating at
higher rates. Stochastic returns on wealth, or capital income risk, also contributes to the
thick top tail while allowing for social mobility, especially in terms of speeding up downward
mobility.


5.2    More on the earnings mechanism

In apparent contrast with our results, several previous papers in the literature have obtained
considerable success in matching the wealth distribution in the data with simulated models
fundamentally driven by the stochastic earnings mechanism. These simulated models how-


                                               26
ever appear driven by extreme assumptions either about the skewness of earnings (adding
an awesome state) or about the working life of agents.
      Kindermann and Krueger (2015), for instance, effectively estimate the (tail of the) earning
process, not directly from earnings data but rather to fit the wealth distribution data (as
we do for r). Their estimates imply that, at the stationary distribution of earnings, the top
0.25% of agents earn on average somewhere between 400 to 600 times the median income, that
is, at least $20, 000, 000 (median earnings are about $50, 000). While substantial uncertainty
pervades the data on top earners, this number appears implausibly high. In fact the top
0.1% of households have average incomes of about $4, 000, 000 (out of which $1, 637, 000 is
earnings, defined as wages, salaries, and pensions), which is of course more than the average
earnings of the top 0.25% (these calculations are according to Piketty-Saez’s World Top
Income Database for 2013-2014, which is not top-coded).
      Another successful simulation exercise driven by skewed earnings is Dı́az et al. (2003).24
They also use an excessively skewed earning process where roughly 6% of the top earners
have 46 times the labor endowment of the median. In the World Top Income Database
2013-14 the average income of the top 5% is $367,000. Even if it were all earnings, it would
correspond to no more that 7.5 times the median income. Similarly, in Castañeda et al.
(2003), at the stationary distribution for labor earnings in the simulation, the top 0.039%
earners have 1000 times the average labor endowment of the bottom 61%. Even if the bottom
61% earns a low $25,000 on average, the top 0.039% would have to earn $25,000,000. This
also appears implausibly high according to the World Top Income Database 2013-14.
      A feature complementing skewed earnings in producing heterogeneity in wealth accu-
mulation rates across agents is variable and random working life-span. Variable working
life-spans produce a fraction of agents with high sojourn times in high earnings states, which
implies in turn a better fit to the wealth distribution with less extreme skewness. For ex-
ample even though their awesome state is less extreme than in the above cited literature,
 24
      Dávila et al. (2012), Section 5.2, adopt this same calibration.


                                                        27
Kaymak and Poschke (2015) calibrate expected working lives to 45 years, with a constant
exponential decay rate into retirement of µ = 1/45. This implies a substantial fraction of
agents with an excessive working life-span at the stationary distribution: over 100 years for
11% of the working population (of these 11%, those at the high earnings states populate the
tail of the wealth distribution).25
       We conclude that without extremely skewed labor earnings or extreme working life-span
variability, it may not be possible for enough agents to accumulate enough wealth to popu-
late the tail of wealth distribution via saved earnings alone. More generally, barring other
mechanisms contributing to thick tails in wealth, the skewness of the earnings distributions
tends to translate one-for-one to the distribution of wealth; see Benhabib and Bisin (2015).
But in the data wealth is substantially more skewed than earnings,26 making it difficult to
match the data with stochastic earnings only.



6        Transitional dynamics of the wealth distribution

As we have noticed, our quantitative analysis is predicated on the assumption that the
observed distribution of wealth is a stationary distribution, in the sense that our estimates
are obtained by matching the data with the moments of the stationary distribution generated
by the model. In this section we instead begin studying the implications of our model for
the transitional dynamics of the distribution of wealth.
       The exercise we perform is as follows: using the observed SCF 1962-1963 distribution
of wealth as initial condition, we estimate the parameters of the model by matching the
implied distribution after 72 years (two iterations of the model) with the observed SCF 2007
distribution and the transition matrix adopted in the previous quantitative analysis.27
  25
      Kaplan et al. (2015) also use the same perpetual youth calibration as in Kaymak and Poschke (2015).
  26
      In the SCF 2007, the Pareto tail, an inverse measure of skewness of the distribution, is estimated to be
1.09 for wealth (net worth), 1.71 for total income, 2.13 for earnings.
   27
      While the analysis does not require nor imposes any stationarity of the distribution of wealth over time,

Notes: The objective value is 0.1035 in simulation (1) matching both distribution and mo-
bility moments, and 0.5141 in simulation (2) matching only the distribution moments.


    Reporting results in Tables 12-14, we distinguish two separate exercises we conducted. In
the first (results in the upper panel of the tables) we target both the moments of the wealth
distribution and those of the transition matrix, as in our previous quantitative exercise. In
the second (results in the lower panel) we only target the moments of the wealth distribution.
    The estimated parameters are relatively close to those estimated in the baseline. We
are then encouraged to conclude that the stationarity assumption imposed in the main
quantitative analysis of this paper is not unreasonable.
    We also note that the fit with the fractals of the wealth distribution is reasonably close
in both cases. In particular, we match the top 1%, which is an indication of how well the
model performs in the tail. As the second case only targets the distributional moments, it
performs slightly better in this regard, as expected. The slightly worse distributional mo-
do not feed in the analysis the observed fiscal policy reforms since the 0 600 s. Doing so should improve the
fit.

      ments match in the first case is compensated by a better job with the mobility moments (the
      simulated mobility moments in the second case are substantially larger than the empirical
      counterparts).
             Finally, this exercise provides useful information about the implied speed of convergence
      of the model. In this respect, Gabaix et al. (2015) show that in continuous-time models the
      typical wealth distribution dynamics deliver extremely slow convergence in simulations. To
      remedy this they introduce exogenous variability in the growth rate or drift term of their
      model. This helps fill the fat tail of the wealth distribution faster, as the few lucky agents
      drawing long sequences of high growth rates fill the tail faster. In our model stochastic
      returns play the same role and the tail is filled faster.28

7     Conclusions

We estimate a macroeconomic model of the distribution of wealth in the U.S. While we
assign special emphasis on the tail of the distribution, the model performs well in fitting the
whole distribution of wealth in the data. Importantly, the model is also successful in fitting
the social mobility of wealth in the data.
    Our analysis allows us to distinguish the contributions of three critical factors driving
wealth accumulation: a skewed and persistent distribution of earnings, differential saving
and bequest rates across wealth levels, and capital income risk in entrepreneurial activities.
All of these three factors are necessary and empirically relevant in matching both distribution
and mobility, with a distinct role for each, which we identify.
    Finally, we begin studying the implications of the model for the transitional dynamics of
the distribution of wealth. The estimates are qualitatively similar to those in the baseline,
and our model delivers fast transitional dynamics. While more work is obviously necessary
in this respect, our results are quite encouraging.
