                        A Direct Estimate of the Technique Effect:
             Changes in the Pollution Intensity of US Manufacturing 1990-2008


1. Introduction

       From 1990 to 2008, the real value of US manufacturing output grew by 35 percent while

the pollution emitted from US factories fell by 52 to 69 percent, depending on the pollutant. This

tremendous decrease in the pollution-intensity of US production has two possible causes:

composition or technique. Either US manufacturers produced proportionally more goods whose

production processes involve less pollution, or manufacturers adopted technologies that enabled

production of the same goods with less pollution – cleaner fuels, energy efficiency, end-of-pipe

abatement equipment, or other production process changes.

       Economists have noticed this trend for some time, but all of the research to date parsing

the cleanup of manufacturing into those two components – composition and technique – has

involved careful documentation of composition changes in the manufacturing sector, with any

leftover pollution reductions being attributed to technique changes. Most find that composition

changes do not explain even half of the cleanup of manufacturing and that therefore technology

changes must explain the majority. If true, this is welcome news. If composition changes had

explained the US manufacturing cleanup that would raise logical follow-up questions: Where are

those polluting factories going? Could those other places replicate the US cleanup without

finding even more polluted places to offshore their polluting industries? But if technique changes

explain the US cleanup, that process could be easily replicable by follow-on countries that adopt

technologies developed elsewhere.

       For carbon pollution the importance of these distinctions is compounded. Any US

cleanup that results from composition changes due to shifting US manufacturing abroad has no




                                                1
climate mitigation benefits, because carbon emitted overseas is just as damaging as carbon

emitted domestically. But any US cleanup that results from technique changes represents real

reductions in global pollution and real climate benefits. So the conclusion that most of the

cleanup stems from technique represents good news.

       But the estimates of the technique effect to date also leave room for worry. Prior

estimates have relied on emissions intensities from a single year, 1987, and the technique effect

has only been measured as a residual, a left-over-amount of cleanup after the other plausible

explanations are exhausted. Its magnitude could be the product of peculiarities of the 1987

emissions inventory, some accounting or measurement error, or unaccounted interactions among

other trends. Those concerns would be alleviated if the technique effect were estimated more

directly as changes over time in the emissions intensities of industries, holding the composition

of those industries constant. The data for that calculation are now available.

       In what follows I provide the first direct estimate of the technique effect. I use the six

iterations of the National Emissions Inventories between 1990 and 2008, listing the amount of

pollution emitted by each of over 400 manufacturing industries. I combine those data with the

NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database to generate pollution per dollar of output for each

of those industries, deflated by industry-specific producer price indexes. I then aggregate across

industries using analogs to the Laspeyres and Paasche price indexes to get a single measure of

cleanup for each of six major air pollutants. Those index measures describe aggregate declines in

pollution per dollar of output for the whole manufacturing sector from 1990 to 2008, abstracting

away from composition changes. In the end, the calculations using this direct estimation of the

technique effect support the research findings using indirect measures. From 1990 to 2008,




                                                 2
pollution per dollar of output from US manufacturing declined by 64 to 77 percent. More than 90

percent of this cleanup can be attributed to technique changes, directly.



2. What we know so far

        Several recent studies have estimated the effect of changes in the composition of the

manufacturing sector by disaggregating output changes among various industries and projecting

their separate emissions using fixed industry-specific measures of pollution-intensity.1 The

standard approach notes that total pollution from manufacturing (P) can be calculated as

                              ܲ ൌ ෍ ‫݌‬௜ ൌ ෍ ‫ݒ‬௜ ‫ݖ‬௜ ൌ ܸ ෍ ߠ௜ ‫ݖ‬௜                                                  (1)
                                     ௜          ௜               ௜



where pi represents pollution from industry i, vi is the value of output, zi is the emissions intensity

or pollution per dollar of output, and ߠ௜ is (‫ݒ‬௜ Ȁܸ) the share of each industry in total

manufacturing output.

        The composition effect can be seen by calculating the predicted total pollution from

manufacturing (ܲ෠) holding those emissions intensities in the last term in (1) constant (‫ݖ‬ҧ).

                                          ܲ෠ ൌ ܸ ෍ ߠ௜ ‫ݖ‬ҧ                                                      (2)
                                                    ௜



Any changes in ܲ෠ over time are due solely to changes in the overall scale (V) of manufacturing

or its composition (ߠ). And any difference between ܲ෠ and actual pollution P must be due to

changes in emissions intensities – or technique.

        Figure 1 depicts the basic idea for sulfur dioxide (SO2). Line (1) plots the total inflation-

adjusted output of the US manufacturing sector from 1990 to 2008, indexed so that 1990=100.

1
 See, for example, Brunel (2014), Levinson (2009), Cole (2000, 2004), Ederington et al. (2004), Kahn (2003), and
Hettige et al. (1992).


                                                        3
This is the scale effect, which increased 35 percent. Line (2) plots the total manufacturing

emissions of SO2, originally in tons but indexed so that 1990=100. SO2 pollution declined 65

percent, which means that SO2 per dollar of manufacturing output declined by 74 percent. Table

1 contains the data behind lines (1) and (2) in Figure 1 for SO2, along with the data for four other

major air pollutants. Pollution per dollar of manufacturing output fell by 64 to 77 percent,

depending on the pollutant, a cleanup that in each case must be explained by some combination

of composition and technique.

         Line (3) of Figure 1 depicts predicted SO2 pollution (ܲ෠) from equation (2), based solely

on changes in the composition and scale of manufacturing. That prediction (ܲ෠) rises 23 percent,

nearly as much as manufacturing overall, which means that the composition effect can only

explain about 12 percent of the decline in SO2 per dollar of manufacturing output.2 Indirectly, 88

percent most of the cleanup of SO2 must be attributable to the residual – the “technique effect.”

         In Levinson (2009) I estimate (indirectly) that from 1987 to 2001, between 60 and 95

percent of the cleanup of US manufacturing was attributable to technique. Brunel (2014)

replicates this analysis for the European Union from 1995 to 2008 and finds that air pollution

from manufacturing declined there as well, and that little or none of that cleanup can be

explained by changes in the composition of Europe’s manufacturing sector. Most, therefore, she

attributes to changes in technique. Martin (2014) shows that declining greenhouse gas emissions

in India have been due more to productivity gains within industries than reallocations among

productive and unproductive industries. And Shapiro and Walker (2014) take a more ambitious

structural approach that leads to similar conclusions. Trends in US manufacturing pollution are

  Manufacturing rose 35 percent, and SO2 pollution fell 65 percent, so pollution per dollar of output fell 74 percent.
(1-(0.35)/(1.35)). Pollution predicted from composition (ܲ෠) grew 23 percent, so composition accounts for 12 percent
of the 74 percent decline in pollution per dollar: (1.35 –1.23)/(1.35 – 0.35).


                                                          4
not explained by the scale or composition industries within manufacturing, and so must be driven

by changes in technique.

           But all of this work that credits most of the manufacturing cleanup to technique does so

as a residual source of improvement after the composition and scale changes have been

accounted for. And this approach has several problems. Most importantly, it assumes there are

no interactions between scale, composition and technique – that changing the scale of an industry

(vi) does not affect its pollution intensity (zi) for example. Any such interactions would all be

erroneously included in the remainder term and attributed to technique effects in this approach.

           Second, because the time-varying measures of pollution intensity I use here were not

available, all of the prior approaches use emissions intensities from a single year – most often the

1987 Industrial Pollution Projection System (IPPS) developed by the World Bank (Hettige et al,

1995). If over time the faster-growing industries cleaned up more, in percentage terms, then

using base-year pollution intensities for ‫ݖ‬ҧin equation (2) misses that change and overstates the

role of technique. If the slower-growing industries cleaned up more, then using base-year ‫ݖ‬ҧ

understates the role of technique. In this paper I address both shortcomings by estimating the

technique effect directly using time-varying measures of pollution intensity.



3. Data and the Indexes

           To estimate industry-specific pollution intensities I combine two sets of data. The first is

the US EPA’s National Emissions Inventory (NEI). The NEI is a national aggregation of

emissions data from state, local, and federal sources, compiled intermittently from 1990 to

2008.3 Pollutant coverage varies, but coverage of six major air pollutants has been mostly

consistent since the beginning: carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide
3
    The NEI data are from 1990, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.


                                                         5
(SO2), particulate matter smaller than 10 microns and 2.5 microns (PM10 and PM2.5), and

volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The NEI reports the amount of each pollutant emitted per

year for each source, along with the industry to which that source belongs.4

        The second dataset is the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database.5 That contains

the annual output of each industry, along with industry-specific price deflators. I merge the two

datasets by industry and year, and divide aggregate pollution by value shipped to get an industry-

specific measure of pollution intensity for each of the three NEI years. 6 Before describing the

results, it’s worth highlighting some key data challenges: changing industry definitions, price

indexes, base-year index choices, and industry composition issues.



Changing industry definitions: SIC and NAICS

        The 1990, 1996, and 1999 NEI data are categorized according to four-digit Standard

Industrial Classification (SIC) codes, while the 2005 and 2008 NEI data are categorized

according to six-digit North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes.7 Each is

a hierarchical numerical taxonomy of industries, with similar industries grouped into separate

classifications. To match the two I rely on the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database,

which publishes industry data according to both industry codes along with a concordance

between the two.

        For half of the 473 six-digit NAICS codes, the match is one-to-one with a corresponding

four-digit SIC code.8 For the others, I matched the pollution from SIC and NAICS industries



4
  More information about the NEI can be found here: http://www.epa.gov/ttnchie1/trends/.
5
  http://www.nber.org/nberces/
6
  As I describe later, similar results come from using value added rather than value shipped.
7
  The 2002 NEA is listed both ways.
8
  For example, SIC 3061, “Molded, Extruded, and Lathe-Cut Mechanical Rubber Goods,” has simply been relabeled
as NAICS 326291, “Rubber Product Manufacturing for Mechanical Use.”


                                                     6
according to the share of value shipped in each.9 In what follows, I report calculations both ways:

converting the early NEI data to NAICS categories, and converting the more recent NEI data to

SIC codes.



Price indexes

        In order to assess whether pollution per dollar of output has declined, I need real values

of output. But prices changed between 1990 and 2008 differently for different industries. For

energy intensive industries like petrochemicals and copper smelters, prices tripled for reasons

unrelated to the characteristics of the products. A barrel of oil or a bar of copper was the same

product in 2008 as it was in 1990, just more expensive. If I were to use the overall producer price

index (PPI) rather than industry-specific price indexes, I would exaggerate the size of these

pollution-intensive industries in 2008 and overstate the technique effect. For these industries,

using industry-specific price indexes is important.

        For industries like computers and semiconductors, the price indexes fell by up to 99

percent, due to changes in the products themselves. A computer in 2008 was not the same

product as in 1990, though manufacturing it might well involve similar quantities of pollution.

Industry-specific price indexes inflate the growth of these relatively clean industries,

understating the technique effect. To be conservative, in what follows I report results using

industry-specific price deflators.




9
 For example, the concordance reports that 92 percent of the value shipped from SIC code 3313,
“Electrometallurgical Products, Except Steel,” can now be classified as NAICS 331112, “Electrometallurgical
Ferroalloy Product Manufacturing.” So I assign 92 percent of the pollution from SIC 3313 to NAICS 331112 as
well.


                                                       7
Index issues: Laspeyres and Paasche

       Directly estimating the technique effect involves a very standard index problem: what

weight do we assign to each industry, given that the industries’ shares of total output changed

from 1990 to 2008? As with any index problem, there are two basic choices. We can create the

index of change by comparing actual 1990 emissions to what the current emissions would have

been, had the individual industries’ emissions intensities changed from 1990 but each industry’s

output remained as it was in 1990.

where zit is the emissions intensity for industry i in year t, and vit is the value shipped from

industry i in year t. This would be analogous to a Laspeyres price index, with pollution

intensities in place of prices. Hence the subscript L.

       Alternatively, we can create the index by comparing actual current emissions to what the

1990 emissions would have been, had each industry’s output in 1990 been as it is currently.

                                            σ௜ ‫ݖ‬௜௧ ൈ ‫ݒ‬௜௧
                                    ‫ܫ‬௉ ൌ                                                           (4)
                                           σ௜ ‫ݖ‬௜ǡଵଽଽ଴ ൈ ‫ݒ‬௜௧



This is the analog to a Paasche price index, subscripted P.

       For prices, the Laspeyres index overstates inflation and the Paasche index understates

inflation, assuming people adjust to changing relative prices by consuming more of the goods

whose prices grow least. In this pollution context, the relative sizes of the two indexes depend on

whether the manufacturing sector has shifted towards or away from industries whose pollution

intensities have fallen the most. If between 1990 and 2008 the manufacturing sector produced



                                                    8
relatively less output in industries with the fastest-falling pollution intensities, the Laspeyres

index will be smaller than the Paasche index and suggest a larger technique effect. If output grew

more in those industries with the fastest-falling pollution intensities, Laspeyres will be larger

than Paasche and suggest a smaller technique effect.

       Although I am using the indexes in equations (3) and (4) to answer the same question as

others have addressed, the approach here is fundamentally different. Rather than holding

technique fixed, examining predicted pollution (ܲ෠) from changes in scale and composition as in

equation (2), and attributing the rest to technique, I do the reverse. I hold composition of output

fixed and show how pollution per dollar of output for the aggregate manufacturing sector has

changed.



Intra-industry composition effects

       One final note deserves mention here. The use of changes in the emissions intensities of

six-digit NAICS codes cannot entirely identify the technique effect, separate from any change in

industry composition. This is because the disaggregate industry definitions are themselves

heterogeneous. In other words, within each 6-digit NAICS code there are sub-industries with

varying degrees of pollution intensity. Over time, the composition of sub-industries within any

six-digit NAICS code may change, potentially altering the pollution intensity of the six-digit

industry – the zi. While this approach would attribute the change in that industry’s pollution

intensity to “technique,” as described it may be due to an undocumented change in composition.




                                                   9
4. Results


       Table 2 reports the Laspeyres and Paasche indexes of pollution intensity for the whole

manufacturing sector, calculated according to equations (3) and (4) for the whole time period.

Sulfur dioxide emissions per dollar of output fell 68.3 percent to 0.317 by the Laspeyres index

and 71.4 percent to 0.286 according to the Paasche index. The indexes for the other four air

pollutants fell similar amounts, ranging from 58 to 78 percent. These are direct estimates of the

technique effect – the drop in pollution intensity of the US manufacturing sector, holding its

composition constant.

       Line (4) of Figure 1 plots this technique effect for SO2 using the Laspeyres index, by

multiplying the index value (0.317 for 2008) by total real manufacturing output ($5491 for 2008)

and indexing the result so that 1990=100. This SO2 prediction based on technique and scale

alone, holding composition fixed, declines almost as much as actual pollution, depicting the

degree to which the overall cleanup stems from technique rather than composition.

       Finally, Table 3 puts the two calculations together and calculates the share of the cleanup

of manufacturing depicted in Figure 1 and documented in Table 1 that is due to the technique

effect reported in Table 2. Column (1) just reports the total cleanup of manufacturing from Table

1 – the gap between manufacturing growth and pollution depicted in Figure 1. Columns (2) and

(4) report the percentage declines in the Laspeyres and Paasche indexes. And columns (3) and

(5) take the ratio of the two – the share of total cleanup of manufacturing in column (1) that is

explained by the industry-by-industry cleanup indexes in columns (2) and (4). Those shares all

exceed 90 percent.

       For volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the share explained by technique using the

Paasche index exceeds 100 percent, which bears some explaining. How can technique account



                                                 10
for more than 100 percent of the cleanup? From 1990 to 2008 the US manufacturing sector

shifted towards industries that in 1990 had production processes that generated a lot of VOCs,

which means that the composition effect was negative. 10 A version of Figure 1 drawn for VOCs

shows line (3) rising above line (1). If each industry kept its 1990 pollution intensity, VOC

emissions would have grown even faster than overall manufacturing, because the sector shifted

towards more pollution-intensive products.

           For comparison with prior research, in the last column of Table 3 I report the share of the

cleanup of each pollutant from the technique effect using the earlier method, as a residual after

calculating the composition effect. In the context of Figure 1 this is like calculating the technique

effect from the difference between lines 2 and 3 instead of between lines 1 and 4. In most cases,

the technique share of the cleanup is even larger when measured directly, suggesting that if

anything, the prior literature that explained the technique effect as a residual understated its role.

The cleanup of US manufacturing is almost entirely explained by declines in pollution intensity

among individual 6-digit industries, not by changes in the relative shares of those industries.

           One other notable feature of Tables 2 and 3 is that for each pollutant, the Laspeyres index

declined slightly less than the Paasche index, suggesting a smaller decline in pollution intensity.

That means that over these periods, pollution intensities declined the most in US manufacturing

industries that grew as a share of total output. The distinction is small, but it runs counter to

conventional wisdom. On average US manufacturing industries that cleaned up the most did not

shrink as a share of the whole sector, they grew.

Robustness Checks

       Table 4 recalculates the indexes by converting the 2008 NEI data to an SIC-code basis,

rather than converting 1990 NEI to a NAICS-code basis. The results are largely the same,

differing by a percentage point at most.

       Table 5 recalculates the pollution intensities (the zi’s) as pollution per dollar of value

added rather than value shipped. There are some slight differences: for some pollutants the

technique effect appears larger using value added; for others the technique effect is slightly

smaller. But the overall conclusion remains, that technique accounts for 90 percent or more of

the cleanup of US manufacturing.



Conclusions

       This simple exercise demonstrates a remarkable change over the past two decades. Air

pollution emitted by US manufacturers has fallen by two-thirds, and that cleanup has almost

entirely come from reductions in emissions intensity of each of the more than 400 industries that

comprise the manufacturing sector rather than from shifts in the shares of those industries in

overall manufacturing output – from technique rather than composition.

       Although simple, the result is newsworthy for two reasons. First, it supports past research

that came to the same conclusion via different methods. Prior studies have held emissions

intensities constant, predicted pollution changes due to composition changes, and attributed the

remainder to technique. Here I hold industry composition constant and predict pollution changes

due to technique directly. As a consequence, the finding here is not subject to the same concerns,

that the residual labeled “technique” may be a function of unaccounted interactions or

peculiarities of the base-year emissions intensities.




                                                 12
       Second, the finding runs counter to perceptions about the effects of environmental

cleanup on US manufacturing. While I don’t assess the cause of that cleanup here, one natural

speculation would be that it has resulted from environmental regulations. If so, those regulations

have not worked by reducing the share of polluting industries in the US manufacturing sector –

driving those industries overseas or reducing consumption of those industries’ products. Instead,

they have worked by reducing the emissions intensities on an industry-by-industry basis. That

finding should be welcomed by anybody concerned that US regulations might appear to be

succeeding, but only by reducing the menu of products available to American consumers or by

shifting pollution from the US to other countries. The results here directly refute that concern.
