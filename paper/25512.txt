The Nonpuzzling Behavior of Median Inflation

NBER Working Paper No. 25512
January 2019
JEL No. E31

                                          ABSTRACT

Economists are puzzled by the behavior of U.S. inflation since the Great Recession of 2008-2009,
and many suggest that the Phillips curve relating inflation to unemployment has broken down.
This paper argues that inflation behavior is easier to understand if we divide headline inflation
into core and transitory components, and if core inflation is measured by the weighted median of
industry inflation rates. This weighted median is less volatile than the traditional measure of core
inflation, the inflation rate excluding food and energy prices, because it filters out large price
changes in all industries. We illustrate the usefulness of the weighted median with a case study of
inflation in 2017 and early 2018. We also show that a Phillips curve relating the weighted median
to unemployment appears clearly in the data for 1985-2017, with no sign of a breakdown in 2008.

1     Introduction

For decades, textbooks have explained inflation behavior with Friedman’s (1968) Phillips

curve: the inflation rate depends on expected inflation and the deviation of unemployment

from its natural rate. Yet this theory has always been controversial, and skepticism has

been rampant in the decade since the 2008 financial crisis. For several years following the

crisis, researchers such as Stock (2011) and Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015) puzzled over a

“missing deflation”: inflation did not fall much despite a sharp rise in the unemployment rate.

More recently, as the economy has approached full employment, economists have puzzled

over the failure of inflation to rise toward the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. According to

Bernstein (2017), recent low inflation is “puzzle #1 in economics.”

    Some observers, such as Summers (2017) and The Economist (2017), have lost patience

with the Phillips curve and suggested it is “broken.” Blinder (2018) wonders “whether the

Phillips curve has died or has just taken an extended vacation.” Blanchard (2016) offers a

tepid defense of the theory, saying the Phillips curve is alive and “at least as well as it has

been in the past.” Blanchard emphasizes that the residuals in the relationship are large.

    This paper argues that inflation behavior is less puzzling if we separate the headline

inflation rate into two components: an underlying or core level of inflation that the Phillips

curve explains, and a transitory component arising from changes in relative prices due to

microeconomic factors. A good proxy for the core inflation rate is a measure proposed by

Bryan and Cecchetti (1994): the weighted median of price changes across industries.

    Many previous researchers, and the policymakers at the Federal Reserve, examine core

inflation in an effort to filter out transitory shocks. However, the usual measure of core

inflation is the inflation rate excluding the prices of food and energy. That variable filters out

shocks in the food and energy industries, but many other industries also experience large price

changes that materially influence the headline inflation rate. The weighted median filters

out all of these shocks, producing a less noisy measure of core inflation whose movements



                                                1
are easier to understand.

   Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the theoretical case for measuring core inflation with

the weighted median, and the previous empirical literature. Section 3 begins our empirical

work by examining the univariate behavior of alternative measures of core inflation. We

show that, for both the CPI and PCE deflator versions of inflation, the weighted median of

industry price changes is less volatile than inflation excluding food and energy.

   Section 4 illustrates the usefulness of weighted median inflation with a careful study

of inflation over 2017 and early 2018. Some observers believe that inflation behavior was

especially puzzling during that period; in particular, despite low unemployment rates, the

Fed’s preferred measure of core inflation, the twelve-month percentage change in the PCE

deflator less food and energy, fell from 1.9 in December 2016 to 1.3 in August 2017 and 1.5 in

December. At a September press conference, Fed Chair Yellen said that low inflation before

2017 was consistent with the Fed’s specification of the Phillips curve, but:

   This year, the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent...is more of a mystery, and I will not
say that the [Federal Open Market] Committee clearly understands what the causes are of
that.

   We show that this mystery disappears if we measure core inflation with the weighted

median inflation rate rather than inflation ex-food and energy. The weighted median does

not fall significantly over 2017 because it filters out price decreases in a number of industries

that pushed down the Fed’s core-inflation measure. Examining the weighted median also

helps resolve confusion among policymakers about an apparent uptick in core inflation in

early 2018.

   Section 5 turns to the Phillips curve. We examine the fit of a simple specification in which

quarterly core inflation depends on expected inflation (as measured by long-term forecasts

from the Survey of Professional Forecasters) and the cyclical component of unemployment

(as measured by the Hodrick-Prescott filter). We first measure core inflation with inflation

less food and energy, and see the source of recent skepticism about the Phillips curve: the

equation fits the data poorly, especially for inflation in the PCE deflator and especially since

                                               2
2008. We then see that the Phillips curve shows up clearly when core inflation is measured

more precisely with weighted median inflation.

    All in all, our results suggest that economists should use the weighted median or related

variables (such as trimmed means of industry price changes) as their primary measures of

core inflation. Researchers should also work on refining these measures. Section 6 concludes

this paper by discussing directions for future research.



2     Background

According to the Phillips curve, the inflation rate depends on expected inflation and the

level of slack in the economy. Economists often suggest, however, that inflation movements

are also influenced by price changes in certain industries. We will discuss, for example,

Chair Yellen’s view that large price decreases for cell phone services and prescription drugs

reduced inflation during 2017. In earlier episodes, economists have explained high inflation

with rising medical costs, and low inflation with falling prices of imported goods.

    The practice of explaining aggregate inflation with industry price changes can, however,

be dangerous. There are always some prices that rise by significantly more than the aggregate

inflation rate and others that rise by less or fall; that is, there are always changes in relative

prices. If the inflation rate is higher than the Phillips curve predicts, one can always find a

cheap “explanation” by citing industries whose prices have risen by more than average; low

inflation can be explained by industries with price decreases. To avoid such vacuity, we need

a theory of which relative-price changes truly affect aggregate inflation.

    Ball and Mankiw (1995) present such a theory, one in which relative price changes matter

if they are unusually large. This result arises because, with costs of nominal price adjustment,

large shocks to industries’ optimal prices induce them to change their actual prices, while

prices are sticky in response to smaller shocks. The disproportionate effects of large shocks

imply that inflation is influenced by asymmetries in the distribution of price changes across


                                                3
industries. If there is a tail of unusually large price increases, skewing the distribution to the

right, that raises inflation; a tail of large price decreases does the opposite. Ball and Mankiw

find strong support for these predictions in U.S. data.

   Measures of core inflation are intended to filter out the effects on headline inflation of

unusual relative price changes, thereby isolating the component of inflation explained by the

Phillips curve. In pioneering work, Bryan and Cecchetti (1994) develop a measure of core

inflation by extending the reasoning of Ball and Mankiw. If asymmetries in the price-change

distribution cause fluctuations in headline inflation, then one can measure core inflation by

eliminating the effects of these asymmetries. A simple variable that does so is the median

of industry price changes, weighted by industries’ relative importance in the aggregate price

index.

   The traditional measure of core inflation is the inflation rate excluding food and energy

prices. In the U.S. economy, many of the large relative price changes that influence inflation

occur in food and energy industries (especially energy), so dropping those industries is a step

toward isolating the core level of inflation. However, large relative price changes also occur

in industries other than food and energy. Based on the disaggregated PCE deflator, Dolmas

(2005) reports that large price changes are common in industries such as computers and

software, televisions, clothing, airline services, financial services, and auto insurance. As we

will see in our empirical work, filtering out large shocks to all industries with the weighted

median yields a core-inflation measure that is less volatile and easier to understand than

inflation less food and energy.

   Weighted-median measures of core inflation–as well as trimmed means of industry price

changes, which also filter out large shocks–have gained increasing attention in recent years.

In 2016, the Bank of Canada announced that it would include a weighted median and

trimmed mean among its primary measures of core inflation. Yet most researchers still define

core inflation as inflation excluding food and energy. Staff at the Federal Reserve produce

forecasts of PCE deflator inflation less food and energy, and this variable is a focus of FOMC


                                                4
meetings and speeches by Fed officials. We hope that this paper helps push economists and

policymakers toward changing their measures of core inflation.

        This paper studies the behavior of two versions of weighted median inflation. One is the

weighted median CPI inflation rate published by the Cleveland Fed, which is currently based

on dividing the basket of goods in the CPI into 45 industries. The other is a weighted median

PCE deflator inflation rate that we have constructed from data on 178 industries provided by

the Dallas Fed. Researchers at Dallas use these data to construct a trimmed-mean measure

of core inflation; we construct a weighted median instead for comparability with the median

CPI series. The relative merits of the weighted-median and trimmed-mean measures of core

inflation are an important topic for future research.1



3         Univariate Evidence

This section examines the univariate behavior of headline inflation, inflation excluding food

and energy, and weighted median inflation. We examine the period 1985-2017. We find that

both of the core-inflation measures filter out much of the transitory variation in headline

inflation, but that the weighted median filters out more and is therefore less volatile.

        Table 1 measures the volatility of each inflation series with the standard deviation of the

change in inflation. We compute this statistic for both the CPI and PCE deflator versions

of inflation. We examine annualized monthly inflation rates, annualized quarterly inflation

rates, and a monthly series on the inflation rate over the previous twelve months.2

        The results in the Table are consistent across the two price indexes and the three data
    1
      A number of previous researchers advocate weighted medians or trimmed means as measures of core
inflation because these variables are strongly correlated with an underlying trend in headline inflation, or
because they are good forecasters of future inflation. Examples include Bryan et al. (1997), Clark (2001),
Smith (2004), Brischetto and Richards (2006), and Ball and Mazumder (2011). Crone et al. (2013) question
the value of medians and trimmed means for forecasting.
    2
      The series for median CPI inflation from the Cleveland Fed is monthly, and our series for median PCE
inflation is derived from monthly data on industry inflation rates. We multiply monthly inflation by 12
to produce annualized inflation rates. To derive annualized quarterly inflation rates, we convert monthly
inflation to monthly price levels, average over three months to get quarterly price levels, compute the
percentage change from the previous to the current quarter, and multiply by four.


                                                     5
frequencies: the standard deviation of changes in inflation is smaller for inflation less food

and energy than for headline inflation, but smaller still for weighted median inflation. The

ratio of the standard deviations of changes in ex-food-energy and median inflation range

from 1.4 to 1.6 (except for monthly PCE data, where the ratio is higher because of an outlier

discussed below).

   To illustrate these results, Figure 1 presents the monthly time series for the two measures

of core inflation; in Figure 1A, both are based on the CPI price index, and in Figure 1B

they are based on the PCE deflator. We can see the greater volatility of the ex-food-energy

measure of core. In the CPI case, for example, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, median

inflation generally fluctuates in a range of about 3-5%; inflation less food and energy (CPIX

inflation) is often in the same range but spikes up to 6% or 7% in a number of months.

Stating in the late 1990s, CPIX inflation spikes downward to zero or below in a number

of months, whereas median inflation falls that far at only one point (February and March

2010).

   The PCE deflator graph also shows that ex-food-energy inflation is more volatile than

median inflation. Some of the months with outliers in PCE inflation less food and energy

(PCEX) are also outliers in CPIX inflation (such as March 2017, an observation that we

examine closely below). But other times, the outlier months differ for CPIX and PCEX. For

example, CPIX inflation spikes down to 0.2% in April 2013 and then rises to 2.7% in July

2013; PCEX inflation is more stable, with rates of 0.7% in April and 1.2% in July. Evidently,

movements in ex-food-energy measures of core inflation can differ due to differences in the

industries covered by the CPI and PCE deflator and/or differences in how industry prices

are measured.

   One episode produces large outliers in the PCEX data: the annualized inflation rate falls

to -6.6% in September 2001 and then jumps to 8.6% in October. These numbers reflect huge

transitory movements in life insurance premiums, which could be related to the September 11

terrorist attacks. Life insurance premiums fell at an annualized rate of -655% in September


                                              6
and then rebounded at a rate of 1457% in October. These price changes were large enough

to strongly influence monthly PCEX inflation rates. Weighted median inflation, by contrast,

filters out this episode along with less dramatic shocks to industry prices.

    Figure 2 compares our two versions of median inflation: median CPI inflation and median

PCE inflation. Usually, the two medians move together fairly closely: it appears that they

isolate more or less the same underlying level of inflation, despite the differences between the

CPI and PCE price indexes. The standard deviation of the difference between median CPI

and median PCE inflation is 0.7, compared to a standard deviation of 1.2 for the difference

between CPIX and PCEX inflation.

    As Figure 2 suggests, the average levels over time of the two medians are close. For

1985-2017, median CPI inflation averages 2.8% and median PCE inflation averages 2.7%.

By contrast, it is well known that the average levels of headline and ex-food-energy inflation

are higher for the CPI than for the PCE deflator. For 1985-2017, the averages of CPIX and

PCEX inflation are 2.6% and 2.2% respectively. For the PCE, the fact that the average of

median inflation (2.7%) significantly exceeds the average of PCEX inflation (2.2%) suggests

a tendency toward left skewness in the distribution of industry inflation rates. The reason

for such a pattern is unclear and might be a subject for future research.



4     A Case Study: Inflation in 2017-2018

Recent history helps us understand the usefulness of weighted median inflation. During

2017, the Fed’s primary measure of core inflation, the 12-month inflation rate in the PCEX,

fell noticeably despite low unemployment, a development that Fed Chair Yellen called a

“mystery” (Yellen (2017a)). In trying to explain this mystery, Yellen stated “there have

been some idiosyncratic factors I think that have held down inflation in recent months”

including price changes in several industries (Yellen (2017b)). We find that inflation in 2017

is less mysterious if we examine the weighted median, which filters out unusual price changes


                                               7
systematically. Examining the weighted median also resolves a puzzle about an uptick in

PCEX inflation in early 2018.

   Figure 3 shows inflation rates for the PCEX and median PCE from January 2017 through

March 2018. Panel A shows inflation over the previous 12 months, which is the focus of

many discussions by economists and policymakers. We see the behavior of 12-month PCEX

inflation that puzzled the Fed: This inflation rate fell from 1.9 percent in January to 1.3

percent in August and 1.5 percent in December, a period when the unemployment rate fell

from 4.8 to 4.1 percent. In discussing this experience in September, Chair Yellen said, “I

will not say that the [FOMC] clearly understands what the causes are.”

   The behavior of 12-month median PCE inflation is different. We see that this inflation

rate starts three tenths of a percent above PCEX inflation and stays above it, in line with

our earlier finding that average median PCE inflation is modestly higher than average PCEX

inflation. For our purposes, however, the key fact about 12-month median inflation is that it

is stable: it stays in a range from 2.0 to 2.2 throughout 2017. Policymakers would not have

perceived a puzzling decline in core inflation if the median were their measure of core.

   Panel B of Figure 3 shows the one-month inflation rates underlying the smoother 12-

month rates in Panel A. For PCEX, we see an important outlier: March 2017, when the

PCEX inflation rate was -1.8%. This rate is 3.8 points below the Fed’s inflation target of

2.0, so for 12-month periods including March 2017, that month pushes inflation below the

target by approximately (3.8)/12 = 0.32 points. Other months in 2017 that pull down the

12-month rate are May and November, which each have a PCEX inflation rate of 0.9. For

median PCE, by contrast, one-month inflation rates in 2017 stay in a relatively narrow range

from 1.4 to 2.9, leading to a very stable series when these rates are averaged over twelve

months.

   For the influential month of March 2017, Figure 4 shows a histogram of industry price

changes within the PCEX index. Each bar in the graph represents an interval of 5 percentage

points in annualized inflation rates and shows the total weights of the industries in that


                                              8
range. We see a tail of large price decreases that skews the histogram to the left and pulls

down PCEX inflation. Industries with sizable weights in the PCEX and highly negative

inflation rates include air transportation (weight of 0.5% and annualized inflation rate of -

65%), communications (weight of 2.5% and inflation rate of -38%), hotels and motels (weight

of 0.9% and inflation rate of -34%), and men’s and boys’ clothing (also weight of 0.9% and

inflation rate of -34%). Large price decreases also occur in smaller industries such as watches

and videocassettes and discs.

   In a series of speeches and news conferences in 2017, officials from the Federal Reserve

sought to explain the low level of PCEX inflation. On several occasions (in May, June,

September, and October), Fed officials cited a large decline in the quality-adjusted prices of

cell phone service that occurred when cell phone companies introduced unlimited data plans

(Brainard (2017), Yellen (2017b), Evans (2017), and Yellen (2017c)). In June, Fed Chair

Yellen also mentioned a drop in prescription drug prices, and in October she mentioned slow

growth in medical costs in general. In September, she suggested that “a variety of special

factors” had restrained inflation.

   In these remarks, Fed officials are trying in a haphazard way to do what the weighted

median inflation rate does more easily and systematically: uncover a stable level of underlying

inflation by filtering out unusual industry price changes. Yellen is right about “a variety of

factors”: many different industries contributed to the negative PCEX inflation of March

2017, and others contributed to the low inflation of May and November. Officials are also

on target in specifically mentioning cell phones, which are a significant factor in the March

outlier. The March inflation rate was -84% for cell phone services and -38% in the broader

communications sector.

   On the other hand, Yellen’s reference to prescription drugs is puzzling. Prices in that

industry rose at an annual rate of 4.7% in March and 3.4% over the 12 months of 2017,

numbers that go in the wrong direction for explaining low inflation. Yellen is correct that

some medical industries experienced low inflation in 2017; the prices of physician’s services,


                                              9
for example, rose by 0.5% over the 12 months. However, this inflation rate is only modestly

lower than aggregate PCEX inflation, and theory suggests that only large relative price

changes are relevant. In explaining aggregate inflation, it is suspect to point out industries

whose inflation rates are modestly higher or lower than average, because there are many

such industries at all times.

       We conclude that it would have been easier for the Fed to accurately interpret core-

inflation movements in 2017 if its measure of core had been weighted median inflation rather

than PCEX.3

       A focus on median inflation might also have clarified the Fed’s analysis of inflation in

early 2018. In the minutes of the FOMC meeting on May 1, some participants suggest that

inflation is likely to overshoot the Fed’s 2% target, noting “the recent increase in inflation.”

This increase is presumably the jump in 12-month PCEX inflation from 1.5% in February

to 1.8% in March, the last month for which the Committee had data. Other Committee

members question the importance of the increase, saying “it may have represented transitory

price changes in some categories of health care and financial services.”

       This reference to industry price changes, like some of Yellen’s remarks in 2017, are ques-

tionable. In the first three months of 2018, price changes in health care industries were

unremarkable. As the minutes suggest, the prices of financial services rose substantially in

March: the annualized inflation rate for financial charges, fees, and commissions was 24%.

But the effect on aggregate inflation was modest. The weight on financial fees in the PCEX

is 2.6%, which means the 24% inflation rate contributed approximately 0.6 percentage points

to PCEX inflation in March, and only 0.05 points to 12-month inflation.

       What then explains the March uptick in 12-month PCEX inflation? The answer is that

March 2018 is the month when the -1.8% inflation rate of March 2017 drops out of the 12-

month average, and is replaced by the current monthly rate of 1.9%. Some journalists, such
   3
    In her September speech, Yellen briefly mentions that trimmed mean inflation has fallen by less than
PCEX inflation, which is some acknowledgment of the usefulness of systematically filtering out large industry
price changes.



                                                     10
as Rugaber (2018) and Mutikani (2018), note the role of March 2017 in explaining 12-month

inflation a year later, but this point does not appear in the FOMC minutes.

    Once again, there is less inflation variability to explain, and potentially become confused

about, if we focus on weighted median inflation. Over the first three months of 2018, there

are no outliers in the monthly median inflation rates that enter or exit the 12-month average.

The 12-month inflation rate is stable at 2.2%.



5     Phillips Curves

Many of the economists who have puzzled over recent inflation behavior emphasize the ap-

parent absence of an unemployment-inflation relationship consistent with a textbook Phillips

curve. Here we ask how well a simple Phillips curve fits quarterly data since 1985, and es-

pecially whether the relationship has broken down since the onset of the Great Recession

in 2008. The answers depend on how inflation is measured. With headline inflation, there

is no discernable Phillips curve. With core inflation as measured by the CPIX or PCEX,

the evidence is mixed and we can see why many analysts would not find a Phillips curve

or would think it has broken down. With weighted median inflation, by contrast, the data

show a clear and robust Phillips curve that remains stable after 2008.


Specification

We consider a simple version of Milton Friedman’s (1968) expectations-augmented Phillips

curve, in which the inflation rate depends on expected inflation and on deviations of unem-

ployment from its natural rate. Specifically, in quarterly data, we assume



                                   πt = πte + α(u − u∗ )t + ǫt ,                              (1)

where π is inflation, π e is expected inflation, and (u − u∗ )t is the average of the unemployment

rate, u, minus the natural rate, u∗ , from t−3 through t. Our inclusion of three unemployment

                                                11
lags follows previous research on the Phillips curve (e.g., Stock and Watson (2010)). For

parsimony, we assume the coefficients on the current and three lags of u − u∗ are all the

same, so only the average of these terms appears in the equation (a restriction that the data

do not reject).

   Again following previous work (e.g., Fuhrer and Olivei (2010); Ball and Mazumder

(2019)), we measure expected inflation with long-term inflation forecasts, specifically, the

mean of ten-year forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. When we measure

inflation with any version of the Consumer Price Index (whether headline or one of the

core measures), we use ten-year forecasts of CPI inflation. When we measure inflation with

the PCE deflator, we have the problem that ten-year SPF forecasts of PCE inflation only

started in 2007. We use these PCE forecasts when they are available. As a proxy for PCE

expectations before 2007, we use the forecasts of CPI inflation minus the average difference

between CPI and PCE forecasts when both are available (which is 0.23).

   We measure the natural rate of unemployment, u∗ , with the trend in unemployment

from the Hodrick-Prescott filter with a smoothing parameter of 1600. We eschew more

sophisticated methods, such as Staiger et al. (1997), which use inflation and unemployment

data to estimate u∗ along with the parameters of an assumed Phillips curve. This approach

can bias the estimates of u∗ in the direction of fitting a Phillips curve relationship even if

none exists, a problem that does not arise with our univariate estimation of u∗ .

   To estimate the Phillips curve, we move expected inflation to the left side of the equation

This equation does not include a constant term: when u − u∗ is zero, Friedman’s Phillips

curve says π − π e should also be zero. However, if we add a constant to the equation, we

sometimes find it is statistically significant, so we present estimates both with and without a

constant. Arguably, one test of Friedman’s theory is whether the estimated constant is close

to zero. We do not put too much weight on this test, however, because a constant might

reflect measurement error in π e or u∗ with a non-zero mean.4


Estimates for 1985-2017

Table 2 presents Phillips curve estimates with inflation measured with the CPI (Panel A)

and with the PCE deflator (Panel B). For each of these price indexes, we compare results

for headline inflation and the two measures of core inflation: inflation less food and energy

(CPIX or PCEX) and weighted median inflation. For the two core measures, Figures 5 and

6 present scatterplots of the data underlying our regressions.

         These results make it clear, first, that the fit of the Phillips curve is highly sensitive to

the choice between headline and core inflation. It is easy to see why someone who focuses

on headline inflation would doubt that the Phillips curve exists. For both headline CPI
                                                                                    2
and headline PCE, the Phillips curve slope α is insignificant and the R s of the equations

are negative (either with or without a constant). The noise in quarterly headline inflation

obscures any underlying Phillips curve.

         We can also see that the choice between the two core-inflation measures is important–

to a substantial degree for CPI inflation and even more for PCE inflation. For CPIX, the
                                                                       2
Phillips curve slope is significant at the 5% level, but the R is negative with no constant
                                                                                                       2
term and only 0.22 with a constant. The fit is better with weighted median CPI: the R is

0.41 without a constant and 0.48 with a constant. The scatterplots in Figure 5 confirm that

a Phillips curve appears more clearly for median CPI than for CPIX.

         When we turn to PCE inflation, the differences between the results for the two core-
                                                                2
inflation measures become larger. For PCEX, the R for the Phillips curve is negative
                                                                                        2
without a constant and only 0.07 with a constant; for median PCE, the R is 0.32 in both
     4
    In particular, the HP filter forces the mean of u∗ to equal the mean of u. Other estimates suggest that
u and u have different means over our sample period of 1985-2017; for example, the mean of the u∗ series
 ∗

produced by the Congressional Budget Office exceeds the mean of u by 0.78 percentage points.


                                                    13
cases. Figure 6 confirms these big differences in fit.

   Some researchers damn the Phillips curve with faint praise, saying that the relationship

exists but it is flat–the effect of unemployment on inflation is small–and the residuals are

large. Blanchard (2016), for example, reports an unemployment coefficient of about -0.20

since the 1990s and a standard error of the residual of 1.0, indicating a “fairly poor fit.”

In our results for median inflation, the unemployment coefficients are substantially larger

in absolute value: -0.48 for median PCE and -0.65 or -0.66 for median CPI. The standard

errors of residuals are between 0.4 and 0.5.


Has the Phillips Curve Taken a Vacation?

Some economists, such as Blinder (2018), suggest that the Phillips curve once existed but

has disappeared since the Great Recession of 2008. Our findings on this issue depend on

how core inflation is measured, even more strongly than before. When our sample period is

restricted to 2008-2017, the fit of the Phillips curve becomes weaker for inflation less food

and energy but stronger for median inflation.

   Table 3 and Figures 7 and 8 present our results for 2008-2017. Notice first that the

Phillips curve always fits well in this period if core inflation is measured with the weighted

median. For both median CPI and median PCE, and with and without a constant term,
      2
the R s range from 0.54 to 0.64. The estimated coefficients on unemployment are close to

those for the full sample since 1985. The Phillips curve appears clearly in Figures 7B and

8B. Based on these results, we doubt that economists would worry about the demise of the

Phillips curve if they examined median inflation.

   When core inflation is measured with inflation less food and energy, our results differ

somewhat for the CPI and PCE deflator. For the CPIX, the evidence for a post-2008

Phillips curve is borderline. The unemployment coefficient is significant at the 5% level

when a constant term is included in the equation but not without a constant. We can also

see in Figure 7A that the results depend heavily on two observations in the lower right of

                                               14
the graph: the first two quarters of 2010, which had the highest levels of unemployment in

the sample and the lowest levels of CPIX inflation. If we exclude these observations, the

Phillips curve slope is far from significant.

    For the PCEX, the data since 2008 contain no evidence whatsoever of a Phillips curve.
                                                                                 2
In the regressions, unemployment has no explanatory power for inflation (R =0.001 with

a constant). Figure 8A confirms this result, and we also see that π − π e is almost always

negative: inflation has persistently fallen short of its expected level. We understand why the

behavior of PCEX, the Fed’s preferred measure of core inflation, has puzzled economists.



6     Conclusion

The measurement of core inflation might seem like a technical subject of interest to a narrow

range of specialists. We have seen, however, that a focus on a sub-optimal core measure, the

inflation rate excluding food and energy, has contributed to perplexity about inflation be-

havior among economists, policymakers, and op-ed writers. The weighted median measure of

core has a stronger theoretical foundation than inflation ex food and energy, and empirically

it is less volatile and easier to understand. In particular, we believe that fewer economists

would puzzle over a breakdown of the Phillips curve if the weighted median received more

attention.

    In light of these findings, economists should do more research on the weighted median

and related measures of core inflation. There are many open issues. Because the median is

a non-linear function of industry inflation rates, it could vary significantly depending on the

level of industry disaggregation. The weighted median is also sensitive to time aggregation;

for example, a quarterly series computed by averaging monthly median inflation rates differs

from the median of industries’ quarterly inflation rates. Researchers should ask which version

of the weighted median is the most useful measure of core inflation. We should also compare

weighted medians to trimmed means of industry inflation rates, which also filter out large
