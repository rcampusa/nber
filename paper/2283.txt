          Federal Assistance and Local Services in the United States:

                The Evolution ofa NewFederalist Fiscal Order




                                   ABSTRACT




     The federalist fiscal structure of the United States has been evolving
steadily towards the centralization of the financing of government services
and transfers. Revenues are raised centrally and then transferred, via
grants-in—aid, to state and local governments. This paper seeks to explain
this movement towards centralized financing. Two alternative hypotheses are
examined. The first--that aid is allocated to correct market or political
failures in the local public economy or to equalize the provision of
meritoriOus local public goods-—generally fails to account for the
distribution of federal aid over the past thirty years. The second
hypothesis——that aid is allocated to ease the fiscal pressure in the state—
local sector when, and only when, it is in the political interests of
Congressional representatives to do so--is supported by the recent data. Our
current system of federal grants to state and local governments is a logical
outcome of a Congressional budget process that rewards the centralized
financing and the localized provision of public good and services.

     From its beginnings, the fiscal system of the United States has been

committed to the principle that multiple layers of government is the preferred

structure for the financing and provision of government services. The U.S.

Constitution through the Tenth Amendment expressly protects the rights of

states to pursue their own fiscal agendas provided those agendas do not

conflict with clearly legislated federal objectives or constitutionally

protected individual rights.1 Most state constitutions through charters for

the creation of local governments offer similar protections for the fiscal

activities of cities, counties, and special districts.2 While the rules for

defining the domains of fiscal decisions are reasonably clear, the exact

contents of these domains are not. Our federalist fiscal structure is an

evolving structure, changing in response to the demands upon it for the

provision of public goods. This paper will examine the most recent phase of

this evolutionary process: the recent centralization in the financing of the

state and local provision of public services.3

     Tables 1-3 reveal the basic trends. Three central facts stand out.

First, total federal, state, and local government spending has been increasing

steadily over this century, both in real dollars and as a percent of national

income (Table 1). The major components of this growth are federal outlays for

defense (growing at 3.61% per annum since 1902), government direct transfers

to persons (growing at 6.65% per annum), and governments' direct provision of

goods and services (growing at 2.70% per annum). Second, state and local

governments are the main producers of non—defense, non-transfer public goods

(Table 2). Finally, there is a decided trend towards the centralized

financing of these state and local services (Table 3). At both the state and

local levels the trend is to move the revenue decision upward to a higher

level of government. Note however, that at the same time we have centralized

the financing of state and local services the spending and production

decisions have remained at the state and local level. While financing has

become centralized, provision decisions have remained localized.

    The move of our fiscal system towards the centralized financing of local

services is not a new phenomenon. The federal government has always provided

aid to the states, and states have always given fiscal assistance to their

localities. What is new--at least since 1960——is the dollar volume of such

assistance and its rapid growth. The story behind this important change is

both economic and political. Economic in that fundamental demographic and

economic changes have acted to increase the demand for state and local

services in this period. Political in that local officials have argued, and

Congress has eventually agreed, that it would be politically advantageous to

finance this expansion via federal grants-in-aid. Growing economic pressure

for local services and the political attractiveness of centralized financing

are the root causes of our new federalist fiscal order.


II. The Evolving Structure of Federal Assistance


     Historically, the federal government has always supported state and local

governments: federal aid is not a new idea. The early land grants to states

for purposes of education, railway expansion, and public infra-structure

development were sizeable, often constituting 20% or more of the land area of

the recipient state.5 Dollar grants appeared for the first time as a

significant transfer to states with the passage of the Federal Aid Road Act of
                                       —3—




1916 and the approval of the Smith-Hughes Act of 1917.6 The 1930's marked the

next major expansion of federal assistance for state and local governments.

The largest single source of these new monies were a variety of federal public

relief programs and the first federal program for unemployment relief.7 Each

of these new relief programs contained (sometimes implicit) matching

provisions which rewarded states with more assistance as they spent more on

public welfare.

     Yet each of these two previous periods of aid expansion pale in

comparison to the growth in federal assistance for state and local governments

from 1960-1980. During this period real federal aid to the states has more

than doubled in dollar amounts and by 1980 had become almost 27% of all state

revenues (see Table 3, columns 3 and 14). Just as importantly, direct federal

to local assistance--virtually non—existent before 1960--became a major source

of local government dollars accounting for just under 114% of all local

revenues by 1980. The 1960—1980 aid explosion had an important impact on the

federal budget as well. Federal assistance to state and local governments

amounted to only 10.5% of all federal non-defense spending and 6.96% of all

federal spending on goods and services in 1950, but by 1980 those percentages

had risen to 19.75% of all non-defense spending and 31.72% of all federal

goods and service spending.8 By 1980 all levels of government in our

federalist fiscal system had an important stake in the structure of federal

aid for state and local governments.

     What has caused this fundamental transformation of our fiscal system? We

might well hope that it was done by design and for a compelling public

purpose, and, indeed, there are good reasons for federal assistance to the

state and local sector. Four separate arguments for intergovernmental grants-

in-aid have been offered in the literature, three of which make the case for
assistance from the perspective of economic efficiency and one of which argues

for governmental aid to insure increased economic equity.

     First, to achieve efficiency, grants—in-aid may be necessary to induce

state and local governments to provide the appropriate level of a national

public good; national public infra-structures or a minimum level of public

education to insure a literate citizenry are examples. Such goods may be

financed and produced by the central government or they may be financed

centrally and then (via aid) produced by the state or local government.

Second, federal government grants to local governments may be necessary to

encourage the efficient level of local public goods when those goods display a

significant level of spillovers--positive or negative-—beyond the boundaries

of the local political jurisdiction. Third, grants—in-aid can be used to

induce a ruling political coalition (e.g., the median voter or a protected

agenda-setter) to expand or contract its preferred level of a locally provided

public good to more closely approximate that level required to achieve within—

community allocative efficiency. Finally, federal, aid to state and local

units can be used to insure a more equitable distribution of economic

resources. While most economists agree that income redistribution across

households should be a federal function, redistributive grants can still be

used to insure a more equitable distribution of meritorious, or ethically

"primary," local public goods. Education is the leading example of such a

commodity, and recent court decisions in California, New Jersey, and New Yor1

have embraced this argument and have explicitly required their states to

redesign their school aid formulaes to encourage a more equitable provision of

this public good. Each of these efficiency and equity arguments offers a

potentially compelling case for federal to state-local grants.9 If national

needs, spillovers, political inefficiencies, or local service inequities have
                                         —5—




grown over the past thirty years, then so too should the level of federal to

state-local aid.

      It is instructive, therefore, to examine the actual distribution of

federal grants against the standards implied by these typical public finance

arguments for federal assistance. Does the distribution of federal aid

conform to the dictates of the normative theory for fiscal assistance?1°

Table 14 attempts to answer this question for each of the major categories of

federal—to—state and federal—to—local grants—in—aid.

      The results in Table 4 show the correlation of the level of aid in each

of five benchmark years to variables which might reasonably approximate an

efficiency or equity argument for federal assistance. Each regression

includes at least one variable which might plausibly be argued to proxy for

each of the three efficiency arguments; the efficiency variables (denoted by

the vector X) will differ across aid categories as the efficiency rationale

differs. Further, two variables—-income per capita in the state (denoted as

Y) and the coefficient of variation in family income within the state (denoted

by CVY)--are included to test for the presence of an equity rationale for

federal aid. Equalizing aid should be negatively related to average state

income and positively related to the coefficient of variation of income within

the state.11 Each aid regression is of the general form:


                                        8X+aCVY
                                         —
(1)                          AID   te             }YCel

where 8, a, and c are coefficients to be estimated, and u is a randomly

distributed error term.

      The resulting regression coefficients will measure the separate

influences of the efficiency arguments--via the X variables--and the equity

rationale--via CVY and Y--on the distribution of federal aid across states,

for each aid category in each sample year. In effect, these estimates of the

AID equation describe the de facto aid forinulaes which allocate federal aid

dollars to state and local governments within each aid category. Each year's

sample includes the forty-eight mainland states. Estimation is by ordinary

least squares. To minimize problems of simultaneity, all X variables, CVY,

and Y are measured so as to pre—date the year in which AID is given. Table !

also reports the simple correlations of AID with each efficiency and equity

proxy as well as the means and the coefficients of variation of AID itself for

each aid category for each of the five sample years.

     Two results are immediately apparent from Table I4 First, the historical

growth in total real aid per capita observed in Tables 1-3 is also observed

for each of the individual aid categories specified in Table : federal—to-

state education aid has grown nearly seven-fold over the last three decades,

welfare aid by a factor of five, "other" federal-to-state aid shows a six-time

increase, and federal-to-local government categorical aid has increased by

almost an order of ten. Only federal-to-state highway aid seems to have

moderated its growth path, declining from a peak of $3O.1 per capita in 1972

(a five factor increase from its 1952 level of $6.1L per capita) to $20.86 per

capita by 1981L. But that fall was more than offset by the introduction of

federal general revenue sharing. Second, and just as important, such

assistance is becoming more equally distributed across the forty-eight

mainland states receiving aid. Table L reports the coefficient of variation

in the distribution of aid across states for each aid category for each of the

five sample years, and without exception the coefficient of variation of aid

declines through time. At the same time that federal aid is growing, it is

also becoming more equally distributed across states.
                                       —7—




     Is there an economic or public purpose logic to this growth and

distribution of federal grants-in-aid? Table 14   reports   both the simple, zero-

order correlations of the state characteristics with AID (within [.]) and the

partial regression coefficients of the characteristics and AID (with standard

errors within (.)).   The resulting regression equations are a summary of the

federal government's de facto aid formula and a direct test of how well the

efficiency and equity arguments do in describing the actual distribution of

aid. In the case of federal welfare and highway aid--both open-ended matching

grants where the level of AID increases with state-local spending——the log of

spending on the aided service is also included in the regressions as a

characteristic which determines the log of AID. Thus, for these aid programs,

the state characteristics other than own spending describe the implicit

matching rate.12 A variable key for Table 14 defines the list of explanatory

variables used in each aid equation.

     How descriptive of federal aid is the national purpose argument? The

results are mixed at best. In the case of federal aid for education, the

variable thought to measure a possible national purpose for educational aid is

the percent of adults over the age of 25 with four or more years of high

school education (%>HS). States with a low percent of educated adults might

be allocated more federal education aid to promote the national objective of

an educated citizenry. If so, the variable %>HS ought to have a significant

and negative regression coefficient. The simple correlations are often

significantly negative; however, the partial regression correlations are

not. Federal education aid seems to find the less educated states on average,

but not on the margin. For highway assistance, the often stated national

purpose is the development of an efficient interstate transportation system

for times of national emergencies, e.g., wars. To test this hypothesis the
                                      -8-



level of military payrolls within the state and the value-added from mining

(the need for natural resource deployment) are included to explain highway

assistance. A positive relationship is expected, but it is observed for only

the simple correlations. For welfare assistance to states, %>HS is again used

to proxy for a national purpose, the argument here being that in states with

less educated adults, income transfers can substitute for human capital and

perhaps minimize the anti-social consequences often associated with abject

poverty. The regression coefficients and simple correlations should be

negative; they are, but only rarely significantly so. "Other" federal-to—

state assistance is primarily for state infra—structures such as sewers, dams,

and hospital beds. To insure that all states have such an infra-structure

even when it may not be feasible to provide it competitively, the federal

government might offer national assistance. If so, aid ought to go to the

more rural states, measured here by the state's population density. A

negative relationship is expected, but never observed. Direct federal aid to

local governments is also primarily for infra-structures and one might invoke

a "save the cities" argument in the spirit of Jane Jacobs (1961) as a possible

national purpose rationale for such assistance. Three variables are used to

measure the possible importance and status of a state's urban environment:

percent of the population who live in urban areas, the percent of housing

which is listed as deteriorated, and the age of the state measured since its

date of statehood. There is some evidence that urban states get more federal-

to—local government assistance, but it is not the older states and it is not

those states with deteriorated housing stocks. Again, the evidence for the

economic argument is mixed at best. Finally, general revenue sharing aid

(GRS) was first introduced under the banner of correcting the micro-economic

and macro—economic consequences of stagnant state and local tax bases. If
                                         —9—



this is the purpose of GRS, then aid ought to be allocated to those states

with the least income responsive tax structures, measured here by the

elasticity of state and local revenues with respect to state income. The GRS

regression coefficients and the simple correlations do not show the expected

negative relationship between GRS and the elasticity of the tax structure. On

balance, the national purpose arguments do not support the observed structure

of federal assistance.

     The spillover rationale is no more compelling as a basis for federal

aid. As an increasing percentage of a state's population outmigrates

(measured by %OutM in Table 1) one can argue that across state spillovers from

education, health care, and state and local services generally may increase.

Thus, states may   tend   to under-provide such services when beneficiaries are

planning to leave; grants can correct the resulting inefficiency. We should

therefore observe more federal education aid and more general revenue-sharing

assistance to states with higher rates of out-migration; we do not. Within

state spillovers or congestion problems resulting from increased

metropolitanization may also be a problem, particularly in transportation.

Increased highway aid might correct this problem. But again the observed

distribution of aid is in the wrong direction; as the percent of the state's

population living in metropolitan areas increases, federal highway aid per

capita in fact declines. To minimize the adverse spillover effects of low

income households re-locating to find higher welfare payments, welfare

matching aid should be allocated to the states where the poor now reside. The

matching rate for welfare aid ought to increase with the percent of the

state's population below poverty; surprisingly perhaps, except for 1962, it

does not. Federal assistance for states in the category "other" is primarily

infra-structure aid; such assistance might best be allocated to those high
                                     -10-




growth states where environmental spillovers might be most worrisome. The

variable NHouse——new housing per square mile in the state--shows there is no

such relationship. In the same spirit, federal aid to local governments

should be allocated to those states with many local governments per square

mile (GDen) so as to overcome the propensity of a highly decentralized fiscal

system to ignore across community spillovers. In fact, federal categorical

assistance to local governments is allocated to states with less decentralized

fiscal structures, On balance, the spillover rationale for aid does little to

help us understand the actual distribution of federal assistance.

     The final efficiency argument for federal aid would use grants—in—aid to

correct for a perceived failure of the local political process to equate the

community's marginal public benefits (i.e., EMRS) to the marginal costs of

producing the local public good (MC); see, for example, Barlow (1971). Such

problems can arise for a variety of reasons. Collective inaction by the

larger majority may allow a better organized minority to dictate the local

outcomes——for example, a tax—conscious coalition of elderly residents and

private school parents might be able to influence local school boards to hold

spending below the majority's preferred outcome. Federal education aid might

then be given to those states and school districts where these coalitions are

most influential and where the perceived need for public education is the

strongest. From the results in Table 11, however, we see federal education aid

is not so allocated; states with relatively more elderly (%Old) and more

private school enrollments (PrKids) get less aid on average and on the margin.

     In other political settings, minorities may not be able to organize.

Federal aid might then be used to induce the controlling majority to be more

responsive to the needs of the weakened minority. For example, previous

research on welfare allocations (e.g., Orr (1968)) has shown blacks are often
                                    —11—




discriminated against in the distribution of transfers. Thus, more federal

welfare assistance might be allocated to states whose population has a larger

percentage of black residents, all else equal. Table 14 shows that there is no

such pattern.

     The mobility of voters often creates special problems for the politically

efficient allocation of state and local public goods. Infra-structure

allocations——highways, sewers, sanitation facilities, dams--might well be

under-provided in those states and localities from which households are most

likely to relocate, under the rationale of consume now and let-the-new—

residents-pay later. Federal aid can be used to offset such a beggar-thy—

neighbor strategy, with more aid allocated for infra-structure development in

those states with the highest rates of out-migration (%OutM); see, for

example, Inman and Albright (1987). Table 14 does show such an allocation

pattern for highway aid and "other" federal to state aid but not for federal

to local categorical aid. Two other variables which measure the need for

infra-structures aid--income growth (YGrow) and the number of local

governments per square mile (GDen)--always show an insignificant or an

unexpected negative relationship.

     Finally, the new theory of efficient inter—regional grants (see Boadway

and Flatters (1982)) suggests how aid can be used to correct another problem

of resident mobility--the propensity of individuals to respond to the average

gains from re—location while ignoring the marginal effects such moves may have

on overall regional welfare. The result may be inefficiently congested public

goods facilities in some communities and under-utilization in others, or over-

populated regional labor markets in some areas and under-populated labor

markets elsewhere. To correct for these inefficient relocations, aid should

be given: 1) to those regions which have lower natural resource rents per
                                      —12—



 capita to help equalize average rents, and then given average rents, 2) to

 those regions which have fewer people so as to induce labor in-migration from

the other regions and 3) to those regions which provide relatively more of

still uncongested public goods.13 To test this hypothesis, revenue-sharing

aid was regressed on value-added in mining in a state (to approximate for

natural resource rents), on the state's population density, and on the level

of state-local spending. Revenue-sharing aid is positively related to state

and loeal spending as expected but not significantly related to value—added in

mining or to population density. The evidence is weak at best for this

efficiency rationale for general revenue-sharing.

     It seems safe to conclude, therefore, that if one is to find a compelling

public purpose logic to the present structure of federal aid to state and

local governments, it will have to be on the grounds of economic equity not

economic efficiency. In fact, Table 14 does show an equalizing intent to

federal assistance, particularly for achieving across state equity. While aid

is occasionally allocated more heavily to states with larger within state

income variations (CVY, to achieve within state service or tax equity),

federal aid is almost always inversely related to the level of state income.

Education aid, highway aid and federal "other" aid in the 1950's and 1960's

are the only exceptions. By 1972, almost all federal aid is equalizing.

     With this observed equity bias to federal aid, we need to ask the next

question: How well does such aid do in equalizing across state variations in

the distribution of meritorious state—local public goods? Are the aid

programs' equalizing intentions realized? Table 5 provides evidence on this

point. For each aid category, the marginal effect of another dollar of state

income on spending is calculated based upon demand studies for state-local

public goods (column 1).   In all cases, as residents' incomes rise, states and

           (1986, Table 7.2) for welfare. The fact that the marginal effect

           of $1 of aid is greater than $1.00 for highway and welfare aid is

           due to the matching provisions implicit in such assistance.

localities spend more on state and local public services. But so too do

states and localities which receive more federal aid; see column 2. If the

poorer income states receive more federal aid then perhaps the increase in

federal aid more than offsets the propensity of lower income states to spend

less on state and local services. Column 3 of Table 5 shows the effects of $1

of additional income on the receipt of federal aid; a negative coefficient

indicates equalizing federal assistance. Column 14 of Table 5 predicts the

effects on spending of' this additional amount of federal aid. If this equity-

based federal aid does neutralize the expenditure effects of private income,

then the total effect of a dollar more of income--equal to the own spending

effect (column 1) plus the aid offset effect (column 14)—should be zero; see

column 5. If there is more than a full offset to the spending effects of

income——Arrow (1971) provides some arguments why this might be desired——then

the total effects of income plus aid should be negative in column 5. In only

one case does federal aid fully neutralize the pro-spending effects of state

income; that case is welfare spending since 1972. For the other aid programs

and "merit" goods considered here-—education and public infra-structures——

federal aid is sometimes equalizing but never so equalizing so as to

neutralize the original effects of income. At best, the current federal aid

structure reduces 25% of the income generated inequities in state-local

spending on education or infra-structures; compare the differences between

columns 1 and 5 in Table 5. While federal aid is a useful step toward state—

local fiscal equity, Table 5 suggests it would be hard to rationalize the

present aid system as a grant structure designed solely to promote fairness.

    The final impression left by this dissection of contemporary federal

grants to state and local governments is that the actual pattern of federal

aid does not map closely the usual economic or public purpose arguments
                                      -1i-




 advanced for such assistance. Perhaps this conclusion is not surprising.15

 But if it is not good public policy reasoning which describes the recent major

 increase in federal aid for the state and local sector, what does? Section

 III argues that the answer is to be found not in the logic of normative

economics but in the workings of behavioral politics.


 III. The Political Economy of Federal Grants


     The pressure to use government to redistribute economic resources is

endemic to stable democratic societies. Coalitions inevitably form around

these institutions with the power to tax and transfer incomes, and in stable

democracies that institution is government.16 Federal grants-in—aid are a

prime vehicle for such redistributions. It is my hypothesis, to be tested

here, that the most recent growth of federal assistance to state and local

governments can be best explained as an exercise in redistributive politics.

     The argument proceeds in two steps. First, with the growth of the urban

public economy following World War II there emerged a new and substantial

demand for state and local public services. The process of suburbanization

and the baby boom of the 1950's and early 1960's created the need for more

schooling and more public infra-structures, historically the concerns of the

state and local sectors. Further, suburbanization created unique fiscal

difficulties for our older central cities placing additional pressure on the

state and local fisc. The net result was a growing demand for public services

from the state and local sector. Second, as demand increased it was natural

to look for new sources of income. The state and local sector was no

different, and the representatives of that sector--the mayors, the governors,

and other locally elected officials--turned to the only source they could:

Washington. Washington responded, but not immediately. It took an important
                                       —15—



shift in institutional structure before additional aid started flowing to the

state and local sector. That institutional shift was the decentralization of

Congressional decision—making over the period 1969-1972. By 1975, our new

federalist fiscal structure was firmly in place. It was built by a growing

demand for local services and by a decentralized Congressional fiscal process

which had discovered the political advantages of redistributive, centralized

financing.


A. The Growing Demand for State and Local Services


     Tables 2 and 3 reveal the growth in resources allocated by the state and

local public sector over this century. The trend has been steadily upward.

From 1902 to 1950 the real (1972 dollars) level of state and local government

own revenues grew at an annual rate of 2.23%, from $115 per capita in 1902

( $114.76 +   $99.81) to $357 per capita ($150.83 + $205.82) by 1950; see Table
3. Since 1950, growth has continued at even a faster rate; own real revenues

of the state local sector have increased at an annual rate of 2.50%, rising

from $357 to $8142 dollars per capita ( $1472.09 + $370.41) by 1985. Federal

aid has also grown dramatically over this period, from $143 per capita

( $38.18 + $14.53) in 1950 to $191 per capita ( $1514.13 + $37.23) by 1985 for

an annual rate of growth of 4.26%. The joint effect has been to increase

total revenues to the state—local sector by 2.70% per year since 1950, from

$1400 per capita ( $357 + $143) to $1033 per capita ( $8142 + $191).

     The driving force behind this growth in revenues has been the increasing

demand by residents for services from the state and local sector. Equation

(2) describes this growth in demand for state and local activities for the

period 191481985. Specified as a demand relationship, total state-local

government spending per capita ( state-local government expenditures on goods
                                               —16.-




and transfers plus the annual fiscal surplus, E + S, measured in 1972 dollars)

is seen to depend positively on last year's real income (Y_1), the previous

year's exogenous (non—matching) real federal aid per capita (Z_1                 total

federal aid minus welfare and highways aid), the level of new housing starts

per capita (NHouse_1), the number of school-age children per capita (Kids_1),

and the crime rate (Crime_1) in the previous year. Expenditures are also

inversely related to the net price of state—local spending, defined here as 1

minus the average federal matching rate for the previous year ( rn                 (welfare

aid + highway aid)/E)_1) multiplied by 1 minus the average effective federal

tax rate of the median income taxpayer, (1 -            r), to   allow for the federal

deductibility of state and local taxes.17

      While the growth in real income has been an important determinant of the

growth in state and local spending since 1948, the central causes behind the

increase are to be found in the demographic and structural changes which re-

shaped the local public economy. Estimates of the relative contribution of

each demand variable to the growth in state-local spending reveals that the
                                       -17-




baby-boom (measured by the increase in school—aged children per capita), the

added difficulties of urban living (measured by the growth in the crime rate)

and the growth in personal income were the prime forces behind the growth in

state-local spending during the period 1948-1970. Since 1970 income and urban

needs have remained important determinants of spending growth, but the baby—

boom has disappeared as a driving force and has been replaced in relative

importance by the increase in federal grants_in_aid.18 The end result of

these local fiscal dynamics has been a rising state-local tax rate (= own

state-local revenues/income) and a growing number of state and local public

employees per capita.19 The demand for state and local services has been

rising but at a rate faster than a simple-—and politically, accommodating--

income effect might justify. Further, those with the most direct vested

interest in satisfying these rising demands--state and local public

employees--have been growing too. In such instances, it is always easiest for

political leaders to look elsewhere for financial support to ease the growing

fiscal pressure. Elected officials from the state and local sector have

proved themselves to be no different. Washington was the obvious place to

turn.


B. Congressional Decentralization and the Growth of Federal Grants


        Congress as an institution for fiscal policy underwent a major

transformation in structure from 1969 to 1972, evolving from a legislative

body dominated by a few major decision-makers with firm control over fiscal

affairs to a largely decentralized forum of individual deal-makers each

required to maximize their own net gain from legislative decisions. A variety

of factors contributed to this transition: the declining influence of

political parties, the increasing sophistication of voters and their
                                           -18-



willingness to vote off the party line to favor their own interests, and

Congressional re-districting favoring suburban and urban interests to balance

the previous rural influence in Congress.2° For each of these reasons, the

Congressional leadership found itself less and less able to dictate fiscal

allocations, and more and more pressured to be responsive to the demands of

all the members.21 These demands were often couched in very simple terms:

bring home "the bacon." In this new political environment, to get anything

approved often meant approval for everything.

      The consequences of this changing Congressional structure for fiscal

policy-—and more specifically for federal grants funding—-can be specified

more formally in a model of representative decision-making within alternative

legislative structures. An elected representative to Congress is assumed to

derive political benefits from the provision of federal government project

dollars to his or her constituents (denoted by x, paid for example by federal

aid), where the level of benefits enjoyed will depend on a set of exogenous

characteristics of the constituents (denoted by the vector F]: B        B(x; F).

The representative bears a political cost, however, whenever dollars flow from

the district to support federal expenditures elsewhere. Those dollars will

typically be paid as federal taxes (T) and are assumed to equal the

representative's district's (s's) share (denoted as 4) of all taxes needed to

support all project dollars allocated to all of N districts:
        N                    N
T5 •    z x1   T(x5;               xi). The representative's net political benefits
                             i s
(NPB) from the allocation of federal dollars financed by taxes is therefore:

district and to support any legislative coalition which can deliver on that

preferred allocation.

        Exactly what that preferred allocation will be, however, depends

fundamentally on how Congress conducts its budgetary business. Three

alternative legislative regimes--and the effects of each on a representative's

preferred budget——can be specified. The first, called the fully decentralized

regime, assumes that each legislator selects the district's preferred project

size x5 under the assumption that marginal changes in x5 will have no

implications for the level of spending preferred by other legislators. Each

legislator then submits their preferred budget--denoted x(D) for the

decentralized regime--and all representatives vote to simply approve each

other's preferred x*(D)'s, where each individual x(D) is specified from (3)

legislative regime. Figure 1 illustrates the preferred district project size

under the decentralized legislative regime in the very simple case

where        equals 1/N--that is, when each of the N legislative districts

contributes an average amount to national taxes.22 Since each district pays

only a small fraction ( 1/N) of its own project's costs, the incentive is to

prefer a much larger project than if the district were responsible for the

full marginal costs of the added project spending (:        $1): x(D) > x(C) in
Figure 1. The fiscal behavior of such decentralized legislatures is typically

called "pork-barrel" budgeting.

      The second legislative regime, called a majority—controlled legislature,

limits pork-barrel spending to some extent. Here a single political party or

majority coalition has sufficient control to insure passage of a budget

without granting the excluded minority any unwanted favors. Only those

legislators in good-standing within the majority are certain to have their

districts preferred projects included within the budget. In addition, the

dominant majority is run by a strong leadership capable of setting majority

policy and enforcing that policy on coalition members; in effect, the

leadership selects each district's preferred project size based upon the

district's revealed NPB schedule. The district's allocation is again set so

as to maximize NPB, but now subject to the leadership's realization that each

district's project's costs will spillover onto taxpayers from other districts

within the majority coalition. (Project costs which fall on taxpayers

represented by the minorities are ignored by the majority leadership.)         The

preferred district project is again defined by maximizing (3):

defines      the optimal project size, where (: dT/dx5) is the relevant marginal

tax cost of a new project dollar and allows for the spillover effects of

spending across districts within the majority coalition. In the simple case

in which all districts pay equal taxes,            will equal M/N or the percent of

majority member districts (of size M) in the full legislature (of size N).23

The size of each project in a majority member district declines from what it

might have been in a fully decentralized legislature because of the partial
                                        -21-



internalization of project costs achieved by strong majority coalition

leadership; see Figure 1 where x(M) < x(D) because        >


     The final legislative regime, called a cooperative legislature, employs a

single political leader, representing a coalition of the whole, to set each

district's allocation for x5. The cooperative regime fully internalizes all

fiscal spillovers which result from centralized financing. In this regime,

each district receives that project size which equates the marginal political

benefits of x to the full marginal costs of x5: b(x, F)         1. The resulting

project size in each district is x(C) in Figure 1; x(C) is each legislator's

preferred budget if he or she can be certain that all other legislators will

cooperate. To achieve the fully cooperative budget, the political leader of

the coalition of the whole must be capable of punishing those individual

legislators who seek to deviate from this allocation by free-riding on the

system of centralized financing and setting their own         > x(C). Such

punishment might entail branding the renegade a "budget-buster" and then

working for his defeat in the next legislative election. Only when the leader

has sufficient resources--financial or otherwise--to make this punishment

credible can the fully cooperative allocation be sustained.

     The size of the total project budget (denoted G) will be equal to the sum

of all district allocations and can be specified for each of these three

legislative regimes. In the case of the fully decentralized legislature, each

district receives its preferred project of size x(D); the total budget will
                         N
therefore equal G(D)      i   x(D). In the case of the fully cooperative regime
                        s1
each district receives its cooperative allocation x(C); the final budget is
                  N
therefore G(C)         x(C). For the majority rule regime the overall project
                 s=1
budget will equal the sum of all majority members projects-— £ x(M), where M
                                                          5QM

is the size of the majority--plus any project spending allocated by the

majority to minority districts. Allocations to the minority for projects of

type x need not be zero. But any minority spending which does occur will only

occur if it improves the welfare of the majority. This may well be the case

if there are policies of interest to the fiscal majority which demand the

cooperation of a minority for approval-—e.g., judicial appointments or treaty

approvals which need 2/3's majorities. Cooperation can be purchased by

granting the minority a level of spending on projects of type x. The most

cost effective bribe is that which maximizes the political surplus to a

minority member without imposing political costs on the majority. This will

be a project of' size x*(C), the allocation of which maximizes the political

surplus available in trade to the majority coalition. If we assume such

trades do in fact occur, then the budget for expenditure on projects of type x

will be the sum of all projects given to majority members plus the sum of all

projects supplied to minority members or G(M)                    Z x(M) +          Z      x*(C).
                                                                                           S

Together the three legislative regimes define three alternative budgets for

project spending. Specified in increasing order of total outlays they are:

     As characterized above, the recent transformation of Congressional

decision-making in the early 1970's marks a shift from majority-controlled

fiscal politics to fiscal allocations based upon fully decentralized

budgeting. No longer are budgets packaged in a dictatorial fashion by the

majority's chosen chairmen of the Ways and Means, Finance, and Appropriations

Committees. In the new Congress, it has been argued, budgets emerge from the

process of give and take in the numerous subcommittees and caucuses of the

House and Senate. The behavioral implications of such a change are threefold:

1) the aggregate level of project spending should expand from G(M) to G(D); 2)

spending across Congressional districts and the states should become more

equalized as previous minority districts receive more project support; and 3)

the absolute number of legislated projects and programs should expand to

accommodate the specific needs of each legislative district. Federal grants

to state and local governments provides one case study in which to look for

these consequences of the Congressional transformation. At least on the

surface the evidence is supportive. First, the aggregate level of federal

grants to state and local governments showed a noticeable upturn around 1970,

particularly in federal aid paid directly to local governments; see Table 3.

Second, the overall distribution of aid has become more equal across states as

measured by the decline in the coefficient of variation in the distribution of

aid; see Table 1. Further, 1972 seems to stand as a key turning point in this

downward trend.25 Finally, the simple number of aid programs passed by

Congress increased dramatically in the late 1960's and the early 1970's,

rising from 160 programs in 1962 to 1412 by 1976.26 It seems clear that the

structure of Congressional decision-making has had an important influence on

the level and structure of our grants system.
      We can make these observations more precise and estimate quantitatively

the influence of Congressional structure on the level of federal support for

the state-local sector. The three regime legislative model specified in eq.

(1) can also be written in "nested" form as:


                 N                                         N
(5)         G    Z x*(C) + p E {x*(M) —
                                            x(C)}     +   & z   {x*(D)   —   x*(C)}
                 s1            sMS                         s1                 S




where   the dummy variable p     1   if the legislature is majority-rule and 0

otherwise and the dummy variable sS        1 if the legislature is decentralized and

o   otherwise.   The default regime (p          0) is the fully cooperative model of

budgeting. Estimation of equation (5) requires a specification of x(C)

and the increments {x*(M) -     x*(C)}   and {x*(D) -     x*(C)}.    Each can be defined

from knowledge of the marginal political benefit schedule and from district

tax shares under the fully cooperative (z       1),   the majority rule (=            ), and
the decentralized (
                        4)   legislative regimes; see Figure 1.

        The marginal political benefit schedule for grants in aid, (x, P), is

assumed to depend upon the demand for state-local public goods within the

district. The political benefits from grants is expected to increase with the

effective burden of state and local own revenues on income (R/Y), new housing

starts in the district (NHouse), the number of school-age children (Kids), the

crime rate in the district (Crime), and the number of state—local employees

per capita. The tax burden represents fiscal pressure on the state—local

sector while housing starts, school-age children, and the crime rate each

indicate a special need which might engender added assistance. State-local

employees per capita (SLEmp) measure the size of the most likely organized

lobby which can express these needs in Washington.27 Together the variables
                                            -25-




CR/I), NHouse, Kids, Crime, and SLEmp define the vector P of b(x, P). The

marginal benefits of grants are assumed to increase with each variable.

       District tax shares under the majority rule and the decentralized

legislative regimes are assumed to equal M/N (=              and i/N (     •)
respectively,   where M/N is the percent of the legislature in the majority

coalition and N is the total size of the legislature. For this analysis, the

majority coalition's share is taken to be the percent of the House of

Representatives controlled by the dominant party, whether Republican or

Democrat. While these measures of tax shares are not precisely correct for

each district,28 the degree of error in this approximation is likely to be

small, and certainly of second order importance when defining the relevant

increments, {x(M) —    x*(C)}    and {x*(D) —
                                                   x(C)}.
       Assuming that the marginal benefit schedule is a linear function of the

vector P ( R/Y, NHouse, Kids, Crime, SLEmp), then x(C), x(M), and x(D)

will also be linear functions of P and their corresponding tax shares——i, M/N,

and 1/N respectively.29 Assuming further that the political benefit schedules

are structurally identical across districts except for variations in P and

that elected representatives define all benefits and costs in per capita

(     per vote) units, then the aggregate spending equation in (5) can be re—
specified in per capita units as:


(6)              g   x*(1, )     + x(M){i       (M/N)} +    (D)}   +   v


where g is federal aid per capita, x*(1, F) is the per capita demand for aid

when the districttax share is 1 and when the elements of P assume their

national average values (       x*(1,   )    x(C;    F)), x(M) is the average increase

in per capita grants spending in districts within the majority coalition as

the legislative regime shifts from cooperative to majority-rule, and (D) is
                                        -26-




the average increase in per capita grants spending in all districts as the

legislative regime shifts from a cooperative to a decentralized structure.3°

With the addition of an assumed additive error term (denoted as      in (6)), eq.

(6) becomes the basis for an econometric analysis of recent federal grants

spending.

     Parameter estimates from eq. (6) will define the coefficients of the

linear political benefit schedule as well as the marginal effects of any

Congressional regime shifts, from cooperative to majority rule (x(M)) or from

cooperative to fully decentralized (x(D)). From the coefficient estimates

of x(M) and x(D) we can also estimate the effects on grants spending of the

shift from a majority rule to a decentralized Congress. It is necessary,

however, to specify a priori the periods which define the alternative

legislative regimes (i.e., i and 6). Congressional scholars generally

describe the period from 191481968 as an example of strong party leadership in

fiscal affairs; see Fenno (1966) and Manley (1970). The period from 1972 to

today is generally characterized by decentralized legislative decision-making

see Shepsle and Weingast (198k). The years 1969-1972 marked the period of

transition; see Ornstein (1975). For this analysis, the majority rule dummy

variable i   is   assigned a value of 1 for the years 1914871, and a value of 0

otherwise. The decentralized legislative regime is represented by a value of

6 equal to 1 for the years 1972 onward; for all previous years 6      0. To

minimize problems of simultaneity all elements of the vector P are lagged one

year. Estimation of eq. (6) also allows for the possibility of first-order

serial correlation in the additive error terms (representated by p,     the

correlation coefficient between        and Vt1). Estimation is based upon data

for the period 19k8—1985. Results are reported in Table 6.

    The initial specification in eq. (6a) assumes that Congress has been

uniformly responsive to constituent demands over the period 198-1985; the

specification in eq. (6b) tests for the additional effects of Congressional

structure on aid spending. In both specifications the individual coefficients

measuring the political benefits of aid--vector P--show that federal aid

increases as the fiscal burden of state-local finance increases, as the number

of school aged children increases, and as state-local employees per capita

rise. The crime rate and new housing starts are never significant, at least

beyond their influence on fiscal pressure, (RIY)_1; see eq. (2) above. What

is particularly impressive is the statistically significant and quantitatively

important role that state-local public employees play in the determination of

federal aid; Congressional spending is quite responsive to the growing size of

this interest group. The elasticity of aid with respect to (SLEmp)_1 is 2.16,

more than twice the elasticities of aid with respect to (R/Y)_1 (= .51),

NHouse1 ( .07), or Kids1 (= .86).

     As important as constituent demand and interest group representation has

been to the recent growth in federal aid, so too has been the structural

shifts in Congressional fiscal politics; see eqs. (6b) and (6c). Eq. (6b) is

the basic specification of the budget model; eq. (6c) extends that

specification to test for a "Reagan-Stockman" effect on aid spending. An F

test for the joint significance of the two Congressional variables——it(M/N) and

6-—rejects the null hypothesis of no effect at the 10% level of significance

in both equations. Further, the Congressional structure variables influence

federal aid as predicted. The coefficients on (M/N)—-Ax(M) = $51.46 in eq.

(6b) and $45.41 in eq. (6c)--measure the average increase in per capita aid in

a majority rule district as Congress moves from a fully cooperative to a

majority rule regime. The coefficients on 6--Ax(D)    $61 .12 in eq. (6b) and
                                        -28-



$59.01 in eq. (6c)-—measure the average increase in the preferred level of aid

spending in every district as Congress shifts from the cooperative to the

decentralized regime.

     Figure 2 illustrates the effects of these Congressional structures on

federal grants spending, based upon the econometric estimates of x(M) and

x(D) from eq. (6c) and actual federal aid expenditures for calendar 1974, one

of the first aid budgets to be decided by the newly decentralized Congress.

Total grants spending in 197k in an average Congressional district equalled

$179 per capita, an estimate of x*(D) for that year. The estimate of

           $59/capita from eq. (6c) implies the level of the cooperative budget

in the average district would have been $120/capita (    x'(C)
x*(D) —    (D)).   The estimate of x(M) from eq. (6c) implies that the average

district's majority—rule budget--if a member of the majority--would have

exceeded its cooperative budget by     $U5/capita; therefore the majority-rule

budget for a majority coalition district would have been $165/capita

(   x(M)     x*(C) +   (M)).   Together these estimates imply that the shift from

majority—rule to decentralized fiscal politics increased the size of the

federal grants budget in an average majority coalition district by

$1)4/capita. The real dollar gains from decentralization accrue to those

districts previously excluded from the majority coalition. In 197k, the

Democrats controlled 55% of the House seats and, for this analysis, are

assumed to constitute the majority coalition. Under decentralized budgeting,

the remaining Lt5% of Congressional districts now move along side the original

majority to capture x*(D) as well. As assumed under the model's original

specification, these minority districts would have received initially only

x*(C) from the majority. The effect of the decentralization of budgetary

politics is to therefore allocate an additional $59/capita in federal aid

( (D) x(D) - x*(C))        to the average minority district. Overall, the

econometric model predicts that under decentralized budgeting grants-in—aid

spending rose by an average of $314/capita ( .55 x $114 + .145 x $59) or by

214%, over what it might have been Congress remained a strong majority-rule

fiscal institution (   $1145 = .55 x x*(M) + .145x*(C) = .55 x $165 +   .1454120).

     This trend towards increased aid spending continued throughout the 1970's

and into 1981, but the period 1982 to 1985 showed another significant break in

the pattern. Now the trend turned downward; see eq. (6c). The explanation

lies in the Reagan-Stockman budgets of those years.31 As fashioned by David

Stockman, the 1982-1985 Reagan budgets were an effort to internalize the

fiscal externalities created under decentralized Congressional budgeting and

to move, if possible, towards the cooperative allocation, x*(C), based upon a

coalition of the whole. The strategy was to join across—the-board spending

cuts with a general reduction in taxes-—just what the cooperative budget would

require.32 Reagan provided the leadership-—and the political arm—twisting--

needed to guide such budgets through a Congress committed to decentralized

fiscal politics.33 For each of the first four Reagan budget years—-

represented by a year dummy variable in eq. (6c)--real aid spending was

reduced from what it might have been had full decentralized Congressional

budgeting prevailed. Aggregate aid spending was reduced initially by $28 per

capita in 1982 and finally by $143 per capita in 1985, a 15% to 22% reduction

when compared to the 1981 aid expenditures of $1914 per capita, the last pre—

Reagan budget. The Reagan budgets appear to have returned us to just about

where we would have been in total aid financing had Congress remained under

firm majority-rule leadership.

     This analysis of the budgetary effects of Congressional reform is

compounded however by one important fact. While 1972 was the operative date
                                    -30—



of transition to decentralized fiscal politics within Congress, it also marks

the date of passage of a major new aid program, the State and Local Fiscal

Assistance Act of 1972. Also known as General Revenue-Sharing (GRS), this

program infused into the state and local public sector an average of $22 per

capita in new grants; see Table IL Given the coincidence of GRS funding and

the emergence of decentralized budgeting, it could well be that the results in

eqs. (6b) and (6c)—-which have been attributed to the new structure of fiscal

politics——are in fact due to the passage of GRS. A "clean" test of the

structural reform hypothesis would re-estimate eqs. (6b) and (6c) using all

aid other than GRS assistance as the dependent variable. A further refinement

of the analysis should also be considered. As large formula grants tied to

state and local spending, federal welfare aid via AFDC and Medicaid grants may

also obscure the true effects of reforms in Congressional structures. A

preferred test for the effects of reform might omit these grants from the

dependent variable as well. What will remain are all the many small grant

programs which provide assistance to the state-local sector for education,

health care, and public infra—structures——programs which together still

totalled $125 per capita or more in grants in the 1970's. Equation (6d)

provides this refined test and re-estimates the structural aid model using as

the dependent variable total aid less GRS and welfare grants. The results are

nearly identical to those achieved earlier, and, if anything, are slightly

stronger.3 The basic conclusion remains in force: the new, decentralized

structure of Congressional fiscal politics has been an important stimulus to

the level of federal grants spending.


IV. Conclusion

     From its inception, the U.S. public economy has been committed to the

principle of fiscal decentralization. Appropriately designed, such a system
                                       —31—




can make a significant contribution to the twin goals of economic efficiency

and economic equity. A potentially important part of that structure are

intergovernmental grants-in-aid. This paper has examined the recent evolution

of our federal grants system from two perspectives. First, can the present

system of federal assistance to state and local governments be rationalized by

the usual normative economic arguments for efficiency and equity in the

provision of local public services: Does such aid provide national public

goods, or internalize externalities across Jurisdictions, or overcome internal

failings of local fiscal choice, or insure a more equitable provision of

meritorious public goods? Second, if not, then what does explain the

structure of our federal aid system?

     Against the usual efficiency arguments for aid, there is little evidence

in the present structure of federal assistance that current aid is motivated

from that perspective. There is more evidence to support an equity foundation

for federal grants, at least to equalize the across state distribution of

meritorious public services. Yet with the possible exception of welfare aid,

such assistance has had only a marginal effect on the final distribution of

state—local public goods. If we are to rationalize the present structure of

federal grants, therefore, it would appear that we should look to arguments

other than those based on achieving economic efficiency or equity.

     An alternative rationale, based upon a model of redistributive politics,

was advanced and tested for the period 19t8—85. The observed growth in

federal grants-in-aid over this period proved consistent with the underlying

structure of this model. Aid has grown with increasing fiscal pressure on the

state and local sector. The baby boom, the process of suburbanization, and

the emergence of the fiscally troubled central city have all contributed to

the demand for federal assistance. Congress has been responsive to these
                                     -32—



demands; particularly so, following the institutional reforms of 1969—1972.

Those reforms have opened the process of Congressional budgeting to

decentralized negotiations and deal-making. When coupled with a national tax

system which shares the costs of local expenditures across all legislative

districts, the result is a budgeting process for federal grants which is

potentially biased towards over-spending. The empirical results presented

here (see Figure 2) suggest that the present Congressionally determined aid

budgets may be inflated by as much as $314 per person, or 214%, over what they

might have been had strong majority-rule leadership remained in force, and

they may be as much as $59 per capita, or 50%, larger than what all

legislators might prefer were they capable of achieving a fully cooperative

fiscal allocation.

     What can be done to control this apparently excessive aid spending?

Short of a constitutional amendment to limit grants spending, there is a

really only one solution: stronger and more effective fiscal leadership in

Congress. The Reagan—Stockman budgets of 1982-1985 revealed the potential

influence such leadership can have on spending, but the resulting cuts seem to

have been a unique, and perhaps short-lived, event. Attempts to

institutionalize such reductions via Reagan's New Federalism reforms never

received serious consideration by Congress; the passage in the winter of 1987,

over Reagan's veto, of new highway and clean water grants only underscore the

point.35 The basic message of this analysis is clear: as long as

Congressional budgeting remains a decentralized fiscal process, the incentives

to finance centrally, and to spend locally, will remain as well. Our current

system of federal grants to state and local governments is just one logical

outcome of this process.

The ideas in this paper were originally presented in a series of classes given

at the University of Pennsylvania Law School in a jointly taught research

seminar with Professor Michael Fitts, sponsored by the Law School's Institute

of Law and Economics. An initial draft of the paper was given to the NBER

conference on Fiscal Federalism; the comments of my discussant, Tom Romer, and

other participants at the Conference were most helpful in preparing this

current version. Finally, I wish to thank the NBER and the Mellon Foundation

     1While the Tenth Amendment is clear on the point that the states are to

retain some policy role within our fiscal system, exactly what that role is to

be is not exactly specified by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has found

it difficult to draw the lines of responsibility without this guidance; see

National League of Cities v. Usery and then the recent Supreme Court opinion

in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority.

     7See Wallis (198k).

     81n 1950 the federal government spent $LO3.89 per capita (1972 dollars)

on non—defense goods and services and on transfers to households and

governments. Federal aid to state-local governments in 1950 was $12.72 per

capita (see Table 3) or 10.5% of this total. Non—defense spending on just

goods and services totaled $265 per capita in 1950; federal aid other than

welfare aid totaled $18.143 per capita (Tables 3 and 5) or 6.96% (:

$18i3/$265)   of all federal spending on non-defense goods and services. By

1980, total federal aid had become $1911.57 per capita or 19.75% of the $985

per capita of all federal non—defense spending in 1980.   Federal aid other

than welfare aid was $126 per capita in 1980 which was 31.72% of all federal

non—defense, non—transfer expenditures in 1980 (= $126/$397).

     9For good introductions to the efficiency theory of grants-in-aid, see

Oates (1972) and Boadway and Flatters (1982). For a discussion of grants-in-

aid to achieve public service equity, see Feldstein (1975), Inman (197$), and

Inman and Rubinfeld (1979)

     10political scientists have raised this same question, but in slightly

different terms, asking: Do grants—in—aid provide significant "general

benefits, those collective goods that people value because they believe

everyone profits, including themselves?" See Arnold (1981, p. 253).

     Since local service levels are determined in part by local income

levels, a large variation in personal income within a state (high CVY) is

likely to imply a large variation in the distribution of' local services.

Federal aid can provide additional resources which may—-state politics

permitting-—be allocated towards narrowing public service inequities.

      12For services supported by matching aid, total aid will be defined by

AID      m(X, CVY, 1)   (Own Spending), where m(X, CVY, 1) defines the program's

matching rate.

      3See Boadway and Flatters (1982), particularly at p. 627.

      Feldstein (1975) interprets the school finance court decisions in these

terms.

      15This result has been noted as well for earlier periods in the history

of federal assistance for state-local governments; see Wright (197k) for a

discussion of federal grants during the depression period, and Monypenny

(1960) for an analysis of federal aid in the 1950's.

      l6Olson (1982) and North (1986) develop their theories of government

economic performance around this idea.

      17lnformation on the actual levels of deductions for state and local

taxes are available from Statistics of Income, Department of the Treasury,

Internal Revenue Services, but only for the years 1972-1985. The ratio of

actual deductions to the level of actual state and local taxes is an estimate

of the average rate of deductibility implicit in the federal tax code. A

comparison of this ratio for the available years with the average effective

tax rate of the median income voter for the same years shows the two series to

be very close.

      l8Estimates of the relative contribution of each demand variable to the

growth in total state—local spending were calculated using the estimated

elasticities from eq. (2) above multiplied by the percentage changes in each

demand variable for the time periods 1948—1970, 1970-1980, and 1980—1985.

Annual growth rates in state-local spending due to these changes were then

calculated and compared to the actual annual rate of growth in state-local

spending. For the period 19k8-70, the actual rate of growth in (E + S) was
                                        -36—




2.6t% per year. Had only real income increased, the growth rate would have
been only .66% per year. The increase in aid and the fall in the tax price

(the federal subsidies) by themselves would have increased (E + S) by .9% per

year. The increase in school-aged children (.22% per year) and the crime rate

(1.30% per year) were the major contributors to the growth in (E + 5) for the

periods 198—1970. For the period 1970-80, (E + S) grew at a rate of 2.19%

per year. Income growth alone would have increased (E + S) by .33% per year,

the crime rate alone would have increased (E + S) by 2.3k% and federal aid

alone would have increased (E + S) by .36% per year. The fall off in housing

starts and the baby bust from 1970 onward were negative influences on (E +

S).    Since 1980, the decline in real aid, the fall in the crime rate, and the

fall in school-aged children have all acted to reduce (E + S) while the growth

in real income has increased (E + S); the net effect has been to hold real

(E +   S) constant over the past six years.
       19The ratio of state and local own revenues to state—local residential

income has risen from .151 in 1950 to .167 in 1960, remained stable at that

rate to 1980, and then rose again to .183 by 1985. The number of state—local

employees per 1000 residents has grown steadily from 26 per 1000 in 1950 to 58

per 1000 by 1980, but then fallen slightly to 57 per 1000 by 1985.

       23While   an   individual district tax share of new expenditures on projects

of type x will be 4 T5/Zx T5IET, a coalition's tax share of such

expenditures, inclusive of all coalition members taxes, will be

 z T        or as Ex. = ET.,               =E    T IzT.. If all districts contribute an
sM8/x.,

average   amount (=    T)   to national taxes, then          M   TIN    T = MIN.

       214The fact that x*(M) is less than x*(D) does not mean that districts in

the majority coalition are worse off than they would be as members of a

decentralized legislature. In fact, it is easy to see from Figure 1 that they

are better off. They save the inefficiency associated with the over-provision

of x under decentralization (the approximate triangle from x(C) to x(D)

above b(x, P) but below the full marginal cost line at $1) and they receive a

tax subsidy from the minority coalitions of (1 — MIN)            •
                                                                     x(M).   Further, to

the extent the majority can extract a fiscal transfer from the minority

through the provision of x5            x(C) to the minority, then they benefit

again. This result is simply an example of the general principle that it is

always best to be in a majority coalition of minimum size in a redistribution

game, if you are in any coalition at all. The problem for any individual

legislator is, of course, knowing if he or she will be in the majority

coalition. Redistribution games are very unstable, and legislators may be in

winning majority one moment and out the next. When legislators are at all

uncertain as to whether they will be in or out of the winning coalition, they

may prefer a legislative structure which gives them a smaller, but more

certain net political benefit. This preference for a lower, but more certain

pay-off in legislative re-distribution games has been offered as a rationale

for the currently decentralized nature of Congressional fiscal politics; see

initially Weingast (1979) and more recently Niou and Ordeshook (1985) and

Epple and Riordan (1986).

         25The bias towards equal aid spending across all districts in a
decentralized Congressional setting is discussed in Arnold (1981),

particularly at pp. 265—279.

         26See ACIR (1978) for a summary of the growth in aid programs.

         27Perhaps the most prominent of the state-local employee associations is

the National Education Association (NEA), a teacher union which played an

important role in the Presidential election of Jimmy Carter. They were

rewarded with the establishment of the Office of Education as a new Cabinet

level Department. Elected state-local officials have also organized as lobby

groups in Washington, and perhaps more than any other organizations were

responsible for the passage of General Revenue Sharing; see Beer (1976).

         28To be so, all districts must pay the same amount in federal taxes; see

fn. 23 above.

         29A linear marginal benefit schedule of the form b(x, F)

a
 0
        - a is
            x    + Z8.P.
                     115
                            defines a linear demand curve for x when b(x, —P) is set

equal to the marginal tax cost of x under the alternative legislative
regimes. For the fully cooperative regime, b(x, F)                          1 defines x(C) as

x*(C)                   —
                            (1i)   +
                                         E(./c&1)P.5      ; for the majority rule regime:

                        — (l/a1)'5   +                      and for the decentralized regime:
x*(M)        (a/a1)                        E(8/ai)P5
x*(D)        (a0/a.1)
                        — (l/ai)5      +
                                           EB./ai)P5.
         30More formally, the specification in eq. (6)                 implies   Ax(D) =

    N
    E 5(D)(P0p5,'0p ) and (M)= E 5(M)(Pop5/ E Pop5)(P/Pop1),
s:1                                           sM                     S€P4

where x(D) x*(D) — x*(C),                  Ax (K) =    x*(M)   —   x*(C),   Pops is the population

in district s, and               and          are average population sizes for majority

districts and all districts respectively. For most purposes it seems

reasonable to assume (P/)                       1; thus Ax(M) is an estimate of the average

 increase in per capita aid in majority coalition districts.

     31Aid spending in calendar year 1982 was defined largely by the budget

for fiscal year 1982, ending on September 30, 1982. The Fl 1982 budget was

approved during the calendar year 1981 and reflects the policies of the first

year of the Reagan administration.

     32The Reagan-Stockman budget strategy is well described in Stockman

(1986), particularly Chapter 5.

     33The important role of the President in the passage of the Reagan

budgets is described in Stockxnan (1986), particularly Chapter 6.

     3The results for a regression of total aid minus only GRS funding are

similar to those in eqs. (6c) and (6d), though the estimates for the

Congressional coefficients are not as precise as those for eqs. (6c) and

(6d). While it is reassuring that all these alternative specifications give

the same conclusion, there are good reasons to embrace eq. (6c) using total

aid expenditures as the preferred specification. Beer's (1976) review of the

passage of GRS makes clear that it was largely decentralized Congressional

fiscal politics which defined the aid formula and the levels of assistance.

Stockman's discussion of the attempts to trim welfare and Medicaid assistance

show the same incentives dominate these programs as well; see Stockman (1986)

at the index references for AFDC and Medicaid and at p. L1J42, particularly.

     35For a discussion of the political fate of the New Federalism, see the

National Journal (1982). In the Appendix to his book on Reagan budget

policies, Stockman reviews the final record of his efforts to trim the federal

aid budget and concludes that while some progress has been made, it may not be

permanent: "(e)very big program and every piddling program that marched out

of the Cutting Room dead or bleeding in February, 1981 lived to tell about

it." And both Republicans and Democrats in Congress were on the "first—aid

team." Stockman (1986, p. 14)42). The recent veto over-rides suggests a

revival may be coming.
