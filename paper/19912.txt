JEL No. Q41,Q54

                                               ABSTRACT

The commercial real estate sector is responsible for a large share of a city’s overall carbon footprint.
An ongoing trend in this sector has been the entry of big-box stores such as Wal-Mart. Using a unique
monthly panel data set for every Wal-Mart store in California from 2006 through 2011, we document
three main findings about the environmental performance of big-box retailers. First, Wal-Mart’s stores
exhibit very little store-to-store variation in electricity consumption relative to a control group of similar
size and vintage retail stores. Second, Wal-Mart’s store’s electricity consumption is lower in higher
priced utilities and is independent of the store’s ownership versus leased status. Third, unlike other
commercial businesses, Wal-Mart’s newer buildings consume less electricity. Together, these results
highlight the key roles that corporate size and centralization of management play in determining a
key indicator of a firm’s overall environmental performance.

Introduction


   Big-box retail stores represent a growing share of commercial real estate’s total

square footage in the United States, with Wal-Mart alone operating 641 million square

feet of retail real estate in 2013. An ongoing policy debate has focused on how local

quality of life, local public finances and local workers’ total compensation are affected

when “Wal-Mart comes to town.” While the conventional wisdom is that big box retail

stores cause the closings of competitor local retailers, recent academic research paints a

more nuanced picture (see Emek Basker, 2007, Emek Basker et. al., 2012, and Russell S.

Sobel and Andrea M. Dean, 2008). Critics have also been concerned that Wal-Mart

causes extra local traffic and hence diminishes local quality of life, but Devin G. Pope

and Jaren C. Pope (2012) conduct a hedonic event study and conclude that home prices

increase in a vicinity of new Wal-Mart store openings. This capitalization approach

suggests that Wal-Mart’s openings raise quality of life or at least represent a new

valuable amenity in residential areas where the firm choses to locate.

   The greenhouse gas emissions of big-box retailers represent another metric for

judging the impact of big-box stores. Retailers such as Wal-Mart produce greenhouse gas

emissions when they transport goods from factories (often located in China) to their

distribution centers in the U.S., and then on to their stores. Big-box retailers also generate

greenhouse gas emissions at their stores, through energy consumption from heating and

cooling, refrigeration, and lighting. This direct impact of big-box retailers on energy

consumption is an important component of the real estate capital stock’s carbon footprint.

In 2012, 46 percent of the nation’s electricity was generated using coal and 20 percent




                                              1
using natural gas. This reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation means that there

is a significant greenhouse gas externality associated with electricity consumption.1

    In the absence of carbon pricing, no retailer has an incentive to take costly actions to

reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, 2 but of course, the sources of these emissions –

diesel for trucks and electricity for heating, cooling and lighting of stores – directly affect

a firm’s profitability. Indeed, in the diffusion of its stores, Wal-Mart evaluates the

distance between potential locations to its distribution centers to economize on

transportation costs (Thomas J. Holmes, 2011).

    This paper builds on the nascent “big box” literature by examining the environmental

performance of Wal-Mart’s stores, with a focus on their electricity consumption. Using a

unique monthly panel data that includes electricity consumption for every Wal-Mart store

in California from 2006 to 2011, we document three main results about the energy

performance of Wal-Mart’s stores. First, there is a remarkable degree of consistency in

Wal-Mart store electricity consumption per square foot of real estate. Across more than

200 Wal-Mart stores, the monthly variation in electricity consumption per square foot of

real estate is much smaller than the across variation for a control sample of retail stores.

    Second, we reject the hypothesis that this low dispersion in consumption in Wal-Mart

stores is caused by the firm custom building stores to achieve a “cookie cutter”

performance. Using data on the electricity consumption of stores that Wal-Mart has

leased versus built for itself, we find no difference in electricity consumption.

  A recent report finds that some of the largest global companies, including Wal-Mart, have recently started
to incorporate a price on carbon in their long-term financial planning to anticipate future regulation on
carbon emissions. See https://www.cdp.net/CDPResults/companies-carbon-pricing-2013.pdf.


                                                     2
   Third, we document evidence that newly constructed Wal-Mart stores have

significantly lower electricity consumption than older buildings – this contrast with

results documented for commercial buildings in general, where higher quality, newer

vintages of commercial buildings actually consume more electricity than older buildings

(Matthew E. Kahn et al., 2013).

   We propose two hypotheses that can explain these facts. The first explanation focuses

on the role of managerial human capital and expertise in generating a consistent

environmental performance across operations. If there is a fixed cost to acquiring

expertise in energy efficiency, then firms who operate numerous commercial buildings

will have a greater incentive to make this investment than retailers who own and operate

just one retail store. The human capital argument is an optimistic, albeit unexpected

message for environmentalists, because it suggests that industrial concentration can

actually lead to higher levels of energy efficiency (Nicholas Bloom et al., 2011).

   The second hypothesis relates to the ability of large corporation to make more

optimal capital investment decisions as compared to small, “mom and pop” storeowners.

Large retailers such as Wal-Mart are economic decision-makers, not hindered by capital

or liquidity constraints. Such firms that are led by professional managers, monitored by a

board of directors, are less likely to suffer from behavioral biases that may otherwise lead

to suboptimal investment in energy efficiency (Tom Tietenberg, 2009). It has been

documented that across the retail sector, stores belonging to large chains tend to invest

more in information technology (Lucia Foster et al., 2006). Indeed, Wal-Mart has been at

the forefront in the adoption of tools for more efficient “production” (Thomas J. Holmes,

2011) and a similar effect seems to play out for optimizing building energy efficiency.




                                             3
We also document differences in energy efficiency based on local utility rates, which

provides some support for this “rational optimization” hypothesis.

   This paper’s findings contribute to the empirical literature measuring corporate social

responsibility (“CSR”). The CSR literature highlights the multitude of different rankings

and criteria used for creating a single index of this ambiguous concept (see Antonio

Márquez and Charles J. Fombrun, 2005, and Duygu Turker, 2009). To collapse a set of

criteria into a single index requires index weights. These weights implicitly embed the

sustainability priorities of the person creating the ranking.

   Given the paramount importance of the climate change mitigation challenge, we

argue that benchmarking big-box stores with respect to their in-house carbon production

is an important exercise. Our approach can be scaled up to compare companies over time

and to make cross-company comparisons at a point in time.

   This paper also contributes to the recent literature on measuring the urban carbon

footprint. This literature has focused on the residential carbon footprint generated by

transportation and residential electricity consumption and home heating consumption

(Edward L. Glaeser and Matthew E. Kahn, 2010). But, the commercial building sector is

a major part of the urban capital stock, and the carbon emissions from these buildings

now actually surpass the impact of transportation and the residential sector in most

developed economies (Matthew E. Kahn, Nils Kok and John M. Quigley, 2013).

   The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the main

determinants of how big-box stores contribute to greenhouse gas production, and

develops the hypotheses tested in the paper. Section III provides an overview of the

unique panel of data on energy consumption in a large set of Wal-Mart stores. Section IV




                                              4
  presents the results of the estimations, and Section V provides a conclusion and

  discussion.



I.    The Economics of Carbon Emissions of Big-Box Retailers

      The impact of big-box retailers on global carbon emissions stems from several steps

  in the supply chain, including initial shipments of factory goods to the distribution center,

  distribution of these goods to the final retail stores and the activity that takes place in the

  retail stores. Of course, the manufacturing of goods also leads to carbon emissions, but

  these are generally considered to be outside of the scope of the big-box retailer, which

  acts as a “middleman.”3

      At the point of sale, there are two factors at play in determining the energy impact of

  the purchase: the efficiency of the store, and the energy used by consumers when making

  their trip to the store. Wal-Mart has an incentive to locate near population centers and this

  reduces driving.4 Within a local retail market where a Wal-Mart operates, consumers face

  a choice concerning what retail trips to make to various retailers or perhaps travelling

  further to a Wal-Mart and making many purchases during that single trip (Morton E.

  O'Kelly, 1983, A. Okoruwa et al., 1988). Recent work by Kristin Lovejoy et al. (2013)

  documents that when a big-box Target store opens, vehicle miles travelled decline. This

  suggests that shoppers are making fewer trips and engage in more “one stop” shopping

  when the big-box store opens.



  3 With the outsourcing of manufacturing to low-cost countries, the carbon externality of production has
  now shifted away from the actual location of consumption.
  4 Wal-Mart‘s low prices mean that consumers buy more products, which ultimately leads to higher carbon

  emissions (Christian Broda et al., 2009). This raises an opportunity cost question of the carbon content of
  an extra dollar of Wal-Mart sales relative to all alternative uses for that dollar, but in this paper, we focus
  on carbon emissions from retail stores only.


                                                        5
      Once goods are stocked and consumers are at the store, the commercial building’s

attributes play a key role in determining the carbon impact of the product. For example,

retail giant H&M emits 50 percent of its total corporate carbon emissions through

electricity consumption in stores (and corporate offices).5 The buildings that firms own,

lease, and operate thus represent an important part of their environmental impact, which

has become increasingly relevant to corporations. Depending on whether a store is owned

or leased (and, in case of the latter, the lease structure), a retailer has control over the

quality of equipment for heating, ventilating and cooling the facility, as well as the

quality of appliances such as lighting and refrigeration units.

      Presumably, an on-site manager can influence the use-intensity of the equipment,

which depends on the performance of the store, as well the training (“human capital”) of

the manager or his engineer. Research based on a sample of 300 British manufacturing

firms highlights a negative correlation between firm energy intensity and an index of the

firm’s management quality (Nicholas Bloom et al., 2011). One explanation for this

correlation is that management quality is associated with improved productivity and an

indicator of productivity is output per unit of energy. Since energy consumption leads to

greenhouse gas production, holding the scale of production constant, firms with higher

quality management produce less greenhouse gas emissions.



      A. Main Empirical Hypotheses

      Given that technological progress, in combination with economies of scale and scope,

have made Wal-Mart a major contributor to the overall increase in productivity and

efficiency in the retail sector (Emek Basker, 2007), we expect that the environmental
5
    See H&M “Conscious Actions Sustainability Report 2012” (p.60).


                                                   6
performance of Wal-Mart stores differs from its peers. In particular, we focus on the

“standardization” of environmental performance across stores, driven by the rollout of

highly similar equipment across stores, and consistent training of on-site engineers.



   H1: Wal-Mart stores feature limited dispersion in environmental performance,

relative to a comparable group of control stores.

   H2: The ownership structure of Wal-Mart stores has no effect on the environmental

performance of these stores.



   While residential electricity consumption patterns have been well-studied (see for a

discussion Dirk Brounen et al., 2012, and Koichiro Ito, 2014), we know very little about

how commercial buildings, occupied by some of the major corporations, perform over

time, or about the heterogeneity of the performance. However, there is some evidence

that sophisticated commercial owners and tenants capitalize energy savings when leasing

or purchasing office space (Piet M.A. Eichholtz et al., 2013). We posit that Wal-Mart’s

size, access to capital, and management expertise allows it to act as if it is a “ruthless cost

minimizer” that we observe in the intermediate micro textbooks. Such a firm would stand

in contrast to inefficient residential consumers who, for a variety of potential reasons

leave money on the table, the so-called “energy efficiency paradox” (for a discussion of

the residential literature, see Hunt Allcott and Alan Greenstone, 2012).

   For Wal-Mart, stores and other facilities represent the largest fraction of the corporate

carbon footprint, and electricity represents the second-highest operating expense. These




                                              7
expenses rise proportionately with local energy prices and this provides a strong incentive

to economize on energy consumption.



    H3: In areas where electricity prices are higher, we expect Wal-Mart to display

higher temperature-adjusted levels of energy efficiency.



    In 2005, Wal-Mart pledged a corporate commitment to develop a store prototype that

would be 25-30 percent more energy efficient by 2009. The corporate target was to

reduce carbon emissions from existing facilities by 20 percent in 2011 (compared to

2005).

    While this suggests that Wal-Mart’s new stores would be more energy efficient than

older stores, Wal-Mart has also made investments to retrofit its older stores. Wal-Mart

has embarked on an energy efficiency program, including lighting retrofits through

replacing conventional lighting by LEDs, and installing more efficient refrigeration

units. 6 The empirical results reported below recover estimates of the net differential

electricity consumption in recent vintage Wal-Mart stores as compared to earlier vintage

Wal-Marts, allowing us to test whether the vintage effects documented by Matthew E.

Kahn et al. (2013), where newer, higher quality buildings consumer more electricity than

otherwise comparable, but older buildings, holds for big-box retailers.



    H4: Newly constructed Wal-Mart stores outperform less recently constructed stores

in energy-use intensity

II.      Data and Methods

         Through a unique research partnership with Wal-Mart, we obtain access to

   information on the monthly electricity consumption across all Wal-Mart stores in

   California. This information includes both consumption, as well as the physical

   characteristics of the stores, such as year of construction, size and store type (Sam’s Club,

   Supercenter, or Wal-Mart). Of course, weather is an important determinant of electricity

   consumption in buildings. Using geocoding techniques, each Wal-Mart store is assigned

   to the reporting weather station closest to the centroid of the zip code containing the

   store, where the temperature data comes from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center.7

   We also obtain information on the utility district corresponding with each of the stores (in

   our case, we focus on San Diego Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and Pacific

   Gas & Electric), and the wholesale electricity prices in the districts.

         Figure 1 shows a map of the stores that we study in this paper. To put this into

   perspective: Wal-Mart currently operates 4,663 stores across all states in the U.S.,

   including 3,182 Supercenters, 620 Sam’s Clubs, and 554 “regular” Wal-Mart stores (as

   well as 258 Neighborhood Markets and a small number of other store concepts).

         To make comparisons with the energy efficiency of retail stores that are not owned

   and/or operated by Wal-Mart, we create a matched sample of retail stores located in a

   “Western” utility district. An elaborate description of the dataset is in Matthew E. Kahn

   et al. (2013). To make more precise evaluations, we apply two additional selection

   criteria. First, we focus on stores that are comparable in size (between 50,000 and

   250,000 sq.ft.). Second, we run a propensity score model, predicting the likelihood of a
   7
       See http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/.


                                                 9
store in the control sample to be a Wal-Mart store by its observable characteristics, such

as building size and age. We then match each Wal-Mart store with its “nearest neighbor”

(see Dan A. Black and Jeffrey A. Smith, 2004, for an application), based on the estimated

propensity scores.

    To test the first hypothesis, which focuses on the “standardization” of Wal-Mart

activity across stores, we estimate the variation in energy consumption per square foot

(the “energy use intensity”) for all Wal-Mart stores, and for our set of control stores in

the same geographic area:

    (1)

    In equation (1), we regress the natural logarithm of the energy use per square foot in

Wal-Mart store i in month t on a spline of outdoor temperature knots and an error term

(assumed i.i.d.). We then predict the average store electricity consumption holding

outdoor temperature constant.

    We also report results based on estimating equation (2), which represents a reduced-

form regression model explaining the energy use intensity per square foot as a function of

outdoor temperature, building attributes and other observable characteristics:

    (2)

    In equation (2),         are store type-fixed effects (Supercenter, Wal-Mart, or Sam’s

Club),     is a vector of store-specific characteristics, such as its vintage and size,   are

month-fixed effects, controlling for unobservable shocks to electricity consumption

common to each store i. To control more precisely for locational effects as related to local

electricity rates, we include a set of dummy variables,       , one for each unique electric

utility.   is an error term, assumed to be i.i.d.


                                              10
III.   Results

       A. Standardization of Wal-Mart Stores

       In this section, we study the hypothesis that Wal-Mart consistently applies the same

   energy management practices across its large set of stores. As our sample of Wal-Mart

   stores covers a wide area across California, the variation in climate and the intensity of

   business activities yields different requirements regarding temperature settings, lighting,

   and other energy-consuming equipment and appliances. Given that the varying locations

   feature different local labor markets, it is possible that worker discretion over day-to-day

   activities at the store (for example, heating or cooling settings) and design decisions over

   lighting, insulation, and cooling, could lead to very different energy consumption patterns

   across stores.

       Figure 2 shows the energy consumption per square foot for the sample of Wal-Mart

   stores and the control sample. These simple comparisons provide some insight into the

   deviation from the average consumption in both samples. The estimations of Model (1)

   are reported in Table 1. This table reports the empirical distribution of the average

   electricity consumption by store while standardizing for outdoor temperature. The key

   finding is the minimal dispersion of energy consumption per square foot across all Wal-

   Mart stores, and per store type. For Wal-Mart, its stores in the 99th percentile (i.e., the

   least efficient stores) consume just 34 percent more energy as compared to the average

   Wal-Mart store, and stores in the 1st percentile (i.e., the most efficient stores) consume

   only about 50 percent less as compared to the average Wal-Mart store.




                                               11
   Columns (5) and (6) show the variation of energy consumption based on estimates of

equation (1) for the control sample. For all retail buildings in the control sample, the least

efficient stores (99th percentile) consume almost three times as much electricity as

compared to the average store. This variation is slightly smaller for the propensity-score

matched sample.

   These findings suggest that Wal-Mart standardizes the construction and operation of

the energy performance of its stores. The absence of wide differentials across stores

suggests that centralized management practices are more important than any idiosyncratic

store-specific factors, such as the assignment of one building engineer to a store. In

contrast, in our control sample, buildings are owned and operated by a large variety of

investors and tenants. This leads to idiosyncratic factors more strongly influencing

building energy consumption, where some buildings are operated in a highly efficient

manner, and some other buildings running inefficiently. It is important to emphasize that

our control group set of stores represents other retail stores of similar size and vintage.



   B. Capital Vintage Effects

   The environmental implications of the capital stock differ across sectors. In the case

of electric utilities, many older power plants are grandfathered and do not face severe

Clean Air Act regulations (Randy A. Nelson et al., 1993). In the case of cars, the vehicle

fleet’s local pollution emissions have been falling sharply over time as new vehicles emit

much less pollution per mile than early model year vehicles such as those build in the

1970s (Matthew E. Kahn and Joel Schwartz, 2008). In the case of fleet fuel economy,




                                             12
Christopher R. Knittel (2012) documents that fuel economy progress slowed down during

the times of low gas prices as new car makers focused on other dimensions of quality.

    In contrast, in the case of commercial real estate, Matthew E. Kahn et al. (2013)

document a positive correlation between commercial building quality and electricity

consumption. They argue that for commercial real estate, the quality of real estate and

electricity consumption are likely to be complements. This hypothesis suggests that, in

the absence of carbon pricing, as the older lower quality commercial real estate stock is

replaced with new, higher quality capital, that energy consumption per square foot will

rise.

    Table 2 shows the estimation results of equation (2), documenting that more recently

constructed Wal-Mart stores consume significantly less electricity than older stores. 8

Stores built during the past decade use about four percent less electricity as compared to

stores constructed before 1995. This finding contrasts with findings for commercial real

estate in general. Whereas quality and energy consumption are complements for most of

the durable building stock, Wal-Mart keeps the quality of the stores constant, while

improving the efficiency of the equipment, leading to a decrease in energy use intensity

for newly constructed stores.



    C. Efficient Investments

    We also test hypotheses related to the role of commercial real estate ownership

structure and local electric utility energy pricing in determining a Wal-Mart store’s


8
  In studying the impact of these factors on big-box store electricity consumption, we use our unique data
set. Despite the number of variables that we can access, we recognize that there will be unobserved
determinants of building electricity consumption. In estimating equation (2) using OLS, we are assuming
that the error term is not correlated with the explanatory variables.


                                                   13
  electricity consumption. For each Wal-Mart store, we know whether the commercial

  building is leased or is owned by Wal-Mart. If Wal-Mart engages in customization of

  buildings that creates energy efficiency, then we would expect to find that leasing has a

  positive effect on electricity consumption (i.e., it increases consumption, ceteris paribus).

  As shown in Column (2) of Table 2, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the coefficient is

  zero. This result suggests that central management takes actions to negate any initial

  conditions such that a leased piece of real estate is inherently inefficient. Since Wal-Mart

  is the tenant, it has no short run incentive to modify the structure of the building itself.

        From the location of each Wal-Mart store, we also know the corresponding utility

  district. Presumably, a value-maximizing corporation would invest more in energy

  efficiency in areas where energy prices are higher. In Column (2) of Table 2, we report

  the coefficient estimates for the dummy variables for each of the major utilities (PG&E is

  the base dummy). We find the largest negative coefficient for Wal-Mart stores in the San

  Diego (SDGE) territory. This is the utility where commercial consumers face the highest

  average prices 9 and we find that Wal-Mart store electricity consumption is 9 percent

  lower as compared to electricity consumption in stores that are located in the cheaper

  PG&E territory. It is important to note that these results include controls for local

  temperature conditions.



IV.     Conclusions

        The commercial real estate sector is a major determinant of a city’s overall carbon

  footprint. While all major companies discuss their efforts to achieve corporate socially

                                                   14
responsibility targets, these quantitative measures are often elusive and do not often

provide direct information about the firm’s true environmental social costs.

   In this paper, we argue that a company’s electricity consumption is a verifiable and

meaningful indicator of its overall environmental performance.        We investigate the

energy consumption differences for Wal-Mart stores in California as compared to similar

retail stores of similar size and building age owned and/or managed by a diverse set of

investors and tenants. We document strong evidence of standardization across buildings

by Wal-Mart, leading to limited variation in energy consumption across buildings. The

electricity consumption of Wal-Mart stores does not depend on the ownership status of

the actual stores (leased versus owned), but stores that are located in more expensive

utility areas feature lower electricity consumption. We also find that newer Wal-Mart

stores consume less electricity as compared to older stores. This result stands in contrast

to other findings for commercial buildings.

   Together, these results highlight the role that both management and access to

financial capital may play in determining the retail sector’s environmental performance.

Our findings suggest that large corporations are more likely to make investments in

improving the efficiency of their durable capital. Given our data, we are unable to

disentangle how much of this fact is due to better access to capital, a focus on cost

minimization rather than “utility maximization,” or access to better human capital in

managing the firm’s capital stock. All of these factors imply that industrial concentration

can actually lead to higher levels of energy efficiency.

   The results in this paper also provide a perspective on carbon emissions as an

externality from activities in the commercial real estate sector, and how large




                                              15
corporations might be affected if carbon were to be priced. Some simple calculations

show that, using the 2009 emission factor for California and an assumed social cost of

carbon of $32 per ton of carbon dioxide, the total carbon externality from Wal-Mart

stores in California is $7 million (in 2009), or 23 cents/sq.ft.10 This is a tangible corporate

environmental performance measure that can be compared over time and across different

commercial real estate entities, and across different corporate occupiers of commercial

real estate such as big-box retailers.

utilities (see http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/egrid/index.html).

Notes:

          The table reports the empirical distribution of the average electricity consumption by store while
          standardizing for outdoor temperature, based on estimating equation (1).

          “All Retail” includes retail stores that are comparable in size (between 50,000 and 250,000 sq.ft.).

          “PSM Sample” includes retail stores that are the “nearest neighbor” match for each Wal-Mart
          store, based on estimated propensity scores.
