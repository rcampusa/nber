Risk, Unemployment, and the Stock Market: A Rare-Event-Based Explanation of Labor Market
Volatility

                                           ABSTRACT

What is the driving force behind the cyclical behavior of unemployment and vacancies? What is
the relation between job-creation incentives of firms and stock market valuations? We answer
these questions in a model with time-varying risk, modeled as a small and variable probability of
an economic disaster. A high probability implies greater risk and lower future growth, lowering
the incentives of firms to invest in hiring. During periods of high risk, stock market valuations are
low and unemployment rises. The model thus explains volatility in equity and labor markets, and
the relation between the two.

1     Introduction

The Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides (DMP) model of search and matching offers an intriguing
theory of labor market fluctuations based on the job creation incentives of employers (Diamond
(1982), Pissarides (1985), Mortensen and Pissarides (1994)). When the contribution of a new hire
to firm value decreases, employers reduce investment in hiring, decreasing the number of vacancies
and, in turn, increasing unemployment. Due to the glut of jobseekers in the labor market, vacancies
become easier for employers to fill. Therefore, unemployment stabilizes at a higher level and the
number of vacancies at a lower level. That is, labor market tightness (defined as the ratio of
vacancies to unemployment) decreases until the payoff to hiring changes again.
    While the mechanism of the DMP model is intuitive, it fails to answer a fundamental ques-
tion: what causes job-creation incentives, and hence unemployment, to vary? The canonical DMP
model and numerous successor models suggest that the driving force is labor productivity. How-
ever, explaining labor market volatility based on productivity fluctuations is difficult, because
unemployment and vacancies are much more volatile than labor productivity (Shimer (2005)).
Furthermore, unemployment does not track the movements of labor productivity, as is partic-
ularly apparent in the last three recessions. Rather, these recent data suggest a link between
unemployment and stock market valuations (Hall (2015)).
    In this paper, we make use of the DMP mechanism to explain the cyclical behavior of unem-
ployment. However, rather than linking labor market tightness to productivity itself, we propose
an equilibrium model in which fluctuations in labor market tightness arise from a small and time-
varying probability of an economic disaster. Even if current labor productivity remains constant,
disaster fears lower the job-creation incentives of firms. The labor market equilibrium shifts to a
lower point on the vacancy-unemployment locus (the Beveridge curve), with higher unemployment
and lower vacancy openings. At the same time, stock market valuations decline.
    Our model generates a high volatility in unemployment and vacancies, along with a strong neg-
ative correlation between the two. This pattern of results accurately describes post-war U.S. data.
We calibrate wage dynamics to match the behavior of the labor share in the data and find that


                                                1
matching the observed low response of wages to labor market conditions is crucial for both labor
market volatility and realistic behavior of financial markets. Furthermore, the search and match-
ing friction in the labor market and time-varying disaster risk result in a realistic equity premium
and stock return volatility. Because the labor market and the stock market are driven by the same
force, the price of the aggregate stock market and labor market tightness are highly correlated,
while the correlation between labor productivity and tightness is realistically low.
       Our paper is related to three strands of literature. First, since Shimer (2005) showed that
the DMP model with standard parameter values implies small movements in unemployment and
vacancies, a strand of literature has further developed the model to generate large responses
of unemployment to aggregate shocks. In these papers, the aggregate shock driving the labor
market is labor productivity. Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008) argue that a calibration of the
model combining low bargaining power of workers with a high opportunity cost of employment
can reconcile unemployment volatility in the DMP model with the data. Other papers suggest
alternatives to the Nash bargaining assumption for wages (Hall (2005), Hall and Milgrom (2008),
Gertler and Trigari (2009)). Compared with Nash bargaining, these alternatives render wages
less responsive to productivity shocks. Thus a productivity shock can have a larger effect on
job-creation incentives. Our paper departs from these in that we do not rely on time-varying
labor market productivity as a driver of labor market tightness, which leads to a counterfactually
high correlation between these variables. Furthermore, we also derive implications for the stock
market, and explain the equity premium and volatility puzzles.1
       Second, the present work relates to ones that embed the DMP model into the real business cycle
framework, with a representative risk averse household that makes investment and consumption
decisions. In the standard real business cycle (RBC) model (Kydland and Prescott (1982)),
   1
    Other recent work connects time-variation in discount rates to unemployment. Eckstein, Setty, and Weiss
(2015) solve a DMP model with risk-neutral investors and exogenous discount rates where labor and capital are
complements. They show that volatility in corporate discount rates can account for volatility in unemployment.
Hall (2015) conjectures that a DMP model in which discount rates that rise in recessions can explain unemployment,
and shows that, when an exogenous stochastic discount factor is estimated using the aggregate stock market, the
resulting time series of unemployment tracks that in the data. Neither paper provides a general equilibrium model.
Our results show that the connection between discount rates, recessions, and unemployment in a general equilibrium
DMP model is more subtle than one might think (see Section 3.4).



                                                        2
employment is driven by the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure, and,
because the labor market is frictionless, no vacancies go unfilled. Merz (1995) and Andolfatto
(1996) observe that this model has counterfactual predictions for the correlation of productivity
and employment, and build models that incorporate RBC features and search frictions in the
labor market. These models capture the lead-lag relation between employment and productivity
while having more realistic implications for wages and unemployment compared to the baseline
RBC model. In this paper, we also document the lead-lag relation between productivity and
employment in the period that this literature analyzes (1959 - 1988). However, our empirical
analysis shows that this lead-lag relation is absent in more recent data. These papers do not study
asset pricing implications.
   Third, our paper is related to the literature on asset prices in dynamic production economies.
In these models, as in the RBC framework described above, consumption and dividend dynamics
are endogenously determined by the optimal equilibrium policy of a representative firm. This
contrasts with the more standard asset-pricing approach of assuming an endowment economy, in
which consumption and dividends are taken as given. The main difficulty in production economies
is endogenous consumption smoothing (Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer (2010), Lettau and Uhlig
(2000)). While higher risk aversion raises the equity premium in an endowment economy, this
leads to even smoother consumption in production economies resulting in very little fluctuation
in marginal utility. One way of overcoming this problem is to assume alternative preferences, for
example, habit formation as in Boldrin, Christiano, and Fisher (2001) and Jermann (1998), though
these can lead to highly volatile riskfree rates. Another approach is to allow for rare disasters.
Barro (2006) and Rietz (1988) demonstrate that allowing for rare disasters in an endowment
economy can explain the equity premium puzzle. Building on this work, Gourio (2012) studies the
implications of time-varying disaster risk modeled as large drops in productivity and destruction
of physical capital in a business cycle model with recursive preferences and capital adjustment
costs. Gourio’s model can explain the observed co-movement between investment and risk premia.
However, unlevered equity returns have little volatility, and thus the premium on unlevered equity
is low. This model can be reconciled with the observed equity premium by adding financial

                                                3
leverage, but the leverage ratio must be high in comparison with the data. Also, as in RBC models
with frictionless labor markets, Gourio’s model does not explain unemployment. Petrosky-Nadeau,
Zhang, and Kuehn (2013) build a model where rare disasters arise endogenously through a series
of negative productivity shocks. Like our paper, they make use of the DMP model, but with a very
different aim and implementation. Their paper incorporates a calibration of Nash-bargained wages
similar to Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008), leading to wages that are high and rigid. Moreover,
their specification of marginal vacancy opening costs includes a fixed component, implying that
it costs more to post a vacancy when labor conditions are slack and thus when output is low.
Finally, they assume that workers separate from their jobs at a rate that is high compared with
the data. The combination of a high separation rate, fixed marginal costs of vacancy openings
and high and inelastic wages amplifies negative shocks to productivity and produces a negatively
skewed output and consumption distribution. Like other DMP-based models described above,
their model implies that labor market tightness is driven by productivity. Furthermore, while
their model can match the equity premium, the fact that their simulations contain consumption
disasters make it unclear whether the model can match the high stock market volatility and low
consumption volatility that characterize the U.S. postwar data.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides empirical evidence about the relation
between the labor market, labor productivity and the stock market. Section 3 presents the model
and illustrates the mechanism in a simplified version. Section 4 discusses the quantitative results
from the benchmark calibration and alternative calibrations. Section 5 concludes.



2     Labor Market, Labor Productivity and Stock Market

      Valuations

In the literature succeeding the canonical DMP model, labor productivity serves as the driving
force behind volatility in unemployment and vacancies. Recent empirical work, however, has
challenged this approach on the grounds that labor productivity is too stable compared with un-



                                                4
employment and vacancies, and that the variables are at best weakly correlated. In this section we
summarize evidence on the interplay between unemployment, productivity and the stock market.
       In Figure 1, we plot the time series of labor productivity Z and of the vacancy-unemployment
ratio V /U , the variable that summarizes the behavior of the labor market in the DMP model.2
Both variables are shown as log deviations from an HP trend.3 Figure 1 shows the disconnect
between the volatility of V /U and of productivity: labor productivity Z never deviates by more
than 5 percent from trend, while, in contrast, V /U is highly volatile and deviates up to a full log
point from trend. The lack of volatility in productivity as compared with labor market tightness is
one challenge facing models that seek to explain unemployment using fluctuations in productivity.
       Another challenge arises from the co-movement in these variables. Figure 1 shows that tightness
and productivity did track each other in the recessions of the early 1960s and 1980s. However,
this contemporaneous correlation disappears in the later part of the sample. A striking example
of this disconnect is the aftermath of the Great Recession, which simultaneously features a small
productivity boom along with a labor-market collapse. Overall, the contemporaneous correlation
between the variables is 0.10 as measured over the full sample, 0.47 until 1985 and -0.36 afterwards.
There is some evidence that Z leads V /U ; the maximum correlation between V /U and lagged Z
occurs with a lag length of one year. However, this relation also does not persist in the second
subsample; while the correlation over the full sample is 0.31, it is 0.62 in the subsample before
1985 and -0.09 after 1985.
       While the data display little relation between unemployment and productivity, there is a
relation between unemployment and the stock market.4 We will focus on the ratio of stock market
valuation P to labor productivity (output per person in the non-farm business sector) Z because
P/Z has a clean counterpart in our model.5 Figure 3 shows a consistently positive correlation
   2
     All variables are measured in real terms. See Appendix D for a description of the data.
   3
     Following Shimer (2005) we use a low-frequency HP filter with smoothing parameter 105 throughout to capture
business cycle fluctuations. All results are robust to using an HP filter with smoothing parameter 1,600.
   4
     Our study focuses on the time-series relation between hiring and the stock market. Belo, Lin, and Bazdresch
(2014) demonstrates a cross-sectional relation between required rates of return and hiring: firms that hire more
appear to have lower risk premia. The same mechanism that we employ to explain the time series patterns can
also account for this evidence.
   5
     P/Z closely tracks Robert Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio (P/E), as shown in Figure 2. The
correlation between the quarterly observations of these series is 0.97 for the period from 1951 to 2013.


                                                        5
between labor market tightness V /U and valuation P/Z. The correlation over the full sample is
0.47. In the period from 1986 to 2013, the correlation is 0.71. Moreover, like V /U , P/Z is volatile,
with deviations up to 0.5 log points below trend. Figure 4 shows that vacancies V follow a similar
pattern to V /U .
    Why might labor markets be tightly connected with stock market valuations, but not with
current productivity? In the sections that follow, we offer a model to answer this question.



3     Model

In Section 3.1 we review the DMP model of the labor market with search frictions. In Section 3.2,
we use the DMP model with minimal additional assumptions to demonstrate a link between equity
market valuations and labor market quantities. We confirm that this link holds in the data. In
Section 3.3 we present a general equilibrium model that explains labor market and stock market
volatility in terms of time-varying disaster risk (we will examine the quantitative implications of
this model in Section 4). In Section 3.4 we give closed-form solutions in a special case of the model
in which disaster risk is a constant. This special case gives intuition for how disaster risk affects
labor market quantities and prices in financial markets.


3.1    Search frictions

The labor market is characterized by the DMP model of search and matching. The representative
firm posts a number of job vacancies Vt ≥ 0. The hiring flow is determined according to the
matching function m(Nt , Vt ), where Nt is employment in the economy and lies between 0 and 1.
We assume that the matching function takes the following Cobb-Douglas form:

                                    m(Nt , Vt ) = ξ(1 − Nt )η Vt1−η ,                             (1)




                                                   6
where ξ is matching efficiency and η is the unemployment elasticity of the hiring flow. As a result,
the aggregate law of motion for employment is given by

                                        Nt+1 = (1 − s)Nt + m(Nt , Vt ),                            (2)

where s is the separation rate.6 Define labor market tightness as follows:

                                                             Vt
                                                    θt =        .
                                                             Ut

The unemployment rate in the economy is given by Ut = 1 − Nt . Thus the probability of finding
a job for an unemployed worker is m(Nt , Vt )/Ut = ξθt1−η . Accordingly, we define the job-finding
rate f (θt ) to be
                                                 f (θt ) = ξθt1−η .                                (3)

Analogously, the probability of filling a vacancy posted by the representative firm is m(Nt , Vt )/Vt =
ξθt−η which corresponds to the vacancy-filling rate q(θt ) in the economy:

                                                  q(θt ) = ξθt−η .                                 (4)

The functional form of f and q provide useful insights about the mechanism of the DMP model.
The job-finding rate is increasing, and the vacancy-filling rate is decreasing in the vacancy-
unemployment ratio. In times of high labor market tightness, namely, when the vacancy rate
is high and/or the unemployment rate is low, the probability of finding a job per unit time in-
creases, whereas filling a vacancy takes more time.
       Finally, the representative firm incurs costs κt per vacancy opening. As a result, aggregate
investment in hiring is κt Vt .


3.2        Equity Valuation and the Labor Market

In this section we consider a partial-equilibrium model of stock market valuation, using the frame-
work discussed in Section 3.1 but with minimal additional assumptions. We show that a link
   6
       The assumption of Vt > 0 implies that the maximum drop in employment level is s.



                                                         7
between the stock market and the labor market prevails under these very general conditions.
   Let Mt+1 denote the representative household’s stochastic discount factor. Consider a repre-
sentative firm which produces output given by

                                                Yt = Zt Nt ,                                        (5)

where Zt is the non-negative level of aggregate labor productivity. Assume that labor productivity
follows the process
                                    log Zt+1 = log Zt + µ + xt+1 ,                                  (6)

where, for now, we leave xt+1 unspecified; it can be any stationary process. Let Wt = W (Zt , Nt , Vt )
denote the aggregate wage rate. The firm pays out dividends Dt , which is what remains from
output after paying wages and investing in hiring:

                                     Dt = Zt Nt − Wt Nt − κt Vt .                                   (7)

The firm then maximizes the present value of current and future dividends
                                                               ∞
                                                               X
                                         max              Et          Mt+τ Dt+τ                     (8)
                                   {Vt+τ ,Nt+τ +1 }∞
                                                   τ =0        τ =0


subject to
                                     Nt+1 = (1 − s)Nt + q(θt )Vt ,                                  (9)

where q(θt ) is given by (4). The firm takes θt and Wt as given in solving (8). The economy is
therefore subject to a congestion externality. By posting more vacancies, firms raise the aggregate
Vt , therefore increasing θt and lowering the probability that any one firm will be able to hire.
   The following result establishes a general relation between the stock market and the labor
market.

Theorem 1. Assume the production function (5) and that the firm solves (8). Then the ex-
dividend value of the firm is given by

                                                      κt
                                             Pt =           Nt+1 ,                                (10)
                                                     q(θt )


                                                          8
and the equity return equals
                                                    κt+1
                                           (1 − s) q(θ t+1 )
                                                             + Zt+1 − Wt+1
                                  Rt+1 =                   κt                .                    (11)
                                                          q(θt )

Furthermore, if κt = κZt for fixed κ, then

                                             Pt     κ
                                                =        Nt+1 .                                   (12)
                                             Zt   q(θt )

Proof. See Appendix A.

   Some notation is helpful in understanding this theorem. Let lt denote the Lagrange multiplier
on the firm’s hiring constraint (9). We can think of lt as the value of a worker inside the firm
at time t + 1. In deciding how many vacancies to post at time t, the firm equates the marginal
benefit of an additional worker with marginal cost. Because the probability of filling a vacancy
with a worker is q(θt ) (see Section 3.1), the marginal benefit is lt q(θt ) while the marginal cost is
simply the cost of opening a vacancy, κt . Thus a condition for optimality is:

                                                κt = lt q(θt ).                                   (13)

It follows that lt = κt /q(θt ), and furthermore, that the value of the firm equals the number of
workers employed multiplied by the value of each worker. This is what is shown in (10).
   Equation 11 has a related interpretation. The t + 1 return on the investment of hiring a worker
is the value of the worker employed in the firm at time t + 2 (multiplied by the probability that
the worker remains with the firm), plus productivity minus the wage, all divided by the value of
the worker at time t + 1. Note that the previous discussion implies that the value of the worker
                        κt
employed at t + 1 is   q(θt )
                              .
   Equation 12 follows directly from (10) and from the assumption that the cost of posting a
vacancy is proportional to productivity (given our assumption of a nonstationary component to
productivity, this implies a balanced growth path). We can evaluate (12) empirically. We take
the historical time series of the price-productivity ratio and of Nt+1 (equal to one minus the
unemployment rate). Given standard parameters for the matching function (discussed further


                                                      9
below), this implies, by way of (12), a time series for the vacancy-unemployment ratio θt . Figure 5
shows that the resulting ratio of vacancies to unemployment lines up closely with its counterpart
in the data.


3.3      General equilibrium

In this section, we extend our previous results to general equilibrium. Theorem 1 still holds, but
the general equilibrium model allows us to model the underlying source of employment and stock
price fluctuations.


3.3.1     The Representative Household

Following Merz (1995) and Gertler and Trigari (2009), we assume that the representative household
is a continuum of members who provide one another with perfect consumption insurance. We
normalize the size of the labor force to one.7 The household maximizes utility over consumption,
characterized by the recursive utility function introduced by Kreps and Porteus (1978) and Epstein
and Zin (1989):
                                                                                         1
                                                                              1   
                                            1                       i 1− ψ            1− 1

                                Jt = Ct        + β Et Jt+1                                   ,       (14)

where β is the time discount factor, γ is relative risk aversion and ψ is the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution (EIS). In case of γ = 1/ψ, recursive preferences collapse to power utility.
      The recursive utility function implies that, assuming optimal consumption, the stochastic dis-
count factor takes the following form:
                                                                                       1 −γ

                                                                           i
                                                                               1−γ
                                                                                       

    This assumption implies that our model focuses on the transition between employment and unemployment
rather than between in and out of labor force.

3.3.2      Wages

The canonical DMP model assumes that wages are determined by Nash bargaining between the
employer and the jobseeker. Both parties observe the surplus of job creation; the fraction received
by the jobseeker is determined by his bargaining power. Pissarides (2000) shows that the Nash-
bargained wage, WtN , is given by

                                     WtN = (1 − B)bt + B(Zt + κt θt ),                                       (16)

where 0 ≤ B ≤ 1 represents the worker’s bargaining power and bt is the flow value of unemploy-
ment.8 The Nash-bargained wage is a weighted average of two components: the opportunity cost
of employment and the contribution of the worker to the firm’s profits. If the bargaining power
of the worker is high, the firm has to pay a higher fraction of the output the worker produces as
wage, as well as the foregone costs from not having to hire.
       The Nash-bargained wage is a useful benchmark. However, it implies wages that are unreal-
istically responsive to changes in labor market conditions (see Section 2). This is a well-known
problem in the literature on labor market search. Hall (2005) proposes a rule that partially
insulates wages from tightness in the labor market. Let

                                          Wt = νWtN + (1 − ν)WtI ,                                           (17)

where
                                      WtI = (1 − B)bt + B(Zt + κt θ̄).                                       (18)

The parameter ν controls the degree of tightness insulation.9 With ν = 1, we are back in the Nash
bargaining case. With ν = 0, wages do not respond to labor market tightness. The resulting wage
remains sensitive to productivity but loses some of its sensitivity to tightness. Furthermore, this
formulation allows a direct comparison between versions of the model with and without tightness
   8
     The canonical Nash-bargained wage equation holds in our model. See Petrosky-Nadeau, Zhang, and Kuehn
(2013) for the proof in a similar setting.
   9
     Hall (2005) specifies WtI as constant and productivity as stationary. In our setting with non-stationary pro-
ductivity, WtI must be proportional to Zt to allow for balanced growth. In Section 2, we show that, in the data,
wages are responsive to Zt but not to θt .



                                                       11
insulated wages. Hall and Milgrom (2008) provides a microfoundation for (17).
       To have a balanced-growth path, we will assume bt = bZt (recall that κt = κZt , see Section 3.2).
Besides being necessary from a modeling perspective, it is also realistic to link unemployment
benefits (broadly defined) with productivity: as Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis (2015) show
using micro data, the time benefits of unemployment are an empirically large fraction of total
unemployment benefits. The importance of these time benefits imply that, in the data, total
benefits to unemployment are procyclical.


3.3.3       Technology and the Representative Firm

The representative firm produces output Yt with technology Zt Nt given in (5). In normal times,
log Zt follows a random walk with drift. In every period, there is a small and time-varying proba-
bility of a disaster.10 Thus,

                                      log Zt+1 = log Zt + µ + t+1 + dt+1 ζt+1 ,                    (19)

and where ζt < 0 gives the decline in log productivity, should a disaster occur.11 We assume
the log of the disaster probability λt follows an autoregressive process which (for convenience) is
independent of the shocks to productivity. That is,

                                    log λt = ρλ log λt−1 + (1 − ρλ ) log λ̄ + λt ,                 (20)

                                                                               iid
where λ̄ is the mean log probability, ρλ is the persistence, and λt ∼ N (0, σλ2 ). In solving the model,
we approximate this process using a finite-state Markov chain with all nodes smaller than one (see
Table 3).
       Following the literature on disasters and asset pricing (e.g. Barro (2006), Gourio (2012)) we

       The distribution of ζt is time-invariant and therefore independent of all other shocks.

interpret a disaster broadly as any event that results in a large drop in GDP and consumption.
Major wars, for example, lead to a large destruction in the capital stock, rendering existing workers
less productive. A disruption in the financial system, or a major change in economic institutions
could also lead to sharply lower output per worker.


3.3.4      Equilibrium

In equilibrium, the representative household holds all equity shares of the representative firm. The
representative household consumes the output Zt Nt net of investment in hiring κt Vt , and the value
of non-market activity bt (1 − Nt ) achieved by the unemployed members:

                                      Ct = Zt Nt + bt (1 − Nt ) − κt Vt .                                   (21)

Note that consumption includes firm wages and dividends; the definition of dividends in (7) shows
that the sum of wages and dividends amounts to Zt Nt − κt Vt . The household also consumes the
flow value of unemployment. This implies that we are treating this flow value primarily as home
production as opposed to unemployment benefits (which would be a transfer that would net to
zero).12 To summarize, households maximize (14), subject to the budget constraint (21) and the
law of motion for Nt (9), where θ is taken as given. The fact that the household owns all equity
shares implies that the optimal investment in hiring is also that which solves the firm’s problem.
       The proportionality assumptions on vacancy costs κt and the flow value of unemployment bt
in productivity Zt imply that we can write:

                                    Ct = Zt Nt + bZt (1 − Nt ) − κZt Vt .                                   (22)

Therefore, we can define consumption normalized by productivity, ct = Ct /Zt , as

                                         ct = Nt + b(1 − Nt ) − κVt .                                       (23)
  12
    This is consistent with the results of Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis (2015) as discussed in Section 3.3.2.
Changing to the alternative assumption that these benefits net to zero, however, does not impact our results. To
ensure that our model-data comparison is valid, when quantitatively assessing the model we report the model-
implied dynamics of consumption from dividends and wages, namely, Zt Nt − κt Vt , as this is what is measured in
consumption data.



                                                       13
In equilibrium, the value function Jt is determined by productivity, the disaster probability and
the employment level. That is, Jt = J(Zt , λt , Nt ). Given our assumptions on productivity and the
homogeneity of utility, the value function takes the form

                                           J(Zt , λt , Nt ) = Zt j(λt , Nt ),                                           (24)

where we refer to j(λt , Nt ) as the normalized value function. The normalized value function solves
                                                                                                              1

subject to (23) and (9). This normalization implies that we can solve for all quantities of interest
as functions of two stationary state variables, λt and Nt .


3.4    Comparative Statics in a Model with Labor Search and Constant

       Disaster Probability

Before exploring the quantitative implications of our full model in Section 4, we consider the
simpler case of constant disaster probability. We show that the economy is isomorphic to one
without disasters but with a different time discount factor. When the EIS is greater than one,
the effect of disasters is to make the agent less patient and lead him to invest less in hiring. An
analogous isomorphism is present in the models of Gabaix (2011) and Gourio (2012). Furthermore,
stock prices are decreasing, and unemployment increasing as a function of the disaster probability,
provided that the EIS is greater than one. The closed-form solutions allow us to give intuition for
these results, which will carry over to the dynamic results in Section 4.
   To derive closed-form solutions, we replace the random variable dt+1 ζt+1 with a compound
Poisson process with intensity λ̃. At our parameter values, the difference between the probability
of a disaster λ and the intensity λ̃ is negligible, and we continue to refer to λ̃ as the disaster
probability. Unless otherwise stated, proofs are contained in Appendix B.

Theorem 2. Assume that disaster risk is constant. The value function in a model with labor
search and disasters is the same as the value function in a model without disasters but with a

                                                                     1

                                                            1−γ

Moreover, β̂(λ̃) is decreasing in λ̃ if and only if ψ > 1.

   Note that (26) recursively defines the normalized value function in an economy without disaster
risk. Theorem 2 shows that an economy with disasters is equivalent to one without, but with a
less patient agent when the EIS ψ > 1 and a more patient agent when ψ < 1. As this statement
suggests, the change to the time-discount factor due to disasters reflects a trade-off between an
income and a substitution effect. On the one hand, the presence of disasters lead the agent to want
to save (the income effect). But the mechanism that the agent has to shift consumption, namely,
investing in hiring, becomes less attractive because there is a greater chance that the workers will
not be productive (the substitution effect). When ψ > 1, the substitution effect dominates, and
the agent, in effect, becomes less patient.
   We can also see the effect of the probability of disaster on the riskfree rate and on the equity
premium. In the case with constant λt , these equations turn out to be the same as in an endowment
economy model (Tsai and Wachter (2015)).

market is at its steady state. The log risk-free rate is given by

The riskfree rate is decreasing in λ̃.

   The risk of a rare disaster increases agents’ desire to save, which drives down the riskfree rate.
In contrast to Theorem 2, this result holds regardless of the value of ψ.

Lemma 2. Assume in a model with labor search that disaster risk is constant and the labor market
is at its steady state. The equity premium is given by

                                Rf

The equity premium is increasing in λ̃.

   The first term in the equity premium represents the normal-times risk in production. Given the
low volatility in productivity and consumption, this first term will be very small in our calibrated
model. The second term represents the effect of rare disasters. A rare disaster causes an increase
in marginal utility, represented by the term e−γζ − 1, at the same time as it causes a decrease
in the value of the representative firm, as represented by eζ − 1. Because the representative firm
declines in value at exactly the wrong time, its equity carries a risk premium. This also implies
that the equity premium is unambiguously increasing in the probability of a disaster.
   How are the risk premium and the riskfree rate connected to the effective time-discount factor
and to firm valuations? We now answer this question. Consider a transformation of the price-
dividend ratio:
                                                        Dt
                                                                
                                      h(λ̃) = − log 1 +    .                                    (30)
                                                        Pt
Then h(0) is the price-dividend ratio when there is no disaster risk:
                                                       !
                                              1                 1
                                                                             
                           h(0) = log β + 1 −                µ + (1 − γ)σ2 .                   (31)
                                              ψ                 2

Note that in this iid economy where quantities are at their steady-state values, Pt /Dt is a constant
that depends on λ̃. There is a tight connection between the price-dividend ratio and the effective
time-discount factor.

Theorem 3. Assume in a model with labor search that disaster risk is constant and the labor
market is at its steady state. Define β̂(λ̃) as in Theorem 2. Define h(λ̃) as in (30). Then

                                  h(λ̃) − h(0) = log β̂(λ̃) − log β.                            (32)

Thus the price-dividend ratio is decreasing in λ̃ if and only if ψ > 1.

                                                     16
   Applying (28) and (29), we see that the effect of disaster risk on h(λ̃) can be decomposed into
a discount rate effect (which in turn can be decomposed into a risk premium and riskfree rate
effect) and an expected growth effect, as in Campbell and Shiller (1988):
                                                                           

                                                   +E        e−γζ − 1      eζ − 1        λ̃ +         E eζ − 1 λ̃           . (33)
                                                    |                 {z                 }        |        {z         }
                                                              risk premium effect               expected cash-flow effect


The decomposition (33) provides additional intuition for the effect of changes in the disaster
probability on the economy. On the one hand, an increase in the risk of a disaster drives down the
riskfree rate. This will raise valuations, all else equal. However, it also increases the risk premium
and lowers expected cash flows. When ψ > 1, the risk premium and cash flow effects dominate
the riskfree rate effect and an increase in the disaster probability lowers valuations.
   We now explicitly connect these results to the labor market. First, as suggested by the result
in Section 3.2, the greater are valuations, the greater is labor market tightness (see Appendix A
for a rigorous proof). Because an increase in the probability lowers valuations, it lowers labor
market tightness, provided that the EIS is greater than 1.

Corollary 1. Assume in a model with labor search that disaster risk is constant and the labor
market is at its steady state.

  1. The price-dividend ratio is increasing as a function of labor market tightness.

  2. Labor market tightness is decreasing in the probability of a disaster if and only if ψ > 1.

   When firms are faced with a higher risk of an economy-wide disaster, they have an incentive
to reduce hiring. This decreases equilibrium tightness θ to the point where firms are indifferent
between hiring and not. Thus higher disaster risk results in higher unemployment, lower vacancies,
and lower firm valuations.
   The previous discussion separates the effects of the risk premium and the riskfree rate on the
price-dividend ratio and hence on firm incentives. What about the discount rate overall? Hall

                                                        17
(2015) conjectures that a model that produces higher discount rates in recessions can drive co-
movement of unemployment and the stock market. The analysis in this section shows that it is not
discount rates per se that matter, but the combination of discount rates and growth expectations
(it is also not necessary for these to be related to recessions driven by lower current productivity).
For higher discount rates to be associated with lower unemployment, EIS greater than 1 is a
necessary but not sufficient condition:

Corollary 2. Assume in a model with labor search that disaster risk is constant and the labor
market is at its steady state. The expected return is increasing in λ̃ if and only if

    The analysis in this section sheds light on the tight link between the valuation mechanism and
the labor market. As we will show in the next section, this mechanism is helpful in quantitatively
explaining historical fluctuations in the labor market.



4     Quantitative Results

Below, we compare statistics in our model to those in the data. Section 4.1 describes the calibration
of parameters for preferences, labor market variables, and productivity in normal times. Section 4.2
describes assumptions on the disaster distribution. Given these assumptions, Section 4.3 shows
what happens to labor market, business cycle, and financial moments when a disaster occurs or
when the disaster probability increases. We then simulate repeated samples of length 60 years from
our model. Section 4.4 describes statistics of labor market moments in simulated data. Section 4.5
describes statistics for business cycle and financial moments. Section 4.6 makes use of alternative
calibrations to highlight the main mechanisms behind our results.

4.1       Model Parameters

Table 1 describes model parameters for our benchmark calibration. Unless otherwise stated,
parameters are given in monthly terms. Labor productivity in normal times is calibrated to the
labor productivity process from the postwar data (see Appendix D for data description). This
implies a monthly growth rate µ of 0.18% and standard deviation σ of 0.47%. We calibrate the
separation rate to 3.5% as estimated by Shimer (2005). We calibrate the Cobb-Douglas elasticity
η to 0.35, consistent with empirical estimates in Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001) and Yashiv
(2000). The parameter κ, corresponding to unit costs of vacancy openings normalized by labor
productivity, is set to 0.5, the average of estimates from Hall and Milgrom (2008) and Hagedorn and
Manovskii (2008).13 For the bargaining power of workers (B) and the flow value of unemployment
(b), we use values from Hall and Milgrom (2008); these are 0.5 and 0.76 respectively. We set the
matching efficiency ξ to 0.365, targeting a model population value for unemployment equal to
10%.
       We calibrate the tightness-insulation parameter ν to match wage dynamics in the data.14 Ta-
ble 2 shows the standard deviation and autocorrelation of wages in the data, as well as the elasticity
of wages with respect to labor market tightness and productivity. Also shown is the elasticity of
labor market tightness to productivity. The elasticity of wages to labor market tightness is low
throughout the sample, while the elasticity of wages to labor productivity ranges from 0.67 in the
full sample, to close to unity in the sample after 1985. We consider two versions of the model,
one that insulates wages from labor market tightness (our benchmark specification), and one with
no tightness insulation (the Nash bargaining solution). For each case, we simulate 10,000 sample
paths of 60 years of data and report the median, and the 5th and 95th percentile of each statistic.
Tightness insulation allows the model to match the standard deviation of wages to that of the data;
without tightness insulation, wages are too volatile. Tightness insulation is also consistent with
other aspects of the data: it implies wages with unit elasticity with respect to productivity, but
  13
     Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008) find a constant and a pro-cyclical component in vacancy costs. We specify
vacancy costs proportional to productivity for simplicity.
  14
     Following Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008), we calculate wages by multiplying the labor share by productivity.




                                                      19
near zero elasticity with respect to labor market tightness. Under the Nash-bargaining solution,
however, wages are unrealistically elastic with respect to labor market tightness.
       We assume the EIS ψ is equal to 2 and risk aversion γ is equal to 5.7. As is standard in
production-based models with recursive utility, an EIS greater than one is necessary for the model
to deliver qualitatively realistic predictions for stock prices (see Section 3.4). An important ques-
tion is whether this level of the EIS is consistent with other aspects of the data. Using instrumental
variable estimation of consumption growth on interest rates, Hall (1988) and Campbell (2003) es-
timate this parameter to be close to zero. However, as noted by Bansal and Yaron (2004), this
parameter estimate may be biased in models with time-varying second (or higher-order) moments.
To gauge the impact of the mis-specification, we repeat the instrumental-variable regressions of
consumption growth on government bill rates in data simulated from our model.15 We find a
mean estimate of 0.15, consistent with the data. Thus, despite the assumption of an EIS greater
than 1, our model replicates the weak relation between contemporaneous consumption growth and
interest rates.


4.2       Size Distribution and Probability of Disasters

The distribution for the disaster impact ζt is taken from historical data on GDP declines in
36 countries over the last century (Barro and Ursua (2008)). Following Barro and Ursua, we
characterize a disaster by a 10% or higher cumulative decline in GDP. The resulting distribution
for 1 − eζ is shown in Figure 6. We assume that, if a disaster occurs, there is a 40% probability
of default on government debt (Barro (2006)).
       We approximate the dynamics of the disaster probability λt in (20) using a 12-state Markov
chain. The nodes and corresponding stationary probabilities are given in Table 3. The station-
ary distribution of monthly probabilities is approximately lognormal with a mean of 0.20% and
standard deviation 1.97%. In comparison, the 10% criterion for a disaster implies that the annual
frequency of disasters in the data is 3.7%, indicating that our assumption on the disaster frequency
  15
    The instruments are twice-lagged consumption growth, the government bill rate, and the log price-productivity
ratio.


                                                       20
is conservative. We choose the persistence and the volatility of the disaster probability process to
match the autocorrelation and volatility of unemployment in U.S. data.
   Table 4 describes properties of the disaster probability distribution. Because this distribution is
not available in closed form, we simulate 10,000 sample paths of length 60 years. We find that 53%
of these sample paths do not have a disaster; thus the post-war period was not unusual from the
point of view of our model. Because the distribution for the disaster probability is highly skewed,
the average λt is much lower in samples that, ex post, have no disasters than it is in population.
Below, we report statistics from these simulated data for unemployment, vacancies, and business
cycle and financial moments. Unless otherwise stated, the model statistics are computed from the
no-disaster paths.


4.3    The effect of disasters and disaster probabilities

To highlight the implications of time-varying disaster probability, our model assumes a simplified
view of the disaster itself. As described in Section 3.3, a disaster is a one-time, permanent drop
in labor productivity. Because consumption, dividends and wages scale with productivity, these
variables all fall by equal percentages in a disaster; if for example productivity drops by 15% in a
disaster, they also drop by 15%. While this view of a disaster is stylized, results in the literature
(e.g. Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursua (2013) and Tsai and Wachter (2015)) suggest that
introducing more complicated dynamics are unlikely to alter the implications for non-disaster
states, which are the main focus of our analysis.
   Figure 7 shows what happens to the labor market and to the business cycle in the months
following an increase in the disaster probability. We assume an increase in the (monthly) proba-
bility from 0.05% to 0.32%, representing an approximately two-standard deviation increase along a
typical no-disaster path. This increased probability of a disaster reduces the optimal employment
level because, even though current productivity is unchanged, future productivity is more risky.
Firms substantially reduce vacancies when the shock hits; vacancies then slowly rise to a new
steady state which is lower than before. During this time, unemployment steadily rises as well.



                                                 21
Vacancies and unemployment take about two years to converge to their new steady states. This
two-standard deviation increase in the disaster probability leads to an approximately 6% decrease
in employment and a 25% decrease in vacancies at the end of the two-year period. As Figure 7
shows, the increase in unemployment coincides with a decline in stock valuations.
       While vacancies and unemployment respond substantially to an increase in disaster probability,
consumption does not. In the very short term, an increase in the disaster probability slightly
increases consumption because investment in hiring falls. In the longer term, consumption falls
because the lower level of employment implies lower output.16
       Figure 8 shows what happens to financial markets following a two-standard deviation increase
in the disaster probability. Equity returns fall dramatically because of the sharp decline in stock
prices described above. However, in the months following the increase, equity returns are slightly
higher because of the greater risk premium needed to compensate investors for bearing the risk of
a disaster. At the same time, the government bill rate falls because the greater degree of risk in
the economy leads investors to want to save.


4.4       Labor Market Moments

Table 5 describes labor market moments in the model and in the U.S. data from 1951 to 2013. Panel
A reports U.S. data on unemployment U , vacancies V , the vacancy-unemployment ratio V /U ,
labor productivity Z, and the price-productivity ratio P/Z. The labor market results replicate
those reported by Shimer (2005) using more recent data. The vacancy-unemployment ratio has
a quarterly volatility of 39%, twenty times higher than the volatility of labor productivity of 2%.
The correlation between Z and V /U is 10%, whereas the correlation between P/Z and V /U is
47%, consistent with the findings in Section 2.17 The correlation is lower in the pre-1985 sample,
and higher in the post-1985 sample. These findings, together with the more detailed analysis in
Section 2, motivate the mechanism in this paper.
  16
     Bloom (2009) solves a model in which time-varying uncertainty leads to lower consumption and output; our
model is consistent with the data he reports.
  17
     As noted in Section 2, we follow Shimer (2005) in using a low-frequency HP filter with smoothing parameter
105 . We report volatilities of log deviations from trend.


                                                      22
    Panel B of Table 5 reports the statistics calculated from sample paths simulated from the
model. We simulate 10,000 sample paths of length 60 years. We report means from the 53% of
simulations that contain no disaster. Our model is calibrated to match the volatility of unemploy-
ment. However, the model can also explain the volatility of vacancies, and the high volatility of
the vacancy-unemployment ratio. The model also correctly generates a large negative correlation
between vacancies and unemployment. Other possible mechanisms, such as shocks to the sepa-
ration rate, generate a counterfactual positive correlation between V and U (Shimer (2005)). In
addition, our model captures the low correlation between the labor market and productivity and
the relatively high correlation between the labor market and stock prices; it overstates the latter
correlation because a single state variable drive both. However, a united mechanism for both stock
market and labor market volatility is a better description of the data compared to models based
on realized productivity, especially for the U.S. data from mid-1980s to the present.
    Figure 9 shows the Beveridge curve (namely, the locus of vacancies and unemployment) in
the data and in the model. The position of the economy along the historically downward sloping
Beveridge curve is an important business cycle indicator (Blanchard, Diamond, Hall, and Yellen
(1989)). The time-varying risk mechanism in our model is able to generate such negative cor-
relation, and as a result, the model values are concentrated along a downward sloping line. In
our model, an increase in risk and a decrease in expected growth leads to downward movement
along the Beveridge curve. Following an increase in disaster probability, the economy converges
to the new optimal level of employment which is lower than before. Because the matching func-
tion is increasing in both vacancies and unemployment, a lower level for vacancies is needed to
maintain the employment level. The model is able to generate a wide range of values on the
vacancy-unemployment locus, including data values at the lower right corner of the Beveridge
curve observed during the Great Recession which correspond to high values for the disaster prob-
ability.




                                                23
4.5       Business Cycle and Financial Moments

We now turn to the model’s implications for consumption, output, and for financial market vari-
ables. Table 6 shows that the model produces a low volatility of consumption and output, just
as in the data. The volatility for consumption (2.3%) is slightly lower than for output (2.5%),
reflecting the consumption-smoothing motives of the agent.
       There are two independent dimensions to cyclicality in the model, namely, comovement with
labor productivity and with disaster risk. In the model, the effect of productivity shocks on
consumption and output growth is identical. This is not the case for disaster risk, however. Con-
sumption equals output by the firm, plus home production, minus investment in hiring. Because
both output and investment are pro-cyclical with respect to disaster probability, the consumption
response to disaster probability shocks is weaker than the output response, as shown in Figure 7.
This creates a higher volatility in output growth compared to consumption growth, in line with
the data.18 The volatility of consumption and output is substantially higher in population than
in samples without rare disasters, which are comparable to the post-war period.
       Table 6 also shows that the model produces a realistically low average return and volatility for
government bills; these are 3.6% and 3.8%. respectively. While somewhat higher than in the data
postwar, these are very low compared with the values for equity returns (see below), and lower
than in many models of production. The data fall well within the confidence bands implied by
the model. Average returns on government bills are low in the model because of the precautionary
savings motives arising from the risk of a disaster (Section 3.4).
       Even though output can have long periods with small shocks, there remains the possibility of
a large disaster. Because firms’ cash flows are exposed to this disaster, in equilibrium, investors
require a high premium to hold equity. Indeed, in samples without disasters generated from the
model, the median equity premium is 6.7%. Because our model does not include financial leverage,
we follow common practice (see, e.g. Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursua (2013)) and report
  18
    Note that our definition of measured consumption does not include the flow value of unemployment as described
in Section 3.3.4, and is therefore directly comparable to consumption expenditures in the data. Model-implied
consumption volatility including the flow value of unemployment, bt (1 − Nt ), is 1.4%.



                                                       24
data values that are adjusted for leverage in the table.19 The equity premium generated by our
model is in fact higher than the adjusted value in the data, 5.3%, and is not far from the unadjusted
value of 7.9%.20
       Besides matching the equity premium, our model can also generate high levels of return volatil-
ity. We can see this already in Figure 8 from the large return response in the event of an increase
in the disaster probability. Table 6 shows, indeed, that return volatility implied by the model
is 19.8% per annum, above the unlevered value in the data and close to the unadjusted value of
17.6%. While iid models such as Barro (2009) and Gabaix (2011) can explain why there is an
equity premium in the context of production, it is harder to explain why returns are volatile even
in periods when no disasters take place.21 In our model, return volatility comes about through
time variation in the probability of the disaster. When this probability rises, future prospects for
growth dim, and more importantly, the discount rate for this future growth increases. Embedded
in the value of a firm is the value of a worker who is in place. When firm values fall, so too do
the incentives for hiring. Thus our model produces high equity volatility, even though volatility
of output is low.
       A problem often faced by dynamic models with production is low riskiness of firm cash flows.
Firms respond to bad news about future productivity (concerning its mean, its riskiness, or both)
by cutting investment, and increasing dividends. This makes firm equity a hedge and decreases
both the equity premium and return volatility. To produce reasonable values, models that focus
on investment assume counterfactually high leverage (Gourio (2012)), or assume that stocks are
something other than the dividend claim (Croce (2014)). Our model is also one of investment;
posting a vacancy implies an investment in hiring. However, we are able to match the equity
premium and return volatility without the use of leverage. One reason for this is the relative
insensitivity of wages to labor market conditions. Another reason is that our model is one where
  19
     Lemmon, Roberts, and Zender (2008) report an average market leverage ratio of 28% among U.S. firms from
1965 to 2003. Accordingly, the unlevered equity premium is calculated multiplying stock returns by 0.72.
  20
     The population equity premium generated by the model is even higher: 13.3%. This higher value reflects the
fact that samples that contain disasters have higher disaster probabilities, and hence higher risk premia. Because
of the noise induced by disasters, this value is difficult to compare to any one historical sample.
  21
     In periods with disasters, returns will be volatile because cash flows are volatile. In our model, the population
value for return volatility is 40% per annum.


                                                         25
unemployment and stock returns share an underlying process, and unemployment is highly volatile.
We discuss these mechanisms further in the next section.


4.6       Sources of Volatility and Risk Premia

We compare three alternative specifications to our benchmark model to highlight the sources of
volatility and risk premia: a model with constant disaster probability, where disaster probability
is set to 0.20%, the stationary mean in the benchmark model; a model with no disaster risk; and
a model with Nash-bargained wages, namely, ν = 1. In all cases, we follow the same simulation
strategy as before, namely simulating 10,000 samples with length 60 years. We report results from
samples without disasters, which is 53% of samples in the time-varying model and 24% in the
constant disaster risk model.22 When relevant, we also report population values.
       Table 7 reports labor market volatility in the alternative specifications. If risk is not time-
varying, labor market variables and P/Z are constant. This confirms that the only source of
fluctuation in the labor market is disaster probability. The case without any disasters yields
the same volatility as the case with constant disasters (recall that we are reporting results from
no-disaster samples). The case without tightness insulation (but with time-varying risk) does
produce some volatility in unemployment, vacancies, and in the vacancy-unemployment ratio, but
much less than in our benchmark case. In this case, the risk of future productivity declines (as
represented by low tightness) is passed on to workers in the form of lower wages. Thus firms
maintain hiring when risk goes up, and unemployment as well as prices fluctuate much less than
in the data. The resulting wage process also differs sharply from its empirical counterpart, as
shown in Table 2.
       Table 8 reports business cycle and financial moments. We first describe the volatility of con-
sumption and output. In the absence of time-varying risk, consumption growth and output growth
have the same volatility. Moreover, this volatility is lower as compared to our benchmark case
with time-varying risk. Thus time-varying disaster risk causes some fluctuations in consumption
  22
    There are fewer disasters in the model with time-varying λ as opposed to constant λ because the process is
highly skewed; most of the time λ takes on values consistent with few disasters.


                                                     26
and output due to firm’s optimal investment decisions. Constant λ and zero λ (no disaster risk)
have the same implications for consumption and output in samples without disasters. Allowing for
time-varying λ, but eliminating the tightness insulation from wages, has similar macroeconomic
implications as setting λ to be a constant. Without tightness insulation, time-varying risk has
only a small impact on firms’ investment in hiring for the reasons described above: firms can pass
greater risk of a disaster on to their employees in the form of lower wages. However, we do not
see this in the data.
       We now turn to the financial moments. The model without disaster risk delivers a negligible
equity premium and equity volatility, as well as an unrealistically high riskfree rate. This is in
spite of the fact that the model is not the benchmark real-business-cycle model; rather it still is a
DMP model with tightness-insulation. The reason is that output and thus firm cash flows remain
smooth in this model. The model with constant disaster risk has a high equity premium, however
equity volatility is still negligible in periods without disasters.23
       Interestingly, the case with time-varying λ and no tightness insulation has implications for
equity returns that are dramatically different than the case with tightness insulation. In this case,
investment in the firm becomes very safe because the firm has a cost structure that is highly
sensitive to cyclical conditions in the economy. In times of low disaster probability, employment
increases and wages increase substantially due to the high sensitivity of wages to labor market
tightness. In contrast, when employment falls, wages adjust rapidly downward. Thus investment
in the firm forms a hedge against the main risks in the economy, and, in equilibrium, risk premia
are negative.
       While these results point to the importance of tightness-insulation for wages, it is also the case
that tightness-insulation alone does not lead to an equity premium, high stock return volatility,
or for that matter, volatile unemployment, as illustrated by our case with constant disaster risk,
  23
     In the model with constant λ, samples without disasters have higher average excess returns than in population;
this is the effect of the Peso problem described in Jorion and Goetzmann (1999). In the model with time-varying
λ, somewhat surprisingly, the opposite effect holds and the samples without disasters have lower average excess
returns. The reason is that samples that, ex post, have no disasters are also those that, ex post, have lower disaster
probabilities, and hence lower equity premia. The time-varying λ case has higher population risk premia for the
reasons given in Wachter (2013).



                                                         27
or no disaster risk. In these cases, equity volatility is indeed higher than consumption and output
volatility, but the difference is slight: 1.7% versus 1.3% per year. Unlike in models with wage
rigidities (Uhlig (2007), Favilukis and Lin (2014)), or high operating leverage induced by high
and stable wages (Petrosky-Nadeau, Zhang, and Kuehn (2013)), wages fluctuate fully in response
to changes in productivity in our model; it is their response to labor market conditions that is
dampened (see Table 2). It is time-varying risk premia arising from the risk of a disaster that
generates equity volatility.



5     Conclusion

This paper shows that a business cycle model with search and matching frictions in the labor
market and a small and time-varying risk of an economic disaster can simultaneously explain labor
market volatility, stock market volatility and the relation between unemployment and stock market
valuations. While tractable, the model can generate high volatility in labor market tightness along
with realistic aggregate wage dynamics. The findings suggest that time variation in aggregate
uncertainty offers an important channel, through which the DMP model of labor market search and
matching can operate. The model provides a mechanism through which job creation incentives of
firms and stock market valuations are tightly linked, as the comovement of labor market tightness
and stock market valuations in the data suggest. While the presence of disaster risk and realistic
wage dynamics generate a high unlevered equity premium, the source of labor market volatility
and stock market volatility is time variation in risk. Finally, the model is consistent with basic
business cycle moments such as consumption growth and output growth.

A        Proofs of results for a general stochastic discount factor

The results in this section do not depend on our assumptions on Mt+1 or Zt+1 .

Proof of Theorem 1 The representative firm pays out as dividend what is left from output after
subtracting wage costs and investment in hiring:

                                                 Dt = Zt Nt − Wt Nt − κt Vt .                                        (A.1)

The firm takes wages Wt and labor market tightness θt as given and maximizes the cum-dividend

that (A.5) can be interpreted as an Euler equation with lt as the value of a worker inside the firm.

out with Et [Zt+1 Nt+1 − Wt+1 Nt+1 + lt+1 (1 − s)Nt+1 ] for all t as a result of (A.5). It follows that

Combining (A.8) with (A.4) results in (10).

   Using this result, we provide characterizations of returns and prices that will be useful in what
follows.

Lemma A.1. Under the assumptions κt = Zt κ and bt = Zt b, the equity return equals

                                         (1 − s) q(θκt+1 ) + 1 − w(θt+1 ) Zt+1

                                                      q(θt )
                                                                          Zt



                                                      30
where w(θt ) is the wage normalized by productivity:

                           w(θt ) = (1 − B)b + B(1 + κ(νθt + (1 − ν)θ̄)).                    (A.11)

The result follows directly from Theorem 1, Equation 11.
   Given lt as the value of a worker inside the firm, the Euler equation (A.5) suggests a notion of
a payout of a worker inside the firm:

                                         Dtl = Zt − Wt − slt .                               (A.12)

Lemma A.2. Under the assumptions κt = Zt κ and bt = Zt b, the payout ratio of a worker employed
in a firm is given by

                                     Dtl   Zt − Wt − slt
                                         =                                                   (A.13)

                                           1 − w(θt ) − s q(θκt )
                                         =         κ              .                          (A.14)
                                                       q(θt )


Proof Equation A.14 follows directly from (A.12) and the assumptions.


   How does this notion of payout ratio relate to the more traditional dividend-price ratio?

Lemma A.3. Consider the dividend-price ratio for the firm, Dt /Pt . Then,

                                                Dl
                                                                !
                                         Dt                          Nt
                                      1+    = 1+ t                                           (A.15)
                                         Pt      lt                 Nt+1

Thus, if the labor market is in a steady state (defined as Nt = Nt+1 ), Dt /Pt = Dtl /lt .


Proof It follows from (10), the definition of dividends (7), and the law of motion for Nt (9) that

                             Pt + Dt = lt Nt+1 + Zt Nt − Wt Nt − κt Vt

                                        = (Zt − Wt + lt (1 − s))Nt




                                                  31

                                        =
                                                    lt        Nt+1
                                                  l
                                                    !
                                                D      Nt
                                        = 1+ t
                                                lt Nt+1

where the last line follows from (A.13).


    The following lemma gives a comparative static result on the price-dividend ratio. It is strictly
applicable in the case of iid productivity growth (in our specification, constant disaster probability)
because it relies on constant labor market tightness θ. When λt is constant, the economy converges
deterministically to a steady state where θ is constant.

Lemma A.4. When the labor market is in a steady state (θt+1 = θt ), the price-dividend ratio is
increasing in θ.

Proof. It follows from (A.14) that

                                        Dtl   1 − w(θ)
                                            =     κ    −s
                                        lt       q(θ)




Because of (4), the first term is proportional to (1 − w(θ))θ−η . It follows from (A.11) that w(θ) is
increasing in θ (intuitively, wages are increasing in tightness). It is also necessary that 1 − w(θ)
is positive; otherwise, in this iid economy the firm would operate continually at a loss. Therefore
(1 − w(θ))θ−η is decreasing in θ, and, by the second statement in Lemma A.3, the price-dividend
ratio is increasing in θ.



B      Constant Disaster Risk Model

Appendix B.1 describes the compound Poisson process that is useful in the constant disaster risk
case. Appendix B.2 provides proofs for this case. When disaster risk is constant, labor market

                                                  32
variables Nt , Vt and θt are deterministic. We assume that the economy has run for long enough
that it has reached its steady state, with Nt = Nt+1 , and similarly for Vt and θt .


B.1     Compound Poisson Process

The algebraic rules for compound Poisson processes illustrated in this section are adapted from
Cont and Tankov (2004). Drechsler and Yaron (2011) model jumps in expected growth and
volatility using compound Poisson processes. Let Qt,t+1 be a compound Poisson process with
intensity λ̃. Specifically, λ̃ represents the expected number of jumps in the time period (t, t + 1].
Agents in the model view the jumps in (t, t + 1] as occurring at t + 1. Then, Qt,t+1 is given by
                                              
                                              PNt+1 −Nt ζ

                                              
                                                   i=1        i
                                 Qt,t+1 =
                                              
                                                                   if Nt+1 − Nt = 0,
                                              
                                              0
                                              


where Nt is a Poisson counting process and Nt+1 − Nt is the number of jumps in the time interval
(t, t + 1]. Jump size ζ is iid. We can take conditional expectations with Qt,t+1 using

                                            Et euQt+1 = eλ̃(E[e ]−1) ,
                                                               uζ
                                                h         i
                                                                                                                 (B.1)

where log of the right-hand side is the cumulant-generating function of Qt,t+1 . More precisely, the
                                                                                                             k
probability of observing k jumps over the course one period (t, t + 1] is equal to eλ̃ λ̃k! . We take the
t to be in units of months in our quantitative assessment of the model.


B.2     Proof for the constant disaster risk case

We first prove the equation and comparative statics for the effective time discount factor.

Proof of Theorem 2 Consider the normalized value function in (25) and replace the disaster
term with the compound Poisson process Qt,t+1 with constant intensity λ̃:
                                                                                                       1
                                                                                           1    
                                                                                       i 1− ψ       1− 1

              j(λ̃, Nt ) =   ct ψ    + β Et e(1−γ)(µ+t+1 +Qt,t+1 ) j(λ̃, Nt+1 )1−γ      1−γ
                                                                                                            .   (B.2)




                                                              33
Conditional on time-t information, the realizations of t+1 , Qt,t+1 and Nt+1 are independent. There-
fore, we can write (26) with
                                                                                 1
                                                      h                      i 1− ψ
                                                          (1−γ)Qt,t+1          1−γ
                                        β̂(λ̃) = βEt e                                .                          (B.3)

Taking the expectation using the algebra introduced in Appendix B.1, we compute the log of the
effective time discount factor:
                                                               1
                                                     1−        ψ
                                                                       h             i       
                             log β̂(λ̃) = log β +                      E e(1−γ)ζ − 1 λ̃.                         (B.4)
                                                      1−γ

Note that ζ takes only negative values. For γ > 1 and γ < 1 we have
                                              h           i
                                            E e(1−γ)ζ − 1
                                                                        < 0.                                     (B.5)
                                                   1−γ
                                                                         1
Therefore, log β̂(λ̃) is decreasing in λ̃ if and only if 1 −             ψ
                                                                             > 0 which is equivalent to ψ > 1.

   Next we derive the equation for the riskfree rate:


Proof of Lemma 1 Because λt is constant and the economy is at its steady state, the stochastic
discount factor (15) becomes:
                                                          µ
                                                   βe− ψ −γ(t+1 +Qt+1 )
                                    Mt+1 =                                       1 −γ     .                      (B.6)
                                                                                 ψ
                                              Et   [e(1−γ)(t+1 +Qt+1 ) ]        1−γ



Here we have used (24) to substitute in for the value function. Taking the expectation in the
denominator, the log stochastic discount factor becomes

                                             µ
                      log Mt+1 = log β −       − γ(t+1 + Qt+1 )
                                             ψ
                                                            1
                                                                                                                 (B.7)
                                                              − γ  h (1−γ)ζ i
                                               !
                                 1       1              2   ψ
                               −           − γ (1 − γ) σ −        E e          λ̃.
                                 2       ψ                  1−γ

It follows that the log risk-free rate log Rf = − log E[Mt+1 ] is given by:
                                                                                !

      The following Lemma recharacterizes the Euler equation in terms of model primitives:

where w(θ) is the wage normalized by productivity defined by (A.11) and β̂(λ̃) is defined as in
(B.3).


Proof We rewrite the Euler equation (A.5) in a more familiar form

                                                             Et [Mt+1 Rt+1 ] = 1                                                        (B.10)

where we have divided through by lt and used the characterization of returns in (11). The result
follows from substituting (A.10) and (B.6) into (B.10) and solving the expectation using the
definition of β̂(λ̃) in (B.3).

Equation (B.11) follows from taking the expectation of (B.13) using rules introduced in Section B.1.



Lemma 2 follows from (B.11) and the equation for the riskfree rate given in (B.8). Corollary 2
follows from inspection of the terms multiplying λ̃ in (B.11).

The second equality follows from Lemma A.3. The result then follows from adding 1 to (A.14)

C      Equilibrium Solution

Let x0 denote the value of the variable x in period t + 1 and x the value at t. We can rewrite the
normalized value function (25) as

                                                                     1

The value function and policy functions are functions of the exogenous state variable λ and the
endogenous state variable N . The dynamics of the stochastic discount factor and returns are driven
by four shocks: disaster probability λ0 , normal times productivity shock 0 , disaster indicator d0 and

disaster size ζ 0 . Let E be the expectation operator over four shocks. In our numerical procedure,
we solve for the consumption policy c(λ, N ) and the value function g(λ, N ). The market clearing
condition allows us to compute the vacancy rate given the consumption policy.
   It follows from (15) and (24) that the stochastic discount factor can be written as

We approximate the AR(1) process for log disaster probability by a 12-state Markov process
and use the corresponding probability transition matrix to calculate expectations over λ0 . The
expectations over ζ 0 and 0 can be taken directly since their distributions are iid.
   We approximate the policy function and the value function by a polynomial of employment
level N where the polynomial coefficients are estimated for each value of the disaster probability



                                                                           37
separately. We use n + 1 nodes for employment to conduct the approximation by an n’th order
polynomial. As a result we have 24(n + 1) unknowns and equations resulting from the equilibrium
conditions (C.6) and (C.7). We evaluate the equilibrium conditions at the nodes of the Chebyshev
polynomial of order n. Our quantitative results are not significantly different for polynomial
approximations of order 3 or higher.



D      Data Sources

We use data from 1951 to 2013 for all variables.

    • Z is the seasonally adjusted quarterly real average output per person in the nonfarm business
      sector, constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) from National Income and
      Product Accounts (NIPA) and the Current Employment Statistics (CES).

    • P is the real price of the S&P composite stock price index, downloaded from Robert Shiller’s
      website (www.econ.yale.edu/ shiller/data.htm).

    • P/E is the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio, downloaded from Robert Shiller’s website
      (www.econ.yale.edu/ shiller/data.htm).

    • P/Z is the price-productivity ratio scaled to have the same value as P/E in the first quarter
      of 1951.

    • U is the seasonally adjusted unemployment, constructed by the BLS from the Current Pop-
      ulation Survey (CPS). Quarterly values are calculated averaging monthly data.

    • V is the help-wanted advertising index constructed by the Conference Board until June 2006.
      We use data on vacancy openings from Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)
      from 2000 to 2013. We extrapolate the help-advertising index until 2013 and observe that
      our extrapolation has a correlation of 0.96 in the period from 2000 to 2006 where both data
      sources are available. For data plots, we remove a downward sloping time trend in log V /U .
      Quarterly values are calculated averaging monthly data.

                                                38
• W denotes wages measured as the product of labor productivity Z and labor share from the
  BLS.

• C is annual real personal consumption expenditures per capita from the BEA.

• Y is annual real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita from the BEA.

• R is the value weighted return market index return including distributions from CRSP. Real
  returns are calculated using inflation rate data from CRSP. Net returns are multiplied by
  0.68 to adjust for financial leverage.

• Rb is the 1-month Treasury bill rate from CRSP. Real rates are calculated using inflation
  rate data from CRSP.

• ∆c and ∆y denote log consumption and log output growth. Annual growth rates from
  monthly simulations that we compare to data values are calculated aggregating consumption
  and output levels over every year. Let Ct,h denote the consumption level in year t and month
  h. Annual log consumption growth in the model is calculated as
                                                 P12          !
                                                 i=1 Ct+1,i
                                   ∆ct+1 = log   P12              .                     (D.1)
                                                  i=1 Ct,i


  The same method is applied to output growth as well.

for leverage. Raw equity returns in the data have a premium of 7.90% and volatility of 17.55%
over this period.

Notes: Standard deviations (in log deviations from an HP trend) for unemployment (U ), vacancies
(V ), labor productivity (Z) and the price-productivity ratio (P/Z) in the data and in four versions
of the model. Data are from 1951 to 2013. All data and model moments are in quarterly terms.
Model values are calculated by simulating 10,000 samples with length 60 years at a monthly
frequency. We report means from simulations that include no disaster realizations. In the constant
disaster probability model, we set disaster probability to 0.20%, the stationary mean.

Notes: ∆c denotes log consumption growth, ∆y log output growth, R the unlevered equity return,
Rb the government bill rate. All data and model moments are in annual terms. We simulate
10,000 samples with length 60 years at monthly frequency and report the median from samples
that contain no disasters. In the constant disaster probability model, we set disaster probability
to 0.20%, the stationary mean of the disaster probability process used in the benchmark model.
Population values are from a path with length 100,000 years. Returns and growth rates are
aggregated to annual values.
