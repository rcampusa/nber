                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper, we analyze the determinants of corporate saving in the form of changes in the stock of
cash for 11 Asian economies using firm-level data from the Oriana Database for the 2002–2011 period.
We find some evidence that cash flow has a positive impact on the change in the stock of cash, which
suggests that Asian firms are borrowing constrained and that they save more when their cash flow
increases so that they will be able to finance future investments. Moreover, we find in the developed
economy sample that, as expected, cash flow has a positive impact on the change in the stock of cash
only in the case of the smallest firms, which are more likely to be borrowing constrained, and find
in the developing economy sample that, as expected, the positive impact of cash flow on the change
in the stock of cash declines with firm size. In addition, we find that the cash flow sensitivity of cash
declined after the global financial crisis. Finally, we find some evidence that Tobin’s q has a positive
impact on the change in the stock of cash.

                                 I.   INTRODUCTION



Corporate saving has always played an important role, but it has shown a substantial

upward trend in many, if not most, of the developed and Asian economies for the past 2

decades, as pointed out by Karabarbounis and Neiman (2012), and thus is of even

more importance now. Yet most previous analyses of saving have focused on

household (or personal) saving or national (or domestic) saving, and there have been

relatively few analyses of corporate (or firm) saving (refer to the papers in the

references section for a representative sampling of previous theoretical and empirical

analyses of corporate saving).



         Why do firms accumulate liquid assets? In other words, why do firms channel

their cash flow into liquid assets rather than into physical capital (capital formation) or

into shareholder distributions (dividends)? The high saving rates in Asia have been

called a “saving glut” and have been blamed for the pre-global financial crisis “global

imbalances,” and both academics and policy makers have expended much effort in

trying to understand the saving behavior of this region generally (see, for example,

Horioka and Terada-Hagiwara (2011), but the factors driving the surge in corporate

saving in Asia have yet to be disentangled. The objective of this paper is to fill this void

by doing an empirical analysis of the saving behavior of Asian firms.



         The recent literature on corporate saving has proposed two main explanations

for the excess corporate saving in emerging markets. First, emerging markets have a

limited supply of financial assets and are financially constrained (see, for example,



                                             1
Dooley, Folkerts-Landau, and Garber 2005; Matsuyama 2007; Ju and Wei 2006, 2010;

and Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas 2008). In this explanation, the underdeveloped

financial sector serves as the main driver of corporate saving behavior.



        The second strand of the literature on corporate saving focuses on the role of

the precautionary motive. In this explanation, excess saving and thence net capital

outflows result from precautionary saving arising from idiosyncratic risk (see, for

example, Mendoza, Quadrini, and Rios-Rull 2009, Sandri, 2010, and Benhima, 2010).

In these precautionary saving models, rising uncertainties cause a decline in corporate

investment, as has been particularly noticeable in some of the Southeast Asian

economies.



        The goal of this paper is not to directly address the macroeconomic

phenomenon of the saving glut, but rather to understand the process whereby firms

accumulate liquid assets or saving by analyzing firm-level income statement data. In

particular, we are interested in why firms channel their cash flow into liquid assets

(defined to include cash as well as other financial assets) rather than into physical

capital. We also seek to determine whether and when corporate saving behavior can

serve as a useful indicator of the extent to which firms face external borrowing

constraints. Thus, we focus on two specific determinants of corporate saving: income

uncertainty and the cost of external finance.



        In this paper, we analyze the determinants of corporate saving in the form of

changes in the stock of cash for 11 Asian economies using firm-level data from the


                                            2
Oriana Database for the 2002–2011 period. Figure 1 shows trends in our measure of

corporate saving during the sample period. The change in the stock of cash (as a share

of total assets) was positive throughout the sample period, which indicates that cash

holdings have been increasing throughout this period. This supports the view that there

was a “saving glut” in Asia. However, some variations can be observed across time and

among groupings of economies. Firms in our sample continued to save more cash until

2010 despite the slight dip in 2008, and the cash saving rate peaked in 2010 before

dropping quite sharply in 2011. This general trend can be observed in both developed

and developing economies, but firms’ cash holdings increased significantly more in

developing economies than in developed economies after 2007, until they dropped

sharply in 2011.



        To preview our main findings, we find some evidence that cash flow has a

positive impact on the change in the stock of cash, which suggests that Asian firms are

borrowing constrained and that they save more when their cash flow increases so that

they will be able to finance future investments. Moreover, we find in the developed

economy sample that, as expected, cash flow has a positive impact on the change in

the stock of cash only in the case of the smallest firms, which are more likely to be

borrowing constrained, and find in the developing economy sample that, as expected,

the positive impact of cash flow on the change in the stock of cash declines with firm

size. In addition, we find that the cash flow sensitivity of cash declined after the global

financial crisis. Finally, we find some evidence that Tobin’s q has a positive impact on

the change in the stock of cash.

           The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We discuss theoretical

considerations in Section II, the estimation model and the estimation method in Section

III, the data source in Section IV, the estimation results in Section V, and the summary

and conclusions in Section VI.



                       II.   THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS



In this section, we consider the determinants of corporate saving from a theoretical

perspective. Our discussion draws heavily on the analyses on Almeida, Campello, and

Weisbach (2004), Khurana, Martin, and Pereira (2006), Riddick and Whited (2009), and

Almeida, et al. (2013) (see also Karabarbounis and Neiman (2012) and Huang (2011),

who also discuss the importance of borrowing constraints as a motive for corporate

saving).



           Households and firms are very different economic entities with very different

objective functions, with households consuming in order to maximize their utility and

firms investing in plant and equipment and using that plant and equipment in order to

produce goods and services and make profits. However, there are many similarities

between the two types of economic entities nonetheless. For example, in the same way

that households save in order to finance their future consumption, firms save in order to

finance their future investment. Moreover, in the same way that households have a

choice between financing their consumption by borrowing or by drawing down their

previously accumulated saving, firms have a choice between financing investment by

borrowing or by drawing down their previously accumulated saving. Furthermore, in the


                                            4
same way that borrowing constraints and borrowing costs will influence households’

decisions about how to finance their consumption, borrowing constraints and borrowing

costs will also influence firms’ decisions about how to finance their investment.



        As the Fisher Separation Theorem states, the firm's decision regarding

physical investment is, of course, paramount, and once this decision is made, the firm

will then decide how to finance the investment, whether it be from internal funds (cash)

and/or external funds (loans and bond and equity issues). It is in this context that firms

will decide whether and how much financial assets (cash) to hold, and it is this decision

upon which we will focus in this paper.



        If firms did not face borrowing constraints, they could finance their investment

in plant and equipment by borrowing as much as they needed from external sources at

market rates and therefore would not need to hold financial assets in preparation for the

sudden and unexpected appearance of profitable investment projects (projects with a

positive net present value). However, if firms faced borrowing constraints, as a result of

which they had to pay more than the market rate of interest when borrowing from

external sources, they might choose to hold at least some financial assets at all times to

ensure that they were able to take advantage of any profitable investment projects that

might suddenly and unexpectedly arise without having to borrow from external sources,

thereby saving on expected future financing costs.



        Note, however, that holding financial assets confers costs as well as benefits.

One cost of holding financial assets is that doing so reduces the amount of current


                                            5
investments that can be financed from internal sources, and in the case of borrowing

constrained firms, this in turn may reduce the amount of current investments the firm

can do. Another cost of holding financial assets is that the firm must pay taxes on the

interest income earned on holdings of financial assets. Thus, firms must balance the

costs of holding financial assets (the cost of foregone current investment projects and

the tax liability on the interest income accruing to holdings of financial assets) against

the benefits of doing so (the reduction in expected future financing costs) when deciding

how much of their assets to hold in the form of financial assets.



         We turn next to what these theoretical considerations imply concerning the

“cash flow sensitivity of cash,” the impact of cash flow on how much firms save in the

form of cash, where cash is construed broadly to include all liquid financial assets.

According to the analysis of Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach (2004), an increase in

cash flow will cause firms to want to increase current investment as well as future

investment. A firm that is not borrowing constrained will not necessarily increase its

cash holdings in response to an increase in its cash flow and may use the entire

increase in its cash flow to finance current investment because it knows that it will be

able to finance future investment using external funds without any difficulty. Thus, an

increase in cash flow will not have a systematic impact on how much unconstrained

firms save in the form of cash (that is, the so-called “cash flow sensitivity of cash” of

unconstrained firms would be expected to be zero).



         However, a firm that is borrowing constrained will use at least part of the

increase in its cash flow to increase its cash holdings so that it will be able to increase its


                                              6
future investment without relying on external funds. Thus, an increase in cash flow will

cause borrowing constrained firms to save more in the form of cash (that is, the “cash

flow sensitivity of cash” of borrowing constrained firms will be positive).



         By contrast, Riddick and Whited (2009) extend the theoretical analysis of

Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach (2004) and show that the cash flow sensitivity of

cash may be negative in the case of borrowing constrained firms. They obtain a very

different prediction regarding the sign of the cash flow sensitivity of cash because they

assume that the firm faces positively serially correlated productivity shocks. As a result,

a positive productivity shock will cause the firm’s cash flow to increase and its capital to

become more productive, and its productivity will revert to its mean only slowly. This will

induce the firm to shift its assets from cash to physical capital, and if this substitution

effect is strong enough to offset the income effect identified by Almeida, Campello, and

Weisbach (2004) and discussed above, the firm will invest and draw down its cash

holdings in response to an increase in cash flow caused by a positive productivity shock.

Thus, an increase in cash flow will cause firms to save less in the form of cash (that is,

the “cash flow sensitivity of cash” will be negative).



    Thus, the sign and magnitude of the “cash flow sensitivity of cash” is theoretically

ambiguous and will depend on whether or not firms are borrowing constrained and on

whether or not increases in cash flow are accompanied by increases in productivity.

Empirical analysis is needed to determine the sign and magnitude of the “cash flow

sensitivity of cash.”

             III.   ESTIMATION MODEL AND ESTIMATION METHODS



In this section, we describe our econometric model, which is based on the theoretical

considerations discussed in the previous section, as well as the estimation methods

used to estimate our model.



         Following Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach (2004), Khurana, Martin, and

Pereira (2006), and Riddick and Whited (2009), we estimate the following baseline

equation:



CHCASHA(i,t) =       a0 + a1 * CFA(i,t) + a2 * q(i,t) + a3 * SIZE(i,t) + e(i,t)

(1)



where CHCASHA(i,t) is the ratio of the change in the stock of cash to total assets,

CFA(i,t) is the ratio of cash flow to total assets, q(i,t) is Tobin’s q, and SIZE(i,t) is firm

size measured by total assets of firm i at time t. e(i,t) is an error term of firm i at time t.



         As explained in the previous section, Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach (2004)

predict that the coefficient of cash flow, a1, will be positive in the case of borrowing

constrained firms but that it will be indeterminate in the case of unconstrained firms.

This prior implies that firms should increase their stocks of liquid assets in response to

positive cash flow innovations if they are borrowing constrained. By contrast,

unconstrained firms should not display such systematic behavior when managing their

liquidity; i.e., their cash flow sensitivity of cash should not be statistically different from


                                               8
zero.



         This prediction of a positive propensity to save out of cash flow for borrowing

constrained firms is due primarily to Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach’s (2004)

assumption that an increase in cash flow is not accompanied by higher capital

productivity. Therefore, the firm has no incentive to transform liquid assets into physical

assets, and an increase in cash flow produces a pure positive income effect on saving.

Riddick and Whited (2009), on the other hand, stress the importance of the substitution

effect. The substitution effect implies that the firm saves less in the form of liquid assets

because it wants to shift some of its liquid assets into physical assets that have become

relatively more productive.



         We use two definitions of Tobin’s q (q1, the ratio of market price to book value,

and q2, the sum of market capitalization and debt as a ratio of total assets). However,

as the results were not very sensitive to the definition of Tobin’s q, we report only the

results for q1.



         We do the estimations with and without one-digit industry dummies, and

although the results were not found to be very sensitive to the inclusion of industry

dummies, we report the results with and without industry dummies.



         Finally, in addition to estimating the baseline regression [equation (1)], we also

tried augmenting the regression with three additional explanatory variables (capital

expenditures, working capital, and short-term debt).


                                             9
         We estimate this equation using three estimation methods: ordinary least

squares (OLS), the procedure proposed by Fama and MacBeth (1973), and the

generalized method of moments (GMM). The Fama and MacBeth (1973) procedure

consists of estimating the equation for each year using OLS, then pooling the yearly

estimates. Since it is likely that there is measurement error in Tobin’s q, we follow

Riddick and Whited (2009) in using GMM to control for measurement error in Tobin’s q.



         We do the estimates for the full sample, for the subsamples of developed

economies and developing economies, and for individual economies.



         In addition, in order to gauge the impact of the global financial crisis on the

saving behavior of firms, we try dividing the time period of our analysis into pre-crisis

(2002–2007) and post-crisis (2008–2011).



       Finally, we try dividing the sample into various subsamples by firm size on the

grounds that firm size will be a good proxy for borrowing constraints. In particular, we try

dividing the sample into firms above and below the mean (median) and into firm size

quintiles on the grounds that firms that are relatively small will be more likely to be

borrowing constrained whereas firms that are relatively large will be less likely to be

borrowing constrained.



                                IV.    DATA SOURCE




                                            10
In this section, we discuss the source of the data used in our analysis. The data we use

in   our    analysis   are   taken   from   the   Bureau   Van   Dijk   Oriana   Database

(https://oriana.bvdinfo.com/), a comprehensive database that contains financial

information on public and private companies. We use data from 11 Asian economies:

Australia; the People’s Republic of China (PRC); Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan;

the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; and Viet Nam.

We use data for the 10-year period from 2002–2011.



           When we divide the sample into developed economies and developing

economies, we classify Australia; Hong Kong, China; Japan; New Zealand; and

Singapore as developed economies and, the PRC, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea,

Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam as developing economies.



           Comparing our sample to those of previous firm-level analyses of the

determinants of corporate saving, Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach (2004) conduct

their analysis only for firms in the United States (US), whereas Riddick and Whited

(2009) conduct their analysis only for firms in Canada, Japan, France, Germany, the

United Kingdom, and the US. Thus, this paper is the first analysis to include Asian

economies other than Japan in the sample and also the first analysis to include

developing economies in the sample.



           Turning to sample selection, following Riddick and Whited (2009), we deleted

firm-year observations with missing data and for which total assets, the gross capital

stock, or sales are either zero or negative, selected the longest consecutive time series


                                             11
of data for each firm, and deleted firms with only one observation. Following Riddick and

Whited (2009), we also omitted all firms whose primary Standard Industrial

Classification (SIC) code is between 4900 and 4999, between 6000 and 6999, or

greater than 9000 because our model is not appropriate for regulated, financial, or

quasi-public firms. Finally, we also excluded outliers (defined as the top and bottom 1%

of firms) and firms from economies with relatively few observations.



        Appendix Table 1 shows the variable definitions and data sources for the

variables used in the empirical analysis whereas Appendix Table 2 shows the summary

statistics for these variables.



                             V.   ESTIMATION RESULTS



In this section, we discuss our estimation results. Our estimation results are shown in

Tables 1–9. The first three tables show estimation results by economy. Table 1 shows

the OLS estimates, Table 2 shows the Fama and MacBeth (1973) estimates, and Table

3 shows the GMM estimates. Two measures of Tobin’s q were used in the estimations,

with the first being the ratio of market price to book value and the second being the sum

of market capitalization and debt divided by total assets. The left-hand panel of Tables 1

and 2 shows the estimates using the first definition of Tobin’s q, while the right-hand

panel shows the estimates using the second definition of Tobin’s q. Only the first

measure of Tobin’s q based on the ratio of market price to book value is used in Table 3.



         As can be seen from Table 1, in the OLS estimates, the coefficient of greatest


                                           12
interest (the coefficient of cash flow) is positive and statistically significant in all of the 11

economies in our sample regardless of whether or not industry dummies are included.



         As can be seen from Table 2, the Fama and MacBeth (1973) estimates are

generally consistent with the OLS estimates with a positive coefficient on cash flow, but

the coefficient of cash flow is statistically significant in a fewer number of economies.

The coefficient of cash flow is positive and statistically significant in six out of the 11

economies in the sample when industry dummies are included and in nine out of the 11

economies in the sample when industry dummies are not included.



         As can be seen from Table 3 in the GMM estimates, the coefficient of cash flow

is statistically significant in nine out of the 11 economies in the sample and is positive in

all cases in which it is statistically significant.



         Turning to the coefficient of Tobin’s q, in the OLS estimates, it is statistically

significant in seven (six) out of the 11 economies in the sample (positive and significant

in five (five) economies, and negative and significant in two (one) economies when

industry dummies are included (omitted). In the Fama and MacBeth (1973) estimates, it

is not statistically significant in any of the 11 economies in the sample regardless of

whether or not industry dummies are included. In the GMM estimates, the coefficient of

Tobin’s q is statistically significant in only four out of the 11 economies in the sample

and is positive in three out of the four economies in which it is statistically significant.



         We also obtained the GMM results for the full sample of economies, the


                                                13
developed economy sample, and the developing economy sample, and the results are

shown in Tables 4, 5, and 6, respectively. As can be seen from these tables, the

coefficient of cash flow is positive and statistically significant in every case in the

baseline regressions and positive and statistically significant in every case in the

augmented regressions except in the developed economy sample.



         The coefficient of Tobin’s q is positive and statistically significant in the full

sample of economies and the developing economy sample in the case of the baseline

regressions and in the full sample of economies only in the case of the augmented

regressions.



         The fact that the coefficient of cash flow is generally positive suggests that the

income effect analyzed by Almeida, Campello, and Weisbach (2004) is more important

than the substitution effect analyzed by Riddick and Whited (2009), as a result of which

the net impact of cash flow on the change in the stock of cash is positive (i.e., firms save

more in the form of cash when their cash inflows are higher).



         As for the impact of Tobin’s q, there is some evidence that its impact on the

change in the stock of cash is positive but the results are not very clear-cut.



         Turning to the results for the pre- and post-global financial crisis periods, the

coefficient of cash flow is almost always higher during the pre-crisis period than during

the post-crisis period, which is reasonable since the greater pessimism about future

prospects caused by the global financial crisis presumably reduced the demand for


                                            14
cash holdings in preparation for the sudden and unexpected appearance of profitable

investment opportunities. The only exception to this pattern is in the case of the baseline

regression results for the developing economy sample, but the aforementioned pattern

holds in the case of the augmented regression results for this sample, which are

presumably more reliable than the baseline regression results due to the inclusion of

more explanatory variables.



         We now divide the sample into subsamples according to firm size (asset size)

in order to test for the possibility of the differential sensitivity of the change in the stock

of cash to the cash flow variable by asset size. In this exercise, we use the asset size of

firms to divide the sample of firms in each economy into five groups (quintiles). The

grouping is based on the average or median asset size of firms in each economy, and

thus, for firms in an economy in which average (median) asset size is relatively large

such as the PRC, Japan, or the Republic of Korea, some of the firms in the bottom

quintile might be larger than those in the highest quintile in other economies such as

Viet Nam where average asset size is relatively small.



         The results are shown in Tables 7, 8, and 9, for the full sample of economies,

the sample of developed economies, and the sample of developing economies,

respectively (only the results for the variants with industry dummies are shown due to

space limitations). The estimates for both the developed economy sample and the

developing economy sample show that the coefficient of cash flow is almost always

positive and is often statistically significant when it is positive whereas it is never

negative and statistically significant, contrary to what Riddick and Whited (2009)


                                              15
predicted. This is true even when we augmented the specification by adding capital

expenditures, working capital, and short-term debt and estimated the equation using

GMM. This finding constitutes strong support for the income effect posited by Almeida,

Campello, and Weisbach (2004), and there is no evidence of a shift from cash flow to

physical assets.



        Turning to patterns by firm size, as explained earlier, Almeida, Campello, and

Weisbach (2004) predict that the coefficient of cash flow, a1, will be positive in the case

of borrowing constrained firms but that it will be indeterminate in the case of

unconstrained firms. Since smaller firms are more likely to be borrowing constrained, we

would expect the coefficient of cash flow, a1, to be larger and more highly significant in

the case of smaller firms, and our results are consistent with this expectation.



       As the results for developed economies in Table 5 show, the coefficient of cash

flow is positive and significant in the case of the lowest firm size quintile but is not

statistically significant in any other quintile. Moreover, as the results for developing

economies in Table 6 show, the coefficient of cash flow is positive and statistically

significant in the case of all firm sizes, but its significant level and absolute magnitude

decline with firm size in the case of the baseline regressions (although the coefficient of

cash flow is not significant for any firm size in the case of the augmented regressions).

Thus, the results for both developed and developing economies are consistent with our

prior that smaller firms are more likely to be borrowing constrained and that they would

be expected to have a stronger tendency to save when cash flow is high.

                      VI.    SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS



In this paper, we analyzed the determinants of corporate saving in the form of changes

in the stock of cash for 11 Asian economies using firm-level data from the Oriana

Database for the 2002–2011 period. We found some evidence that cash flow has a

positive impact on the change in the stock of cash, which suggests that Asian firms are

borrowing constrained and that they save more when their cash flow increases so that

they will be able to finance future investments. Moreover, we found in the developed

economy sample that, as expected, cash flow has a positive impact on the change in

the stock of cash only in the case of the smallest firms, which are more likely to be

borrowing constrained, and find in the developing economy sample that, as expected,

the positive impact of cash flow on the change in the stock of cash declines with firm

size. In addition, we find that the cash flow sensitivity of cash declined after the global

financial crisis. Finally, we found some evidence that Tobin’s q has a positive impact on

the change in the stock of cash.



       Turning finally to the policy implications of our findings, our findings suggest that

the behavior of Asian firms is heavily influenced by borrowing constraints and that

financial sector development would induce Asian firms to invest more in physical assets

and do less saving in the form of cash holdings. In order to better understand the

behavior of Asian firms, particularly in developing countries, future research might

include measures of uncertainty (such as the serial correlation and variance of income),

following Riddick and Whited (2009), to test the hypothesis that uncertainty is at least as


                                            17
important a determinant of the change in the stock of cash as borrowing constraints.
