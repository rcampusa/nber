We study a fiscal policy model in which the government is present-biased towards public
spending. Society chooses a fiscal rule to trade off the benefit of committing the government to
not overspend against the benefit of granting it flexibility to react to privately observed shocks to
the value of spending. Unlike prior work, we characterize rules that are self-enforcing: the
government must prefer to comply with the rule rather than face the punishment that follows a
breach, where any such punishment must also be self-enforcing. We show that the optimal rule is
a maximally enforced deficit limit, which, if violated, leads to the worst punishment for the
government. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the government to violate the
deficit limit following sufficiently high shocks. Punishment takes the form of a maximally
enforced surplus limit that incentivizes overspending; fiscal discipline is restored when the
government respects it.

1       Introduction
Countries impose rules on their governments to constrain their policy decisions. Increas-
ingly prevalent are fiscal rules, in place in 97 countries in 2013, compared to only seven
countries in 1990.1 Governments however do not always respect these rules. For exam-
ple, in 2003, the governments of France and Germany violated the terms of the European
Union’s Stability and Growth Pact by running deficits above the allowed limit, without
facing any sanctions.2 Credible enforcement mechanisms are critical to the institution
of fiscal rules, for governments only abide to rules if the ensuing penalties for breaching
them are severe enough.
     In this paper, we study the optimal design of fiscal rules under limited enforcement.
How restrictive is an optimal fiscal rule? Should the government violate it when the
economy is in distress? What is the optimal structure of penalties for violating the rule?
     Our analysis of fiscal rules builds on the approach used in Amador, Werning, and
Angeletos (2006) and Halac and Yared (2014).3 We consider a government that is
present-biased towards public spending and privately informed about shocks affecting
the value of this spending. Society chooses a fiscal rule to trade off the benefit of
committing the government to not overspend against the benefit of granting it flexibility
to react to shocks. We depart from prior work by relaxing the assumption that rules
can be perfectly enforced. Motivated by real-world rules, we posit that fiscal rules must
be self-enforcing: the government must prefer to comply with the rule rather than face
the punishment that follows a breach. Such a punishment must also be self-enforcing,
meaning that the government in the future must have incentives to pursue it. These
self-enforcement requirements, combined with the government’s private information,
introduce new challenges into our problem; we consider a simple framework that allows
for a full characterization of the optimal self-enforcing fiscal rule.
     Our environment is a small open economy in which the government makes spending
and borrowing decisions. In each period, an independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) shock to the social value of deficit-financed government spending is realized.
The government in each period is present-biased: compared to society, the government
overvalues current spending relative to the stream of future spending. This preference
structure results naturally from the aggregation of heterogeneous, time-consistent citi-
zens’ preferences (Jackson and Yariv, 2015, 2014), or as a consequence of turnover in a

political economy setting (e.g., Aguiar and Amador, 2011).4 We assume that the shocks
to the value of spending are privately observed by the government, capturing the fact
that rules cannot explicitly condition on all contingencies in fiscal policy. Moreover, the
government has full discretion regarding the level of spending, capturing the fact that
any constraint on spending must be self-enforcing. A fiscal rule in this setting assigns
the government a level of spending for each shock, where this assignment must satisfy
the government’s private information and self-enforcement constraints.
    To describe the forces underlying our model, suppose first that fiscal rules could
be perfectly enforced. Society then chooses a rule to optimally resolve the tradeoff
between commitment and flexibility. Fully committing the government to a spending
path would allow to implement the first best policy in the absence of private information,
whereas granting the government full flexibility would yield the first best policy in the
absence of a present bias. Given both private information and a present bias, however, a
tradeoff arises, and the first best is not implementable. Amador, Werning, and Angeletos
(2006) show that, under perfect enforcement (and certain distributional assumptions),
the solution to this tradeoff is a fiscal rule that takes the form of a deficit limit. In each
period, the government spends within the limit if the shock to the value of spending is
relatively low, and it spends at the limit if the shock is higher. The problem is essentially
static: the rule at each date prescribes future deficit limits that maximize future social
welfare, and dynamic incentives are thus not provided to the government.5
    Our focus is on understanding the optimal fiscal rule when external enforcement is
not possible, so the rule must be self-enforcing. As is also true under perfect enforce-
ment, a self-enforcing rule must satisfy the government’s private information constraints:
given a realized shock, the government must prefer its assigned spending level and con-
tinuation value to those prescribed for a different shock. In addition, a self-enforcing rule
must satisfy the government’s self-enforcement constraints: given a realized shock, the
government must prefer its assigned spending level and continuation value to a spend-
ing level not prescribed for any shock. Any observable deviation at a date t—where the
government chooses a spending level corresponding to no shock—is optimally punished
by inducing the worst possible continuation from date t+1 onward.6 In fact, if this pun-
ishment is severe enough, self-enforcement constraints are non-binding; the government
always prefers to abide to the perfect-enforcement deficit limit to avoid the punishment.

Our formulation corresponds to the quasi-hyperbolic consumption model; see Laibson (1997).

     This follows from standard arguments; see Abreu (1988).


                                                 2
    Our main result is a characterization of the optimal self-enforcing fiscal rule when
self-enforcement constraints are binding. We show that this rule takes the form of a
maximally enforced deficit limit, which, if violated, leads to the worst punishment for
the government. The rule is thus similar to that under perfect enforcement, although it
differs in two aspects. First, the deficit limit imposed on the government is more relaxed
than the perfect-enforcement limit. Second, the optimal self-enforcing rule may provide
dynamic incentives, with the government breaching the deficit limit and triggering pun-
ishment under sufficiently high shocks.
    To obtain this characterization, we begin by establishing general properties of opti-
mal incentive provision. Society incentivizes the government not to overspend by using
continuation values as reward and punishment. We show that in any optimal rule,
continuation values must take a bang-bang form, so the government receives either the
maximal reward or the worst punishment in the future, depending on its behavior in the
present.7 Using milder punishments would be less socially costly; however, the harshest
future punishment maximizes the range of shocks under which society can impose fiscal
discipline in the present, and we show that this maximizes social welfare.
    Given a continuum of shocks with differentiable density, our bang-bang result re-
lies only on generic properties of the distribution function, which guarantee that the
information structure is rich enough that steepening incentives always allows to reduce
distortions. Under additional distributional assumptions, we are able to further show
that optimal bang-bang continuation values must be monotonic in the realized shock.
In fact, building on monotonicity, we characterize the spending allocation, establishing
that these distributional assumptions are sufficient, as well as necessary, for maximally
enforced deficit limits to be uniquely optimal.8
    Specifically, when the perfect-enforcement rule is not self-enforcing, we show that
there are two possible cases for the optimal self-enforcing rule. In the first case, society
sets a relaxed deficit limit that satisfies the self-enforcement constraint under all shocks.
In the second case, society prescribes a tighter deficit limit with dynamic incentives:
the government receives the maximal continuation value if it respects the limit and the
worst continuation value if it breaches the limit, where the latter occurs following high
enough shocks. We show that the optimal choice for society depends on the distribution
of shocks and the government’s present bias. Given feasible continuation values, society
   7
     As we discuss in the review of the literature and in more detail in Subsection 4.1, our bang-bang
result is related to, but different from, that in Abreu, Pearce, and Stacchetti (1990).
   8
     These assumptions are similar to, but stronger than, those in Amador, Werning, and Angeletos
(2006). See Section 4.

chooses a tight deficit limit enforced by dynamic incentives if and only if high shocks are
sufficiently rare and the government’s present bias is sufficiently severe. A deficit limit
that is respected under all shocks is not optimal in this case, as this limit would need
to be too relaxed to accommodate self-enforcement for high shocks that are unlikely.
Society is better off imposing a tighter deficit limit that binds under lower shocks, while
letting the government violate the limit and be punished following high shocks.
    We complete our characterization of the optimal self-enforcing fiscal rule by exam-
ining the structure of punishment. We show that the worst punishment—which, as just
described, may be triggered in an optimal rule—takes the form of a maximally enforced
surplus limit. If the shock to the value of spending is relatively high, the government
respects the surplus limit and is rewarded with the maximal continuation value; if the
shock is relatively low, the government may violate the limit and be punished with the
worst continuation value. The logic for this result is analogous to that for the optimal
deficit limit, but reverse. A maximally enforced surplus limit minimizes social wel-
fare (and thus maximizes punishment) by incentivizing the government to overspend as
much as possible. Since the government is present-biased towards spending, incentiviz-
ing overspending relaxes self-enforcement constraints and achieves lower social welfare
than incentivizing underspending.
    The form of the maximally enforced surplus limit implies that punishment is always
temporary. In particular, the economy remains in punishment only if shocks are rel-
atively low; when a high shock occurs, the economy transitions back to a maximally
enforced deficit limit, which is associated with the highest continuation value. An op-
timal fiscal rule with dynamic incentives is therefore self-enforced by transitions in and
out of the best and worst equilibria, with the economy fluctuating between periods of
fiscal rectitude and periods of fiscal profligacy.

Related literature. Our paper fits into the aforementioned literature on mechanism
design that studies the tradeoff between commitment and flexibility.9 This literature
is mainly concerned with environments with perfect enforcement, whereas we examine
the optimal rule under self-enforcement. Closely related is Amador and Bagwell (2016),
which considers the classic problem of regulating a privately informed monopolist but
in the absence of transfers. In a static setting with an ex-post participation constraint,
   9
     In addition to the work previously cited, see Sleet (2004). More broadly, our paper relates to
the literature on delegation in principal-agent settings, including Holmström (1977, 1984), Alonso and
Matouschek (2008), and Ambrus and Egorov (2015). Hörner and Guo (2015), Li, Matouschek, and
Powell (2017), and Lipnowski and Ramos (2017) study related dynamic problems. The agent in these
settings has a bias applying to all periods, rather than a present bias as in our self-control problem.


                                                  4
the paper shows that optimal regulatory policy takes the form of a threshold which
the monopolist satisfies unless it decides to shut down. In contrast to this paper, our
analysis does not rely on the perfect enforcement of thresholds, and it considers “money
burning” in the form of self-enforcing dynamic punishments.
    Also related to our work is the literature on the political economy of fiscal policy.10
Dovis and Kirpalani (2017), in particular, examine deficit limits that are endogenously
enforced by reputational concerns. We depart by studying the optimal self-enforcing
fiscal rule under privately observed shocks and no restrictions on its structure. Our
work further contributes to the literature on hyperbolic discounting and the benefits
of commitment devices.11 Most closely related is Bernheim, Ray, and Yeltekin (2015),
which analyzes the self-enforcement of consumption rules for a consumer with quasi-
hyperbolic preferences. The paper shows that optimal punishments take the form of
temporary over-consumption; however, the model features no private information, and
as a consequence punishment does not occur along the equilibrium path.
    Finally, the equilibrium dynamics in our environment, featuring fluctuation between
reward and punishment, together with our bang-bang characterization, are related to
the analysis of price wars in Green and Porter (1984) and more broadly the dynamics
of repeated games in Abreu, Pearce, and Stacchetti (1990). The latter provides condi-
tions under which the bang-bang property is necessary for optimality in settings with
repeated moral hazard. As our environment is one of repeated adverse selection, our
characterization is not a direct application of their result; yet, the intuition is related, as
we discuss in Subsection 4.1. Athey, Bagwell, and Sanchirico (2004) also address related
issues in a repeated Bertrand game with private information.

We study a simple model of fiscal policy in which the government in each period makes
spending and borrowing decisions. Our environment is similar to that analyzed in

Amador, Werning, and Angeletos (2006) and Halac and Yared (2014).12 As discussed
in Section 3, our departure will be in considering fiscal rules that are self-enforcing as
opposed to externally enforced.
    Consider a small open economy. At the beginning of each period, t ∈ {0, 1, . . .}, the
government observes a shock to the economy, θt > 0, which is the government’s private
                                                                 
information or type. θt is drawn from a bounded set Θ ≡ θ, θ with a continuously
differentiable probability density function f (θt ) > 0 and associated cumulative density
function F (θt ).
    Following the realization of θt in each period t, the government chooses public spend-
ing Gt ≥ 0 and debt Bt+1 subject to a budget constraint:

                                                      Bt+1
                                       Gt = τ +            − Bt ,                                   (1)
                                                      1+r

where τ > 0 is the exogenous fixed tax revenue collected by the government in each
period, Bt is the level of debt with which the government enters period t, and r is the
                                                        Bt+1
exogenous interest rate. B0 is exogenous and limt→∞ (1+r)    t = 0, so that all debts must

be repaid and all assets must be consumed. Note that cross-subsidization across types
is not possible: the net present value of public spending at any point cannot depend on
the government’s type, unlike in other models such as Atkeson and Lucas (1992) and
Thomas and Worrall (1990).13
    Social welfare at the beginning of date t is
                                      ∞

discount factor. The government’s welfare at date t after the realization of its type θt ,

     Amador, Werning, and Angeletos (2006) consider a two-period setting, but as shown in Amador,
Werning, and Angeletos (2003), under i.i.d. shocks the results apply directly to a multiple-period
environment.
  13
     Other papers that build on these and also feature cross-subsidization are Sleet and Yeltekin (2006,
2008) and Farhi and Werning (2007).



                                                      6
    There are two important features of this environment. First, the government’s objec-
tive (3) following the realization of its type does not coincide with the social objective
(2). In particular, compared to society, the government overweighs the importance
of current spending relative to future spending. As mentioned in the Introduction,
this structure arises naturally when the government’s preferences aggregate citizens’
preferences. Jackson and Yariv (2015) show that with any heterogeneity in citizens’
preferences, every non-dictatorial aggregation method that respects unanimity must be
time inconsistent; moreover, any such method that is time separable must lead to a
present bias and thus a representation like that in (2)-(3).14 Our formulation can also
be motivated by political turnover. For instance, preferences such as these may emerge
in settings with political uncertainty where policymakers place a higher value on public
spending when they hold power and can make spending decisions. A bias of β ∈ (0, 1)
for a current policymaker can be interpreted in this sense as the probability that the
policymaker will be part of the government in the next and all future periods. Due to
turnover, policymakers are biased towards present spending relative to future spending
and incur excessively high debts; see, e.g., Aguiar and Amador (2011).
    The second feature of our environment is that the realization of θt —which affects
the marginal social utility of public spending—is privately observed by the government
at date t. One interpretation is that fiscal rules imposed on the government cannot
explicitly condition on the value of θt , even if this shock were observable.15 An alter-
native interpretation is that the exact cost of public goods is only observable to the
policymaker, who may be inclined to overspend on these goods. A third possibility is
that citizens have heterogeneous preferences or heterogeneous information regarding the
optimal level of public spending, and the government sees an aggregate that the citizens
do not see (see Sleet, 2004).
    To facilitate an explicit characterization of the optimal self-enforcing fiscal rule, we
assume:16

Assumption 1. U (Gt ) = log(Gt ).

    Assumption 1 implies that welfare is separable with respect to the level of debt. To
see this, let the spending rate at date t be gt ∈ [0, 1], corresponding to the fraction of
  14
     Specifically, any such time-separable aggregation method will be utilitarian, and by the results in
Jackson and Yariv (2014), it will thus be present-biased.
  15
     Halac and Yared (2017a) study a delegation problem in which shocks can be verified by a rule-
making body at a cost.
  16
     This assumption is made in previous work studying economies with hyperbolic discounting, includ-
ing Barro (1999) and, in the context of fiscal rules, Halac and Yared (2014).

government that chooses a spending rate gt and savings rate xt = 1 − gt in each period
t. Following Bernheim, Ray, and Yeltekin (2015), we impose a lower bound ν and upper
bound 1 − ν on gt so that payoffs (and thus punishments) are bounded; we take ν > 0
small enough that this constraint is otherwise non-binding.
      In this environment, the first-best policy that maximizes social welfare (5) at date
t = 0 is defined by a stochastic sequence of spending and savings rates that satisfy
gtf b = g f b (θt ) and xft b = xf b (θt ), where

                                      θt U 0 (g f b (θt )) = W 0 (xf b (θt )).                              (7)

On the other hand, the government’s flexible policy is defined as the spending and
savings rates gtf = g f (θt ) and xft = xf (θt ) that maximize the government’s welfare (6)
at date t, holding future government policies {gt+k , xt+k }∞          k=1 fixed. The flexible policy
satisfies
                                 θt U 0 (g f (θt )) = βW 0 (xf (θt )).                            (8)

3     Self-Enforcing Rules
A key feature of our analysis is that we allow the government to choose any feasible
spending rate gt in each period t. This is a main distinction from prior work, which
restricts the set of available actions by assuming that rules can be perfectly enforced.
We instead consider self-enforcing fiscal rules, motivated by the observation that, in
practice, governments are free to choose whether to abide to rules, and their choices
depend on the consequences of a breach. Hence, in our setting, a government’s current
spending decision must be self-enforced by the expected behavior of the government
in the future following this decision. Specifically, we define a self-enforcing rule as a
perfect public equilibrium of the interaction between successive governments. Such a
rule must satisfy a sequence of private information and self-enforcement constraints, as
we describe next.


3.1     Equilibrium Allocations
We consider the interaction between the governments in each period t. As is standard
in the dynamic contracting literature, we restrict attention to public strategies, namely
those that depend on the public history and current private information, but not on
any privately observed history. Let ht−1 = {g0 , g1 , ..., gt−1 } ∈ [0, 1]t−1 denote the public
history of spending rates through time t − 1 and Ht−1 the set of all possible such
histories. A public strategy for the government in period t is σ t (ht−1 , θt ), specifying,
for each history ht−1 ∈ Ht−1 and current government type θt ∈ Θ, a spending rate
gt (ht−1 , θt ) and associated savings rate xt (ht−1 , θt ) = 1 − gt (ht−1 , θt ). A perfect public
                                                                         ∞
equilibrium is a profile of public strategies σ = (σ t (ht−1 , θt ))t=0 such that for each
t ∈ {0, 1, . . .}, σ t (ht−1 , θt ) maximizes the t-period government’s welfare (6) given the
                                                  ∞
continuation strategies σ t+k ht+k−1 , θt+k k=1 of all future governments. We henceforth
refer to perfect public equilibria as simply equilibria.
    Let θt−1 = {θ0 , θ1 , . . . , θt−1 } ∈ Θt−1 denote the history of shocks through time t − 1.
                                                                                            ∞
Associated with any strategy profile σ is a spending sequence,            gt θt−1 , θt θt ∈Θt t=0 ,

where V is the lowest value of Vt θt−1 supported by equilibrium strategies.

    Constraint (9) is the private information constraint, capturing the fact that the
government at date t can misrepresent its type. This constraint guarantees that a gov-
ernment of type θt prefers to pursue its equilibrium policy rather than that of another
type θ0t ; given (9), this unobservable deviation would entail a spending rate gt (θt−1 , θ0t )
and continuation value Vt+1 (θt−1 , θ0t ). Constraint (10) is the self-enforcement constraint,
capturing the fact that the government at date t can freely choose any feasible spending
rate gt . This constraint guarantees that a government of type θt prefers to pursue its
equilibrium policy rather than deviating to its flexible policy g f (θt ) and being maxi-
mally punished with continuation value V . Note that the right-hand side of (10) is the
government’s minmax payoff.
    Constraints (9) and (10) are clearly necessary along an equilibrium path. Further-
more, if a spending sequence satisfies these constraints, then it can be supported by an
equilibrium in which, following an observable deviation in period t, the government in
each following period reverts to the worst equilibrium, delivering a continuation value
V . Since an observable deviation is off the equilibrium path, it is without loss to assume
that it is maximally punished (Abreu, 1988).


3.2      Recursive Representation
A self-enforcing fiscal rule is a perfect public equilibrium as described in the previous
section, inducing a sequence of spending that satisfies the private information constraint

                                                      10
 (9) and the self-enforcement constraint (10). A self-enforcing fiscal rule is optimal if it
 maximizes social welfare (5) at time t = 0 subject to these constraints.
     Given the repeated nature of our model and following the logic of Abreu, Pearce, and
 Stacchetti (1990), we can represent the optimal self-enforcing rule recursively: rather
 than optimizing over an entire spending sequence, we choose current spending and sav-
 ings rates g (θ) and x (θ) as a function of the shock θ, along with a continuation value
 V (θ) which is itself drawn from the set of values that satisfy the private information
                                                          
 and self-enforcement constraints. That is, letting V , V correspond to the set of con-
 tinuation values supported by equilibrium strategies,19 an optimal self-enforcing fiscal
 rule solves:
                                                                                  
                    V =          max             E θU (g (θ)) + W (x (θ)) + δV (θ)               (11)
                          {g(θ),x(θ),V (θ)}θ∈Θ

                                                  subject to
θU (g (θ)) + βW (x (θ)) + βδV (θ) ≥ θU (g (θ0 )) + βW (x (θ0 )) + βδV (θ0 ) ∀θ, θ0 6= θ, (12)
        θU (g (θ)) + βW (x (θ)) + βδV (θ) ≥ θU (g f (θ)) + βW (xf (θ)) + βδV ∀θ,                 (13)
                                            g (θ) + x (θ) = 1,                                   (14)
                                                          

     The private information constraint (12) is a recursive formulation of (9), and the
 self-enforcement constraint (13) is a recursive formulation of (10). Constraints (14) and
 (15) are feasibility constraints. We say that a rule is incentive compatible if it satisfies
 (12)-(13), and it is incentive compatible and feasible, or incentive feasible for short, if it
 satisfies (12)-(15).
     Analogous to the problem in (11), the worst punishment V corresponds to the solu-
 tion to:
                                                                                  
                    V =          min             E θU (g (θ)) + W (x (θ)) + δV (θ)               (16)
                          {g(θ),x(θ),V (θ)}θ∈Θ

                                          subject to (12)-(15).

    Throughout our analysis, we assume that the solutions to both problems (11) and
 (16) admit piecewise continuously differentiable functions g (θ), which allows us to es-
   19
     The set of equilibrium continuation values can be guaranteed to be convex by introducing a public
 randomization device. Such a device however will not be used in the optimum, which has a bang-bang
 nature. We thus omit the details to ease the exposition.

tablish our results by the use of perturbations.20 An alternative approach to using
perturbation arguments would be to use Lagrangian methods, as in Amador, Werning,
and Angeletos (2003). Since our problem is not globally concave, however, a Lagrangian
approach would not establish uniqueness of the solution. Moreover, such an approach
would make it difficult to identify general properties that must hold in any solution,
as well as to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of maximally
enforced deficit limits. We are able to provide all these results using perturbations.
   The next lemma follows from standard arguments; see Fudenberg and Tirole (1991):

Lemma 2. {g (θ) , x (θ) , V (θ)}θ∈Θ satisfies the private information constraint (12) if
and only if: (i) g(θ) is nondecreasing, and (ii) the following local private information
constraints are satisfied:

   1. At any point θ at which g(·), and thus V (·), are differentiable,

                          dg(θ)                                  dV (θ)
                                (θU 0 (g(θ)) − βW 0 (x(θ))) + βδ        = 0.
                            dθ                                     dθ

   2. At any point θ0 at which g(·) is not differentiable,

       lim0 {θ0 U (g(θ)) + βW (x(θ)) + βδV (θ)} = lim0 {θ0 U (g(θ)) + βW (x(θ)) + βδV (θ)} .
       θ↑θ                                             θ↓θ


   By the local private information constraints, government welfare is piecewise continu-
ously differentiable. Moreover, these constraints imply that the derivative of government
welfare with respect to θ is U (g(θ)). Hence, in an incentive compatible rule, government
welfare for type θ ∈ Θ satisfies
                                                                                 Z     θ

                                                                                   θ


Substitution of (17) into the social welfare function in (11) implies that social welfare
(normalized by debt) can be written as
                                                             Z    θ

  20
     Also, if the problem in (11) (respectively, (16)) admits multiple solutions that differ only on a
countable set of types, we select the solution that maximizes (respectively, minimizes) social welfare
for those types.




                                                 12
where
                                Q (θ) ≡ 1 − F (θ) − θf (θ) (1 − β) .

    This formulation will be useful for our characterization of the optimal self-enforcing
fiscal rule in the next section, which will appeal to properties of the function Q(θ).
For intuition, note that since the government is biased towards overspending relative
to society, higher levels of spending can be attributed to larger spending distortions.
In this sense, Q(θ) represents the weight that society places on spending distortions
associated with government type θ. The shape of this function will tell us how society
wishes to allocate distortions across different government types.


4       Maximally Enforced Deficit Limits
We characterize the optimal self-enforcing fiscal rule by solving the recursive problem
(11)-(15). We begin in this section by taking the set of feasible continuation values
      
  V , V as given, where we assume, for the problem to be interesting, that V > V .21
We show that the unique optimal rule is a deficit limit with maximal enforcement. The
continuation equilibrium induced by this rule is examined in Section 5.
     We define a maximally enforced deficit limit as follows:

Definition 1. {g (θ) , x (θ) , V (θ)}θ∈Θ is a maximally enforced deficit limit if there exist
     
θ∗ ∈ 0, θ and finite θ∗∗ > max {θ∗ , θ} such that
                                       ( 
                                             min{g f (θ), g f (θ∗ )}, V    if θ ≤ θ∗∗ ,
                   {g (θ) , V (θ)} =              f                                                 (19)
                                                    g (θ), V               if θ > θ∗∗ ,

where

       θ∗∗ U (g f (θ∗ )) + βW (xf (θ∗ )) + βδV = θ∗∗ U (g f (θ∗∗ )) + βW (xf (θ∗∗ )) + βδV .         (20)

    Figure 1 illustrates the spending allocation under a maximally enforced deficit limit
                                                                               
with θ∗ > θ and θ∗∗ < θ. Under this rule, types θ ∈ [θ, θ∗ ) and θ ∈ θ∗∗ , θ choose their
flexible spending rate g f (θ) and types θ ∈ [θ∗ , θ∗∗ ] choose type θ∗ ’s flexible spending
rate g f (θ∗ ). Furthermore, types θ ≤ θ∗∗ (solid line) are maximally rewarded with
  21
    If it were the case that V = V , then the unique equilibrium would entail all government types
choosing their flexible spending rate g f (θ) at all dates. In the Online Appendix, we provide a sufficient
condition for V > V to hold under the assumptions maintained for our main result in Proposition 2.
This condition amounts to the discount factor δ ∈ (0, 1) being high enough.

4.1     Bang-Bang Incentives
Society can use continuation values as rewards and punishments to discipline the gov-
ernment and reduce overspending. The next proposition shows that in any optimal
rule, these rewards and punishments are extreme. That is, continuation values are
bang-bang: given a feasible set [V , V ], along the equilibrium path V (θ) only travels to
extreme points in this set.

Proposition 1 (necessity of bang-bang). Suppose Q(θ) satisfies the following generic
properties:

  (i) Q0 (θ) 6= 0 almost everywhere;
                                                                      R θH               R θH
                                               b then
 (ii) If θ ≤ θL < θH ≤ θ and Q(θL ) = Q(θH ) = Q,                            Q(θ)dθ 6=          b
                                                                                                Qdθ.
                                                                       θL                 θL

                                                              
Then in any solution to (11)-(15), for all θ ∈ (θ, θ), V (θ) ∈ V , V               and V (θ) is left- or
right-continuous at θ.

    Proposition 1 shows that the bang-bang property is necessary for social welfare
maximization. As in other repeated game settings, an optimal fiscal rule using only
extreme continuation values always exists in our framework; this is true simply because
an interior continuation value V (θ) can be assigned in expectation by randomizing over
V and V . Proposition 1 proves a stronger result: any rule that prescribes interior
continuation values is strictly dominated by one with high-powered incentives.
    This proposition is consistent with the work of Abreu, Pearce, and Stacchetti (1990),
who provide general conditions under which the bang-bang property is necessary for
optimality in environments of repeated moral hazard (see Theorem 7, p.1055 in their
paper). There are important differences, however, between our result and theirs. On the
one hand, establishing the necessity of bang-bang continuation values is facilitated in
our self-control setting by the fact that the set of continuation values is one-dimensional,
unlike in their model. On the other hand, new difficulties arise when establishing the
bang-bang property in our setting of repeated adverse selection as opposed to moral
hazard. Under moral hazard, local perturbations that spread out continuation values
for a given public realization of uncertainty are always incentive feasible and socially
beneficial, as they induce more desirable actions.22 In contrast, under adverse selection,
local perturbations that spread out continuation values can reduce social welfare (for
  22
     For example, in a standard principal-agent model with linear preferences over consumption and
continuous disutility of effort, spreading out continuation values for a given realization of output allows
to induce higher effort.

                                                    15
example, if Q0 (θ) < 0); moreover, even when such perturbations are socially beneficial
(for example, if Q0 (θ) > 0), they may violate the monotonicity of the spending schedule
required by incentive compatibility.
     Despite these differences, the intuition for our bang-bang result is related to that in
Abreu, Pearce, and Stacchetti (1990) in that it stems from the richness of the information
structure.23 Given a continuum of types, this richness is guaranteed by conditions (i)
and (ii) in Proposition 1, and it implies that society can always reduce distortions by
steepening incentives. Condition (i) states that over any sufficiently small interval, Q(θ)
is either strictly decreasing or strictly increasing; as a result, society benefits from moving
spending distortions towards either lower types or higher types, respectively. Condition
(ii) extends this property: if Q(θ) takes the same value at two endpoints of an interval—
so that society weighs spending distortions at these endpoints equally—this condition
requires that the average weight on distortions over the interval be different from that
of the endpoints. That is, society strictly prefers to concentrate distortions within the
interval or at an endpoint. We note that given f (θ) continuously differentiable, (i) and
(ii) are generic properties of {f (θ), β} pairs which characterize Q(θ) for θ ∈ Θ.24
     It is also worth noting that the result in Proposition 1 does not rely on the presence
of self-enforcement constraints and would continue to hold absent (13). As such, our
bang-bang characterization of continuation values applies more generally to other self-
control problems. One example is the problem of Amador, Werning, and Angeletos
(2006) under our Assumption 1 on preferences; this assumption ensures that spending
is interior, as required for our characterization.25 We conjecture that the arguments
may also extend to the monetary policy model of Athey, Atkeson, and Kehoe (2005).
     The formal proof of Proposition 1 in the Appendix makes use of perturbation argu-
ments.26 We establish the result in three steps; we next provide a summary which may
give intuition and serve as a guide to follow the proof.
     Step 1 shows that V (θ) is a step function, so dynamic incentives are not provided
  23
    See Yared (2010a) for a related discussion in a repeated adverse selection model.
  24
    Condition (i) fails only if θf 0 (θ)/f (θ) = −(2 − β)/(1 − β) for a positive mass of types, but then
any arbitrarily small perturbation of β would render the condition true. Similarly, condition (ii) fails
                                   R H            R H
only if Q(θL ) = Q(θH ) = Qb and θL Q(θ)dθ = θL Qdθ    b for some θL , θH ∈ Θ. However, the condition
                                   θ              θ
would then hold for any arbitrarily small perturbation of f (θ) over (θL , θH ) which preserves the value
   R θH                        R θH
of θL f (θ)dθ but not that of θL F (θ)dθ.
  25
     Ambrus and Egorov (2013) provide examples in the setting of Amador, Werning, and Angeletos
(2006) in which spending is at a corner and, as a result, interior punishments can be optimal.
  26
     Some of the arguments we use for regions where Q0 (θ) < 0 are similar to those employed by Athey,
Atkeson, and Kehoe (2005) in their analysis of optimal inflation rules. Unlike in their work, where rules
are perfectly enforced, our arguments take into account the constraints due to self-enforcement.



                                                      16
locally to the government. Suppose instead that V (θ) was strictly increasing or strictly
decreasing, and thus strictly interior, over an interval [θL , θH ]. By Lemma 2, g(θ) must
be strictly increasing over the interval, and by condition (i) in Proposition 1, we can
take a subinterval such that Q0 (θ) > 0 or Q0 (θ) < 0 for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ].27 We then show
that there exists an incentive feasible perturbation that strictly increases social welfare.
To illustrate, take g(θ) < g f (θ), and hence V 0 (θ) < 0, for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ]. If Q0 (θ) < 0,
we construct a flattening perturbation that rotates the increasing g(θ) schedule clockwise
over [θL , θH ], which entails reducing dynamic incentives with a counterclockwise rotation
of the decreasing V (θ) function. This perturbation is socially beneficial because, given
Q0 (θ) < 0, society prefers to concentrate spending distortions on lower rather than
higher types. If instead Q0 (θ) > 0, we construct a steepening perturbation that drills a
hole in the g(θ) schedule by making allocations in (θL , θH ) no longer available, which
entails increasing dynamic incentives by moving interior continuation values towards
V (θL ) or V (θH ). This perturbation is socially beneficial because, given Q0 (θ) > 0,
society prefers to concentrate spending distortions on higher rather than lower types.
We obtain that V (θ) must be a step function, and we also show that V (θ) must be left-
or right-continuous at each θ ∈ (θ, θ).
     Step 2 of the proof establishes that V (θ) ∈ {V , V } at any point θ at which dg(θ) dθ
                                                                                             > 0.
Since, by Step 1, local dynamic incentives are not provided, we show that any such point
θ must belong to an interval with flexible spending and constant continuation value V ∈
[V , V ]. However, if V ∈ (V , V ), we can construct incentive feasible perturbations similar
to those above: if Q0 (θ) < 0 over the interval, we perform a flattening perturbation
that rotates the spending schedule clockwise; if Q0 (θ) > 0, we perform a steepening
perturbation that drills a hole in the spending schedule. By the logic in Step 1, these
perturbations strictly increase social welfare, so V ∈ (V , V ) cannot be optimal.
     Step 3 completes the proof by showing that V (θ) ∈ {V , V } at any point θ at which
dg(θ)
  dθ
       = 0. By the results in Step 1 and Step 2, if V (θ) ∈ (V , V ) for such a point,
then this point belongs to a stand-alone segment [θL , θH ] with g(θ) = g and V (θ) = V
for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ], for some g > 0 and V ∈ (V , V ), and with g(θ) jumping at each
boundary (unless θL = θ or θH = θ). We then show that there exists an incentive
feasible perturbation that changes g and V slightly and strictly increases social welfare.
This perturbation uses the fact that condition (ii) in Proposition 1 holds. For example,
                         R θH
if it is the case that θL Q(θ)dθ > Q(θL ), we perform a segment-shifting steepening
perturbation: we increase g and change V so as to leave the government welfare of type
  27
     Note that given f (θ) continuously differentiable, condition (i) in Proposition 1 implies that the set
of types θ such that Q0 (θ) = 0 is nowhere dense.


                                                    17
θH unchanged, thus increasing spending for types θ ∈ (θL , θH ] and letting type θL jump
down to a lower spending rate. This perturbation is socially beneficial because, given
R θH
  θL
     Q(θ)dθ > Q(θL ), society prefers to concentrate spending distortions on θ ∈ (θL , θH ]
compared to θL . Analogous perturbations apply to other instances of condition (ii):
   R θH
if θL Q(θ)dθ < Q(θL ), we perform a segment-shifting flattening perturbation where
                            R θH
we reduce g; if Q(θH ) 6= θL Q(θ)dθ, we construct segment-shifting steepening and
flattening perturbations where we keep the government welfare of type θL unchanged.


4.2    Monotonic Incentives
To further characterize the schedule of continuation values V (θ), and solve for the op-
timal rule in the next subsection, we make the following assumption:

Assumption 2. There exists b
                           θ ∈ Θ such that

                             f 0 (θ)     2−β
                           θ         > −          if θ < b
                                                         θ, and                       (21)
                             f (θ)       1−β
                               0
                             f (θ)       2−β
                           θ         < −          if θ > b
                                                         θ.                           (22)
                             f (θ)       1−β

    Assumption 2 states that Q(θ) is strictly decreasing for θ < b
                                                                 θ and strictly increasing
         b                            b
for θ > θ, with a minimum value Q(θ) ≤ Q(θ) < 0. Note that the assumption allows
for either of the inequalities in (21) or (22) to hold for all θ ∈ Θ; in this case b  θ is
defined as either the upper bound or the lower bound of the set Θ, respectively. As-
sumption 2 satisfies properties (i) and (ii) in Proposition 1 and holds for a broad range
of distributions, including the uniform, exponential, log-normal, and gamma distribu-
tions. This assumption is similar to, but stronger than, the distributional assumption
used in Amador, Werning, and Angeletos (2006); we will show in Subsection 4.4 that
Assumption 2 is necessary for our characterization of optimal self-enforcing rules.
    We maintain Assumption 2 for the remainder of our analysis. The next lemma shows
that, given the implied shape of Q(θ), optimal incentives are monotonic.

Lemma 3. In any solution to (11)-(15), V (θ) is weakly decreasing, left-continuous at
θ = θ, and right-continuous at θ = θ with V (θ) = V .

    Together with the bang-bang property established in Proposition 1, this lemma im-
plies that either the continuation value is at its maximum level V for all types θ ∈ Θ, or
it jumps down from V to V at some interior point θ ∈ Θ. The intuition for this result
is related to the shape of the Q(θ) function that tells us how society wishes to allocate

                                            18
spending distortions across types. If θ > b θ, society benefits from concentrating spending
distortions on relatively high types; this is achieved by using high-powered incentives
that punish high levels of spending by lowering the continuation value from V to V . In
contrast, if θ < bθ, society benefits from concentrating spending distortions on relatively
low types; this is achieved by using low-powered incentives that keep the continuation
value constant at V .
     The proof of Lemma 3 in the Appendix proceeds in three steps, which we briefly
summarize here. Step 1 shows that any interval with continuation value V must lie above
b
θ. To see why, note that the self-enforcement constraint requires that all types in the
interval spend flexibly. Then if Q0 (θ) < 0 for such types, we can perform an incentive
feasible flattening perturbation that rotates the spending schedule g(θ) clockwise; by
the logic in Step 1 in the proof of Proposition 1, this perturbation is socially beneficial.
Hence, we must have Q0 (θ) > 0, and by Assumption 2 the interval must lie above b       θ.
                                 ∗∗                        ∗∗     b
     Step 2 shows that if V (θ ) = V for some type θ ≥ θ, then V (θ) = V for all
θ ≥ θ∗∗ . Suppose by contradiction that V (θ) = V for some θ > θ∗∗ . Extending the
continuity result established in Proposition 1 to type θ yields that there exists an interval
[θL , θH ], θL > θ∗∗ , with V (θ) = V for all θ in the interval. However, if dg(θ)
                                                                                 dθ
                                                                                     > 0 for
θ ∈ [θL , θH ], we can perform an incentive feasible steepening perturbation that drills
a hole in the g(θ) schedule; by the logic in Step 1 in the proof of Proposition 1 and
Q0 (θ) > 0, this perturbation is socially beneficial. Moreover, if g(θ) is constant over
a stand-alone segment [θL , θH ], we can perform an incentive feasible segment-shifting
steepening perturbation that slightly reduces spending and changes the continuation
value so as to leave type θL equally well off; by the logic in Step 3 in the proof of
Proposition 1 and Q0 (θ) > 0, this perturbation is socially beneficial. Thus, a segment
[θL , θH ] with continuation value V and θL > θ∗∗ cannot exist, proving the claim.
     Given any type θ∗∗ as just defined, Step 3 completes the proof by showing that
θ∗∗ > θ. If this were not the case, we would have V (θ) = V for all types θ ∈ Θ.
However, a global perturbation that increases the continuation value for all types would
then be incentive feasible and strictly increase social welfare.


4.3    Optimal Self-Enforcing Fiscal Rule
The following proposition states the main result of the paper:

Proposition 2 (optimal self-enforcing fiscal rule). If {g (θ) , x (θ) , V (θ)}θ∈Θ is a so-
                                           
lution to (11)-(15), then there exist θ∗ ∈ 0, θ and finite θ∗∗ > max {θ∗ , θ} satisfying
(19)-(20). Hence, any optimal self-enforcing rule is a maximally enforced deficit limit.

    By Proposition 1 and Lemma 3, either all government types θ ∈ Θ receive the highest
continuation value V , or the continuation value jumps down from V to V at a point
θ∗∗ ∈ (θ, θ). To establish Proposition 2, we take θ∗∗ as given and solve for the optimal
allocation above and below this point. If θ ∈ (θ∗∗ , θ], the allocation is characterized by
the binding self-enforcement constraint with {g(θ), V (θ)} = {g f (θ), V }. If θ ∈ [θ, θ∗∗ ],
we show that the spending schedule g(θ) must be continuous, so the allocation takes
the form of bounded discretion. Since a minimum spending requirement would reduce
social welfare, a maximum spending limit g f (θ∗ ) is optimal for types in this range.
    The proof that g(θ) is continuous over [θ, θ∗∗ ] builds on perturbation arguments sim-
ilar to those used in the previous subsections. Given the absence of dynamic incentives,
                                                              
a discontinuity would entail a hole in some range θL , θH ; that is, g (θ) would jump
                                                           
at a point θM ∈ θL , θH such that types θ ∈ θL , θM spend at g f (θL ) < g f (θ) and
                     
types θ ∈ θM , θH spend at g f (θH ) > g f (θ). However, if θM < b  θ, an incentive feasible
                                                          L
perturbation that slightly closes the hole by raising θ strictly increases social welfare:
given Q0 (θ) < 0, the benefit of lowering spending for types right above θM outweighs the
                                                                                           
cost of raising spending for types right above θL . Moreover, if θM ≥ b    θ, then θM , θH
is a stand-alone segment over which g(θ) = g and Q0 (θ) > 0, and by the logic in Step 2
in the proof of Lemma 3, an incentive feasible segment-shifting steepening perturbation
strictly increases social welfare. It follows that g(θ) cannot be discontinuous below θ∗∗ .
    Proposition 2 proves that any optimal rule must be a maximally enforced deficit
limit, but it is silent on whether this limit is violated along the equilibrium path, that
                                                                
is, whether θ∗∗ < θ. To address this issue, define θe ∈ 0, θ as the threshold type
corresponding to the optimal deficit limit under perfect enforcement, as in the work of
Amador, Werning, and Angeletos (2006). Given Assumption 2, θe is the unique solution
to28                                   Z   θ
                                               Q(θ)dθ = 0.                               (23)
                                          θe

   Clearly, if a deficit limit associated with maximum spending rate g f (θe ) is self-
enforcing, then by Proposition 2 it is optimal:

Corollary 1. If

             θU (g f (θe )) + βW (xf (θe )) + βδV ≥ θU (g f (θ)) + βW (xf (θ)) + βδV ,   (24)

the unique solution to (11)-(15) is a maximally enforced deficit limit with θ∗ = θe and
θ∗∗ ≥ θ.
 28
      Note that Q(θ) = 1 for θ < θ.

                                                 20
    When condition (24) holds, the highest type θ, and therefore all types θ ∈ Θ, prefer to
respect the perfect-enforcement limit g f (θe ) and receive maximal reward V rather than
spend above the limit and receive maximal punishment V . The optimal self-enforcing
rule therefore coincides with that under perfect enforcement and features no dynamic
incentives.
    Our interest is in characterizing the optimal rule when condition (24) does not hold,
so the perfect-enforcement limit g f (θe ) is not self-enforcing. In this case, there exists
a unique type θb > θe corresponding to the tightest deficit limit that all types θ ∈ Θ
would respect:

          θU (g f (θb )) + βW (xf (θb )) + βδV = θU (g f (θ)) + βW (xf (θ)) + βδV .    (25)

The next proposition provides a necessary and sufficient condition for punishments to
be used along the equilibrium path when (24) is not satisfied:

Proposition 3 (use of punishment). Suppose (24) does not hold, i.e. the optimal deficit
limit under perfect enforcement is not self-enforcing. If
                                Z   θ              
                                        Q(θ) − Q(θ) dθ ≥ 0,                            (26)
                                  θb


the unique solution to (11)-(15) is a maximally enforced deficit limit with θ∗ = θb and
θ∗∗ = θ. Otherwise, the unique solution to (11)-(15) is a maximally enforced deficit limit
with θ∗ ∈ (θe , θb ) and θ∗∗ < θ.

    When the perfect-enforcement limit g f (θe ) is not self-enforcing, society faces the
following tradeoff. On the one hand, society can raise the value of θ∗ to the point
that the associated limit g f (θ∗ ) satisfies the self-enforcement constraint of type θ and
thus all types θ ∈ Θ. This option entails setting θ∗ = θb and θ∗∗ = θ and has the
benefit of avoiding socially costly punishments along the equilibrium path, albeit at the
cost of allowing significant overspending within the relaxed deficit limit. On the other
hand, society can impose a tighter deficit limit g f (θ∗ ) which does not satisfy the self-
enforcement constraint of all types. This option sets θ∗ < θb and θ∗∗ < θ and induces
higher discipline on types θ ≤ θ∗∗ , but at the cost of imposing punishments on path
whenever a shock θ > θ∗∗ is realized.
    Proposition 3 shows that which of these two options is optimal for society depends on
whether condition (26) holds or not. The intuition for this condition is familiar by now:
it tells us how society wishes to allocate spending distortions, and in particular whether

                                              21
society prefers to concentrate distortions on types θ ∈ [θb , θ) versus θ. A relaxed deficit
limit that avoids punishments concentrates distortions on θ ∈ [θb , θ), whereas tightening
the deficit limit by the use of punishments moves distortions towards θ.
    Taking feasible continuation values as given, condition (26) is determined by the
distribution of shocks and the government’s present bias. Specifically, (26) holds if
high shocks are relatively frequent (so f (θ) and thus −Q(θ) > 0 are high) and the
                                                   Rθ
government’s present bias is not too severe (so θb Q(θ)dθ < 0 is high). In this case—
which would arise, for example, if b
                                   θ = θ, such as under a uniform distribution of shocks—
imposing punishments on high types is very costly, and, moreover, society can satisfy
these types’ self-enforcement constraints without relaxing the deficit limit by much.
The optimal rule therefore sets a relaxed deficit limit that all types respect, namely
with θ∗ = θb and θ∗∗ = θ.
    In contrast, if high shocks are relatively rare and the government’s present bias is
severe, condition (26) does not hold. In this case—which would arise under b          θ < θ
and f (θ) close enough to zero—the cost of punishing high types is relatively low, and,
moreover, society would need to raise the limit g f (θ∗ ) significantly if it were to satisfy
the self-enforcement constraints of all types. Hence, it is optimal to set a tighter deficit
limit, and let a positive mass of government types θ ∈ (θ∗∗ , θ] violate the limit and
receive maximal punishment on the equilibrium path.29
    Given the properties of Q(θ), Proposition 3 shows that there exist a unique threshold
θ and associated θ∗∗ satisfying (20) that optimally resolve the tradeoff between imposing
  ∗

fiscal discipline and avoiding punishments on path. As a result, the deficit limit that
maximizes social welfare is unique.


4.4       Discussion of Distributional Assumption
The results in Subsection 4.3 show that Assumption 2 is sufficient to obtain the unique
optimality of maximally enforced deficit limits for any given continuation values {V , V }.
In this section, we explore the necessity of this distributional assumption for our findings.

Definition 2. Assumption 2 is weakly violated if there exist θL , θH ∈ Θ, θH > θL , and
∆ > 0 such that (i) Q0 (θ) ≥ 0 for θ ∈ [θL , θL +∆] and (ii) Q0 (θ) ≤ 0 for θ ∈ [θH −∆, θH ].
Assumption 2 is strictly violated if the inequalities in (i) and (ii) are strict.

       We find that both weak and strict violations of Assumption 2 would affect our results:
  29
    While Proposition 3 conditions on a given set of feasible continuation values [V , V ], one can derive
from this result sufficient conditions for punishment to occur or not along the equilibrium path regardless
of these values. See Subsection 5.2 for a discussion.

                                                    22
Proposition 4 (necessity of distributional assumption). If Assumption 2 is weakly
violated, then there exist continuation values {V , V } for which not every solution to
(11)-(15) is a maximally enforced deficit limit. Moreover, if Assumption 2 is strictly
violated, then there exist continuation values {V , V } for which no solution to (11)-(15)
is maximally enforced deficit limit.

    This proposition shows that Assumption 2 is not only sufficient but also necessary
for maximally enforced deficit limits to be uniquely optimal. In this sense, our analysis
imposes the minimal structure that guarantees the unique optimality of this class of
rules, which resemble fiscal rules commonly used in practice in the form of a deficit limit
or a spending or debt limit. Note that both weak and strict violations of Assumption 2
are possible even when Q(θ) satisfies properties (i) and (ii) in Proposition 1. Under
these violations, an optimal self-enforcing rule may thus feature bang-bang incentives
yet induce an allocation that would not be implementable by a deficit limit. We prove
the first part of Proposition 4 by construction and the second part by contradiction.30


5      Punishment and Dynamics
Section 4 characterized the optimal self-enforcing fiscal rule taking the set of feasible
continuation values as given. In this section, we complete our characterization by de-
scribing the allocations that underly the continuation values used in an optimal rule.


5.1     Worst Punishment
The worst punishment for the government, given by the continuation value V , deter-
mines the tightness of the self-enforcement constraints in (13). Moreover, as shown in
Proposition 3, this punishment is induced along the equilibrium path whenever the op-
timal deficit limit under perfect enforcement is not self-enforcing and condition (26) is
not satisfied. The next proposition describes the allocation underlying V , which solves
the program in (16).

  30
    As noted in Subsection 4.2, Assumption 2 is stronger than the distributional assumption used in
                                                                                     Rθ
Amador, Werning, and Angeletos (2006). Define θa as the lowest value such that θ Q(e      θ)deθ ≤ 0 for all
θ ≥ θa . Then using our notation and taking f (θ) to be differentiable, Amador, Werning, and Angeletos
(2006) assume Q0 (θ) ≤ 0 for all θ ≤ θa . One can verify that there are distributions F (θ) satisfying this
assumption for which Assumption 2 is strictly violated, and therefore for which there exist continuation
values {V , V } such that no solution to (11)-(15) is a maximally enforced deficit limit.

         p U (g (θ p )) + βW (x (θ p )) + βδV = θ p U (g (θ p )) + βW (x (θ p )) + βδV .


Hence, the worst punishment is a maximally enforced surplus limit. Moreover, the worst
punishment is unique.

    In the absence of self-enforcement constraints, the worst punishment would entail
forcing all government types to choose either the highest or the lowest feasible spending
rate so that the value V is minimized. However, such a harsh punishment would not be
self-enforcing. Proposition 5 shows that the worst punishment that is self-enforcing takes
the form of a maximally enforced surplus limit, associated with a minimum spending
rate g f (θ∗p ). Government types that respect the surplus limit by spending above g f (θ∗p )
are maximally rewarded with continuation value V ; government types that violate the
surplus limit by spending below g f (θ∗p ) are maximally punished with continuation value
V . Because a positive mass of types θ ≥ θ∗∗ p respect the limit, the equilibrium transitions
back to the allocation associated with value V with strictly positive probability.
    A maximally enforced surplus limit minimizes social welfare by incentivizing over-
spending. Intuitively, given a government type θ, there are two ways in which society
can induce low welfare: either by inducing spending below the first-best rate g f b (θ),
or by inducing spending above this rate. Since the government is biased towards over-
spending in the present, the latter relaxes self-enforcement constraints, and it is thus
a more efficient means of reducing welfare. As a result, in the worst-punishment al-
location, all types spend above their first-best rate, and in fact weakly above their
flexible rate. Moreover, consistent with Proposition 1, overspending is incentivized by
the use of bang-bang continuation values: society maximally rewards government types
that spend above the surplus limit and maximally punishes those that spend below the
limit.31 High-powered incentives allow society to maximize distortions.
    The proof of Proposition 5 follows from analogous arguments to those used to obtain
  31
    These features are related to the results of Bernheim, Ray, and Yeltekin (2015), who study self-
enforcing consumption rules in an environment without shocks or private information. They find that
the worst punishment takes the form of over-consumption followed by maximal reward.


                                                24
Proposition 2. The main difference, of course, is that instead of maximizing the social
welfare function in (18), the worst punishment minimizes this function. As a result, the
arguments that apply to types θ < b    θ when maximizing welfare—which make use of the
fact that Q (θ) in (18) is strictly decreasing in this region—instead apply to types θ > b
                                                                                         θ
when minimizing welfare—since −Q (θ) is strictly decreasing in this region. The same
is true with regards to the arguments that apply to types θ > b   θ in the maximization of
welfare, which now apply to types θ < b    θ in the minimization of welfare. This explains
why the worst punishment is a maximally enforced surplus limit while the optimal rule is
a maximally enforced deficit limit. One step that requires additional care is establishing
that the optimal surplus limit is indeed respected by some government types; that is,
the worst punishment is not an absorbing state with {g(θ), V (θ)} = {g f (θ), V } for all
θ ∈ Θ. We prove this by showing that a limit that is respected by types θ arbitrarily
close to θ achieves lower social welfare than assigning flexible spending and maximal
punishment to all types: the cost of increasing overspending outweighs the benefit of
increasing the continuation value for high enough types.

    The objective functions above are written using an analogous representation of social
welfare as in (18), except that we use the form of the optimal rules obtained in Proposi-
tion 2 and Proposition 5, and we take the reference type to be arbitrarily close to zero as



                                                                25
opposed to equal to θ.32 Similarly, the binding self-enforcement constraints for types θ∗∗
and θ∗∗ p under the optimal deficit limit and surplus limit, respectively, are written using
an analogous representation of government welfare as in (17). Programs (27) and (28)
show that the larger the difference between the maximal reward and the worst punish-
ment, (V − V ), the more society can relax self-enforcement constraints, which allows to
sustain a higher reward and a worse punishment. An optimal self-enforcing rule yields
the highest value of V and lowest value of V that solve this fixed point problem.33
     As discussed in Subsection 4.1, the optimal self-enforcing fiscal rule features a bang-
bang property, so that along the equilibrium path continuation values only travel to
extreme points in the feasible set [V , V ]. Given this bang-bang form, the dynamics
induced by the optimal rule depend on the tightness of self-enforcement constraints and
the distribution of shocks. By Corollary 1 and Proposition 3, if either the optimal deficit
limit under perfect enforcement is self-enforcing or condition (26) holds, the equilibrium
features no dynamics: the same deficit limit g f (θ∗ ) is imposed in every date. In contrast,
if the perfect-enforcement deficit limit is not self-enforcing and condition (26) does not
hold, Proposition 3 and Proposition 5 imply that the economy transitions in and out of
the best equilibrium associated with value V and the worst punishment associated with
value V . Starting from the initial period, the government is subject to a deficit limit
g f (θ∗ ). If the realized shock is θ ≤ θ∗∗ , the government respects the deficit limit and
the best equilibrium restarts in the second period; if the realized shock is θ > θ∗∗ , the
government violates the deficit limit and the equilibrium transitions to punishment in
the second period. Starting from a punishment period, the government is subject to a
surplus limit g f (θ∗p ). If the realized shock is θ ≥ θ∗∗
                                                        p , the government respects the surplus
limit and the equilibrium transitions to the best equilibrium in the next period; if the
realized shock is θ < θ∗∗   p , the government violates the surplus limit and the equilibrium
remains in punishment in the next period.
     The primitives of the model determine whether self-enforcement constraints bind and
condition (26) does not hold, as required for dynamic incentives to be provided to the
  32
    Noting that f (θ) = 0 (and thus Q(θ) = 1) for θ < θ and limθ↓0 {θU (g f (θ)) + δW (xf (θ))} = 0.

    The first-order conditions of programs (27) and (28) are intuitive. For example, suppose the perfect-
enforcement rule is not self-enforcing and (26) does not hold, so that by Proposition 3, θ∗∗ < θ in an
optimal self-enforcing rule. Then the first-order condition of (27) yields
                                     Z   θ ∗∗
                                                (Q(θ) − Q(θ∗∗ ))dθ = 0.
                                       θ∗

Analogous to (23) and (26), this condition says that an optimal maximally enforced deficit limit balances
spending distortions across government types: θ∗ and θ∗∗ are such that the average distortion on types
θ ∈ [θ∗ , θ∗∗ ) is weighted equally as that on type θ∗∗ .

government. Self-enforcement constraints will bind so long as the highest shock θ is suf-
ficiently extreme. Intuitively, as θ increases, the difference between type θ’s per-period
welfare from flexible spending, θU (g f (θ)) + βW (xf (θ)), and this type’s per-period wel-
fare from spending at the perfect-enforcement limit, θU (g f (θe )) + βW (xf (θe )), becomes
larger, and for high enough θ condition (24) cannot hold. Regarding (26), as discussed
in Subsection 4.3, it depends on the distribution of shocks and the government’s present
bias whether this condition holds for a given set of continuation values. In particular,
the condition will fail provided that −Q(θ) > 0 is low enough—which holds if high
shocks are unlikely—and β is low enough—which means that tight rules are not self-
enforcing under high shocks. For any continuation values {V , V } and parameter β < 1,
a sufficient condition for (26) to fail is that f (θ) approach zero as θ approaches θ.
    In sum, our analysis shows that the presence of shocks that are sufficiently extreme
and rare (relative to the government’s present bias) is a sufficient condition for pun-
ishments to occur along the equilibrium path. The optimal deficit limit under perfect
enforcement is not self-enforcing in this case, and society would have to set an excessively
lax deficit limit to ensure that the government always respects it. Instead, it is optimal
to impose a tighter limit which the government respects only under non-extreme shocks,
and to temporarily transition to maximal punishment when extreme shocks occur.


6     Concluding Remarks
This paper has studied the role of self-enforcement in determining the optimal structure
of fiscal rules. Under perfect enforcement, an optimal rule takes the form of a deficit
limit which is never breached in equilibrium. Under self-enforcement, an optimal rule
is a maximally enforced deficit limit, which, if violated, leads to the worst punishment
for the government. We established necessary and sufficient conditions under which the
government violates the deficit limit along the equilibrium path, following bad enough
shocks to the economy. In this case, the economy fluctuates between periods of reward—
with a maximally enforced deficit limit that constrains overspending—and periods of
punishment—with a maximally enforced surplus limit that incentivizes overspending.
The government enters a reward phase whenever it satisfies the imposed deficit or surplus
limit, and transitions into a punishment phase whenever it violates the limit. These
transitions ensure that both the maximally enforced deficit limit and the maximally
enforced surplus limit are self-enforcing.
    Our focus has been on a situation in which external enforcement is absent and the


                                            27
optimal fiscal rule under perfect enforcement is not self-enforcing. It is worth noting
that our analysis also applies to situations in which external enforcement is possible but
limited. Society may be able to impose sanctions on the government beyond those that
are self-enforcing, yet these may not be severe enough to guarantee perfect enforcement.
Our analysis in Section 4 applies to this case without change, taking V to be the harshest
possible punishment that society can impose. An optimal rule is a maximally enforced
deficit limit, which, if violated, leads to the worst punishment, including externally
enforced penalties. Provided that these penalties are sufficiently small, the perfect-
enforcement deficit limit may not be implementable, and punishments would arise along
the equilibrium path under the conditions derived in Section 4.
    We believe there are potentially interesting directions for future research. We would
like to explore in future work the extent of our bang-bang characterization in Proposi-
tion 1; as we have noted, our result does not rely on self-enforcement and may apply
to other models of repeated adverse selection. Another possible direction would be to
consider an extension of our model with more general time-inconsistent preferences. The
problem would change compared to our quasi-hyperbolic setting: while in our formu-
lation the preferences of the government regarding future policies coincide with those
of society, a government’s bias that extends to future periods would make the problem
closer to one of repeated delegation. Additionally, our setting can be enriched to con-
sider a group of countries or subnational regions subject to a common fiscal rule which
must be self-enforcing. The properties of an optimal common rule would depend on
governments’ self-enforcement constraints and the nature of collective punishments.
    Finally, while we have focused on fiscal policy, the insights of this paper may be
applied to other settings featuring a commitment-versus-flexibility tradeoff and self-
enforcement. For example, consider an individual who suffers from a self-control prob-
lem and establishes rules for himself to curb his consumption of a temptation good
such as television or alcohol. Such an individual values rules that impose discipline
on himself, but also benefits from having flexibility to increase his consumption of the
temptation good when he finds this consumption to be highly valuable. Furthermore,
in the absence of external enforcement, any rule the individual imposes on himself must
be self-enforcing. In this context, our results imply that an optimal rule takes the form
of a consumption threshold, which the individual may violate when his value of con-
sumption is high enough. Violation of the threshold leads to punishment in the form
of over-consumption. That is, to limit his consumption of the temptation good, the
individual would transition in and out of periods of self-enforcing binging.

A      Proofs
This Appendix contains the proofs of Proposition 1, Lemma 3, and Proposition 2. See
the Online Appendix for the remaining proofs and supplementary discussions.


A.1      Preliminaries
We describe two functions that we will use in our proofs.

Lemma 4. Given θL ≤ θM ≤ θH , define the functions
                                  Z   θM
                    L   M
                                                     
            L
           S (θ , θ ) =                       βθ − θL f (θ) dθ + (1 − β) θM f (θM )(θM − θL ),
                                    θL
                                  Z  θH              
         S H (θH , θM ) =                     βθ − θH f (θ)dθ + (1 − β) θM f (θM )(θH − θM ).
                                    θM


Then S L (θL , θM ) > 0 if Q0 (θ) < 0 for all θ ∈ (θL , θM ), S L (θL , θM ) < 0 if Q0 (θ) > 0 for
all θ ∈ (θL , θM ), S H (θH , θM ) > 0 if Q0 (θ) > 0 for all θ ∈ (θM , θH ), and S H (θH , θM ) < 0
if Q0 (θ) < 0 for all θ ∈ (θM , θH ).

Proof. Consider the claims about S L (θL , θM ). Note that S L (θ, θM )|θ=θM = 0, and hence
                  R θM L M )
S L (θL , θM ) = − θL dS (θ,θ
                         dθ
                              dθ. Moreover,

                                      Z      θM
             dS L (θ, θM )

                  dθ                     θ

           dS L (θ,θ M )                                                R θM R θM           θ,θM ) e
                                                                                    d2 S L (e
and thus        dθ
                         |θ=θM   = 0. Therefore, S L (θL , θM ) =        θL   θ             2     dθdθ,   where
                                                                                         dθe

Q (θ) > 0. The claims about S (θ , θ ) follow.
   The proof for the claims about S H (θH , θM ) is analogous and thus omitted.

                                                             33
A.2     Proof of Proposition 1
We proceed in three steps.

Step 1. We show that in any solution to (11)-(15), V (θ) is a step function and g(θ)
and V (θ) are left- or right-continuous at each θ ∈ (θ, θ].

    Note first that by the local private information constraints, V (θ) is piecewise con-
tinuously differentiable. Suppose by contradiction that V (θ) is not a step function.
Then there is an interval over which dVdθ(θ) exists and is not zero, and therefore a sub-
interval [θL , θH ] over which dVdθ(θ) is either strictly positive or strictly negative, with
V < V (θ) < V . By the private information constraint (12), g(θ) must be continuous
and strictly increasing over [θL , θH ]. By property (i) in Proposition 1, it suffices to
consider the following two cases:
Case 1: Suppose Q0 (θ) < 0 for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ]. We show that there exists an incen-
tive feasible flattening perturbation that rotates the increasing spending schedule g(θ)
clockwise over [θL , θH ] and strictly increases social welfare. Define
                                               Z    θH
                                   1
                              U= H                      U (g (θ)) dθ.
                                 θ − θL         θL


For given κ ∈ [0, 1], let ge (θ, κ) be the solution to

                              g (θ, κ)) = κU + (1 − κ) U (g (θ)) ,
                           U (e                                                                    (29)

                          e(θ, κ) = 1 − ge(θ, κ) and define Ve (θ, κ) as the solution to
which clearly exists. Let x

          g (θ, κ)) +βW (e

    The original allocation corresponds to κ = 0. We consider a perturbation where we
increase κ marginally above zero if and only if θ ∈ [θL , θH ]. Note that differentiating
(29) and (30) with respect to κ yields

Substituting (31) in (32) yields that for a type θ ∈ [θL , θH ], the change in government
welfare from a marginal increase in κ is equal to
                                                  Z   θ                  

                                                    θL


    We begin by showing that the perturbation satisfies constraints (12)-(15). For the
private information constraint (12), note that D(θL ) = D(θH ) = 0, so the perturbation
leaves the government welfare of types θL and θH (and that of types θ < θL and θ > θH )
unchanged. Using Lemma 2 and the representation in (17), it then follows from equation
(30) and the fact that ge(θ, κ) is nondecreasing that the perturbation satisfies constraint
(12) for all θ ∈ Θ and any κ ∈ [0, 1].
    To prove that the perturbation satisfies the self-enforcement constraint (13), we
show that the government welfare of types θ ∈ [θL , θH ] weakly rises when κ increases
marginally. Since D(θL ) = D(θH ) = 0, it is sufficient to show that D(θ) is concave over
(θL , θH ) to prove that D(θ) ≥ 0 for all θ in this interval. Indeed, we verify:

                                      D0 (θ) = U − U (g (θ)) ,
                                                             dg (θ)
                                      D00 (θ) = −U 0 (g (θ))        < 0.
                                                              dθ

    Lastly, observe that constraint (14) is satisfied by construction, and constraint (15)
is satisfied if κ > 0 is small enough. The latter claim follows from the fact that, by
assumption, V (θ) ∈ (V , V ) for θ ∈ [θL , θH ] in the original rule. Hence, for κ > 0 small
enough, there exist Ve (θ, κ) ∈ [V , V ] satisfying (29)-(30) for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ].
    We next show that the perturbation strictly increases social welfare. The change in
social welfare from an increase in κ is equal to
              Z        "                                                               #

Substituting with (31) and integrating, this expression simplifies to

                   β    θL


This is an integral over the product of two terms. The first term is strictly decreasing in θ
since g (θ) is strictly increasing over [θL , θH ]. The second term is also strictly decreasing
in θ; this follows from Q0 (θ) < 0 for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ]. Therefore, these two terms are
positively correlated with one another, and thus the change in social welfare is strictly
greater than
               Z   θH                             Z    θH

           β   θL                                     θL


which is equal to 0. It follows that the change in social welfare from the perturbation is
strictly positive. Hence, in any solution to (11)-(15), if V (θ) is continuous and Q0 (θ) < 0
over a given interval, then V 0 (θ) = 0 over the interval.
Case 2: Suppose Q0 (θ) > 0 for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ]. Recall that g(θ) is continuous and strictly
increasing over [θL , θH ]. We begin by showing that the self-enforcement constraint can-
not bind for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ]. Suppose it did. Using the representation of government
welfare in (17), this implies
                                     Z    θH
                                               (U (g f (e

                                                                   θ)))de
                                                                        θ=0                        (33)
                                      θ


for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ]. Note that the allocation must then satisfy {g(θ), V (θ)} = {g f (θ), V }
for all θ ∈ (θL , θH ): given g(θ) continuous, implicit differentiation of (33) with respect
to θ given (33) holding with equality implies g(θ) = g f (θ); given this, the binding self-
enforcement constraint yields V (θ) = V . However, this contradicts the assumption that
V (θ) ∈ (V , V ) for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ]. Hence, we obtain that the self-enforcement constraint
cannot bind for all types in the interval, and without loss we take the interval to be such
that this constraint is slack for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ].
    We show that there exists a steepening perturbation that is incentive feasible and
strictly increases social welfare. Specifically, consider drilling a hole around a type θM
within [θL , θH ] so that we marginally remove the allocation around this type. That is,
type θM can no longer choose g(θM ) and V (θM ) and is indifferent between jumping to
the lower or upper limit of the hole. With some abuse of notation, denote the limits of
the hole by θL and θH , where the perturbation marginally increases θH from θM . Since

                                                            36

                                        θM


Since Q0 (θ) > 0 for all θ ∈ [θM , θH ], Lemma 4 implies S H (θH , θM ) > 0, and thus the
perturbation strictly increases social welfare. Hence, in any solution to (11)-(15), if V (θ)
is continuous and Q0 (θ) > 0 over a given interval, then V 0 (θ) = 0 over the interval.

    It follows from Case 1 and Case 2 that V (θ) is a step function in any solution to
(11)-(15). We now show that in any such solution, g(θ) and V (θ) must be right- or
left-continuous at each θ ∈ (θ, θ]. Suppose by contradiction that this is not true at some

      0 < θ U (g(θ)) − U (g(θ− )) = β W (x(θ− )) + δV (θ− ) − W (x(θ)) − δV (θ) .

Given β ∈ (0, 1), this implies

           θ U (g(θ)) − U (g(θ− )) < W (x(θ− )) + δV (θ− ) − W (x(θ)) − δV (θ).

It follows that a perturbation that assigns {g(θ− ), V (θ− )} to type θ is incentive feasible,
strictly increases social welfare from type θ, and does not affect social welfare from types
other than θ. Hence, g(θ) and, by Lemma 2, V (θ) must be left- or right-continuous at
each θ ∈ (θ, θ].

                                                                    > 0, then V (θ) ∈ {V , V }.

    If dg(θ)
         dθ
             > 0 at some θ ∈ Θ, then g(θ) is continuous and strictly increasing over some
interval, call it [θL , θH ], which contains θ. By Step 1, V (θ) must be constant over the
interval at some value V ∈ [V , V ], which implies g(θ) = g f (θ) for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ]. We
                       
establish that V ∈ V , V . Suppose by contradiction that V < V < V . As in Step 1,
it suffices to consider the following two cases:
Case 1: Suppose Q0 (θ) < 0 for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ]. Then given V ∈ (V , V ), the arguments in
Case 1 of Step 1 above apply, implying that there exists an incentive feasible flattening
perturbation that rotates the spending schedule clockwise over [θL , θH ] and strictly
                                                             
increases social welfare. Therefore, we must have V (θ) ∈ V , V for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ].
Case 2: Suppose Q0 (θ) > 0 for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ]. Then given V ∈ (V , V ), the arguments in
Case 2 of Step 1 above apply, implying that there exists an incentive feasible steepening
perturbation that drills a hole in the spending schedule within [θL , θH ] and strictly
                                                             
increases social welfare. Therefore, we must have V (θ) ∈ V , V for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ].
                                                            dg(θ)
Step 3. We show that in any solution to (11)-(15), if        dθ
                                                                    = 0, then V (θ) ∈ {V , V }.

   Suppose by contradiction that dg(θ)
                                    dθ
                                       = 0 and V (θ) ∈ (V , V ) for some type θ ∈ Θ.
By Step 1 and Step 2, this type belongs to a stand-alone segment, call it [θL , θM ], such
that g(θ) = g and V (θ) = V for all θ ∈ [θL , θM ], for some g > 0 and V ∈ (V , V ),
and g(θ) jumps at each boundary unless θL = θ or θM = θ. Observe that the self-
enforcement constraint must be slack for all θ ∈ (θL , θM ). This follows from the fact
that the spending rate and the continuation value are constant over [θL , θM ]. Hence, if


                                              38
(13) were to hold as an equality at some θ0 ∈ (θL , θM ), this constraint would be violated
for either θ ∈ [θL , θ0 ) or θ ∈ (θ0 , θM ].
    We show that there exists an incentive feasible perturbation that strictly increases
social welfare. We consider segment-shifting steepening and flattening perturbations
that marginally change the constant spending rate by dg ≶ 0 and change V so as to
keep unchanged the government welfare of either type θL or type θM . As we describe
next, which perturbation within this class we perform depends on the shape of the
function Q(θ) over [θL , θM ].
                                                               R θM            R θM
    Using condition (ii) in Proposition 1, suppose first that θL Q(θM )dθ < θL Q(θ)dθ.
Then we consider a perturbation that marginally changes the spending rate by dg < 0
and keeps type θL equally well off. This means that dV  dg
                                                            is given by

                                                          dV
                              − θL U 0 (g) − βW 0 (x) + βδ    = 0,                          (37)
                                                           dg

where x = 1 − g. Note that this perturbation reduces θM , in the sense that the highest
types in [θL , θM ], arbitrarily close to θM , will now jump up to a higher allocation. This
higher allocation is the allocation over which type θM was initially indifferent if θM < θ
and such an allocation satisfies self-enforcement constraints; otherwise, we let the per-
turbation introduce these allocations (which will satisfy private information constraints,
and will involve flexible spending and maximal punishment if the self-enforcement con-
straint of θM is binding in the original allocation). Calling the allocation to which type
θM jumps up the allocation of type θH , the indifference condition of θM is

           θM U (g) + βW (x) + βδV = θM U (g(θH )) + βW (x(θH )) + βδV (θH ).

To verify feasibility, note that the self-enforcement constraint is slack for all θ ∈ (θL , θM ),
V ∈ (V , V ), and the government welfare of types θL and θM remains unchanged with
the perturbation. Hence, the perturbation is feasible for dg arbitrarily close to zero.
   The change in social welfare due to the perturbation is equal to
                        Z   θM                                  

Substituting with (37) and the indifference condition of type θM yields that the change

Differentiating the indifference condition of type θM and substituting with (37) yields
                                                                

Substituting back into (38) and dividing by                                           β

By the assumption that θL Q(θM )dθ < θL Q(θ)dθ, the above expression is strictly
positive, implying that the perturbation strictly increases social welfare.
   We can perform analogous perturbations in the other instances of condition (ii)
                         R θM                R θM
in Proposition 1. If θL Q(θM )dθ > θL Q(θ)dθ, we consider a perturbation that
marginally changes the spending rate by dg > 0 and keeps type θL equally well off.
Arguments analogous to those above imply that the perturbation is incentive feasible.
Moreover, one can verify that the change in social welfare from the perturbation is given
                                                               R θM             R θM
by S L (θL , θM ), which is strictly positive in this case. If θL Q(θM )dθ = θL Q(θ)dθ,
                                           R θM             R θM
then by condition (ii) we must have θL Q(θL )dθ 6= θL Q(θ)dθ. We then consider
perturbations that marginally change the spending rate by dg ≶ 0 and keep type θM
equally well off. Arguments analogous to those above imply that these perturbation are
incentive feasible. Moreover, one can verify that the implied change in social welfare is
given by either S H (θM , θL ) or −S H (θM , θL ), depending on the sign of dg, where

social welfare in this case.


A.3     Proof of Lemma 3
Step 1. We show that in any solution to (11)-(15), if V (θ∗∗ ) = V , then θ∗∗ ≥ b
                                                                                θ.

     By Proposition 1, if V (θ∗∗ ) = V for some θ∗∗ ∈ Θ, then V (θ) = V over an interval
[θL , θH ] that contains θ∗∗ . We establish that θL ≥ b θ. Suppose by contradiction that
θ < b
 L
        θ. Note that the self-enforcement constraint (13) requires g(θ) = g f (θ) for all
θ ∈ [θL , θH ]. Then we can perform a flattening perturbation that rotates the spending
schedule clockwise over a subset of [θL , θH ] that contains type θL and is below b
                                                                                  θ, analo-
gous to the perturbation used in Step 2 in the proof of Proposition 1. By the arguments
in that step, this perturbation is incentive feasible. Moreover, since Q0 (θ) < 0 for all
types θ in the subset (by the subset being below b  θ and Assumption 2), the perturbation
strictly increases social welfare. It follows that θL ≥ b
                                                        θ, proving the claim in this step.

Step 2. We show that in any solution to (11)-(15), if V (θ∗∗ ) = V , then V (θ) = V for
all θ ≥ θ∗∗ .

    Suppose by contradiction that V (θ∗∗ ) = V for some θ∗∗ ∈ Θ and V (θ) > V for some
θ > θ∗∗ . By Step 1, θ∗∗ ≥ b  θ. We first show that there exist θH > θL > θ∗∗ such that
V (θ) = V for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ]. Suppose this is not true. Then by the contradiction
assumption and Proposition 1, V (θ) must jump up at θ. However, this contradicts the
claim in Step 1 in the proof of Proposition 1 that V (θ) is left-continuous at θ. Therefore,
given Proposition 1 and the contradiction assumption, we must have θH > θL > θ∗∗ such
that V (θ) = V for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ].
    We next establish that g(θ) = g for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ] and some g > 0. Suppose by
contradiction that dg(θ)
                     dθ
                         > 0 for some type θ ∈ [θL , θH ]. Note that the private information
constraint (12) implies g(θ) = g f (θ) in the neighborhood of such a type θ. Then we
can perform an incentive feasible steepening perturbation in this neighborhood as that
described in Step 1 in the proof of Proposition 1, which drills a hole in the spending
schedule g(θ). By the arguments in that step, this perturbation strictly increases social
welfare. It follows that dg(θ)
                          dθ
                               = 0 for any θ > θ∗∗ such that V (θ) = V .
    Finally, we show that a segment [θL , θH ] with V (θ) = V and g(θ) = g > 0 for all
θ ∈ [θL , θH ] and θL > θ∗∗ cannot exist. Consider the closest such segment to θ∗∗ , so
that θL is the lowest point above θ∗∗ at which the continuation value jumps from V to
V . Take θH to be the lowest point above θL at which g(θ) jumps, or take θH = θ if g(θ)
does not jump above θL . Then [θL , θH ] is a stand-alone segment with constant spending

                                            41
g and continuation value V = V . Moreover, note that g > g f (θL ); this follows from
Lemma 2 given the jump in continuation value at θL . There are two cases to consider.
                                                                            R θH
Case 1: Suppose g < g f (θH ). Note that by θL > θ∗∗ ≥ b θ and Assumption 2, θL Q(θ)dθ >
R θH
 θL
     Q(θL )dθ. Moreover, given g f (θH ) > g > g f (θL ), we can perform an incentive fea-
sible segment-shifting steepening perturbation analogous to that in Step 3 in the proof
of Proposition 1; this perturbation marginally reduces g and lowers V so as to keep
the government welfare of type θL unchanged while letting type θH jump to a higher
spending rate. By the arguments in that step, this perturbation strictly increases social
welfare, contradicting the assumption that g < g f (θH ).
Case 2: Suppose g ≥ g f (θH ). Then Lemma 2 requires θH = θ, as the private information
constraint would be violated if g(θ) ≥ g f (θH ) jumps up and V (θ) weakly decreases
at θH . Note that since the self-enforcement constraint (13) is satisfied for θ = θL
and g ≥ g f (θH ), this constraint must hold as a strict inequality for all θ ∈ (θL , θH ].
Then we can perform an incentive feasible segment-shifting steepening perturbation
that marginally reduces g and lowers V so as to keep the government welfare of type
θL unchanged, like that in Case 1 above, except that in this case θH needs not jump to
a higher spending rate. Using the representation in (18), the change in social welfare
from the perturbation is equal to
                                            Z   θH
                                       0

                                             θL


which is strictly positive given θL ≥ b
                                      θ and Assumption 2. This contradicts the assump-
                    H
tion that g ≥ g f (θ ).

    Case 1 and Case 2 imply that a segment [θL , θH ] with V (θ) = V and g(θ) = g > 0
for all θ ∈ [θL , θH ] and θL > θ∗∗ cannot exist, completing the proof of this step.

Step 3. We show that in any solution to (11)-(15), V (θ) is right-continuous at θ with
V (θ) = V .

    By the previous steps and Proposition 1, if V (θ) = V for some θ ∈ Θ, then there
exists θ∗∗ ∈ Θ such that V (θ) = V for all θ > θ∗∗ and, if θ∗∗ > θ, V (θ) = V for all θ ∈
(θ, θ∗∗ ). We begin by establishing that indeed θ∗∗ > θ. Suppose by contradiction that
θ∗∗ = θ and thus V (θ) = V for all θ ∈ (θ, θ]. Then the self-enforcement constraint (13)
implies g(θ) = g f (θ) for all θ ∈ (θ, θ]. Consider an incentive feasible global perturbation
that assigns V (θ) = V to all θ ∈ [θ, θ] and assigns type θ the limiting allocation to

                                                42
its right. This perturbation is incentive feasible and strictly increases social welfare,
contradicting the assumption that θ∗∗ = θ.
    Given θ∗∗ > θ, we complete the proof by showing that V (θ) = V . Suppose by
contradiction that V (θ) < V . By the claims above, this implies that the continuation
value jumps up from V (θ) to V at θ. By Lemma 2, the private information constraint at
θ requires limθ↓θ g(θ) > g f (θ). Moreover, the private information constraint for higher
types requires that there exist θL > θ such that g(θ) = g f (θL ) and V (θ) = V for
all θ ∈ (θ, θL ]. Then we can perform an incentive feasible global perturbation that
assigns types θ ∈ [θ, θL ] the allocation {g(θ), V (θ)} = {g f (θ), V }. Since g f (θ) > g f b (θ)
and θU (g(θ)) + W (x(θ)) is strictly concave, this perturbation strictly increases social
welfare. It follows that we must have V (θ) = V in any solution to (11)-(15).


A.4      Proof of Proposition 2
By Proposition 1, Lemma 3, and the self-enforcement constraint (13), in any solution
to (11)-(15), there exists θ∗∗ > 0 such that {g(θ), V (θ)} = {g f (θ), V } for all θ > θ∗∗ and
V (θ) = V for all θ < θ∗∗ (where it is possible that θ∗∗ > θ). Moreover, by the same
logic as in the last paragraph of Step 1 in the proof of Proposition 1, V (θ∗∗ ) = V (with
g(θ∗∗ ) < g f (θ∗∗ )) in any such solution. Since the self-enforcement constraint holds with
equality at θ∗∗ , it follows that

     θ∗∗ U (g(θ∗∗ )) + βW (x(θ∗∗ )) + βδV = θ∗∗ U (g f (θ∗∗ )) + βW (xf (θ∗∗ )) + βδV .       (41)

This characterizes the allocation for θ ≥ θ∗∗ . To characterize the allocation for θ < θ∗∗ ,
we first establish that g(θ) is continuous over [θ, θ∗∗ ]. Recall from the proof of Lemma 3
that θ∗∗ ≥ bθ. There are two cases to consider:
Case 1: Suppose by contradiction that g(θ) has a point of discontinuity below b
                                                                              θ: there is
a type θM < b
            θ which is indifferent between choosing lim g(θ) and lim g(θ) > lim g(θ).
                                                          θ↑θM            θ↓θM         θ↑θM
Note that given V (θ) = V for all θ ∈ [θ, θ∗∗ ] and θ ≥ b ∗∗
                                                            θ, there must be a hole with
types θ ∈ [θ , θ ) bunched at g f (θ ) and types θ ∈ (θ , θH ] bunched at g f (θH ), for
              L M                      L                  M

some θL < θM < θH . Now consider perturbing the rule by marginally increasing θL ,
in an effort to slightly close the hole. This perturbation leaves the government welfare
of types strictly above θM unchanged and is clearly incentive feasible. The change in




                                               43
social welfare from the perturbation is equal to
                                      Z    θM
                        dg f (θL )                                               
                                                θU 0 (g f (θL )) − W 0 (xf (θL )) f (θ) dθ

                                                                         
        +      L
                 θ U (g  (θ )) − U (g  (θ ))   + W (x (θ )) − W (x (θ ))   f (θM ).
            dθ

By the definition of g f (θL ), we have θL U 0 (g f (θL )) = βW 0 (xf (θL )), and by indifference
of type θM (with V (θ) constant over [θ, b θ)), we have

                  θM U (g f (θL )) + βW (xf (θL )) = θM U (g f (θH )) + βW (xf (θH )).        (42)

Substituting these into the expression above yields that the change in social welfare due
to the perturbation is equal to

                                                                                L
Note that differentiating the indifference condition (42) with respect to θ (and substi-
tuting again with θL U 0 (g f (θL )) = βW 0 (xf (θL ))) yields

                       dθM   dg f (θL ) 0 f L              (θM − θL )
                           =           U (g (θ ))                               .
                       dθL     dθL                U (g f (θH )) − U (g f (θL ))
                                                                        f   L
Substituting this back into (43) and dividing by β1 dgdθ(θL ) U 0 (g f (θL )) > 0, we find that
the change in social welfare takes the same sign as
                                 Z   θM
                   L   M
                                                  

            S (θ , θ ) =                   βθ − θL f (θ) dθ + (1 − β) θM f (θM )(θM − θL ).
                                 θL


By θM < b   θ, Assumption 2, and Lemma 4, S L (θL , θM ) > 0. Thus, the perturbation
strictly increases social welfare, showing that g(θ) cannot jump at a point below b
                                                                                  θ.
Case 2: Suppose by contradiction that g(θ) is discontinuous at a point θ ∈ [b   θ, θ∗∗ ]. Note
that since V (θ) = V for all θ ∈ [b
                                  θ, θ∗∗ ], we can apply the same logic as in Step 2 in the
proof of Lemma 3 to show that dg(θ) dθ
                                         = 0 over any continuous interval in [b θ, θ∗∗ ]. Now
using the arguments in Case 1 above, this means that if g(θ) jumps at a point in [b     θ, θ∗∗ ],
then there exists a stand-alone segment with constant spending in [b     θ, θ∗∗ ]. However,
using again the arguments in Step 2 in the proof of Lemma 3, we can then show that
there exists an incentive feasible segment-shifting steepening perturbation that strictly

                                                          44
increases social welfare. Thus, g(θ) cannot jump at a point θ ∈ [b
                                                                 θ, θ∗∗ ].

    Case 1 and Case 2 imply that g(θ) is continuous over [θ, θ∗∗ ]. It follows that the
allocation over this range must be bounded discretion with either a minimum spending
rate or a maximum spending rate or both. The arguments in Step 3 in the proof of
Lemma 3 imply that a minimum spending rate is suboptimal, and Lemma 2 implies
g(θ∗∗ ) = g f (θ∗ ) for g f (θ∗ ) < g f (θ∗∗ ) which satisfies (41).
    To complete the proof, we now show that θ∗ < θ, so the maximum spending rate
binds for types θ ∈ (θ∗ , θ]. Suppose by contradiction that this is not the case, meaning
that {g(θ), V (θ)} = {g f (θ), V } for all θ ∈ Θ. Consider an incentive feasible perturbation
which assigns {g(θ), V (θ)} = {g f (θ − ε), V } for all θ ∈ [θ − ε, θ], where ε > 0 is
chosen to be small enough as to continue to satisfy the self-enforcement constraint (13)
for all types. Using the representation in (18), the change in social welfare from this
perturbation is equal to
                           Z   θ
                                   (U (g f (θ − ε)) − U (g f (θ)))Q(θ).
                             θ−ε


Since g f (θ − ε) < g f (θ) and Q(θ) < 0 for all θ ∈ (θ − ε, θ) given ε > 0 arbitrarily small,
the perturbation strictly increases social welfare.

B      Supplementary Appendix for Online Publication
B.1     Proof of Lemma 1
We begin by proving necessity. Conditional on a public history ht−1 , type θt can choose
to follow the equilibrium strategy associated with (ht−1 , θ0t ) from t onward for any θ0t 6=
θt , instead of that associated with (ht−1 , θt ). This provides immediate spending rate
gt (θt−1 , θ0t ) and continuation value Vt+1 (θt−1 , θ0t ). Condition (9) is necessary for any such
unobservable deviation to be weakly dominated. In addition, conditional on a public
history ht−1 , type θt can choose spending rate g f (θt ). In equilibrium, this leads to a
continuation value V 0 associated with public history {ht−1 , g f (θt )}. By definition of V ,
the continuation value V 0 weakly exceeds V . Thus, condition (10) is necessary for a
deviation to g f (θt ) to be weakly dominated.
     To establish sufficiency, take a spending sequence that satisfies (9) and (10). We con-
struct equilibrium strategies as follows. Consider a public history along the equilibrium
path in which ht−1 corresponds to a positive probability realization of the spending
sequence. Given θt , the government chooses the level of spending associated with a
history of shocks θt under the spending sequence. If instead ht−2 corresponds to a pos-
itive probability realization of the spending sequence, but {ht−2 , gt−1 } does not, then
the government follows the continuation strategy associated with continuation value V .
Condition (9) implies that any unobservable deviation is weakly dominated, and con-
dition (10) implies that any observable deviation is weakly dominated. Therefore, the
spending sequence is supported by these equilibrium strategies.


B.2     Proof of Proposition 3
Assume that (24) does not hold. We begin with some preliminaries.
   For a given threshold θ0 , denote by b(θ0 ) the type exceeding θ0 at which (20) holds:

 b(θ0 )U (g f (θ0 )) + βW (xf (θ0 )) + βδV = b(θ0 )U (g f (b(θ0 ))) + βW (xf (b(θ0 ))) + βδV . (44)

Note that for any θ0 , b(θ0 ) > θ0 is uniquely defined, with b0 (θ0 ) > 0. By the definition of
a maximally enforced deficit limit in Definition 1, b(θ∗ ) = θ∗∗ , and by the definition of
θb in equation (25), b(θb ) = θ.
    Consider a maximally enforced deficit limit with threshold θ0 and associated b(θ0 ).
Under such a limit, types θ ∈ [θ0 , b(θ0 )] are bunched at the flexible spending rate of θ0 and
receive the maximal reward V , whereas types θ > b(θ0 ) spend at their flexible rate and


                                                46
receive the maximal punishment V . We will consider a perturbation where we marginally
reduce the threshold θ0 and let type b(θ0 ), whose self-enforcement constraint initially
holds with equality, jump up to a spending rate g f (b(θ0 )) with maximal punishment V .
The change in social welfare from this perturbation is equal to:
                                                Z       b(θ0 )

                                                   b(θ0 )U (g f (θ0 )) + W (xf (θ0 )) + δV

By the definition of g f (θ0 ), we have θ0 U 0 (g f (θ0 )) = βW 0 (xf (θ0 )). Substituting with this
and type b(θ0 )’s binding self-enforcement constraint (44) yields

Note that differentiating the indifference condition (44) with respect to θ0 (and substi-
tuting again with θ0 U 0 (g f (θ0 )) = βW 0 (xf (θ0 ))) yields

   The following auxiliary lemmas will be useful to prove the proposition.

Lemma 5. Suppose (24) does not hold. Any solution to (11)-(15) is a maximally
enforced deficit limit with θ∗ ≤ θb .

Proof. By Proposition 2, all we need to prove is that any optimal deficit limit sets a
threshold θ∗ ≤ θb . Suppose by contradiction that an optimal deficit limit sets θ∗ > θb .
Consider a perturbation where we reduce this threshold marginally. Note that the self-
enforcement constraint is satisfied for all θ ∈ Θ given a limit θ∗ > θb ; that is, b(θ∗ ) > θ.
Thus, substituting with f (θ) = 0 for all θ > θ in (45), the change in social welfare from
this perturbation is equal to
                                                                                     Z                 

                                                                                                     θ∗
                                             −           U (g (θ ))                               θ−      f (θ)dθ.                      (50)

Analogous to the derivation in (47), note that
                                                  Z   θ              Z           θ

 θ∗
      θ − θβ f (θ) dθ < 0. Since dgdθ(θ∗ ) U 0 (g f (θ∗ )) > 0, we obtain from (50) that the
perturbation strictly increases social welfare. The claim follows.


Lemma 6. Suppose (24) does not hold and consider a maximally enforced deficit limit
with threshold θ0 ≤ θb and associated b(θ0 ). If M (θ0 ) = 0 and b(θ0 ) ≥ b
                                                                          θ, then M 0 (θ0 ) > 0.
                                                    f    0
Proof. Using (48) and the fact that β1 dgdθ(θ0 ) U 0 (g f (θ0 )) > 0, the condition M (θ0 ) = 0
implies
                          Z b(θ0 )
                                   (Q(b(θ0 )) − Q(θ)) dθ = 0.
                                     θ0

By b(θ0 ) ≥ b θ, Q(b(θ0 )) < 0. Given Assumption 2, the above equality therefore requires
R b(θ0 )
 θ0
         Q(θ)dθ < 0 and Q(θ0 ) > Q(b(θ0 )). Moreover, substituting the above equality in
(49), we obtain

                     1 dg f (θ0 ) 0 f 0
       M 0 (θ0 ) =               U (g (θ )) [Q(θ0 ) − Q(b(θ0 )) + Q0 (b(θ0 ))b0 (θ0 )(b(θ0 ) − θ0 )] .
                     β dθ0
           f   0
Since β1 dgdθ(θ0 ) U 0 (g f (θ0 )) > 0, Q(θ0 ) > Q(b(θ0 )) (as just established), and Q0 (b(θ0 )) > 0
(by b(θ0 ) ≥ b  θ), it follows that M 0 (θ0 ) > 0.

     We now proceed to prove the claims in the proposition. Suppose first that condition
(26) holds. Suppose by contradiction that an optimal deficit limit sets θ∗ < θb and thus
θ∗∗ = b(θ∗ ) < θ. Since this is an interior optimum, the first-order condition M (θ∗ ) = 0
must be satisfied, and by the proof of Lemma 3, θ∗∗ ≥ b    θ. Hence, it follows from Lemma 6
         0 ∗
that M (θ ) > 0. Now note that by condition (26), M (θb ) ≤ 0, that is, a perturbation
that marginally decreases the threshold from θb weakly reduces social welfare. Since
M (θ∗ ) = 0, M 0 (θ∗ ) > 0, and M (θ) is continuous, it follows that there must exist a point
θ0 , with θ∗ < θ0 ≤ θb , such that M (θ0 ) = 0 and M 0 (θ0 ) ≤ 0. However, given M (θ0 ) = 0
and b(θ0 ) > θ∗∗ ≥ b   θ, Lemma 6 implies M 0 (θ0 ) > 0, a contradiction. It follows that a
deficit limit with θ∗ < θb cannot be optimal. Moreover, by Lemma 5, a deficit limit with
θ∗ > θb cannot be optimal either, and thus the unique optimal rule is a deficit limit with
threshold θ∗ = θb .
     Suppose next that condition (26) does not hold. Then M (θb ) > 0, which means that
a perturbation that marginally decreases the threshold from θb strictly increases social
welfare. It follows that an optimal deficit limit cannot set θ∗ = θb , and by Lemma 5,

                                                        49
an optimal deficit limit must set θ∗ < θb . Moreover, by Lemma 6, such an optimum
must be unique. The reason is that any interior optimum must satisfy the first-order
condition M (θ∗ ) = 0. Given M (θ) continuous, the existence of multiple optima would
then require the existence of a point θ0 with M (θ0 ) = 0 and M 0 (θ0 ) ≤ 0, contradicting
Lemma 6.
   Finally, we show that if (26) does not hold, the unique solution θ∗ < θb must satisfy
θ∗ > θe . Note that θe is defined by equation (23), which implies Q(θe ) > 0 and, for
                   R θ0                                                 R b(θ∗ )
any θ0 ∈ (θe , θ), θe Q(θ)dθ > 0. It follows that if θ∗ < θe , then θ∗ Q(θ)dθ > 0.
Now if θ∗ < θe < θb , the first-order condition M (θ∗ ) = 0 must be satisfied, and by the
proof of Lemma 3, b(θ∗ ) ≥ b θ. However, as shown in the proof of Lemma 6 above, these
                    R b(θ∗ )
conditions require θ∗ Q(θ)dθ < 0, yielding a contradiction. We conclude that θ∗ < θe
cannot hold.


B.3     Proof of Proposition 4
Let θL , θH ∈ Θ and ∆ > 0 be defined as in Definition 2. We prove the proposition by
proving the following three claims.

Claim 1. If Assumption 2 is strictly violated and a maximally enforced deficit limit
{θ∗ , θ∗∗ } is a solution to (11)-(15) for given values {V , V }, then θ∗ ≤ θL and θ∗∗ ≥ θH .
Proof of Claim 1. Suppose Assumption 2 is strictly violated. Suppose by contradiction
that a maximally enforced deficit limit with θ∗ > θL is a solution to (11)-(15). Then
analogous to Step 1 in the proof of Proposition 1, consider a perturbation that drills
a hole in the spending schedule in the range [θL , θL + ε] for arbitrarily small ε > 0
                         
satisfying θL + ε < min θ∗ , θL + ∆ . This perturbation is incentive feasible. Moreover,
since Q(θ) is strictly increasing in this range, the arguments in Step 1 in the proof of
Proposition 1 imply that this perturbation strictly increases social welfare. It follows
that θ∗ > θL cannot hold and we must have θ∗ ≤ θL .
    Next, suppose by contradiction that a maximally enforced deficit limit with θ∗∗ < θH
is a solution to (11)-(15). Then consider a perturbation of the allocation for types
                                                                       
θ ∈ [θH − ε, θH ] for arbitrarily small ε > 0 satisfying θH − ε > max θ∗∗ , θH − ∆ . The
perturbation assigns these types a constant spending rate gb and continuation value Vb so
as to leave the government welfare of types θH −ε and θH unchanged. This perturbation
is incentive feasible, and we can show that it strictly increases social welfare. Since the
self-enforcement constraint (13) binds for types θH − ε and θH under the original and



                                             50
thus the perturbed allocation, the representation of government welfare in (17) implies
                                   Z   θH
                                                g ) − U (g f (θ)))dθ = 0.
                                            (U (b                                           (51)
                                       H
                                   θ −ε


Using the representation in (18), the change in social welfare from the perturbation is
equal to
                             Z H
                           1 θ
                                       g ) − U (g f (θ)))Q(θ)dθ.
                                   (U (b                                           (52)

                                                                g ) − U (g f (θ)) is strictly
This is an integral over the product of two terms. Note that U (b
decreasing in θ and Q(θ) is also strictly decreasing in θ over the range [θH − ε, θH ].
Hence, the two terms are positively correlated with one another, which implies that the
change in social welfare is strictly greater than
                          Z   θH                              Z   θH
                                                    f
                                       g ) − U (g (θ)))dθ
                                   (U (b                                Q(θ)dθ,             (53)
                           θH −ε                                θH −ε


which equals zero by (51). It follows that the perturbation strictly increases social
welfare; therefore, θ∗∗ < θH cannot hold and we must have θ∗∗ ≥ θH .

Claim 2. Suppose Assumption 2 is strictly violated. There exist continuation values
{V , V } for which no solution to (11)-(15) is a maximally enforced deficit limit.
Proof of Claim 2. Suppose Assumption 2 is strictly violated. By Claim 1, if a maximally
enforced deficit limit {θ∗ , θ∗∗ } solves (11)-(15), then θ∗ ≤ θL and θ∗∗ ≥ θH . Consider the
indifference condition (20) which defines, for any given θ∗ , a unique value of θ∗∗ > θ∗ .
This condition shows that (θ∗∗ −θ∗ ) is continuous in (V −V ) and approaches 0 as (V −V )
goes to 0. It follows that there exists Λ > 0 such that if (V − V ) < Λ, then (θ∗∗ − θ∗ )
is small enough that θ∗ ≤ θL < θH ≤ θ∗∗ cannot hold. Thus, if the continuation values
{V , V } satisfy (V − V ) < Λ, a maximally enforced deficit limit is not a solution to
(11)-(15).

Claim 3. Suppose Assumption 2 is weakly violated. There exist continuation values
{V , V } for which not every solution to (11)-(15) is a maximally enforced deficit limit.
Proof of Claim 3. Suppose Assumption 2 is weakly violated and a maximally enforced
deficit limit {θ∗ , θ∗∗ } is a solution to (11)-(15). Then {θ∗ , θ∗∗ } satisfy condition (20) and
analogous arguments as in the proof of Claim 2 above imply that there exist continuation
values {V , V } such that θ∗ ≤ θL < θH ≤ θ∗∗ cannot hold. This means that given such
continuation values, any maximally enforced deficit limit {θ∗ , θ∗∗ } solving (11)-(15) must

                                                     51
have either θ∗ > θL or θ∗∗ < θH (or both). Suppose first that θ∗ > θL . Then consider a
perturbation as in the proof of Claim 1 above which drills a hole in the range [θL , θL + ε]
                                                     
for arbitrarily small ε > 0 satisfying θL + ε < min θ∗ , θL + ∆ . The same arguments as
in the proof of Claim 1, given Q0 (θ) ≥ 0 for θ ∈ [θL , θL + ε], imply that this perturbation
weakly increases social welfare. The resulting allocation is therefore a solution to (11)-
(15), and it is not a maximally enforced deficit limit.
    Suppose next that θ∗∗ < θH . Then consider a perturbation as in the proof of Claim
1 above which modifies the allocation for types θ ∈ [θH − ε, θH ] for arbitrarily small
                                  
ε > 0 satisfying θH − ε > max θ∗∗ , θH − ∆ . The perturbation assigns these types a
constant spending rate gb and continuation value Vb so as to leave the government welfare
of types θH − ε and θH unchanged. The same arguments as in the proof of Claim 1,
given Q0 (θ) ≤ 0 for θ ∈ [θH − ε, θH ], imply that this perturbation weakly increases social
welfare. The resulting allocation is therefore a solution to (11)-(15), and it is not a
maximally enforced deficit limit.


B.4     Proof of Proposition 5
The proof of this proposition is analogous to the proof of Proposition 2, with the unique-
ness claim following from the same logic as in the proof of Proposition 3. We therefore
describe this proof only briefly here, focusing on the steps that are different from those
in the previous proofs.
    Observe first that Proposition 1 applies when solving the program in (16), by the
same arguments as when solving the program in (11). The reason is that perturbations
that apply whenever Q0 (θ) > 0 in the maximization of social welfare will now apply
whenever Q0 (θ) < 0 in the minimization of social welfare, and vice versa.
    The analog of Lemma 3 also holds: in any solution to (16), V (θ) is weakly increasing,
right-continuous at θ = θ, and left-continuous at θ = θ with V (θ) = V . Steps 1-3 of the
proof of Lemma 3 are isomorphic in the sense that the arguments applying to types θ < b   θ
now apply to types θ > b θ, and vice versa. However, there are two notable modifications
to the proof of this lemma; we describe them next.
    The first modification involves Case 2 in Step 2 in the proof of Lemma 3. In that case,
we take a segment [θL , θH ] with θH = θ and perform a segment-shifting perturbation
that marginally reduces g and lowers V so as to keep the government welfare of type
θL unchanged. In contrast, we would now take a segment [θL , θH ] with θL = θ and
perform a segment-shifting perturbation that marginally increases g and lowers V so as
to keep the government welfare of type θH unchanged. Note that using the logic of the


                                             52
representation in (18) but with reference type θ instead of θ, we can write social welfare
(normalized by debt) as
                                                              Z       θ
                 1                                 1
                   θU (g(θ)) + W (x(θ)) + δV (θ) +                        U (g(θ))Qp (θ)dθ,    (54)
                 β                                 β              θ


where
                                Qp (θ) = Q(θ) − 2(1 − F (θ)).                                  (55)

Using this representation, the change in social welfare from the perturbation is equal to
                                              Z   θH
                                        0
                                      U (g)            Qp (θ)dθ.
                                              θL


Since Qp (θ) < 0 for all θ ∈ Θ, it follows that the perturbation strictly reduces social
welfare. This contradicts the assumption that the original allocation would solve (16).
    The second modification concerns an argument in Step 3 in the proof of Lemma 3.
In that argument, we rule out the possibility that V (θ) = V for all θ ∈ Θ in a solution
to (11). We can show that this possibility cannot arise in a solution to (16) either,
although the argument is different. To show this here, suppose by contradiction that
V (θ) = V for all θ ∈ Θ in a solution to (16). The self-enforcement constraint (13) then
implies g(θ) = g f (θ) for all θ ∈ Θ. Moreover, given the representation in (18), social
welfare equals
                                                              Z       θ
                 1                                  1
                   θU (g f (θ)) + W (xf (θ)) + δV +                       U (g f (θ))Q(θ)dθ.   (56)
                 β                                  β          θ


Consider a global perturbation in which all types θ ∈ Θ are assigned the allocation
corresponding to a maximally enforced surplus limit {θ∗p , θ∗∗                ∗∗            ∗∗
                                                                   p } with θ p > θ and Q(θ p ) <
0 (and θ∗∗
         p ’s self-enforcement constraint binding given the flexible allocation of θ p , as
                                                                                             ∗

defined in Proposition 5). Note that Q(θ∗∗         p ) < 0 is feasible since Q(θ) < 0. Under
this construction, Q(θ) < 0 for all θ ≥ θ∗∗         p by Assumption 2. Using an analogous
representation to (56) and taking into account that the perturbation keeps type θ’s
allocation unchanged, we find that the change in social welfare from the perturbation is
equal to
                            Z θ∗p
                                  (U (g f (θ∗p )) − U (g f (θ))Q(θ)dθ.                        (57)
                               θ∗∗
                                p


Since g f (θ∗p ) > g f (θ) and Q(θ) < 0 for all θ ∈ [θ∗∗    ∗
                                                      p , θ p ], it follows that the perturbation




                                                  53
strictly reduces social welfare. Therefore, the original allocation with V (θ) = V for all
θ ∈ Θ is not a solution to (16).
    Given Proposition 1 and the analog of Lemma 3 as described above, the next step is
to show that g(θ) is continuous for θ ≥ θ∗∗p . Here analogous arguments to those in the
proof of Proposition 2 apply. The optimality of a binding minimum spending limit then
also follows from analogous arguments as in that proof, with the exception that we now
appeal to the representation of social welfare in (54). Finally, uniqueness of the optimal
limit follows from analogous logic as in the proof of Proposition 3.


B.5     Sufficient Conditions for V > V
Our analysis in Section 4 takes the set of feasible continuation values [V , V ] as given
and assumes V > V . The following lemma provides a sufficient condition under which
this inequality is satisfied and thus continuation values can be used as reward and
punishment to discipline the government. This condition amounts to the discount factor
being sufficiently high, or the government’s present bias being sufficiently severe, so the
current government places a high enough value on restraining future public spending.
We maintain Assumption 2 for this result.
Lemma 7. Suppose δ > b
                     δ, where b
                              δ≡                1
                                              1−Q(b
                                                  θ)
                                                       ∈ (0, 1). Then V > V .

Proof. Take δ > b   δ and suppose by contradiction that V = V . Then by the self-
enforcement constraint (13), in equilibrium the government chooses its flexible spending
rate at all dates, that is, g(θ) = g f (θ) and V (θ) = V = V for all θ ∈ Θ. Using the
representation of social welfare in (18), this yields
                                                                Z                        !
                                                                     θ
                  1                                  1
            V =     θU (g f (θ)) + W (xf (θ)) + δV +                     U (g f (θ))Q(θ)dθ .      (58)
                  β                                  β           θ


Given this value of V , and for a given threshold θ∗∗ ∈ (θ, θ) and ε ≥ 0, let us construct
an equilibrium with the following allocation:
                              ( 
                                    min{g f (θ), g f (θ∗∗ − ε)}, V (θ∗∗ , ε)       if θ ≤ θ∗∗ ,
          {g (θ) , V (θ)} =                       f                                              (59)
                                                   g (θ), V                        if θ > θ∗∗ ,

where

θ∗∗ U (g f (θ∗∗ −ε))+βW (xf (θ∗∗ −ε))+βδV (θ∗∗ , ε)−θ∗∗ U (g f (θ∗∗ ))−βW (xf (θ∗∗ ))−βδV = 0
                                                                                          (60)

                                                  54
and V (θ∗∗ , ε) is the corresponding social welfare:

                1                                                                   
V (θ∗∗ , ε) =     θU min g f (θ), g f (θ∗∗ − ε) + W max xf (θ), xf (θ∗∗ − ε) + δV (θ∗∗ , ε)

                +                           Rθ                                            . (61)
                  β                                  f
                                          + ∗∗ U g (θ) Q (θ) dθ
                                            θ


    The system (58)-(61) corresponds to an equilibrium under a maximally enforced
deficit limit, associated with maximum spending rate g f (θ∗∗ − ε). Government types
θ ≤ θ∗∗ abide to the limit and receive continuation value V (θ∗∗ , ε) (associated with
restarting the equilibrium in the next period), whereas types θ > θ∗∗ spend at their
flexible rate and receive continuation value V (associated with choosing the flexible
spending rate at all future dates).
    For any θ∗∗ , the system admits a solution with ε = 0, in which case V (θ∗∗ , ε) = V .
Suppose the system also admitted a solution with ε > 0 for some θ∗∗ ∈ (θ, θ). In this
case, equation (60) would imply V (θ∗∗ , ε) > V . Moreover, since the system (58)-(61) is
incentive feasible and satisfies (12)-(15), this would imply V ≥ V (θ∗∗ , ε) > V , yielding
the contradiction that we are seeking. To prove the claim, we therefore proceed by
showing that the system (58)-(61) admits a solution with ε > 0 for some θ∗∗ ∈ (θ, θ).
There are two cases to consider.
Case 1: Suppose b θ > θ. Choose θ∗∗ = b    θ. A given ε ≥ 0 yields (58), (59), and (61).
To establish the existence of a solution with some ε > 0, we must thus verify that the
left-hand side of (60) equals 0 for such a value. Note that the left-hand side of (60)
equals 0 for ε = 0, is strictly negative for ε sufficiently close to b
                                                                     θ, and is continuous in
ε. It follows that, if the left-hand side of (60) is positive for ε > 0 arbitrarily close to
0, then there exists ε > 0 for which the left-hand side of (60) equals 0. Consider the
derivative of the left-hand side of (60) with respect to ε (where we have substituted
with θ∗∗ = bθ and used the fact that g f (θ) = θ/[θ + βδE [θ] /(1 − δ)]):
                                           Z                                                 !

This derivative equals 0 at ε = 0. Consider the second derivative of the left-hand side

where the inequality follows from δ > bδ and Q(b  θ) ≤ Q(θ) = −θf (θ)(1 − β) < 0.
   By (62) and (63), the left-hand side of (60) achieves a local minimum at ε = 0. This
implies that the left-hand side of (60) is positive for ε > 0 arbitrarily close to 0, which
completes the argument.
Case 2: Suppose b  θ = θ. Choose θ∗∗ = bθ + υ for some υ > 0 which can be taken to be
arbitrarily small. Then the same steps as in Case 1 apply, where the condition analogous
to (63) for small enough υ holds given δ > b  δ and the continuity of Q(θ). The claim
follows.
