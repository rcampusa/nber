         GOVERNMENT SOLVENCY, PONZI FINANCE AND THE REDUNDANCY
                     AND USEFULNESS OF PUBLIC DEBT


                                            ABSTRACT


       We investigate how the ability of the government to depart from budget balance and issue

debt expands the set of equilibria that can be supported using lump-sum tax-transfer instnirnents. We

show how this depends on the restrictions that exist on the capacity to tax and make transfer

payments, and what these restrictions imply for the government's ability to issue debt.

       Central to our analysis is the defmition of solvency for an infinite-lived government in an

infinite-lived economy with overlapping generations of finite-lived households. Our specification is

derived from the demand for public debt by private agents and the non-negativity constraints on the

capital stock and on private consumption by all generations. Under fairly tight restrictions on the

government's tax-transfer menu, our solvency constraint implies the conventional solvency constraint.

       With unrestricted taxes and transfers Ponzi finance is always possible but 'inessential": it

does not expand the set of equilibria that can be supported. Ponzi finance can be "essential" when

taxes and transfers are restricted. The paper establishes a number of results that demonstrate how the

government's ability to issue debt allows restricted tax-transfer schemes to support all equilibria

attainable using unresiricted taxes and transfers.

 (I) INTRODUCTION.
      Does the ability of the government to depart from budget balance and issue or
retire debt expand or alter the set of equilibria that can be supported? We address
this question for the case in which fiscal policy, involving, in addition to borrowing,
the use of lump—sum taxes and transfers only, can be used for redistribution and
insurance among heterogeneous households 1• Heterogeneity is introduced using an
OLG model without private intergenerational gifts2.
      The answer turns out to depend crucially on the richness of the set of
lump—sum tax—transfer instruments available and on the restrictions that this implies
for the government's ability to issue debt. Central to the argument is our solvency
constraint for an infinite—lived government3 in an infinite—lived economy with
overlapping generations of finite—lived households. The government is solvent if its
budgetary and financing policies are feasible currently and in all future periods. In
our model, government solvency is expressed as a set of three inequality constraints
on admissible sequences of taxes, transfers, public debt and exhaustive public
spending. They are derived from the requirement that the capital stock and private
consumption by each generation be non—negative in each period. In other words,
solvency for the infinite—lived government is derived from the (well—understood)
requirement of solvency (or non—bankruptcy) for each finite—lived household.
     Consider economies in which the long—run real interest rate is above the
long—run growth rate of efficiency labor. Under fairly tight restrictions on the ability
of the government to use taxes and transfers freely, our solvency constraint implies
the conventional solvency constraint, that the sequence of real public debt discounted
at the real interest rate converges to zero. The first sufficient condition is that net
transfer payments by the government to a generation during a period cannot change
sign (from positive when young to negative when old) over that generation's life
                                                                                               2




cycle. The second sufficient condition is that the long—run growth rate of transfers
to the young and taxes on the old is less than the long—run interest rate. If, for
instance, taxes and transfers cannot grow faster in the long run than efficiency labor,
or equivalently, if the ratio of taxes paid (transfers received) during a period by a
generation to the value of the physical resources owned by it, is bounded, the second
sufficient condition would be met.
     Under less restrictive conditions on taxes and transfers, Ponzi finance may be
possible, regardless of the relationship between the long—run real interest rate and the
long—run real growth rate, and   regar&ess   of whether the economy is dynamically
efficient or Pareto—efficient. We distinguish between        essential   Pouzi finance, that
is Ponzi schemes that expand     the   set of equilibria for consumption and           capital

formation that can   be   supported, and     inessential   Ponzi finance that does not
have any real effects. The same essential—inessential distinction is made for
public debt as such- Whether or not public debt (Ponzi finance) is essential

depends on the restrictions imposed on the government's ability to use taxes

and transfers.

     We establish three equivalence results'. The first states that with

unrestricted time— and age—specific taxes and transfers, the ability to depart

from budget balance does not permit additional equilibria to be supported.
Specifically,    any intergenerational redistribution and insurance that              can be
provided with government borrowing or lending can also be provided with a

balanced government budget.

     The second states that, if there are restrictions on the government's

ability to levy   age—specific taxes and       make age—specific transfers during any

given   period, then the option of unbalancing the budget enhances the set of
equilibria   that can be supported. Specifically, if the government is

constrained to have only age—independent taxes and transfers, the ability to
                                                                                              3




unbalance      the budget permits the government to support all the equilibria that
can    be   supported with unrestricted age—specific taxes and transfers.
       This second   proposition will not in general hold if the conventional

government solvency constraint is imposed, and requires our less restrictive

solvency constraint in order to be valid. Essential Ponzi finance

characterizes the age—independent tax—transfer policies.

        Our third equivalence proposition is that even rather severe restrictions

on the variation of taxes and transfers over the lifetime of a generation do

not restrict the equilibria that can be supported, provided unbalanced budgets

are permitted. This result holds under the conventional solvency constraint

and does not require Ponzi finance.

       The substitution of government borrowing for current lump—sum         taxes     (and

such   further future changes in lump—sum taxes, transfers and borrowing as may
be required to preserve government       solvency) will affect the equilibrium of an

economy if it redistributes resources among private agents with different

marginal propensities to spend. In the Samuelson [l9S8 overlapping

generations (OLC) model used in our paper, there is heterogeneity between

generations. Typically, postponing taxation through borrowing or

redistributing directly from the young to the old will reduce aggregate

saving. Such "financial crowding out" has been a central theme of

macroeconomics.

       Alternative government financing policies not only effect redistribution

among generations, in a stochastic environment they will also permit trades

across states of nature or intergenerational insurance. There is by now quite

a rich literature on this subject. Such intergenerational redistribution schemes

as   social security taxes and retirement benefits can provide insurance that either
cannot be provided by the market or is provided ineffidently5. OLC models have
                                                                                      4



incomplete    market participation. Because individual households cannot enter

into insurance contracts before they are born, there may be incomplete

risk—sharing    (Blanchard and Veil [1992]). Even in a dynamically.efficient
economy, the public provision of this insurance can have implications for
Pareto-efficiency (see Zilcha [1990] and Blanchard and Veil [1992fl.6
        Rather than investigating the many interesting positive and welfare aspects
of intergenerational redistribution and of the provision of intergenerational
insurance through the government budget (see e.g. Fischer (1983), Enders and
Lapan [1982], Stiglitz (1983], Merton (19841, Gordon and Varian (1988), Pagano
[1988] and Gale [1990]), we shall focus on the equivalence results, on the
implications of our definition of government solvency, on the conditions under
which   Ponzi finance is possible and on the role of Pouzi finance.

     The outline of the rest of this paper is as follows. Section II develops

the model. Section III introduces our government solvency constraint, relates

it to the conventional solvency constraint and discusses what it implies for

the scope for Ponzi finance. Section IV contains our three equivalence

results and analyzes how they depend on the ability of the government to

engage in Ponzi finance. Section V concludes.

      The conventional government solvency constraint, given in (111.3)

requires    the discounted public debt to vanish in the long run for any realization
of the discounted debt sequence.

     The solvency condition (111.3) has the prima facie attractive property of

implying the same kind of present value or intertemporal budget constraint

(111.4) for the infinite horizon case as for the finite horizon case. If

t—1+T is the finite terminal period, then the standard (and uncontroversial)

government    solvency constraint is p 1+Tbt+T 0 (the government doesn't owe
anything    at the end of the last period). A rational household sector ensures

that Pt_1+Tbt+T     0. From (111.1) these two weak inequalities imply, that the

value of the current stock of debt is equal to the (expectation of) the

present    discounted value of future primary           (non—interest) surpluses. This is

the same as (111.4), with jim dropped. The imposition of (111.3) has been

quasi—automatic in moden macroeconomic analysis. For a very small sample see

Barro [1979] ,   Buiter    [1985] ,   Pagano [1988] and     Blanchard et. al. [1990]. It
has been the subject of extensive empirical testing (see e.g. Hamilton and

Flavin [1986J, Wilcox [1989], Corsetti [1990], Grilli [1990) and Buiter and Patel
[1991]).

     We    believe that the analogy with the finite—horizon case is potentially

misleading. It is by no means obvious what are, in an economy without a

terminal date, the feasible debt strategies of an infinite—lived government
                                                                                                   9




facing an infinite sequence of finite—lived overlapping generations (see e.g.

Shell [1971] and Vilson [1981]). As we shall see, without a—priori

restrictions       on taxes and transfers, our model has a surprising range of
feasible debt strategies, many of which allow for Ponzi finance. Formally,
Ponzi    finance can be       defined   as follows for our model:



Definition 1: Pouzi finance.

         The   government engages in Ponzi finance if
(IlLS)                 ptBt+i                 (1   + rt)pjB for all t 0.         16




       The     government engages in Ponzi finance if, in each period, t, the value
of the debt carried into the next period, t+1, is at least as large as the
cost   of servicing the debt carried into period t.                 From the government's
single—period      budget identity it follows, that a government engages in Ponzi

finance if         —
                       (rLt   +                    0 for all t,   that   is, if it never runs a

primary (non—interest) budget surplus.

       In Section IV we are also interested in sequences of new debt minus old

debt service, {ptBt+j         —
                                  (1   + r)plB}T0 that,            while not themselves Ponzi

schemes, possess infinite subsequences                            — (1   + r)pt_jBJ....o    that
                                                         22                 2232
are Ponzi schemes.

       Ye proceed by investigating what kind of constraints the model of Section

II imposes on the government's ability to issue debt. Equation (11.8),

stating that the savings of the young in period t                  equal the sum of the capital
stock and      the value of the stock of government debt carried into period t+1,

can be    rearranged as equation (111.6)
(111.6)                PtBt+l +    rLt=
                                          —
                                              Ktl       [w —   4]Lt
                                                                                                     10




        Equation (II.3b) (holding with equality), stating that the old consume

 all their after—tax resources, can be arranged as equation (111.7)

 (111.7)                  (14.rti)ptBti —     rL1 = _(1+pt+i)Kt+i cL       +

        It    is immediately obvious from (111.6) that, for given Kt÷i,               Wv
                                                                                               and
      the     value of the public debt issued in period t, PtBt÷i              can   be made
 arbitrarily large (positive or negative) by making matching large (positive or
negative)      period t transfers to the young, _rLt. Such an arbitrarily large

 (positive or negative) value of PtBt+i is consistent with equation (111.7) for

given   r+1. Kt+j,               4 and L2,    as long as period ti-I taxes on the old, rLt

are assigned a matching large (positive or negative value).

        Since 4 and              are non—negative, the constraint on public debt implied

by (111.6) is ptBt+l +                             There also is a lower bound on the

amount of public debt that can be issued (or an upper bound on the stock of

public credit to the private sector). It follows from non—negativity of

consumption by the old in period t. From the resource constraint

Kti —          = wL   +          — 4L    —
                                             c1L1        —
                                                             Gt   and c1   0   it follows that
(Vt   — 4)L      —    + (1   +
                                 P)Kt

                                            Kt+i   0 .       From (111.6) this implies
          +          Ct —    (l+pt)Kt
        These upper and lower bounds on the public debt in each period, together

with the requirement that exhaustive public spending cannot be negative and

cannot exceed the total physical resources available in any period, constitute

our definition of feasible fiscal policy. A solvent government is a

government whose fiscal policy is feasible in a world with rational private

agents'7.
                                                                                 11




Definition   2: Covernient solvency.
     A government is solvent if and only if its debt, taxes, transfer payments
     and exhaustive spending satisfy, for all t 0
     (IlL8a)                       ptBt+l + rLt wiLt
     or, equivalently
     (!IL8a')                      (1+r)p1_1B1 —   r_jLt_1 wL —
     arid

     (IIL8b)                       p1B1 + rL1
     or, equivalently,
     (11L8b')                      (1+rt)pt,B_ r 1L1
     Equations (JILSa and b) plus non—negativity of G imply:
     (iIL8c)                       0 G wL +          (1+pt)Kg
     Note that this definition of solvency can be generalized easily to all

OLG models with finite household horizons. It relies only on the reasonable

postulate that in the last period of its life, each household disposes of all

real and financial assets (including public debt) and pays off any debts it

has carried into that period and does not purchase any new assets or incur any

new debt.

     Since the government solvency constraint is derived from the requirement

that 4,     c1   and X ? 0 for all t    0, another way of interpreting it is that

the government refrains from policies that will bankrupt the private sector:

it does not select sequences for taxes, transfer payments, debt and exhaustive

spending that will cause the non—negativity constraints on consumption by both

generations and on the capital stock to become binding'8.

     The solvency conditions (III.Sa and b') can be rewritten as

(III.9a)           PtBt+t +   rLt    {f(kt) —    ktf'(k)]Ot(1+n)t
                              —
(III.9b')                         (l+r)pt   Bt   [1+f'(k)]kt9t(1+n)t
                                                                                                    12




        Equation (III.Oa) implies that the long—nm growth rate of the total

 resource      transfer from the young generation to the government (whether through
purchases by the young of government debt or through taxes on the young)
 cannot      exceed the long—run growth rate of efficiency labor. Note that there

 is no constraint on ptBt+i or rLt separately, only on their sum.

        Equation (III.Db') implies that the long—run growth rate of the total

resource transfer from the old generation to the government (whether through

explicit       taxes on the old or through the servicing of debt to the government
incurred by the old) cannot exceed the long—run growth rate of efficiency
labor.       Note that there is no constraint on                       or (l+rt)ptiB
separately, only on their sum.

        If the long—nm interest rate exceeds the long—run growth rate of

efficiency labor (urn At9(1+n)t =                  0)   then the solvency constraints


(III.8a and b) imply

                           lim    inf        {At[ptBti + rLtJ} <   0
                           V-'tt i'(t<m
                           lim sup           {At[ptBt+i + rLt]} 0,
                           t'-t   t'(t(cz,
        If   the   limit    inferior and the       limit   superior are the same, we get

(111.10)                                                = lim [riLti —                        =

        Note   how this differs from the conventional solvency constraint

lint AtPtBt+i =      0.      Equation (111.10) states that the present discounted value
t4tD

of the total resource transfer from the young to the government and                     the

present discounted value of the total resource transfer from the old to the
government should converge to zero. Without further restrictions on 4                         and

         equation    (111.10) does not constrain the behavior of the public debt or
the    public credit in the long run.

 Ponzi   finance with unrestricted taxes and transfers: a siMple ezaaple.
      As a simple illustration of the kind of borrowing policies that are

feasible with unrestricted taxes and transfers, consider the deterministic

version of our model with a logarithmic utility function,

however,   is, for well—how life—cycle reasons, not a function of the present

discounted value of life—time resources alone. We can rewrite (111.13) as

follows:
                                                                   2           2

     The young of period t will demand more financial assets, cet. par., if

they expect to have to pay a larger tax                                when they are old, regardless of

the present discounted value of their life—time resources. The demand for

saving by the young depends on the actual distribution of disposable

(after—tax) resources over the lifetime. They will save more while young if
                                                                                                                   14




the distribution of lifetime disposable resources is skewed towards youth. If

the government has the ability to tax the members of any given generation

differently when they are young than when they are old, it can influence the

savings behavior of the young and with it the demand for its debt. By raising

                                                                      r2

government can       raise   saving by the young by any       affecting           amount without

consumption by the young or the old (or the demand for capital as a productive
input). The government can therefore increase its debt without bound.
Consider two euilibria, the single—star equilibrium and the double—star
equilibrium.     Assume that (111.14) holds for all t                                  0, and that   the initial

equilibria are identical.

      Thus, by choosing appropriately growing values for Et, t                                     0, (that is
values such that                   > (1÷nr'(l+rt)), we                     can     raise the growth rate of

public debt in any period to any level. Since the                                   present discounted value of
                                                                                       15




 lifetime    taxes is the same in the single star and the double star equilibrium,

 the equilibrium private consumption sequences are the same, and so will be the

wage rate, capital stock, interest rate and debt price sequences. By making a

 larger transfer to the young of generation t, the government provides the

young with the means for increasing their saving. By levying a larger tax on

that same generation         when old, the government provides the young with an
 incentive     to   save in order to pay these higher taxes.

       Since    ifl      =

                                 Lt —
we note that when aPonzi game is played (/c > (14n11(1+rt)), the total

tax on the young, r Lt, will ultimately become negative and increasingly
large in absolute value, while the tax on the old, r'Lti, will become an

increasingly large positive number. Ye will therefore see the lifetime

pattern of taxes becoming one of ever increasing receipts of transfer payments

when   young and ever increasing tax payments when         old. The lifetime pattern

of taxes therefore has to change sign        or zig—zag.
       It   is obvious that this property generalizes to any finite household

horizon OLG model: what is required is that in the last period of a

household's life, the government be able to recoup in present value terms the

non—balanced budget component of what it has transferred to the household in

the   earlier periods of its life.
       Another way of interpreting this is that the debt can grow without bound
(and at a rate higher than the interest rate) without affecting the
equilibrium allocations for consumption and the capital stock, because        the

government     can, effectively, tax the debt held by the old to pay for the
servicing of the debt held by the old. Government debt held by the old
increases the "base" on which lump—sum taxes on the old can be levied 20•
McCallum [1984] , made       this point in the context of an infinite—lived

representative   agent model 21(see also Bohn [1991]). Spaventa [1987, 1988]

also emphasizes the distinction between models in which only endowments can be

taxed   (such as Pagano [1988])      and models   in which interest income too is
taxable. He, however, does not make the distinction between taxes on the
young, taxes on the old and aggregate taxes. As we shall see below, aggregate

taxes can be zero, and therefore less than the endowment (wage income) and
less that the sum of the endowment and interest income, while the debt grows
at a rate at least equal to the rate of interest forever.

       The same point can be    made slightly more generally by considering the

Case     1: Unrestricted age— and ti.e—contingent taxes and transfers.
         When there are no restrictions, other than those implied by

(III8.a and       b) on taxes and    transfers,     we can   establish the following result.


Proposition       1.

         With   unrestricted age—, time— and state—contingent taxes and transfers,

         any equilibrium for consumption by the young and the old and for the

and rb_i. No matter what value is assigned to r1 '                 can always be

assigned a large enough negative value to ensure that (111.22) is satisfied:

the debt grows at least as fast as the rate of interest.

     From the single—period government budget identity, it follows that

(III.21a) and (III.21b) are the same constraint. No matter what value is

assigned to r4t, •a value can be assigned to              that ensures that

(III.21a,b) are satisfied for any values of rr, rn, bt,                    b4
and bt+i .0

     Another way of putting this is that, by increasing _r**Lt for any given

values of rtiLti and          and for any inherited value of (l+r)piBt ,           it   is

Corollary.
        With unrestricted taxes and transfers, the competitive equihbriurrt model
        with the finite—lived OLG household sector does not require any bounds on the
        level or rate of rowth of public debt. Ponzi finance is therefore always possible,
        regardless of the relationship between the interest rate and the growth rate,
        regardless of whether the economy is dynamically efficient and regardless of
        whether the economy is Pareto—efficient.


Case 2: Restrictions on differences in taxes and transfers in any period for
overlapping      generations.

Three    interesting restrictions fitting this category come to mind.

        (a) Equal taxes or transfers per generation for all generations alive

     daring      any given period.
      In this case r(1÷n) =       for all t 0. In Section (IV) we show that
this restriction does not bite. The long—run growth rate of the debt (over
2—period intervals) equals the interest rate, even when the            interest rate is
above    the growth rate of efficiency     labor. Such Ponzi finance subsequences
are "essential": without them the restrictions on taxes and transfers would
affect the equilibria that can be supported.
        (b)   Equal per capita taxes or transfers for all     generations alive during
     any given period.
     In this case 4               for all t 0. In Section (IV) we show that this
restriction too does not bite. The long—run growth rate            of the debt (over 2

period intervals) equals the sum of the interest rate and the growth rate of
the labor force. Essential Ponzi finance subsequences therefore play a role
whenever the growth rate of the labor force is non—negative.
                                                                                             21




       (c) Equal taxes per unit of efficiency labor for all generations alive

       during any given period.

       In this case         =               for all t    0. In Section (IV) we also show
                                (1+wt)r_i
this restriction to be toothless. The long—run growth rate of the debt (over

2—period intervals) is the sum of the interest rate and the growth rate of

efficiency labor. Such Ponzi finance subsequences are essential.

       What drives these results is that even though the two generations (the

young and    the   old) alive in    any given   period are treated in the same way

during   that period, we can still vary taxes and transfers freely over the
life—cycle   of each generation, making transfer payments to them while young

and   taxing them when old.


Case 3: Restrictions on variations in taxes and transfers over its lifeti.e
for any given generation.
       The most interesting restriction is that net taxes in each of the two

periods of a household's life must have the same sign, that is

                   =
                       t4       A   0 for all t ? 0.

       We need just one of the weak inequalities of the solvency constraint in

order to show that, under this restriction, Ponzi finance is possible only if

the interest rate is below the growth rate of efficiency labor. Consider

equations (III.8a) and (III.Ba'), rewritten for this case as

                                                    —
(III.23a) PtRt+l        [f(kt) —      ktf'(kt)]OtLt 4Lt
                                                                          +           —
(III.23b) (1+rti)pB+i               [f(kti) — kt+if'(kt+i)]Ot+iLt+i           AtrLt       ct+i
       From (III.23a), the only way for the debt to grow faster than the growth

rate of efficiency labor forever, is for 4              to   be negative and for —4   to   grow

at a rate higher than the growth rate of labor productivity. If the debt

grows faster than the growth rate of efficiency labor forever, (III.23b) can
                                                                                            22




only    be satisfied if AtrLt is positive and has a growth rate higher than the

growth rate of efficiency labor. That is impossible since At .             0.   Ve

conclude that —r can grow no faster than the growth rate of labor

productivity and that the growth rate of the debt can therefore be no higher

than the growth rate of efficiency labor. The debt can therefore grow faster

than the interest rate forever only if the interest rate is below the growth

rate of efficiency labor.

        Note that Case 3 includes quite a variety of fiscal rules, including per

capita taxes (or transfers) constant across generations at a point in time,

and growing    over time at a constant proportional rate u, that         is 4 =         =

   = r0(l+v)'    for   all t ? 0. Note that our argument       implies that v   cannot be
permanently    higher that the growth rate of labor productivity.

        Blanchard and Veil [1992J considered the special case of this model where

the labor force is constant (n =     0),   there is no productivity growth (°          =0
for all t     0), there is no exhaustive public spending (Ct =          0 for all t    0)

and there are no taxes or transfers (r0 =      0).       In their model, debt obviously

cannot grow faster than wage income in the long rim. In the deterministic

version of their model, this means that only in a dynamically inefficient

equilibriwn can there be viable Ponzi schemes, with the public debt growing

forever at least as fast as the interest rate but no faster than the growth

rate of labor income.

        In general (that is, even if net taxes can change sign over the life

cycle), if the long—run rate of interest exceeds the long—rim growth rate of

the disposable income of the young (wages net of taxes on the young), that is,

if lint {At{Ot(f(kt)_ktf(kt))_4](1+n)t} = 0              equations

         From the public credit constraint (III.8b) or (I1I.Sb') it follows that,

if     the long—nm rate of interest exceeds the rate of growth of the disposable
income       of the old (capital income minus taxes on the old), that is, if
       {At[(1(kt))kt9t_(1+n)_lriI(1+n)t} = 0 22, we have

        If   lint inf    {atptB÷i} = lint sup {AtptBi} = 0, then we also have
             t'—i
lint ApB1 = 0. This means                that   when the long—nm rate of interest exceeds
t-'w

the long—nm growth rate of the disposable income             of the young and of the old,

the    conventional solvency constraint emerges.
        If   the taxes paid (transfers received) by each generation are

distortionary, it is unlikely that the long—run growth rate of per capita

taxes (transfers) can exceed the long—nm growth rate of productivity. There

will be some finite upper bound on the ratio of taxes and transfers per

generation to the real (physical) resources owned by that generation. Tax

administration and collection costs that are strictly convex functions of the

amount of taxes raised, will also put a finite upper bound on the ratio of

taxes paid to real resources owned (see Barro [1976], Iccallun [1984]            ,   Kremers

[1989)    and Bohn [1991}).

       We summarize the foregoing discussion in the following Proposition:
                                                                                                         24




 Proposition 2.

           The    conventional government solvency constraint        (tin              =   0)23 is
                                                                            AtptBt+j                 implied


           by   our solvency constraint (IIL8a,b and c) if
           (a) The long—rum interest rate exceeds the         long—run   growth rate of efficiency
           labor (tin AtG j-1n)t = 0)
                   tcD
           and

           (6) Either, the   net   tax   paid   by any generation at a given age cannot change sign
           over the lifetime of that generation,
                 or, the long—run growth rate of taxes paid or transfers received at a given
           age by a generation is less than the long—run rate of interest.


       In       order for the public debt to grow at least as fast as the rate of

interest forever, when the rate of interest is above the growth rate of

efficiency labor, it must be possible to make transfer payments to a

generation when it is young and                  to tax it when it is old; in addition, the
growth rate of these taxes and transfers must be at least as high as the
interest rate24. Note that it is only the taxes on or transfers to each
generation that must have a growth rate at least as high as the interest rate.
Aggregate         taxes net of transfers, r?Lt +
                                                          riLt    , need not grow at all, as
Case 4      below makes clear.



Case   4:       Restrictions on how taxes can change          frot   period to period.

       Ye       consider the example of age—specific taxes growing at a common (but
not necessarily constant) growth rate, that is r r_i(1t) and
       =
            2o1.c)        for all t 0. This is an interesting case because                     in many

models, taxes on the young will grow, from one generation to the next, at the
                                                                                          25




same rate as taxes on the old in steady state. We define



     E fJ1+tj)         t   0.


In this case the relevant solvency constraints become

                  S— (1+pt)Kt   S ptBti + T41t(1+n)t c wL
                                                            <          —
                  _(1+pt)Kt     (1+r)piBt —   r2i$t(1+n)t       wtLt       Ct
       Let r be negative and           positive, with    + (l+n1r21 = 0.        As long

as       is positive, the public debt always grows at least as fast as the rate

of interest, since ptBt+j —
                                   (rt)P_iB     E Ct —      + (1+nY1r2i]t(1+n)t and

C 0. The actual value of               (and thus of      each period can be chosen so

as to keep ptBt÷i + rWt(1+n)t invariant under different choices of                 and

independent of the growth rate of of ptBt+i.

       Despite     these restrictions, we can still make transfer payments to the
young and impose taxes on the old. In addition, we can choose, each period,
the coiwon growth rate of per capita taxes on the old and per capita transfer
payments to the young. If C 0 for all t, we can make the growth rate of
public debt exactly equal to the interest rate each period.


(B')   THREE EQUIVALENCE RESULTS.

       We   can   now can state our first equivalence result:


Proposition 3.
       Given initial values      and b0 and a feasible sequence g, t 0 , any
       equilibrium for Pj' k1, c and c with arbitrary paths of debts b and of
       lump—sum taxes and transfers r and r for all i I can be replicated without
       debt and deficits, that is by using balanced—budget lump—sum taxes and transfers

       only.
                                                                                           26




      What this means is that, in a deterministic model, any intergenerational
redistribution that can be supported by debt and taxes can also be supported just
with taxes and without debt. In the stochastic case it is true in addition that any
intergenerational insurance supported with public debt, unbalanced budgets and age—
and generation—dependent lump—sum taxes can also be provided with a balanced
budget and without public debt.


      Proof: An equilibrium is characterized for all t          0 by equations (111.16) to
(111.20),   the government solvency constraint given in (III.8a, b, and c) and
initial conditions k0 and b0. ye rewrite the first two inequalities of the
solvency constraint as follows:
(IY.la)        (l+a!i)(1+n)pbi
                                   +            f(k) —       ktf'(k)
or

(IY.lb)                                                                             —
               (1÷r)p.ib —   (i+wt+iy(i+n)r i f(k)                   —
                                                                         ktf'(kt)

or

                           —
(IV.2b)        (l+r)p1b                              —(l+)kt
                                                         i
     The proof is direct and     constructive. We first consider            a "reference

equilibrium"   supported by given sequences   of taxes   and debt,   denoted by single

overbars.   Next we propose an alternative set of sequences of taxes and debt
(denoted by double overbars), which include the balanced—budget, zero public debt
sequences. Finally, we check by direct computation that the double overbar
sequences support the same equilibrium sequences of consumption and capital
accumulation as the single overbar sequences (note that exhaustive public

spending    is the same under both policies). Formally, consider paths b ,
                                                                                                               27

                                                                           p k1        c and      4   for     all
       I for given k0      and        .   We   show that for any other set of debt paths

          I    I, there exists associated paths for lump—sum taxes and transfers

    and 4   , t 0 that support the same equilibrium paths
                                                           p, kt , and                                    4

    Equation (IV.3) ensures that the economy—wide capital market equilibrium
condition (111.19) will be satisfied for the sane values of

(and therefore also the same values of                          Equation     (IV.4) ensures that the

budget constraint of the old in period t given in (111.18) will be satisfied

for the same values of 4
                                     , k1 and               .   It   is easily   verified that the
government budget identity in (111.20) will           also be        satisfied under the double
overbar policies. Finally, it is obvious that if the government solvency

constraint is satisfied for the single overbar policy it will also be satisfied for the
double overbar policy.

       The remaining equilibrium conditions (111.16), and                     (111.17)    also hold
under the double overbar policy. To get Proposition 1 we set                          = 0    for all
I 1.0
       Thus any equilibrium with government debt and deficits can be replicated
                                                                                           28




by   an economy in which the government budget is balanced period—by—period (and
the stock of debt is zero) by appropriate age—specific lump—sum taxes and
transfers.
     It can        be   checked easily that, if   the   conventional government solvency
constraint     (111.3) is satisfied under the single overbar policy, it is also

satisfied under the double overbar policy. The validity of Proposition 3,

unlike that of Proposition 4 and its Corollaries belov, is therefore not

dependent on the acceptability of our generalized solvency constraint. The

reason is that under the double overbar policy in the proof of Proposition 2,

taxes and transfers are not in any way restricted.

      Proposition 3 is a generalization of the well—known proposition that an

equilibrium with positive public debt financed by taxes on the young is

equivalent to a balanced budget, pay—as—you—go (or unfunded) social security

retirement     scheme in which lump—sum taxes on the young are paid out as
lump—sum transfers          to the old. Calvo and   Obstfeld   [1988a,b] proved it for a
non—stochastic          model.



Corollary 1.

       With   unrestricted lump—atm taxes and transfers, public debt is redundant
      or "inessential", that is, it does not permit additional eqtilibria to be
      supported.


Corollary     2.

       With   unrestricted tazes and transfers, Ponzi finance is "inesseritial",
      that is, it does not per-mit additional equilibria to be supported.
                                                                                                29




Proposition 4.

           Given   an initial value Ic0 and a sequence of exhaustive public spending g, t 0,
           any equilibrium for v       , c and c1 for all I       0 supported by age— and
           time—dependent lump—sum taxes and transfers but without public debt and with
           balanced public sector budgets, can also be supported with age—independent (equal
           per capita for both generations alive in any given period) lump—sum taxes and
           transfers, provided unbalanced public sector budgets are allowed.


        This means that any intergenerational redistribution and intergenerational
insurance supported with balanced—budget age—dependent lump—sum taxes and
transfers,     can also be supported with age—independent lump—sum taxes and         tranfers


but   with unbalanced public sector budgets. Note that, from Proposition 3,                there

is    no loss of generality in taking the benchmark equilibrium of Proposition 4

to have a balanced budget and zero public debt.

        We shall give a detailed proof only for the case where the unbalanced

budget,       age—independent tn—transfer policy involves equal per capita taxes on
both generations alive in any given period (Case 2b) of our taxonomy in
Section III. The proofs for equal taxes per generation (Case 2a) and equal
taxes per efficiency unit of labor (Case 2c) are virtually identical.



Proof: Variables with single overbars represent the benchmark balanced—budget

policy with age—dependent taxes and transfers. Variables with double overbars

represent the age—independent tn/transfer case with an unbalanced budget.

Note that           =   o,    = —u +             +       and       =     =     for   all

I     0.

       From equation (111.18) it follows that, if equivalence holds, it must be
                                                                                    30




true that


(IV.7)             Ptbt+i = (1 +      rt÷i['ci[?+i+ t÷i(11F1          —
      From (IV.?) and the government's single—period budget identity, (or

equivalently from the economy—wide capital market equilibrium condition

(111.19)), it follows that, if the double overbar regime supports the same

equilibria as the single overbar regime, it must be true that (IV.8) holds.


(IV.8)            Ptbt+l = (1 +       n)1ç1[      —
                                                      tI
      For   any   is is clear that a value of          can be found to satisfy (IV.?)

and (IV.8). The other equilibrium conditions (111.16) and (111.17) are also

satisfied under the double overbar regime. The solvency constraint under the

single overbar regime is

(IY.9)                     f(kt) —     ktf'(kt)
and

(IV.1O)           o—1i            (1+pt)kt
Under the double overbar regime the solvency constraint is


(IV.11)                    +   (1 +   n)191       f(k) —   ktf'(kt)
and


(IV.12)           Ptbt÷l + (1 +       n)1O1       g — (1÷pt)kt
It is clear from (IY.S) that if the solvency constraint is satisfied under the

single over—bar regime ((IV.9) and (IV.10) hold), then it will also be

satisfied under the double overbar regime ((IV.11) and (IV.12) hold). a

      While this completes the proof of Proposition 4, it is instructive to

investigate the behavior of taxes and of the public debt under the double

overbar regime. It tuns out that Ponzi finance of a special kind (the

sequence of government debt will have infinite subsequences that grow faster

than the rate of interest forever if the population growth rate is positive),
                                                                                                        31




 will in general be necessary for the age—independent tax—transfer regime to

 support the same equilibria as the unrestricted tax—transfer regime. Ponzi

 finance    is therefore essential under the restricted tax—transfer scheme.
         Equations    (IV.?) and     (IV.8)   imply
                               =                  +                     —             +

     The value of the public debt under the age—independent tax,                          unbalanced

period to a negative value in the next. If, for instance,           and       were

constant over time, the saw—tooth pattern of the public debt, with debt in the

homogeneous equation of (IV.16) having a growth factor of _(l+rt) each period,

(as signaled in Calvo and Obstfeld [1988bJ for an economy without population

growth or productivity growth) is immediately apparent.

        Over a two—period horizon, the public debt evolves according to

(IV.17)      PtBt÷2 =   (l+n)2(1+rt+i)(1+rt)pt_iBt
                                                     —

                        +              —
                            (2+n)fr1
     Consider the simple example where           =       =0   and   =     =     for
all t     0. Equation (IV.17) simplifies to


             ptBt+2 =   (1+n)2(1+rt     (l+rt)p i8t —    (2+n)rtiLti
     Then     is negative (the balanced—budget scheme redistributes from the old

to the young) and r+1 is non—negative, the public debt will, over a

two—period horizon grow at a proportional rate at least equal to the sum of

the real interest rate and the growth rate of population. If n is

non—negative, the sequence of the public debt will therefore have infinite

subsequences that are characterized by Ponzi finance. Public credit too will,

over a two—period interval, grow at a rate asymptotically equal to the sum of

the interest rate and the growth rate of population. Note that "subsequence

Ponzi finance" is "essential" in this case.

     When the age—restricted tax policy is given by Case 2a of Section III,

that is by equal taxes or transfers per generation, or (1+n) =                          the

public debt path that supports any balanced budget equilibrium with

unrestricted taxes and transfers is given by

     In   the simple example when            =      for   all t and Lt is constant, the

public debt (and the public credit) will, over a two period horizon, grow

asymptotically at the rate of interest. Subsequence Ponzi finance is again

"essential".

Corollary 2.

     Proposition   4. holds when the restriction that per capita taxes are equal
    for both generations alive in any given period is replaced by the
     restriction that taxes per efficiency unit of labor in any given period are
     equal.


    When the age—restricted tax policy is given by Case 2c of Section III,

that is by equal taxes             or transfers per unit of efficiency           labor, or
     =                     the   public debt path that supports any         balanced budget
equilibrium with unrestricted taxes and transfers is given by
                                                             —

         Again taking the simple example where                   = 0 and    =        for    all t     0,

it   is easily seen that over a 2—period interval, the public debt                         (and the

public     credit) will asymptotically grow             at the sum    of the interest rate, the
growth rate of population and the growth rate of productivity. If the growth
rate of efficiency labor is non—negative, Ponzi finance will be feasible and
"essential".

Proposition 5.

         Given   an initial value         and a sequence of exhaustive public spending        g,
           0, any equilibrium for p, k ,           c   and         for all t 0 that can be
         supported with a balanced budget and unrestricted lump—sum taxes and
         transfers, can aLso be supported with taxes and transfers that are
         required to have the same sign during the lifetime of each generation,
         provided unbalanced budgets are allowed.


       Proof: Under the balanced budget (single overbar) reference policy,
     = 0   and         +
                           iLti       =      for   all t 0.        Under the double overbar

policy,     we have                 (l+rt)pt1B ÷          —
                                                                    — ._iLt_i        and      =
                                                                                               35




      > 0 for all t         0. For the two policies to support the same equilibrius

 (and for the double overbar policy to satisfy the solvency constraint if the

 single overbar policy satisfies it) it must be the case that pB+ Lt =

 (or   equivalently that (1+r)p1B —           iLt_i      =
                                                             _?_iLi).
        The behavior of the public debt under the double overbar policy is

governed by

                         =                                        —
 (IY.20)          v—1        (1-rt+At_ir1[L    +
                                                   At_i_iLt_i         at]
Noting     that


(IV.21)           Pt_iBt +   lLtl     =

we see that equations (IV.20) and (IY.21) can be satisfied through the


appropriate choice of (positive or negative) values for                      and         for

any    given   positive value of Ati and     exogenously     given feasible values of

        and

        Consider, for instance, the special case where At =           1, that is there
either has to be an equal tax or an equal transfer each period over the

lifetime of each generation. Equation (IY.20) then simplifies to

                                                     —
                 pt_iBt =    (2+rY'[L + _iLt_i           C]
Since    the stock of debt can be negative as well as positive, the restriction

that       and       must have the same sign (or even be equal), does not prevent

the government from replicating any equilibrium supported by a balanced budget

policy   with unrestricted taxes and transfers.
       Since, by assumption, taxes paid to the government cannot change sign
over the life cycle, Ponzi finance is only possible under the               double overbar

policy if the interest rate is below the growth rate of efficiency labor.

This is obvious from (IV.20), as ?Lt +                                 cannot have a
                                               At i iLt 1 —
                                                                                         36




 long—run growth rate in excess of the growth rate of efficiency labor.

       Proposition 3 states that public debt and deficits (and by implication

Ponzi finance) are redundant policy instruments as long as the fiscal

authority    has unrestricted age—specific lump—sum taxes and transfers.
Proposition 4 and its     two Corollaries and   Proposition 5 emphasize that a
fiscal authority with a restricted tax—transfer instrumentarium may be able to
use public debt and deficits as perfect substitutes for the missing
age—specific     taxes and transfers, provided the government solvency constraint

is specified as in (III.Sa,b and c). Essential (subsequence) Ponzi finance

may be a feature of these government borrowing and lending strategies (vide

Proposition 4 and its Corollaries).

       Our approach to government solvency has    implications     for the empirical

approaches   to testing for government solvency (see e.g. Hamilton and Flavin
[l986J, Wilcox [1989], Corsetti [1990] , Grilli 11990) and Buiter and Patel [1991]).
All these papers used variants of the convergence—in—expectation version of the
conventional solvency criterion given in (III.3b), involving the long—run behavior
of the discounted public debt, that is, they tested
                                                       4.irnEt_1+TPt1+Tbt+T
(l÷nF1iirnAt_l+Tpl+TB+T =         0   (or its expectational counterpart).
       We have   seen that even in economies in which the long—run rate of
interest   exceeds the long—run growth rate of efficiency labor, Ponzi finance

may be feasible. As long as (1) the tax     burden   can   vary   freely over the life

cycle of each generation (specifically if they can make       net positive transfer
payments   to a generation when it is young and    impose a net positive tax when
it   is old, and (2) the transfers and taxes can grow at least as fast as the

rate of interest, the potential for Ponzi finance exists. Note that the

empirically unlikely zig—zag pattern of the debt need not occur when the two
                                                                                    37




 generations alive during any given period can be treated differently by the

 tax—transfer system (see the proof of Proposition 5).



 (V) CONCLUSION.

         Merely   looking at the stock of public debt, without attempting to

 evaluate the total impact of the fiscal—financial policy nles on what

 Auerbach, Cokhale and Kotlikoff [1991] have called the "generational accounts"

 can be very misleading as an indicator of thefl degree of financial crowding out

 pressure in the economy. We shoved that, given a sufficiently rich

 tax—transfer menu, the government could achieve any desired intergenerational

redistribution and insurance with public debt, without it or indeed with

public credit. It is when tax—transfer options are constrained that the

option of public borrowing or lending becomes valuable, both for

intergenerational redistribution and for intergeneratIonal insurance.

     The tax—smoothing proposition demonstrates how public debt can be useful

for conventional (not uncertainty—related) efficiency reasons in the absence

of non—distortionary taxes and transfers. Our paper complements this by

shoving how public debt can be useful in the pursuit of distributional

objectives and efficient intergenerational insurance schemes, if there is a

restricted    menu of lump—sum taxes and transfers.
     An important part in the proof of the proposition that government debt
can be used to take over the intergenerational redistribution and insurance
roles of missing age—specific taxes and transfers, was our specification of
the government solvency constraint. A government is solvent if      is   does not
pursue   policies that force the private sector into bankruptcy when there

exists an alternative policy that would not do so. The private sector is

bankrupt when the non—negativity constraints on consumption by the young,
                                                                                           38




consumption   by the old or the capital stock become binding. The stock of

public debt is limited by the condition that the total amount             of   resources

taken    by the government   from the young, whether through borrowing or through

taxes,   cannot exceed the wage income of the young. The stock of public credit
is likewise limited by the condition that the total amount           of   resources taken
by the government from the old, whether through the old servicing their debt

to the government or through taxes, cannot exceed the capital income of the

old.

       Provided   the government can   make net transfer     payments to a generation
when it is young and     impose   net taxes on that generation when it is old, and
provided these transfer payments and taxes      can   grow   at least at the rate of
interest,   Ponzi finance is possible, regardless of the relationship between

the interest rate and the growth rate, and regardless of whether or not the

economy is dynamically inefficient or Pareto efficient. If either of these

assumptions is violated, our solvency constraint implies (when the long—run

interest rate exceeds the long—run growth rate of efficiency labor) that the

conventional solvency constraint applies: the sequence of public debt

discounted at the rate of interest converges to zero.

                                             NOTES

      'With distortionary (non—lump--sum) taxes and transfers, real equilibria
 will almost always be affected by the ability, offered by unbalanced budgets,
to wary the pattern over time of the excess burdens associated with the use of
distortionary instruments. See e.g. Barro [1979].
       2See Buiter [1990]      for a discussion of the roles of different kinds of
heterogeneity        in a number of standard OLG models.


     31t is the institution of government that must be infinite—lived, not any
particular set of incumbent politicians. Specifically, what is required that
a government does not repudiate the debt incurred by its predecessors.
      4Earlier versions of these propositions can         be   found in Buiter and Kletzer
 [1990, 1991].
     'For an analysis of private intergenerational risk sharing motivated
through altruism see Hayashi, Altonji and Kotlikoff [1991].
      'Apart from the incomplete market participation that           is   intrinsic to
OLG  models without the institution of hereditary slavery, more stan4ard types
of insurance market failures can also create a potential welfare—improving
role for taxes, transfer payments and public debt. For instance, in the presence
of uncertain lifetimes (a feature that is absent from our model), a compulsory social
security retirement scheme can provide an annuity that is actuarially fairer than
those provided by the voluntary private annuities market which is adversely affected
by adverse selection (see Abel          and Feldstein (1989)). Eaton and Rosen 119801,
Varian 11980], Feldstein [1988], Kimball and Naákiw [1989] and Kaplow J1991J
discuss how income taxation can serve as social insurance against uncertainties in
labor income. The positive and welfare consequences of such social insurance will of
course depend on the availability and nature of private insurance arrangements and
the reasons for the absence of a set of complete insurance markets. Typically,
adverse selection problems can be mitigated by compulsory social insurance through
the tn-transfer mechanism while moral hazard problems affect efficient public
provision of insurance as much as private provision.
     7Alloving for longer maturity debt would add notation but would not affect
the equivalence results.
         'The single—period utility function v is twice continuously differentiable, strictly
concave, increasing in c1 and c2 and satisfies the Inada conditions.
      5Since taxes, coupon payments and the marginal product of capital can be
stochastic,   it   may not be possible to satisfy (I1.3a,b) for non—negative values of 4

and/or    c. While labor productivity and the marginal product of capital are
assumed    to be positive, it may not be possible to satisfy the constraints
4 0, c_1 0, I÷ 0 and C 0                      for arbitrary public debt, tax and
transfer sequences. Our government solvency constraint is in fact exactly the
constraint that households are not forced into bankruptcy by government
policy.
     Note that for arbitrary government policies, private bankruptcy might
occur even if individuals cannot borrow from the government (bd              0), because
                                                                                            43



 even without private debt to the government, the old might not have enough
 resources to pay the stochastic taxes. If the constraints 4,               c    o were

 imposed, even non—contingent debt issued by private individuals (bd c 0) would in
 general be risky debt, with gross rate of return 1 + rt+1 if there is no bankruptcy
 (c > 0) and gross rate of return max{0, ((1 + p+)4+              —

 otherwise.       With or without private debt to the government, the old might not
 have enough resources to pay taxes. Assuming that taxes owed to the government
 have the same priority as interest owed to the government, actual taxes plus
 interest paid by the old would be given by min{r + t+i4+i' (1 +
 It is even possible that the young would not be able to pay their taxes. This would
 be the case if w plus the madmal amount the young could borrow were less than
 lj.       Allowing for this would greatly complicate the exposition but would not affect
 our equivalence results, as long as taxes and interest owed would be subject to
 the same treatment.
           'We   do not impose the constraints kd     0 and bd    0.    Since in the
household decision problem V stands for equity, that is ownership claims to
the stock of physical capital, there is no reason the household cannot go
short in it. We could also allow households to issue state—contingent debt.
What we are implicitly assuming in our formal model is that the debt they
issue is identical to government debt. The introduction of private debt does
therefore not increase the asset menu.
     11The consumer's optimum will be turn out to be interior because (1) the
utility function satisfies the Inada conditions, (2) the wage rate, the gross
return on debt and the gross return on capital are positive and (3) government
policy does not drive consumers to bankruptcy. Equations (II.4a,b) anticipate
points (2) and (3), which are introduced later in Section II, respectively in
Section III.

           '2Note that when debt is riskless, (II.4a,b) imply the familiar risk premium
for    capital formula Etpt+i =      r+i — Covt[pt+i,    v'(c)J, where Cov denotes the
                                                   Etv'(c)
conditional variance operator.
     '3Public consumption can bean argument in the private utility function.
As long as it enters in an additively separable way, it will not affect the
first—order conditions for private consumption. Since we are interested in
characterizing feasible fiscal strategies rather than optimal ones, we model
public consumption as a pure waste of resources. Public sector capital
formation could be added to our list of fiscal instruments in a
straightforward manner and is omitted only because of space limitations.

discounted debt process, and not just to its mathematical expectation. See

     161f we extended the government financial liability menu, say by allowing
longer maturity debt, the definition would have to be adapted to the specific
set of government debt instruments allowed. The statement that the government
never runs a primary surplus, always defines Ponzi finance.
     liThis is in the spirit of O'Connell and Zeldes [1988) , who point out that
in order for the government to run a "rational" Ponzi scheme, a rational
private sector must be willing to be at the receiving end of such a scheme.
     °Note that in our model both the wage rate and the marginal product of
capital are positive, because of we restrict the level of labor—augmenting
productivity to be postive. Without a government sector, private bankruptcy
would therefore not occur. If the technology were to permit private
bankruptcy even without a government, our solvency constraint would be
modified as follows. The government does not select sequences for taxes,
transfer payments, debt and exhaustive spending that will cause the
non—negativity constraints on consumption by both generations and on the
capital stock to become binding if there exist alteniative sequences of the
government instruments that would avoid this.
     '9Note that the total transfer to the government by the young during period
t evolves  according to
                    =
                      (1+rt)(ptiBt1+rt1Li) + [(1+n)r* (1÷rt)ri]Lti

     "Note that such a tax is not perceived by those investing in government
debt as a "tax on debt" affecting expected returns from holding debt, even if
the tax is fully anticipated. It is perceived as lump—sum, that is the amount
paid   is
        perceived as independent of the actions of the tax payer, including
her portfolio choice.
     21lcCallum's specification of the private sector solvency constraint (which
is not well motivated) still implies that the long—rim growth rate of the
public debt must the less than the private rate of time preference.

can depend only on      and therefore not on         If you tax the young more in
period t under the double overbar policy than under the single overbar policy,
you will borrow less (equation (111.9)). In period t+l the taxes on the old
generation can be lower under the double overbar policy by (l+r÷i) tines the
amount by which the taxes they paid in period t (when they were young) were
higher . This leaves the life—time budget constraint unaffected.
