                                              ABSTRACT

This paper constructs an index of financial sophistication that, in comprehensive data on Swedish households,
best explains a set of three investment mistakes: underdiversification, risky share inertia, and the tendency
to sell winning stocks and hold losing stocks (the disposition effect). The index of financial sophistication
increases strongly with financial wealth and household size, and to a lesser extent with education and
proxies for financial experience. The index is strongly positively correlated with the share of risky
assets held by a household.

1. Data Description and Deﬁnitions

Swedish households pay taxes on both income and wealth. For this reason, the national
Statistics Central Bureau (SCB), also known as Statistics Sweden, has a parliamentary
mandate to collect highly detailed information on the ﬁnances of every household in
the country. We compiled the data supplied by SCB into a panel covering four years
(1999-2002) and all Swedish residents (about 4.8 million households). The information
available on each resident can be grouped into three main categories: demographic
characteristics, income, and disaggregated wealth.
    Demographic information includes age, gender, marital status, nationality, birth­
place, education, and place of residence. The household head is deﬁned as the individ­
ual with the highest income. The education variable includes high school and post-high
school dummies for the household head.
    Income is reported by individual source. For capital income, the database reports the
income (interest, dividends) that has been earned on each bank account or each security.
For labor income, the database reports gross labor income and business sector.
    The panel’s distinguishing feature is that it contains highly disaggregated wealth
information. We observe the worldwide assets owned by each resident on December

31 of each year, including bank accounts, mutual funds and stocks. The information
is provided for each individual account or each security referenced by its International
Security Identiﬁcation Number (ISIN). The database also records contributions made
during the year to private pension savings, as well as debt outstanding at year end and
interest paid during the year.
    Following Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (henceforth “CCS”, 2007), we measure a
household’s total ﬁnancial wealth as the sum of its holdings in these asset classes, ex­
cluding from consideration illiquid assets such as real estate or consumer durables, de­
ﬁned contribution retirement accounts, capital insurance products that combine return
guarantees with risky asset holdings, and directly held bonds. Also, our measure of
wealth is gross wealth and does not subtract mortgage or other household debt. CCS
(2007) summarize the relative magnitudes of all these components of Swedish household
balance sheets.
    The results presented in this paper are based on households that exist throughout
the 1999-2002 period. We impose no constraint on the participation status of these
households, but require that they satisfy the following ﬁnancial requirements at the
end of each year. First, disposable income must be strictly positive and the three-year
rolling average must be at least 1,000 Swedish kronor ($113). Second, ﬁnancial wealth
must be no smaller than 3,000 kronor ($339). For computational convenience, we have
selected a random panel of 100,000 households from the ﬁltered population. Unless
stated otherwise, all the results in the paper and appendix are based on this ﬁxed
subsample.

2. Additional Results on the Regressions Reported in the Main Text

We begin by reporting additional results on the regressions presented in Tables 1 and
2 of the main text. In Table A1, we report the cross-sectional correlation of investment
mistakes in the population of households considered in Tables 1 and 2. In the top left
corner, we consider the correlation of observed mistakes. We ﬁnd that risky share
inertia has a slight positive correlation with underdiversiﬁcation and the disposition
eﬀect, while the correlation between underdiversiﬁcation and the disposition eﬀect is
slightly negative. In the bottom right corner, we report the correlation of ﬁtted mistakes,
which are computed using the unrestricted regression coeﬃcients reported in Table 1
of the main text. All three correlations are strongly positive, ranging between 53.4%
and 80.9%. This suggests that it is possible to construct a single index of ﬁnancial
sophistication.
    In Table A2, we report the simple correlation between characteristics and ﬁtted mis­
takes. The ﬁtted values are again computed using the unrestricted regression coeﬃcients
reported in Table 1. Disposable income, private pension premia, real estate wealth, the


                                            2
post-high school dummy, and most strikingly ﬁnancial wealth are all negatively cor­
related with the three mistakes. We conversely obtain positive correlations between
mistakes and the retirement or entrepreneurs dummies. Thus, the collinearity of regres­
sors seems to explain apparent instability in the signs of some coeﬃcients reported in
Table 1.
    In Table A3, we report the restricted regression coeﬃcients of investment mistakes
on household characteristics. The results are derived from Table 2 in the main text, and
have the advantage of being directly comparable to Table 1. Log ﬁnancial wealth has
approximately the same coeﬃcients as the ones obtained in the unrestricted regression,
while larger diﬀerences are apparent for other regressors.

3. Robustness Checks

3.1. Disposition Eﬀect

Stockholders with Both Gains and Losses. In Tables A4-A6, we reestimate the
sophistication regressions on the set of participating stockholders with both gains and
losses in their stock portfolios. Dhar and Zhu (2006) impose a similar requirement on
the set of households they consider in their analysis. As in the main text, we classify
a stock as a winner if its performance during the year is higher than the unhedged
version of the MSCI world index. We verify in Table A4 that ﬁnancial wealth, and
to a lesser extent household size and education, have a negative impact on all three
mistakes, and we observe in Table A5 that the ﬁtted values of investments mistakes
have high positive correlations. As is apparent in Table A6, the reduction of the R2
coeﬃcient in the restricted regression is modest for underdiversiﬁcation and inertia,
but more pronounced for the disposition eﬀect. The index of ﬁnancial sophistication
increases with ﬁnancial wealth, household size and education, but tends to be lower for
immigrants, entrepreneurs and the unemployed. Thus, the results reported in the main
text are robust to the choice of this alternative subsample.

Losers and Winners Deﬁned by Absolute Performance During the Year. In
Tables A7-A9, we classify a stock as a winner if it has a positive return during the
year, and as a loser otherwise. We reestimate the sophistication regressions and mistake
correlations on the set of participating stockholders with both gains and losses in their
stock portfolios. Tables A7-A9 show that the results of the main text are robust to the
choice of alternative stock classiﬁcation and household subsample.

Disposition Eﬀect Computed Using Full Sales Only. In Tables A10-A12, we
investigate the robustness of our results when the measure of the disposition eﬀect only
takes full sales into account. We focus on participating stockholders who sell at least


                                           3
one stock (either partially or fully) and experience both gains and losses in their stock
portfolios during the year. Gains and losses are calculated with respect to the unhedged
world index. We verify in Tables A10-A12 that the results reported in the main text are
robust to considering only full sales in the disposition eﬀect measure.

3.2. Risky Share Inertia

We now consider two alternative measure of risky share inertia.

Risky Share Changes in Levels. In Tables A13-A15, we proxy inertia by the absolute
value of risky share changes in levels, |wh,t+1 −wh,t |. We obtain broadly similar, if slightly
weaker, results than in logs.

Adjustment Model. In CCS (2009), we have introduced an adjustment model of the
risky share. For every household h, we write the period-t + 1 risky share, wh,t+1 , as the
                                                      p                         d
weighted average of the households’s passive share, wh,t+1 , and target share, wh,t+1  :
                                                 p                d
                     ln(wh,t+1 ) = (1 − φh ) ln(wh,t+1 ) + φh ln(wh,t+1 ),
                     p
The passive share wh,t+1   is the proportion of risky assets in the complete portfolio at
the end of year t + 1 if the household passively holds its year-t portfolio for an entire
year. The passive share can be readily computed for every household. By contrast, the
         d
target wh,t+1 is unobserved and is estimated, along with the adjustment coeﬃcient φh ,
by instrumental variable regression in CCS (2009).
    We now use the adjustment model to deﬁne a proxy for inertia that can be read­
ily computed for every household. The adjustment equation implies that the inertia
measure 1 − φh satisﬁes
                                                          d
                                        ln(wh,t+1 ) − ln(wh,t+1 )
                             1 − φh =       p             d
                                                                    .                      (3.1)
                                        ln(wh,t+1 ) − ln(wh,t+1 )

The numerator can be decomposed as follows:
                        d                               d                         d
      ln(wh,t+1 ) − ln(wh,t+1 ) = ∆ ln(wh,t+1 ) − ∆ ln(wh,t+1 ) + ln(wh,t ) − ln(wh,t ).

We classify households into bins of the initial risky share wh,t , and proxy the target
              d
change ∆ ln(wh,t+1 ) by the equal-weighted average of the risky share change among
                                                                       d , then
households in the same bin, ∆Th,t+1 . If we also assume that wh,t = wh,t

                                      d
                    ln(wh,t+1 ) − ln(wh,t+1 ) ≈ ∆ ln(wh,t+1 ) − ∆Th,t+1 .




                                              4
                                d
Let ph,t+1 = ln(wh,t+1 ) − ln(wh,t+1 ) denote the passive change. The denominator of
(3.1) can similarly be rewritten as:
             p             d                        d                         d
         ln(wh,t+1 ) − ln(wh,t+1 ) = ph,t+1 − ∆ ln(wh,t+1 ) + ln(wh,t ) − ln(wh,t )
                                      ≈ ph,t+1 − ∆Th,t+1 .

Given these approximations, we deﬁne the following proxy for the inertia coeﬃcient:
                                  ¯                         ¯
                                  ¯ ∆ ln(wh,t+1 ) − ∆Th,t+1 ¯
                                  ¯
                         yh,t,2 = ¯                         ¯.
                                       ph,t+1 − ∆Th,t+1     ¯

Since changes in the target are poorly estimated, we take absolute values and winsorize
the ratio to reduce noise.1
    In Tables A16-A18, we reestimate the sophistication regressions and mistake corre­
lations when the inertia coeﬃcient yh,t,2 is winsorized at the 95th percentile. The results
are broadly consistent with the ﬁndings of the main text. Signiﬁcance levels, correla­
tions, and R2 coeﬃcients are lower than in Tables 1 and 2 because of the noisiness of
this alternative measure.
    In Tables A19-A21, we conﬁrm this interpretation by winsorizing the inertia coef­
ﬁcient at the 90th percentile. The reduction in noise leads to higher signiﬁcance levels
and R2 , as one would expect. The correlation coeﬃcients are slightly lower, however,
presumably because winsorization reduces the covariance between the inertia measure
and other mistakes. Overall, this analysis conﬁrms that the results in the main text are
robust to the choice of alternative measures of inertia based on the adjustment model.

Market Measure of Inertia. Consider a general equilibrium economy in which the
representative agent holds the market portfolio. At the end of the following year, her
new target risky share must coincide with her passive risky share:
                                                     wh,t (1 + rm,t+1 )
                       ωp (wh,t ; rm,t+1 ) =                                    .
                                               1 + rf,t + wh,t (rm,t+1 − rf,t )
These considerations lead us to proxy household inertia by the market measure:

                           yh,t,2 = | ln(wh,t+1 ) − ln ωp (wh,t ; rm,t+1 )|,
   1
    The following example illustrates why the measure of inertia is quite noisy. Consider a closed
economy in which the representative agent passively holds the market portfolio. The numerator and
denominator of
                                       ∆ ln(wh,t+1 ) − ∆Th,t+1
                                                                                                 (3.2)
                                           ph,t+1 − ∆Th,t+1
are then both equal to zero. The sign and magnitude of the ratio are thus unstable for households
that are close to the mean. Since we have shown in CCS (2009) that the inertia coeﬃcient is contained
between 0 and 1 for almost all households, we reduce noise by taking absolute values and winsorizing
the upper tail of yh,t,2 .


                                                    5
where rm,t+1 is the return on the unhedged world index. yh,t,2 is the distance between
the actual risky share, wh,t+1 , and a proxy for the target, ω p (wh,t ; rm,t+1 ).
   In Tables A22-A24, we reestimate the sophistication regressions when inertia is
proxied by the market measure. The results are consistent, if slightly weaker, than
the estimates reported in the main text.

4. Measuring Diversiﬁcation on Less Detailed Datasets

We have hitherto computed household-level Sharpe ratios from the highly disaggregated
asset-level data provided by Statistics Sweden. In other countries, however, researchers
often have access to more limited information on household ﬁnances, and must rely on
statistics such as the number of stocks, the number of funds, and the share of funds in
the risky portfolio, as diversiﬁcation proxies. In Table A25, we report the cross-sectional
correlation between these proxies and the actual Sharpe ratio in our dataset. Speciﬁcally,
for every household h, we consider the number of stocks nh in the risky portfolio, the
number of risky funds mh , the total number of risky assets nh + mh , the share of risky
assets in funds Fh , and the weighted number of risky assets: (1 − Fh )nh + Fh mh . We
also consider a more elaborate imputation method of the Sharpe ratio, which is based
on the household’s number of stocks and funds, the share of funds in the risky portfolio,
as well as the average return, standard deviation and correlation of stocks and funds.
The exact deﬁnition of the imputed Sharpe ratio is provided at the end of the section.
    The share of funds in the risky portfolio is a reasonable diversiﬁcation proxy, with
a 0.49 cross-sectional correlation with the Sharpe ratio. The imputed Sharpe ratio per­
forms well but provides only a tiny improvement in the correlation compared to the
share of funds. Variables such as the number of stocks or the number of risky assets,
however, are poor diversiﬁcation proxies, as evidenced by their small or slightly negative
correlation with the risky portfolio’s Sharpe ratio. In Tables A26-A28, we reestimate
the sophistication regressions when the share of funds in the risky portfolio is used as
a diversiﬁcation proxy. The results are qualitatively similar to the ones obtained in the
main text.
    In Tables A29-A31, we reestimate the sophistication regressions based on the im­
puted Sharpe ratio. The results are consistent with the ones obtained with the fund
share and the actual Sharpe ratio. Predicted correlations and R2 coeﬃcients, however,
are substantially larger than with the Sharpe ratio and the fund share, which suggests
that these estimates should be interpreted with caution when using the imputed the
Sharpe ratio in other datasets.
    Overall, the share of funds in the risky portfolio appears to be a reasonable proxy for
risky portfolio diversiﬁcation. This is encouraging news for household ﬁnance researchers
since these measures are readily available in many countries.


                                            6
4.1. Imputed Sharpe Ratio

As in CCS (2007), we assume that assets are priced on world markets in dollars according
to a global version of the CAPM. From the perspective of a Swedish investor, the
pricing model induces a domestic CAPM in which the currency-hedged world index is
mean-variance eﬃcient. Because currency-hedging is typically unavailable to most retail
investors, except perhaps the richest, we view the unhedged version of the index as more
attainable. The computation of the imputed Sharpe ratio then proceeds as follows.

   • The CAPM implies that the excess return on the equal-weighted Swedish index
     has mean μSI = 7.35% and volatility σSI = 31.2%.

   • The excess return on a stock held by a Swedish household has mean μD = μSI ,
     average volatility σ D = 71.61%, and average pairwise correlation ρ = 8%. The
     computation of σ D and ρ is based on the variance-covariance matrix of excess
     returns implied by the CAPM.

   • The unhedged world index has expected excess return μm = 5.52%, volatility
     σ m = 15.98%, and Sharpe ratio Sm = 34.56% (from the CAPM).

   • The average correlation between an individual stock and the unhedged index is
     ρ∗ = 28.32%.


We now consider the household’s stock and fund portfolios. The household’s stock
portfolio yields the excess return:
                                                  nh
                                               1 X
                                    rh,D,t   =       ri,t ,
                                               nh
                                                    i=1

which has mean μD and variance σ 2h,D = σ D2 [1 + (n − 1)ρ] /n . We assume that fund
                                                    h         h
holdings are invested in the unhedged version of the world index.
   Under these assumptions, the excess return on the risky portfolio,

                            rh,t = Dh,t rh,D,t + (1 − Dh,t )rm,t ,

has mean E(rh,t ) = Dh,t μD +(1−Dh,t )μm and variance σ 2h,t = Dh,t
                                                                  2 σ 2 +(1−D )2 σ 2 +
                                                                      h,D        h,t m
                  ∗
2Dh,t (1 − Dh,t )ρ σ m σ D . We therefore proxy the household’s Sharpe ratio by:

                                    Dh,t μD + (1 − Dh,t )μm
          ISh,t = h                                                          i1/2 .
                    2     2                2  2                     ∗
                   Dh,t σ h,D + (1 − Dh,t ) σ m + 2Dh,t (1 − Dh,t )ρ σ m σ D

The corresponding underdiversiﬁcation measure is 1 − ISh,t /Sm .

Notes: This table reports the cross-sectional correlation of investment mistakes in the panel of Swedish households considered in Table 1 of the main text. In the top left panel we
compute the correlation of observed mistakes, in the bottom right panel the correlation of predicted mistakes, and in the bottom left panel the correlation between predicted and observed
mistakes. Mistakes are demeaned year by year, and predicted mistakes are computed using the pooled regressions reported in Table 1.

     Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics. The estimation is based on households that hold
     stocks at t, experience both gains and losses in their stock portfolios between t and t+1, still hold risky assets at t+1, and for which the immigration
     dummy is available. Underdiversification is measured by the Sharpe ratio loss relative to the unhedged world index under the CAPM. Risky share inertia
     is proxied by the absolute value of changes in the log risky share. The disposition effect measure is the difference between the proportion of gains
     realized and the proportion of losses realized during the year. A stock is classified as a gain if it outperforms the unhedged world index during the year,
     and as a loss otherwise. Mistakes are expressed in percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous
     characteristics are also standardized year by year.

Notes: This table reports the cross-sectional correlation of investment mistakes. The measure of each mistake and the set of households are the same as in Table A4. In the top left
panel we compute the correlation of observed mistakes, in the bottom right panel the correlation of predicted mistakes, and in the bottom left panel the correlation between predicted and
observed mistakes. All mistakes are demeaned year by year, and predicted mistakes are computed using the pooled regressions reported in Table A4.

              Notes: This table reports the pooled restricted regression of the negative of investment mistakes on

              A4 and A5. In Panel A, we compute the coefficients of the sophistication index, their t-statistics, as well as the
              simple correlation of the index with each characteristic. In Panel B, we report the proportionality coefficient of
              risky share inertia and the disposition effect measure, and the adjusted R2 of all three mistakes. The
              proportionality coefficient of underdiversification is by definition equal to unity and is not reported. Mistakes are
              expressed in percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous
              characteristics are also standardized year by year.

     Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics when a stock is classified as a winner if it has a
     positive return during the year, and is otherwise classified as a loser. Underdiversification is measured by the Sharpe ratio loss relative to the unhedged
     world index under the CAPM. Risky share inertia is proxied by the absolute value of changes in the log risky share. The disposition effect measure is the
     difference between the proportion of gains realized and the proportion of losses realized during the year. The estimation is based on households that
     hold stocks at t, experience both gains and losses in their stock portfolios between t and t+1, still hold risky assets at t+1, and for which the immigration
     dummy is available. Mistakes are expressed in percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous
     characteristics are also standardized year by year.

         Notes: This table reports the pooled restricted regression of the negative of investment mistakes on household
         characteristics. The measure of each mistake and the set of households are the same as in Tables A7 and
         A8. In Panel A, we compute the coefficients of the sophistication index, their t-statistics, as well as the simple
         correlation of the index with each characteristic. In Panel B, we report the proportionality coefficient of risky
         share inertia and the disposition effect measure, and the adjusted R2 of all three mistakes. The proportionality
         coefficient of underdiversification is by definition equal to unity and is not reported. Mistakes are expressed in
         percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous
         characteristics are also standardized year by year.

      Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics when the disposition effect measure only takes full
      sales into account. Underdiversification is measured by the Sharpe ratio loss relative to the unhedged world index under the CAPM. Risky share inertia
      is proxied by the absolute value of changes in the log risky share. The disposition effect measure is the difference between the proportion of gains
      realized and the proportion of losses realized during the year, and only full sales are taken into account. A stock is classified as a gain if it outperforms
      the unhedged world index during the year, and as a loss otherwise. The estimation is based on households that hold stocks at t, sell at least one stock
      and experience both gains and losses in their stock portfolios between t and t+1, still hold risky assets at t+1, and for which the immigration dummy is
      available. Mistakes are expressed in percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous characteristics are
      also standardized year by year.

Notes: This table reports the cross-sectional correlation of investment mistakes. The measure of each mistake and the set of households are the same as in Table A10. In the top left
panel we compute the correlation of observed mistakes, in the bottom right panel the correlation of predicted mistakes, and in the bottom left panel the correlation between predicted and
observed mistakes. All mistakes are demeaned year by year, and predicted mistakes are computed using the pooled regressions reported in Table A10.

               Notes: This table reports the pooled restricted regression of the negative of investment mistakes on household
               characteristics. The measure of each mistake and the set of households are the same as in Tables A10 and
               A11. In Panel A, we compute the coefficients of the sophistication index, their t-statistics, as well as the simple
               correlation of the index with each characteristic. In Panel B, we report the proportionality coefficient of risky
               share inertia and the disposition effect measure, and the adjusted R2 of all three mistakes. The proportionality
               coefficient of underdiversification is by definition equal to unity and is not reported. Mistakes are expressed in
               percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous
               characteristics are also standardized year by year.

      Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics when risky share inertia is proxied by the absolute
      value of risky share changes in levels. Underdiversification is measured by the Sharpe ratio loss relative to the unhedged world index under the CAPM.
      The disposition effect measure is the difference between the proportion of gains realized and the proportion of losses realized during the year. A stock is
      classified as a gain if it outperforms the unhedged world index during the year, and as a loss otherwise. The estimation is based on participants at t and
      t+1 with direct stockholdings at t for which the immigration dummy is available. Mistakes are expressed in percentage points. All mistakes and
      characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous characteristics are also standardized year by year.

Notes: This table reports the cross-sectional correlation of investment mistakes. The measure of each mistake and the set of households are the same as in Table A13. In the top left
panel we compute the correlation of observed mistakes, in the bottom right panel the correlation of predicted mistakes, and in the bottom left panel the correlation between predicted and
observed mistakes. All mistakes are demeaned year by year, and predicted mistakes are computed using the pooled regressions reported in Table A13.

      Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics when risky share inertia is proxied by the measure
      from the adjustment model winsorized at the 95th percentile. Underdiversification is measured by the Sharpe ratio loss relative to the unhedged world
      index under the CAPM. The disposition effect measure is the difference between the proportion of gains realized and the proportion of losses realized
      during the year. A stock is classified as a gain if it outperforms the unhedged world index during the year, and as a loss otherwise. The estimation is
      based on participants at t and t+1 with direct stockholdings at t for which the immigration dummy is available. Mistakes are expressed in percentage
      points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous characteristics are also standardized year by year.

Notes: This table reports the cross-sectional correlation of investment mistakes. The measure of each mistake and the set of households are the same as in Table A16. In the top left
panel we compute the correlation of observed mistakes, in the bottom right panel the correlation of predicted mistakes, and in the bottom left panel the correlation between predicted and
observed mistakes. All mistakes are demeaned year by year, and predicted mistakes are computed using the pooled regressions reported in Table A16.

                share inertia and the disposition effect measure, and the adjusted R2 of all three mistakes. The proportionality
                coefficient of underdiversification is by definition equal to unity and is not reported. Mistakes are expressed in
                percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous

      Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics when risky share inertia is proxied by the
      adjustment model measure winsorized at the 90th percentile. Underdiversification is measured by the Sharpe ratio loss relative to the unhedged world
      index under the CAPM. The disposition effect measure is the difference between the proportion of gains realized and the proportion of losses realized
      during the year. A stock is classified as a gain if it outperforms the unhedged world index during the year, and as a loss otherwise. The estimation is
      based on participants at t and t+1 with direct stockholdings at t for which the immigration dummy is available. Mistakes are expressed in percentage
      points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous characteristics are also standardized year by year.

                share inertia and the disposition effect measure, and the adjusted R2 of all three mistakes. The proportionality
                coefficient of underdiversification is by definition equal to unity and is not reported. Mistakes are expressed in

      Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics when risky share inertia is proxied by the market
      measure. Underdiversification is measured by the Sharpe ratio loss relative to the unhedged world index under the CAPM. The market measure of risky
      share inertia is the absolute value of the difference between the household’s log risky share, ln(wh,t+1 ), and its log passive share if it holds the unhedged
      world index during the year, ln(ωp(wh,t,rm,t+1)). The disposition effect measure is the difference between the proportion of gains realized and the proportion
      of losses realized during the year. A stock is classified as a gain if it outperforms the unhedged world index during the year, and as a loss otherwise. The
      estimation is based on participants at t and t+1 with direct stockholdings at t for which the immigration dummy is available. Mistakes are expressed in
      percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous characteristics are also standardized year by year.

Notes: This table reports the cross-sectional correlation of investment mistakes. The measure of each mistake and the set of households are the same as in Table A22. In the top left
panel we compute the correlation of observed mistakes, in the bottom right panel the correlation of predicted mistakes, and in the bottom left panel the correlation between predicted and
observed mistakes. All mistakes are demeaned year by year, and predicted mistakes are computed using the pooled regressions reported in Table A22.

               Notes: This table reports the pooled restricted regression of the negative of investment mistakes on household
               characteristics. The measure of each mistake and the set of households are the same as in Tables A22 and
               A23. In Panel A, we compute the coefficients of the sophistication index, their t-statistics, as well as the simple
               correlation of the index with each characteristic. In Panel B, we report the proportionality coefficient of risky
               share inertia and the disposition effect measure, and the adjusted R2 of all three mistakes. The proportionality
               coefficient of underdiversification is by definition equal to unity and is not reported. Mistakes are expressed in
               percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous
               characteristics are also standardized year by year.

      Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics when underdiversification is proxied by the share
      of direct stockholdings in the risky portfolio. Risky share inertia is proxied by the absolute value of changes in the log risky share. The disposition effect
      measure is the difference between the proportion of gains realized and the proportion of losses realized during the year. A stock is classified as a gain if
      it outperforms the unhedged world index during the year, and as a loss otherwise. The estimation is based on participants at t and t+1 with direct
      stockholdings at t for which the immigration dummy is available. Mistakes are expressed in percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are
      demeaned year by year, and continuous characteristics are also standardized year by year.

Notes: This table reports the cross-sectional correlation of investment mistakes. The measure of each mistake and the set of households are the same as in Table A26. In the top left
panel we compute the correlation of observed mistakes, in the bottom right panel the correlation of predicted mistakes, and in the bottom left panel the correlation between predicted and
observed mistakes. All mistakes are demeaned year by year, and predicted mistakes are computed using the pooled regressions reported in Table A26.

                A27. In Panel A, we compute the coefficients of the sophistication index, their t-statistics, as well as the simple
                correlation of the index with each characteristic. In Panel B, we report the proportionality coefficient of risky
                share inertia and the disposition effect measure, and the adjusted R2 of all three mistakes. The proportionality
                coefficient of underdiversification is by definition equal to unity and is not reported. Mistakes are expressed in
                percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous

      Notes: This table reports the pooled regressions of investment mistakes on household characteristics when underdiversification is proxied by the
      imputed Sharpe ratio loss relative to the unhedged index under the CAPM. Risky share inertia is proxied by the absolute value of changes in the log
      risky share. The disposition effect measure is the difference between the proportion of gains realized and the proportion of losses realized during the
      year. A stock is classified as a gain if it outperforms the unhedged world index during the year, and as a loss otherwise. The estimation is based on
      participants at t and t+1 with direct stockholdings at t for which the immigration dummy is available. Mistakes are expressed in percentage points. All
      mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous characteristics are also standardized year by year.

Notes: This table reports the cross-sectional correlation of investment mistakes. The measure of each mistake and the set of households are the same as in Table A29. In the top left
panel we compute the correlation of observed mistakes, in the bottom right panel the correlation of predicted mistakes, and in the bottom left panel the correlation between predicted and
observed mistakes. All mistakes are demeaned year by year, and predicted mistakes are computed using the pooled regressions reported in Table A29.

               Notes: This table reports the pooled restricted regression of the negative of investment mistakes on household
               characteristics. The measure of each mistake and the set of households are the same as in Tables A29 and
               A30. In Panel A, we compute the coefficients of the sophistication index, their t-statistics, as well as the simple
               correlation of the index with each characteristic. In Panel B, we report the proportionality coefficient of risky
               share inertia and the disposition effect measure, and the adjusted R2 of all three mistakes. The proportionality
               coefficient of underdiversification is by definition equal to unity and is not reported. Mistakes are expressed in
               percentage points. All mistakes and characteristics are demeaned year by year, and continuous
               characteristics are also standardized year by year.
