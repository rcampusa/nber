                                            ABSTRACT

The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a project-based carbon trade mechanism that subsidizes
the users of climate-friendly technologies and encourages technology transfer. The CDM has provided
financial support for a large share of Chinese wind projects since 2002. Using pooled cross-sectional
data of 486 registered CDM wind projects in China from 2002 to 2009, we examine the determinants
of technological change in wind power from a learning perspective. We estimate the effects of different
channels of learning—learning through R&D in wind turbine manufacturing, learning from previous
experience of installation, and learning through the network interaction between project developer
and turbine manufacturer—on technological change, measured as reductions in projected costs or as
increased capacity factor across CDM wind projects. While we find that a manufacturer’s R&D and
previous installation experience matter, interactions between wind turbine manufacturers and wind
project developer lead to the largest cost reductions. Whereas existing literature suggests that wind
power firms can learn from the experience of other wind farm developers, our results indicate that
wind power firms mainly learn from their own experience and that knowledge spillovers mostly occur
within certain partnerships between wind project developer and foreign turbine manufacturers in China’s
wind power industry.

1.     Introduction

       As the world’s largest energy consumer and carbon dioxide (CO2) emitter, China’s

energy consumption and carbon emissions are a focus of global climate change and energy

security talks. Because China has abundant wind resources with great development potential,

increasing the share of wind in China’s energy mix is a promising solution (Wang, 2010).

China’s wind industry has developed rapidly during the past ten years. After experiencing

annual growth rates of wind installed capacity over 100% from 2003 to 2009, China became the

worlds’ largest wind power country in terms of cumulative installed capacity in 2010 (GWEC,

2012). As a result of this massive wind capacity expansion, China has also developed a domestic

wind power equipment supply chain. China’s three largest domestic wind turbine manufacturers

were ranked among the top ten wind turbine manufacturers in the world by 2010 (Wang et al.,

2012). This immense progress is driven by a variety of policy instruments that the Chinese

government has implemented to incentivize investment in wind energy, including domestic

policies and international support.

       Perhaps the most notable international support program for the development of renewable

energy in China is the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The CDM is an international

carbon trade mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol that assists developed countries to fulfill their

committed emission reductions through financing projects that can reduce carbon emissions in

developing countries. A secondary goal of the CDM is to help developing countries achieve

sustainable development. The transfer of climate-friendly technologies from developed countries

to recipient countries can help with the goal of achieving sustainable development, particularly if

the technologies transferred lead to knowledge spillovers that reduce the future costs of

emissions reductions within the country (Popp, 2011). In this paper, we use data on CDM wind



                                                                                                 1
projects in China to assess the impact of technology transfer and learning on renewable energy

costs in the country. We ask whether expected project costs fall after other similar projects in the

country. Moreover, we consider whether costs fall throughout the country or just locally. More

localized effects suggest spillovers, whereas project costs falling throughout the country (and

perhaps across the world as well) suggest other types of technological changes at work, such as

the development of more efficient turbines by leading global manufacturers. In addition, we also

test the effects of different learning channels, such as R&D in wind turbine manufacturing,

previous installation experience, and collaboration between turbine manufacturers and project

developers, on technological change.

       Our study contributes to both the CDM and technological learning literature. Existing

studies examining CDM’s efficacy on transfer of renewable energy technologies and the

subsequent diffusion of these technologies in developing countries are mostly qualitative and

descriptive. These papers argue that the CDM has promoted the development of renewable

energy in developing countries, but the impacts vary across technologies and countries (Lewis,

2010; Schneider, 2008; Schneider et al., 2010; Wang, 2010). While some empirical studies

analyze the determinants of technology transfer via CDM projects (Seres, 2007& 2009;

Dechezlepretre, 2008& 2009; Hascic & Johhnstone, 2011; Schindm, 2011), empirical evidence

on the effectiveness of technology transfer and the diffusion of the technologies—the

technological progress induced by CDM projects—is inadequate. Using CDM wind projects in

China as our sample, we attempt to fill this intellectual gap by providing empirical evidence on

technological progress in China’s CDM wind projects, and on the learning channels that have led

to this technological progress.




                                                                                                  2
       Our paper adds to the learning literature by incorporating collaboration theories to

explain the learning process and providing evidence for a learning-by-interacting effect. The

detailed data in CDM project design documents (PDD) allows us to study the relationship among

various actors in the development of China’s wind industry, including project developers and

turbine manufacturers. Built on the existing literature that tests learning-by-doing and learning-

by-searching effects (Junginger et al., 2005; Taylor et al., 2006; Nemet, 2006 & 2012;

Soderholm & Klassen, 2007; Soderholm & Sundqvist, 2007; Qiu and Anadon, 2012; Patridge,

2013), we show that the collaborations between project developers and turbine manufacturers are

important sources of learning that takes place in the Chinese wind industry. In addition, our

paper provides one of the first empirical studies of learning in the Chinese wind industry.

       Our research has policy implications for international climate policy makers and the

Chinese government. Studying one of the world’s largest wind power producers in which most

of the wind projects are supported by CDM, our research sheds light on how CDM, as a demand-

side policy subsidizing the adoption of wind technologies, can be used to facilitate technological

change in wind power. Although the evidence of knowledge spillovers is not apparent, the

learning-by-doing effect itself still provides justification for demand-side subsidies to price

negative externalities and stimulate demand in order to provide opportunities for learning-by-

doing. Moreover, the evidence of learning-by-interacting effect between foreign turbine

manufacturers and local wind farm developers indicates that the financial support from CDM

could also result in technological progress in developing countries through increasing the

opportunities of technology transfer. By focusing on the roles of various actors in the wind

industry, our research increases the understanding of the learning process in China’s wind

industry and helps the Chinese government better target policies to facilitate different channels



                                                                                                3
of learning, especially learning through the collaboration between wind farm developers and

turbine manufacturers.

       We proceed with a review of previous work on policy tools and technological change in

China’s wind power, including a discussion of the important roles of CDM in the development of

China’s wind industry, and the standardized CDM project process. Section 3 provides the

theoretical framework for learning process in wind projects and presents our hypotheses. Section

4 discusses the data and empirical models that we use to test the effects of different channels of

learning. Section 5 and section 6 analyze the empirical results and summarizes our main

conclusions respectively.

2.     The CDM and the Development of China’s Wind Industry

2.1    Policy instruments and technological change in China’s wind industry

       There are two market failures in the innovation and adoption of renewable energy

technologies – the non-priced environmental damages caused by fossil fuel energy and the

under-investment in new technologies due to knowledge spillovers. For the wind industry, wind

power is currently less cost-competitive than electricity generated from coal and natural gas

because the negative externalities of fossil fuel power are not included in energy prices.

Moreover, private firms do not consider the potential social benefits from knowledge spillovers

when investing in wind technology, leading to underinvestment.

       Due to these market failures, policy tools are often used to induce technological change

in wind energy. The Chinese government has implemented a bundle of domestic policies to

facilitate wind power deployment and to promote domestic wind technology advancement, such

as the national wind concession program, mandating that a share of electricity be generated from

renewable energy, tax relief for wind farms, a power surcharge for renewables, and R&D



                                                                                                4
subsidies. Moreover, the Chinese government has also actively engaged in international

collaboration to foster international technology transfer and redirect domestic investment in wind

technology (Zhang et al., 2009; Lewis, 2010). As shown in Table 1, these policy instruments can

be further classified as supply-side policies that subsidize the wind technology R&D activities

and demand-side policies that subsidize the demand for wind technologies. CDM is an

international financial support that subsidies the users of wind technologies.

                                                      [Table 1]

         Previous studies on the relationship between policy instruments and the technological

achievement in China’s wind industry are mainly qualitative and descriptive. They

systematically reviewed policies that support wind industry, and then described the technological

change in terms of the upgrading of wind turbine size, increased innovation and patenting

activities of domestic turbine manufacturers, and cost reduction in turbine manufacturing and

electricity generation (Zhang et al., 2009; Wang, 2010; Ru et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2012; Wang

et al., 2012; Lewis, 2013). Although some scholars studied how the policy support induced the

technological progress in wind turbine manufacturing industry (Ru et al., 2012; Lewis, 2013),

most descriptive and qualitative research did not analyze the link between policy instruments and

the technological change.

       Empirical research explaining technological change in China’s wind power is rare. Using

wind projects from China’s national concession programs1 from 2003 to 2007, Qiu and Anadon

(2012) applied the learning curve model to examine the factors influencing the price of wind


1
 Prior to 2009, any wind project in China with capacities over 50 MW would go through a national concession
bidding process managed by the central government to select its developer. Potential developers were invited to join
this public bidding process. The bidder who offered the “best price” under the terms provided by the bidding method
would win the right to build the wind farm and sell the electricity at its bidding price to the grid. From 2003 to 2008,
five rounds of national concession bidding programs produced 18 wind projects (Zhang et al., 2009; Wang et al.,
2012; Qiu et al., 2012).

                                                                                                                      5
power measured by the bidding price of each bidder participating in the national concession

programs. They found that the joint-learning from technology adoption and wind projects

installation experience, localization of wind turbine manufacturing, and wind farm economies of

scale significantly affect the price of wind power. However, their sample only included 15 wind

projects, which accounts for less than 50% of the total installed capacity nationwide during the

observing period. In addition to its small sample, the bidding price they use may underestimate

the production cost of wind power. Large players, such as big state-owned developers that are

not driven by a profit-maximization objective, could commit to below cost prices in order to win

the contract first (Yang et al, 2010; Wang, 2010). The estimated internal rate of return (IRR) in

those proposals were often below the industrial benchmark (Li et al., 2008). 2

        In this paper, we use data from CDM wind projects in China to explain technological

change in China’s wind power. This data provides a more representative sample and less

distorted production cost of wind power, as described in more detail below. Moreover, our

empirical analysis on CDM wind projects sheds light on how international support, such as

CDM, leads to technological progress in wind power, which is often neglected in previous

qualitative and descriptive research.

2.2 CDM as a demand-side policy for wind technology

        As a demand-side policy that subsidizes the users of wind technology, CDM has, to a

great extent, facilitated the adoption of wind technology in China since 2002. As shown in

Figure 1, the annual incremental installed capacity from wind projects registered as CDM

projects contributes to a large share of the annual incremental installed capacity in China. From

2003 to 2009, the total installed capacity from CDM wind projects account for 74.7% of the total


2
 According to the State Power Corporation’s “Interim Rules on Economic Assessment of Electrical Engineering
Retrofit Projects”, the benchmark IRR for a project in power industry is 8% of the total investment.

                                                                                                              6
installed capacity in China.     To incentivize investment in wind, the Chinese government

encouraged and even acted as a broker to engage wind farm developers in CDM project

application. During the project design stage, local government agencies in charge of approving

wind farm development proposals would recommend CDM to some proposed projects with IRR

below the industrial benchmark in order to overcome their financial obstacles. At the national

level, industrial associations such as the Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association,

which manage the industry on behalf of the government, hold workshops to help renewable

energy project developers learn CDM rules and process (Lin et al., 2004).

                                             [Figure 1]

       In addition to increasing wind power deployment, CDM has also improved wind project

operation and management by helping China’s wind industry to learn about advanced wind

technologies and scientific monitoring mechanisms. One approximate measurement for wind

technology progress that has been used in many previous studies is the size of wind turbines (Ru

et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012). In our sample, the average size of the wind turbines used in

CDM projects increased from 0.90 MW in 2002 to 1.45 MW in 2009. As further evidence of the

development of China’s domestic wind industry, note that, since 2006, the majority of installed

capacity in CDM projects are turbines produced by Chinese wind turbine manufacturers.


2.3 The standardized CDM project process and the validity of project documents

       All CDM wind projects are registered and managed in a highly standardized and

transparent process according to the CDM legal framework under the Kyoto Protocol. The key

criteria for CDM project approval is whether a project demonstrates its “additionality”, which

means that the proposed wind project could not be developed without the revenue from CDM

carbon trading due to high financial risk or technical barriers. If a project cannot demonstrate the


                                                                                                  7
additionality by using methods provided by CDM rules, its application will be rejected. Once the

CDM executive board (EB) approves a wind project for CDM registration, the project can get

emission credits, known as certified emission reductions (CERs), based on its annual electricity

generation. The project developer can sell these CERs to emission credit buyers from developed

countries and use this revenue to subsidize its investment. On average, the economic incentive

from CDM revenue is about 0.05 to 0.1 RMB/kWh, which approximately equals 10%-20% of

the electricity price of wind power (Lewis, 2010 & 2013; Li, 2010; Zhang et al, 2009).

       A typical CDM wind project cycle has six steps, as shown in Figure 2. First, a wind

project developer prepares and submits a standardized PDD and supporting materials, including

a financial analysis. The PDD and supporting materials must be validated by a third party

auditing agency (i.e. the designated operational entity, or DOE) accredited by the EB according

to check whether the proposed project meets the CDM requirements before it can register as a

CDM project. During its operational phase, carbon emission reductions from the project activity

are monitored and verified by another third party agency according to methods specified in the

validated PDD. The EB issues CERs to the project developer based on the verification.

                                           [Figure 2]

       These independent and transparent auditing and monitoring procedures ensure the

validity of the CDM PDDs. For all projects reaching the registration step, their PDD and

supporting financial analysis are available on the CDM official website for public comments

before registration. In addition, the validation and monitoring reports are also available on the

CDM website to provide a record of the complete process.

3.     Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses




                                                                                               8
       The CDM has subsidized the majority of China’s wind projects and has facilitated the

technological change of China’s wind industry during the past ten years. We use CDM wind

projects in China to analyze the learning process in China’s wind industry and to examine the

effects of different channels of learning on technological change. We measure technological

change as the reduction of electricity production cost across different wind projects. The learning

process in our study refers to how knowledge related to wind power is acquired and diffused

among different participants in the wind projects, including project developers and wind turbine

manufacturers. In China, power generation and power transmission are separated. Wind project

developers are power companies in charge of power generation, which are either state-owned

enterprises or private power companies. Project developers purchase wind turbines from either

domestic or foreign wind turbine manufacturers, who work closely with project developers.

       Following the technological learning and collaboration theories, we identify the

following channels of learning that could lead reduced electricity production costs.

3.1    Learning by doing (LBD)

       The traditional learning curve model explains increased productivity, typically measured

through reduced production costs, as a function of learning from the accumulation of experience

in production (Arrow, 1962). Experience curves have been widely used to model the cost

reduction of renewable technologies, such as solar photovoltaics, wind turbine manufacturing,

and wind power production (Grubler et al., 1999; Ibenholt, 2002; Junginger et al., 2005; Nemet,

2006 & 2012; Qiu and Anadon, 2012; Patridge, 2013).

       In wind power, the unit cost of electricity production could be reduced through the

accumulation of experience in wind turbine manufacturing and installation, and/or through the

accumulation of experience in wind project development and operation. As the wind turbine



                                                                                                 9
manufacturer’s experience in turbine production and installation increases over time, the cost of

manufacturing a wind turbine and installing a wind turbine may decrease. Similarly, experience

of developing and operating wind projects helps project developers learn more about choosing a

quality site, selecting a suitable wind turbine and operating the wind farm efficiently. Such

experience will result in lower costs for wind power. Thus, the first two hypotheses we test are:

      H1: The more experience the CDM project developer has developing and operating wind

projects, the lower the unit production costs of the current project will be.

      H2: The greater the production and installation experience of a project’s wind turbine

manufacturer, the lower the unit production costs of the current CDM project will be.

3.2      Knowledge spillover effects

         Within the learning-by-doing literature, a subset of papers identify knowledge spillover

effects. These papers find that firms can learn from a competitor firm’s experience, but that

internal experience has a larger effect (Thornton and Thompson, 2001). Once a new technology

has been commercialized, its use is hard to hide from rival firms. Thus, wind power companies

can also learn how to develop and operate a wind farm from the experience of other developer’s

wind projects (Nemet, 2012; Qiu and Anadon, 2012).              To test both the existence and

appropriability of learning-by-doing, Nemet (2012) uses a panel data of wind projects in

California. He estimates the learning effects on wind farm installation and operation from

internal experience at both the project and firm level, and from external experience both within

the state of California and in the global wind market. The results indicate that wind farm

developers learn from their own projects and from the experience of other firms in both

installation and operation. Such external spillovers justify policies that subsidize the demand for

wind technology. Similarly, Qiu and Anadon’s work (2012) on the wind industry in China also



                                                                                                10
shows learning from industrial experience, but it is not clear that the Chinese wind developers

learn from their own experience. As they point out, the details of all bids were made public every

year, providing a source for other developers to learn. For CDM projects, the transparent project

registration and monitoring process allows information sharing on project design and operation

among project developers, which may particularly facilitate the knowledge spillovers across

CDM projects. Therefore, we also test:

      H3: Increased experience developing and operating wind projects by other firms in the

industry also leads to lower unit production costs for the current CDM project.

3.3      Learning by searching (LBS)

         Wind technology innovation through research, development and demonstration (RD&D),

often referred to as “learning-by-searching” (LBS), can also lead to wind power cost reductions

(Junginger et al, 2005; Kahouli-Brahmi, 2008; Qiu and Anadon, 2012). Examples of

technological improvements through RD&D include larger turbines, lighter materials, more

efficient turbine design and improved control systems, which could either reduce the cost of a

wind turbine or increase the efficiency of converting wind energy to electricity. Extending

traditional one-factor learning curve models to include R&D, several recent studies use two-

factor learning models to disentangle the impacts of R&D and cumulative experience on

technological change in wind power (Soderholm & Klassen, 2007; Soderholm & Sundqvist,

2007; Qiu and Anadon, 2012). While the empirical studies of the European wind power sector

suggest that R&D is the dominant factor, Qiu and Anadon’s research, which covers just a five

year period, does not successfully separate the effect of LBS and LBD due to the

multicollinearity between their LBD and LBS variables. We use a manufacturer-specific stock

of knowledge, described in section 4, to identify and test the learning-by-searching effect:



                                                                                               11
    H4: The greater the knowledge stock that a wind turbine manufacturer has accumulated

through its R&D, the lower the unit production cost of the CDM project using its turbines

will be.

3.4 Learning by interacting (LBI)

       The literature on technological learning also discusses another channel of learning –

learning by interacting (LBI). Improving network interactions between research institutes,

manufacturers and end-users allows for better diffusion of knowledge (Grubler, 1998; Junginger

et al, 2005). Collaborative and long-term partnerships increase the likelihood of tacit knowledge

transfer by increasing trust between the two parties and reducing information asymmetry

(Schneider, 2008).   Similarly, interagency collaboration facilitates resource and knowledge

sharing among network partners. In inter-firm networks, firms can have some degrees of access

to the specialized knowledge of their partners while exploiting and enhancing the existing

knowledge and capacities within themselves (Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Inkpen and Beamish

1997). The trust that network partners have between each other is found to be instrumental in

reducing transaction costs, improving investments and stability in relations, and stimulating

learning, knowledge sharing, and innovation (Koppenjan and Klijin, 2004). Previous cooperative

ties between the network partners are positively associated with the development of inter-firm

trust (Inkpen & Currall 2004).

       In a wind project, the project developer works with its turbine supplier in many stages,

such as turbine installation, operation and maintenance. Thus, another important channel of

technological learning in wind projects could be the joint learning between project developer and

wind turbine manufacturer on installation and operation through their collaboration in one or

multiple wind projects. According to the CDM PDDs we have examined, frequent



                                                                                              12
communication and training activities regarding operation and maintenance between turbine

suppliers and project developers contributes to the absorption and dissemination of wind

technologies, particularly the advanced technologies embedded in the imported turbines.

Therefore, we test the learning-by-interacting effect separately:

       H5: The more cooperation that the developer has with the same manufacturer prior to the

current CDM project, the lower the unit production cost of this project will be.

4.          Data and Descriptive Statistics

            To examine the effects that different learning channels have on electricity production

costs across wind projects, we use pooled cross-sectional data of 510 registered CDM wind

projects in China that started construction from 2002 to 2009. After we exclude the observations

that have missing data for some variables, the sample that we use for empirical analysis has 486

projects. These projects were developed by 87 developers and used wind turbines from 23

turbine manufacturers. Therefore, many developers and turbine manufactures participated in

more than one CDM wind project in China. A developer may have cooperated with the same

wind turbine manufacturer in several projects.

            We combine several datasets for this study. The CDM project data, including information

on project costs, project size, turbine size, annual electricity production, project developer, and

turbine manufacturers, is collected from the validated CDM PDDs and their financial analyses.3

Data on provincial level and manufacturer’s installed capacity comes from the Chinese Wind

Energy Association’s annual reports. Although there are some wind projects not included in the

CDM database, non-CDM installed capacity only accounts for a small share of the total installed

Delphion database.

4.1      Key variables

4.11     Dependent variables

         We use several dependent variables to examine different aspects of technological change.

To measure the overall technological change in wind power, we use the per unit electricity

production cost of the wind farm as our primary dependent variable, enabling us to compare our

results with the previous literature on technological learning in wind power. To further explore

how different learning channels drive down the unit production cost, we decompose the overall

learning effects into two subsystems of learning: wind farm construction and installation, and

wind farm operation. We examine these two subsystems by looking at capital cost per kWh and

the capacity factor of the wind farm correspondingly.

      1) Electricity production cost

        The primary dependent variable is the projected unit cost of electricity production of

project i that starts construction in year t (Unit_costit), also known as the levelized cost. We

calculate the per unit production cost by dividing the project life cost by its life electricity

production estimated in the project financial analysis, which captures the projected average cost

of generating one unit (kWh) of electricity by the project. The unit cost is calculated as follows:

                                                                 &
                                _                                      /


where Captitalj is the static construction investment in the jth year in project life, O&Mj is the

annual operation and maintenance expenditures in year j, and Electricityj represents the annual

 We use installed capacity data from 2002 to 2008 to calculate the previous installation experience that a developer
or a manufacturer has. The non-CDM installed capacity only accounts for 13% of the total installed capacity in
China.

                                                                                                                  14
electricity generated by the wind farm in year j.5 Both project costs and electricity production are

discounted at a discount rate r = 8%, which is the industrial benchmark IRR on total investment.6

The year that project i starts construction, represented by t, corresponds to the first year in its

project life (i.e. j=1). We adjust all cost variables to 2005 prices.

           While the cost data from CDM project design documents and financial analyses are

expected costs, using the CDM data provides several advantages.                           To prove additionality,

proposed projects must not be financially viable without the revenue from selling emissions

credits.     Thus, project developers have no incentive to understate costs, which would

overestimate technological progress. At the same time, since we only use projects that have been

validated and registered, the proposed project costs have been evaluated by independent auditors.

Projected costs that are unreasonably high would lead to rejection of a proposed project. For

capital costs, the validating agencies usually crosscheck estimated capital costs with the actual

costs specified in construction and equipment purchase contracts. According to the CDM

validation guidelines and the validation reports we have examined, the estimated capital costs are

very close to the real capital investment. Moreover, many project design documents used actual

capital costs in their financial analyses.7 For O&M costs, the auditing agencies compared the

estimated costs with public statistics and other similar CDM wind projects. Based on the




5
  Although the annual electricity production data we collect from validated CDM project design documents are
estimated generation, the electricity generation is monitored after the project starts its operation. According to the
monitoring reports that we have examined, the estimated annual electricity production is very close to the actual
electricity generation.
6
  According to the State Power Corporation’s “Interim Rules on Economic Assessment of Electrical Engineering
Retrofit Projects”, the benchmark IRR for a project in power industry is 8% of the total investment.
7
  To rule out the possibility that the project developers learn to produce more accurate cost estimation over time, we
used stratified sampling to select 51 of our 510 projects by the year that a project started construction. For projects
before 2006, the validation reports do not provide actual cost data, but they claim that they have cross-checked with
the actual data and the estimation are consistent with the actual capital investment. For projects starting from 2006 to
2009, the estimated costs are very close to the real capital costs for all years. Based on this validation, we believe
that the possibility of better cost estimation is small.

                                                                                                                    15
comparison, they must determine that the projected O&M cost data used in CDM project design

document are reasonable before validating the project.

        Thus, we believe that our cost measurement is more reasonable and credible than the

national concession bidding prices used by Qiu and Anadon (2012). As discussed in section 2.1,

bidding prices in the national concession program may be much lower than the actual price,

which is often a strategy used by developers to win the project first without considering the long-

term project profitability (Li et al., 2008; Yang et al, 2009; Wang, 2010). Absent the availability

of actual cost data for Chinese wind farms, we believe that our validated CDM data provide the

most accurate representation of electricity production costs for wind projects in China.

    2) Unit capital cost

        Wind farm capital investment costs have a major influence on the costs of electricity

production (Junginger et al., 2005). Investment costs include costs such as turbine foundations,

land, grid connection, civil works, and turbine installation. We calculate the estimated unit

capital cost in a similar way to total unit costs:


                                   _                          /


    3) Capacity factor

        We use projected capacity factor to measure the operational performance of a wind farm.

The capacity factor is the ratio of the actual electricity produced by a wind farm in a given period

to its potential output if the wind farm was operated at full nameplate capacity for the entire

period. We calculate the capacity factor of a CDM wind project using the following formula:


                                           /     ∗        ∗




                                                                                                 16
         The capacity factor of a wind farm is mostly determined by the availability of wind on

the site. Given the wind quality in a particular region, we expect additional experience will help a

developer pick a better site, select suitable wind turbines and make the best use of the wind

resource at the site, all of which lead to increased capacity factor. In addition, the quality of wind

turbines and the interactions between the developer and its turbine manufacturing partners may

also help to improve performance.

4.12 Manufacturer’s knowledge stock

         To test the effect of learning by searching on electricity production cost, we create a

manufacturer’s knowledge stock (LBSmft), using cumulative patent applications related to wind

power from the manufacturer supplying wind turbines to project i. We lag the manufacturer’s

knowledge stock to account for the time needed to convert an innovation to mass manufacturing.

Since knowledge related to wind power may depreciate over time, we use a 15% depreciation

rate to calculate the knowledge stock in our empirical model, which is a typical knowledge decay

rate used in the R&D literature (Griliches, 1995; Popp, 2004). 8 The knowledge stock variable is

calculated as follow:

                                      LBSmft=LBSt-1*(1-ρ) + NPt-1            (1)

where LBSt-1 represents the existing knowledge stock from year t-1, ρ is the depreciation rate,

and NPt-1 represents the number of new patents that the manufacturer applied for in year t-1.

         We identify each turbine manufacturer’s patent applications in China relevant to wind

energy, which include innovations pertaining to wind turbine manufacturing, installation, testing




8
  We also test the effects of knowledge stock calculated with a 10% depreciation rate. The results are not sensitive to
the choice of discount rates.

                                                                                                                    17
and monitoring, and maintenance. 9 We date these applications by the priority date, as this

corresponds most closely to when the innovative activity actually took place. 10 We use data

collected for each manufacturer by year to calculate the cumulative knowledge stock. If a CDM

project use wind turbines from two manufacturers, we calculate the weighted average knowledge

stock using the shares of their installed capacity in this project as weights.

4.13 Experience at different levels and spillovers

         We test the effects of wind project developing and operating experience for different

participants and at different levels. At the micro level, we have a project developer’s experience

(LBDdev) and the turbine manufacturer’s experience (LBDmft). At the aggregate level, we test the

spillover effects of provincial level wind project experience (Spillprovince) and the experience from

the whole industry (Spillindustry). The experience variables are measured by the cumulative

installed capacities through year t-1 at developer level, manufacturer level, province level, and

industrial level respectively. To test the spillover effects, the experience of project i’s developer

and manufacturer is subtracted from the aggregate level experience, so that aggregate experience

for each project i can be interpreted as the experience of the rest of the industry.

         Finally, we measure collaboration between a project developer and manufacturer (LBI)

by calculating the cumulative capacity of previous CDM projects using both the same developer

and manufacturer. This can be thought of as the shared CDM experience between the developer

and the manufacturer. If a CDM project use wind turbines from two manufacturers, we calculate

the weighted average cooperating CDM experience using the shares of their installed capacity in

this project as weights.


9
  We identify the relevant patents by using the International Patent Classification (IPC), which is a classification
system developed by the World Intellectual Property Organization and used by patent offices around the world to
identify the technology represented in each patent. IPC classification F03D represents wind energy patents.
10
   For a patent application, priority date is the earliest application date anywhere in the world.

                                                                                                                       18
4.2       Control variables

          To accurately assess the impact of learning on our dependent variables, we must also

control for other project features that affect the unit production costs or productivity:

         Wind turbine size (Turbine_sizei). Larger wind turbines access greater wind resources

available at greater heights, allowing them to capture more energy so as to produce more power.

If a CDM project has more than one type of wind turbine, we use average wind turbine size.

         Wind project scale (Project_sizei). Wind projects with larger installed capacity will

have economies of scale. As a result, the unit production cost will be reduced (Berry 2009, Qiu

and Anadon, 2012; Partridge, 2013).

         Wind resource quality. If the project site has better wind resources, it should have

higher productivity. The wind resource quality is measured by dummy variables

      ,    ,    W4i , representing the four wind resource categories specified by the 2009 Feed-in

Tariffs for Wind Power in China (NDRC, 2009). W1i indicates that project i is located in the best

wind quality region while W4i indicates the region with the least wind resources.

         Characteristics of manufacturers and developers. If the wind turbine manufacturer is a

foreign company, Foreignmft equals to 1. Although some foreign manufacturers have developed

subsidiaries in China, we still treat them as foreign manufacturers because their patents belong to

the parent companies.

          We also control for the ownership of the project developer. We classify project

developers into three groups based on their ownership and market power in electricity generation

market: state-owned enterprises (SOE) regulated and supervised by central government, SOEs

regulated and supervised by local government, and private enterprises (Li et al., 2012). We

expect that central SOE developers, on average, have the lowest production costs among the


                                                                                                19
three categories because they dominate the electricity generation market and have more

bargaining power when developing a wind project. By the end of 2011, the top nine central SOE

developers contributed 73.8% of China’s cumulative installed capacity (Li et al., 2012). From

2006 to 2010, SOEs developed 90% of wind projects in China (Li et al., 2010 & 2012).

         Table 2 summarizes the description of explanatory variables for different channels of

learning and control variables.

                                                      [Table 2]

4.3      Descriptive statistics

         Table 3 reports summary statistics for the major variables used in our empirical models.

                                                      [Table 3]

         Figure 3 shows the trend of the average unit cost of CDM projects started from 2004 to

2009.11 We also decompose the unit cost into the unit capital cost and unit O&M cost. All costs

are calculated using 2005 prices. In Figure 3, we see that the unit production cost and its two

components generally have downward trends from 2005 to 2009, which is consistent with the

rapid technological progress in China’s wind power during this period. The unit project cost falls

by 12.1 % and the unit capital cost falls by 10.8 %. Unit O&M cost drops most sharply,

decreasing 17.4 % from 2005 to 2009.12

                                                      [Figure 3]

         While we observe that the average project unit cost and its components have downward

trends from 2005 to 2009, project capacity factors, as shown in Figure 4, do not show a clear

trend during this period. Since the capacity factor is mainly determined by the wind resource


11
   Although the earliest CDM wind projects in China started in 2002, we cannot calculate their unit costs due to
missing data in their project design documents.
12
   While the average project cost is lower in 2004, we only have one observation that has cost data among the 4
projects that started in 2004 in our sample. Thus, these data may not be representative of all the projects in 2004.

                                                                                                                       20
available, one possibility is that projects started earlier could pick sites with better wind

resources, leaving limited choices for later projects.

                                             [Figure 4]

5.     Empirical Model and Results

       To explain what has led to the project cost reduction over time, we test the effects of

different learning channels gradually in three steps using OLS regressions, with each step adding

additional detail on the level of learning from experience. First, we test the effects of aggregate

experience, using only province level experience and experience from the nation as a whole. In

the second step, we separate both the developer’s and the manufacturer’s project experience from

aggregate experience. In the last step, we test the effects of learning-by-interacting by further

separating the shared CDM project experience between the developer and the manufacturer from

their cumulative individual experience. In all three steps, we examine the effect of learning-by-

searching from the manufacturer.

       In addition to testing the learning effects on overall electricity production costs, we

further examine the two subsystems of learning – wind farm installation and operation – by using

unit capital cost and capacity factor as dependent variables correspondingly. This allows us to

see where the cost reduction occurs and how different learning channels influence the

subsystems of electricity production.

5.1    Aggregate level experience

       As the first step, we test the effects of provincial and industrial level experience using

equation (2), which includes the manufacturer’s knowledge stock, provincial installation

experience, and nation-wide installation experience. We subtract provincial experience from




                                                                                                21
national level experience to separate spillovers from the province where a project is located from

spillovers due to experience in other provinces.13

                  _



         To control for the effects of other factors that influence electricity production cost, we

also include all the control variables listed in Table 2, represented by Xi in equation (2). We use

province dummies to control for time-invariant heterogeneity across provinces, such as

topographical and meteorological features, transmission infrastructure, and the investment

environment. We further add year fixed effects to control for other omitted variables that change

over time for all projects starting in the same year, such as national policies, input prices, global

changes in technology, and other unobserved factors.

                                                     [Table 4]

         Table 4 reports the estimates of learning-by-searching effects and the effects of aggregate

level wind project developing and operating experience on unit production costs. We estimate

three models adding different fixed effects. The learning-by-searching effect, captured by

manufacturer’s knowledge stock, is significant across all three models. However, the magnitude

of the LBS effect is very small. In the short run, one more patent from the manufacturer reduces

unit costs by just 0.04%. For the learning-by-doing effect, the aggregate level project developing

experience variables have significant negative effects on unit production costs only in models (1)

and (2), which omit year fixed effects. When we add year fixed effects in model (3), the

aggregate province level experience becomes insignificant. We do not include industrial level

experience when adding year fixed effects to the model, as the sum of provincial experience and

13
  While most learning models use a log-log format, so as to interpret the coefficients as learning rates, we do not
use logs for our explanatory variables as we have many zeros when decomposing experience in the later models.


                                                                                                                      22
industrial experience equals the total industry-wide capacity in a given year, and is thus

correlated with the year fixed effects.

       While the evidence of learning from macro level project experience is not clear, the

results for other control variables are as expected. Both project size and wind resource quality

significantly influence the project unit cost and the effects are consistent with existing literature.

Projects with larger size benefit from economies of scale, leading to a reduction of electricity

production cost. Projects located in regions with lower wind resource quality have higher unit

electricity generation cost than projects in regions with better wind quality.

       Characteristics of the turbine manufacturer and project developer also significantly affect

electricity production cost. On average, the unit costs of projects using wind turbines supplied by

foreign manufacturers are 4% to 5% higher than projects using wind turbines from domestic

manufacturers, suggesting that turbines from foreign manufacturers have higher prices than

domestic wind turbines even after controlling for a manufacturer’s knowledge stock embedded in

the turbines. Indeed, previous research has found that the higher costs of purchasing foreign wind

turbines is one reason that Chinese developers to apply for the CDM support (Wang, 2010). The

unit production costs of projects developed by central SOE developers are estimated to be

approximately 4% to 5% lower than the costs of private developers’ projects.

5.2    Effect of developer’s internal experience and spillover effects

       In the second step, we consider each project developer and manufacturer’s individual

experience. To do so, we must also subtract the developer’s experience, LBDdev, and the

manufacturer’s experience, LBDmft, from the aggregate level experience, Spillindustry. The

empirical model specification becomes:

          ln      _                                                               _

                                                                                                  (3)
                                                                                                   23
where Industry_spill is the knowledge spillover from other projects in the industry.14

         Table 5 shows the regression results of equation (3). Once again we estimate three model

specifications with different fixed effects. The LBS effect is significant across all the models and

the magnitude is similar to what we have found in 5.1. As we separate the developer’s CDM

project experience and manufacturer’s experience from the aggregate level experience, we

observe that learning from the developer’s previous CDM project experience significantly

reduces the project unit cost across all three models. With year fixed effects in model (3), the

magnitude of the coefficient on developer’s experience shows that the unit cost of wind power in

CDM projects nearly falls by 4% for each additional 1 GW of previous installed capacity in

CDM projects by the developer.               Given that the average size of a CDM wind project is

approximately 60 MW, a typical CDM project by the same developer leads to a 0.23% to 0.25%

decrease in future unit costs. Most central SOE developers and some local SOE developers have

around 10 new CDM projects in 2009, so that it will only take one to two years for these

developers to increase capacity by 1 GW. In contrast to developer experience, the manufacturer’s

previous project experience does not have a significant effect on unit production costs.

                                                     [Table 5]

         While we find some evidence of industry-level spillovers in section 5.1, the importance

of these spillovers disappears when we separate learning effects into experience of the turbine

manufacturer and experience of the project developer. In contrast, previous studies that find

evidence of wind power firms learning from the industrial experience (Nemet, 2012; Qiu and

Anadon, 2012) do not separately control for the experience of different actors in the industry.



14
    In equation (3), Industry_spill = Spillindustry – LBDdev – LBDmft + LBI. LBI is the previous cooperating experience
on joint projects between a developer and a manufacturer, which overlap between LBDmft and LBDdev. Thus, we add
it back to avoid double subtraction from industrial experience.

                                                                                                                   24
5.3        Effects of collaborating experience and other channels of learning

           Finally, we examine the role of collaboration in CDM wind projects. Here, we consider

experience on joint projects between a developer and a manufacturer separately from both the

developer and manufacturer’s experience on other projects. The empirical model is:

                                                      ln         _

                                  _                   _                               _

                                                                       (4)


where LBI represents the shared cumulative installed capacities in CDM projects between the

developer and the manufacturer. We separate this shared experience from their own cumulative

installed capacities. 15 In this way, we are able to examine the effect of learning-by-doing and

learning-by-interacting separately. Industry_spill is the knowledge spillover from other projects

in the industry as calculate in section 5.2.

           Table 6 reports the estimates of different learning effects. Model (1) only has province

fixed effects and Model (2) adds year fixed effects. Model (3) further includes an interaction

term between foreign manufacturer dummy and the previous cooperating experience between the

developer and manufacturer in order to tests whether the collaboration with a foreign

manufacturer makes a difference on production costs.

                                                          [Table 6]

           Across all three specifications, we see that the LBS effects are significant and the

magnitudes are similar to the results in Table 5. For LBD effects, a developer’s experience alone

matters, but the impact is smaller than found in the previous section, where a developer’s

experience includes shared experience with the manufacturer.

           What reduces project costs the most is repeated collaboration experience between a

                                                                                                25
developer and the same manufacturer, which suggests the learning-by-interacting effect. A 1 GW

increase of collaborative installed capacity results in approximately a 4% decrease of the unit

electricity production cost. This magnitude indicates that each additional CDM wind project that

the developer and the manufacturer build together decreases unit costs by about 0.25%. In

column (3), the significance of the interaction term with foreign manufacturers suggests that

collaborations between developers and foreign manufacturers generate the greatest cost savings.

An additional 1 GW installed capacity by a developer with its foreign manufacturer partner

drives down the unit production cost by approximately 15.7%, 16 which is nearly three times

greater than the effect of cooperating experience between a developer and a domestic

manufacturer. Thus, each additional CDM wind project that a developer builds with the same

foreign manufacturer will reduce the unit cost by almost 1%. The difference between cooperating

experience with foreign manufacturers and domestic manufacturers on unit cost reduction

suggests that tacit knowledge transfer between foreign manufacturers and project developers is

important to maximize the benefits from the transfer of foreign technologies.

5.4        Learning effects on unit capital cost and capacity factor

           Finally, we use capital cost per kWh and the project capacity factor as dependent

variables to test the effects of different learning channels on wind farm installation and

operation. As shown in Table A1 and A2 in the appendix, the impacts of manufacturer’s

knowledge stock, manufacturer and the developer’s experience alone, and the spillover from the

industrial level on unit capital cost and capacity factor are highly consistent with what we have

found for unit production costs.

           However, collaborating experience between the manufacturer and project developer has

different impacts on unit production cost, unit capital cost, and capacity factors. Table 7
16
     The percentage change is exp (-0.0397 – 0.131) – 1 = -15.7%.

                                                                                              26
compares models with different dependent variables. All models include both province fixed

effects and year fixed effects. For comparison, columns (1) and (2) repeat the results shown in

columns (2) and (3) of Table 6.

                                             [Table 7]

       As shown in model (1) and model (3), learning by interacting effects, captured by

repeated collaboration experience, lead to both production cost reduction and capital cost

reduction. The magnitude of the effect for capital cost reduction is slightly larger than the effect

on production reduction. However, cooperating experience does not have a significant effect on

capacity factor in model (5). When we further test whether cooperating with a foreign

manufacturer makes a difference by adding the interaction terms in model (2), (4) and (6),

cooperation with a foreign manufacturer leads to a greater reduction for electricity production

costs while it makes no difference on capital costs and capacity factor.

       The results above indicate that repeated partnerships between a developer and

manufacturer mostly drive down the costs of construction and installation stage, but do not lead

to better operational performance, as measured by capacity factor. Instead, the developer’s own

experience is sufficient to provide guidance on siting turbines to improve the electricity

generated from each new site. Since the unit capital costs on average account for approximately

80% of the unit electricity production cost of a wind project, we also observe that the

cooperating experience matters most for the production cost reduction on the whole. When we

further differentiate between cooperating experience with foreign manufacturers and domestic

manufacturers, our results suggest that a repeated partnership with a foreign manufacturer

facilitates knowledge diffusion between partners beyond the construction and installation stage,




                                                                                                 27
as the foreign manufacturer interaction is statistically significant in the model using overall costs

as the dependent variable.

6.     Conclusions

       Using CDM wind projects started between 2002 and 2009 in China, this paper examines

the effects of different channels of learning – learning through R&D in wind turbine

manufacturing, learning from firm’s previous experience of installation, learning from the

experience of other firms, and learning through collaboration between wind turbine manufacturer

and project developer—on technological change in China’s wind. We consider the impacts of

these learning channels on the unit cost of electricity generation, as well as on wind farm

installation costs and capacity factor.

       Our empirical analysis successfully separates the learning-by-searching effect from the

joint learning effect of LBS and LBD used in previous research on China’s wind industry.

However, the learning-by-searching effect is much smaller than what has been found for

European wind power over a longer period of time (Soderholm & Klassen, 2007; Soderholm &

Sundqvist, 2007). This is reasonable because our observation period is too short for patents to be

fully commercialized and to have large impact on cost reduction. Another reason could be that

turbines with advanced technology have higher prices while the electricity production is limited

by the technological capacity of the developer or the transmission system.

       Our results also provide evidence of learning-by-doing for wind project developers in

China. While finding LBD effects is consistent with previous research, our paper is the first to

separately identify the experience of manufacturers and project developers. Developers are more

likely to benefit from their past internal experience in both wind farm installation and operation,

which significantly drive down the overall electricity production costs. Unlike previous research,



                                                                                                  28
when we separate the experience of developers and manufacturers from the industrial

experience, the experience of other manufacturers and developers are less important to the

observed project. However, it does not contradict the findings in the work of Qiu and Anadon

(2012) because their measurement for industrial learning also includes the experience and

knowledge stock of the turbine manufacturer involved in an observed project while we partial

out these effects. On the whole, the learning-by-doing effect itself provides support for demand-

side subsidies, such as CDM revenues, to price negative externalities and stimulate demand so as

to provide opportunities for learning-by-doing and reduce future abatement costs.

       Most importantly, we find that what really matters for reducing electricity production

costs is not just the experience of a particular project developer or turbine manufacturer, but the

joint project experience between the developer and the same manufacturer through their repeated

interaction. The repeated partnership between developers and turbine manufacturers leads to

lower electricity production costs, particularly for capital costs. Our results provide justification

for the trend of integrating turbine manufacturing with wind project developing in China’s wind

industry. Both domestic manufacturers such as Goldwind and foreign manufacturers such as

Gamesa have begun to either form subsidiaries to develop wind projects or partner with certain

existing developers in order to get more involved in project development (Li, 2012). This finding

also suggests that the wind energy association or local government could set up platforms or

forums to connect developers and manufacturers in advance, particularly for small developers

that newly enter the market.

       One goal of CDM is to enable technology transfer and the subsequent diffusion of

climate-friendly technologies in countries hosting CDM projects. Our results also provide

evidence that, by encouraging cooperation between local project developers and turbine



                                                                                                  29
manufacturers, the CDM is successful in this goal. However, more research is necessary to

establish the mechanisms through which these partnerships cause costs to fall. While it may be

the case that the reduction of capital costs is a result of joint learning between the developers and

manufacturers on wind farm installation, we cannot rule out that the cost savings are simply the

result of economically reciprocal wind turbine purchase contracts between partners based on

their repeated collaboration. Distinguishing between these explanations requires further

qualitative data to rule out the latter explanation or to separate the impacts of these two

explanations.

       Finally, our strongest evidence for the learning-by-interacting effect occurs when a wind

project developer repeatedly collaborates with a foreign manufacturer. In addition to the transfer

of physical technology, the transfer of tacit knowledge through the partnership drives down the

electricity production cost to a great extent. In the light of this finding, it may not be wise for

Chinese government to prevent foreign manufacturers from entering and competing with other

domestic manufacturers in the turbine manufacturing market.

Notes: Annual total installed capacity data comes from the CWEA’s annual reports on China’s wind power. CDM
installed capacity data is collected from the CDM Pipeline and CDM project design documents. Due to the CDM
registration process, the incremental installed capacity from CDM projects in 2009 is incomplete. Thus, the CDM
share shown for 2009 may be lower than the actual share.
