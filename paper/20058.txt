Bequests and Heterogeneity in Retirement Wealth

JEL No. E21,J14

                                              ABSTRACT

Households hold vastly heterogenous amounts of wealth when they reach retirement, and differences
in lifetime earnings explain only part of this variation. This paper studies the role of intergenerational
transmission of ability, voluntary bequest motives, and the recipiency of accidental and intended bequests
(both in terms of timing and size), in generating wealth dispersion at retirement, in the context of a
rich quantitative model. Modeling voluntary bequests, and realistically calibrating them, not only generates
more wealth dispersion at retirement and reduces the correlation between retirement wealth and lifetime
income, but also generates a skewed bequest distribution that is close to the one in the observed data.

1   Introduction

Why do U.S. households reach retirement with vastly different wealth levels,
even when we condition on realized lifetime income? Can we construct a model
that explains this fact? What are the important features that help generate
this heterogeneity?
    The answers to these questions help improve our understanding of the
factors affecting savings, and thus help inform many kinds of policy reforms,
including taxation and social insurance reforms. As Heckman, Lochner, and
Taber (1998) wrote, “It is potentially very dangerous to ‘solve’ problems whose
origins are not well understood.”
    Our main contribution is to study the role of intergenerational links, in
the form of intergenerational transmission of ability and both accidental and
voluntary bequests, in shaping wealth dispersion at retirement and its corre-
lation with lifetime income. The aggregate importance of wealth transmitted
across generations calls for an investigation of the impact of these transfers on
individual savings, wealth inequality, and its interaction with earnings shocks
over the life cycle. To do so, we study these elements in the context of a rich,
quantitative, overlapping generations model with incomplete markets, which
features earnings risks and incorporates the key institutional policies provid-
ing public insurance for these risks. The interaction of risks and insurance,
in fact, affects saving motives and, thus, observed wealth accumulation in an
interesting and non-trivial way.
    Besides voluntary and accidental bequests, and transmission of ability from
parents to children, other factors have been shown to be important to un-
derstanding saving behavior and cross-sectional wealth inequality in the U.S.
However, we know little about the effects of these elements on wealth hold-
ings at retirement. These institutional factors include a government-provided
minimum consumption (Hubbard et al. (1995)), defined benefit pensions, and
a more realistic modeling of Social Security rules (Scholz et al. (2006)). We
explicitly model all of these factors, as they might have important effects di-
rectly, but might also interact with the effects of intergenerational links on

                                       2
savings at retirement, thus providing a misleading picture of the effects of in-
tergenerational links, should these important programs not be accounted for.
    In our framework, after controlling for lifetime earnings, wealth differ-
ences at retirement arise for the following two reasons. First, when borrowing
constraints prevent households from smoothing consumption intertemporally,
households that differ in the timing of earnings over the life cycle will have very
different wealth levels at retirement. Second, inheritances add another source
of wealth heterogeneity among households with similar lifetime earnings. Our
calibrated bequest motive implies that bequests are a luxury good, and thus
increases the desire to leave bequests for households receiving large bequests,
thereby increasing their saving rate and leading to more wealth inequality and
less correlation of wealth to lifetime earnings.
    Our main finding is that the model with intergenerational links matches
the data well. More specifically, it generates an average of the Gini coefficients
for wealth, after controlling for lifetime income, of 0.53, compared with .52 in
the data; and a correlation coefficient between lifetime earnings and retirement
wealth of 0.75, which is a bit higher than in the data (0.62), but lower than
in the version of the model that does not allow for intergenerational links.
Adding a modest amount of measurement error in earnings and wealth further
reduces this correlation to 0.71.
   Removing the voluntary bequest motive, even the in presence of different
assumptions about the receipt of involuntary bequests, increases the gap be-
tween the model and the data. To make this point, we compare the benchmark
model with all intergenerational links, including voluntary bequests, with two
models without voluntary bequest motives, which differ in the timing and
size of accidental inheritances receipt. First, accidental bequests of different
sizes are received at age 50. Second, accidental bequests of different sizes are
randomly received at realistic ages between 35 and 55. The versions of the
model without voluntary bequest motives generate average Gini coefficients
for wealth that, controlling for lifetime income, are 0.46 and 0.46, respec-
tively, which are lower than the .52 observed in the data. They also imply
a tighter relationship between lifetime earnings and retirement wealth, and

                                        3
more specifically, the correlation coefficients between these variables are 0.81
and 0.80, respectively, compared with 0.62 in the data.
   In contrast, as one might have expected, the intergenerational transmission
of earnings ability from parents to children tends to increase the correlation
between wealth and lifetime earnings at retirement. In fact, the model with
bequest motives, but without intergenerational transfer of productivity, im-
plies a correlation of 0.73, which is lower than the 0.75 in the benchmark
calibration. Without intergenerational transmission of earnings ability, the
distribution of inheritance received is independent of households earnings; this
implies that poorer people tend to receive comparatively larger inheritances,
which helps reduce the correlation coefficient between lifetime earnings and
retirement wealth.
    We also investigate the distributional effects of means-tested minimum con-
sumption programs in old age, Social Security, and pensions. Eliminating the
realistically calibrated consumption floor from our benchmark calibration re-
sults in the income-poor households having more of an incentive to save to
insure against bad income shocks; this tends to decrease wealth inequality and
generates a lower average Gini coefficient, after controlling for lifetime income,
of 0.49, compared with 0.53 in the benchmark model, while the correlation of
wealth at retirement and permanent income barely changes.
    Removing private pensions raises the average wealth of the households in
the high earnings deciles, as they save much more to smooth consumption over
their lifetime. As a result, the Gini coefficients decrease a lot at the higher
earnings deciles, and the average of the Gini coefficients across income deciles
drops to 0.49. For the same reason, the correlation coefficient between re-
tirement wealth and lifetime income increases to 0.79. If, on top of removing
private pensions, one were to switch from a history-dependent Social Secu-
rity system, the wealth Gini coefficients for the lower earnings deciles would
increase, while the ones for the highest earners would decrease. On net, the av-
erage of the Gini coefficients across income deciles would barely change, while
the correlation coefficient between wealth and lifetime earnings would increase
to 0.82.

   The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 frames our contribution in the
context of the literature. Section 3 presents the model and the calibration of
the model. Section 4 shows the quantitative results of the benchmark model
and investigates the role of various features of the model. Section 5 concludes.


2    Related Literature

Many authors document that households with similar characteristics, such
as lifetime income, age, and family structure, hold vastly different amounts of
wealth at retirement (see Hurst et al. (1998), and Grafova et al. (2006)). Hen-
dricks (2007a) shows that the correlation coefficient between lifetime earnings
and wealth at retirement (0.61) is much less than unity, and that substantial
wealth differences remain after controlling for lifetime earnings and age. In
fact, the average of the Gini coefficients in wealth at retirement across lifetime
earnings deciles is 0.54, compared with 0.62 in the full sample.
   Several economists (for example Bernheim et al. (2001) and Hendricks
(2007a)) argue that these features of the data are inconsistent with most life-
cycle models of consumption-saving behavior, and thus constitute a challenge
to such theories and their policy implications. Our goal is to see how close we
can get to the observed data once we allow for a rich model with earnings risk
and many features of public insurance, which also includes intergenerational
transmission of physical and human capital across generations.
   An extensive literature, both empirical and theoretical, shows that the
transmission of physical and human capital from parents to children is a very
important determinant of households’ wealth in the aggregate economy (see
Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) and Gale and Scholz (1994)), and of both wealth
and earnings ability over the household’s life cycle (see Hurd and Smith (1999)
and Becker and Tomes (1986)). As a result, it is also a prime candidate to
investigate retirement savings.
   This paper builds on a large literature that studies the cross-sectional
wealth inequality at all ages (see Huggett (1996), Quadrini (2000), Casteneda
et al. (2003), De Nardi (2004), and Cagetti and De Nardi (2006)). It is also

                                        5
related to studies on retirement saving. Engen et al. (1999), Engen et al.
(2004), and Scholz et al. (2006) study the adequacy of household retirement
saving. Those papers abstract from the intergenerational links of bequests
and earnings ability. Gokhale et al. (2001) abstract from voluntary bequest
motives.
    We build on work by Hendricks (2007a) by introducing transmission of
both physical and human capital across generations. These features, once re-
alistically calibrated, imply that the households receive an inheritance at a
random time, whose timing is consistent with their parent’s life expectancy,
and whose size is consistent both with their parents’ estate and with the dis-
tributions of estates left in the U.S. economy. In our framework, therefore,
households expect to receive and do receive different amounts of inheritances
at different times. In addition, due to the luxury voluntary bequest motive
coming out of our calibration, people who either receive high labor incomes
or large bequests hold onto more wealth due to a voluntary bequest motive,
which is stronger for richer people.


3     The Model

The model is a discrete-time, incomplete markets, overlapping generations
economy with an infinitely lived government.

3.1   Government

The government taxes capital and labor income at rates τa and τl , respectively,
to finance government spending and government transfers. It also taxes earn-
ings at rate τss to finance Social Security. These two government budgets are
balanced during each period. The Social Security benefits that agents receive,
P (e
   y ), are linked to their realized average annual earnings ye.

3.2   Firm, Technology, and Defined Benefit Plan

There is one representative firm producing goods, which also maintains a de-
fined benefit plan, that is financed by contributions on each worker’s behalf at
                                        6
the rate τDB . The defined benefit pension budget is balanced at each period.
   Retired households receive pensions from the defined benefit plan each
period until they die. These pension benefits, DB(ey ), are linked to each indi-
vidual’s realized average annual earnings.

3.3      Demographics, Preferences, and Labor Productivity

Each model period lasts five years. Agents start their economic life at the
age of 20 (t = 1). By age 35, (t = 4), the agents’ children are born. The
agents retire at age 65 (t = 10). From that period on, each household faces a
positive probability of dying, given by (1 − pt ), which only depends on age.1
The maximum life span is age 90 (T = 14), and the population grows at a
constant rate n. Figure 1 displays the structure of the overlapping generations
model.

       Preferences are time separable, with a constant discount factor β. The
period utility function from consumption is given by U(c) = (c1−γ −1)/(1 −γ).
   Agents also derive utility from the bequests transferred to their children
upon death. This form of ‘impure’ bequest motive implies that an individual
cares about total bequests left to his/her children, but not about the consump-
tion of his/her children.
     Following De Nardi (2004), the utility from bequests b is denoted by φ(b) =
φ1 [(b + φ2 )1−γ − 1]. The term φ1 measures the strength of bequest motives,
   1
    We make the assumption that people do not die before age 65 to reduce computational
time. This assumption does not affect the results since in the U.S., the number of adults
dying before age 65 is small.

                                                                7
while φ2 reflects the extent to which bequests are luxury goods; if φ2 > 0,
the marginal utility of small bequests is bounded, while the marginal utility of
large bequests declines more slowly than the marginal utility of consumption.
                                                                              i
    Total labor productivity of worker i at age t is given by yti = ezt +ǫt , in which
ǫt is the deterministic age-efficiency profile. The process for the stochastic
productivity shock zti is: zti = ρz zt−1
                                     i
                                         + µit , µit ∼ N(0, σµ2 ).
   To capture the intergenerational correlation of earnings, we assume that
the productivity of worker i at age 55 is transmitted to children j at age 20 as
follows: z1j = ρh z8i + ν j , ν j ∼ N(0, σh2 ), as parents are 35 years (seven model
periods) older than their children.

3.4   The Household’s Recursive Problem

We assume that children have full information about their parents’ state
variables and infer the size of the bequests that they are likely to receive
based on this information. The household’s state variables are given by x =
(t, a, z, ye, Sp ), where a denotes the agent’s financial assets carried from the
previous period. The last term, Sp , denotes the parent’s state variables.
    From t = 1 to t = 9 (from 20 to 60 years of age), the agent survives
for sure to the next period. Let V (t, a, z, ye, Sp ) and V I (t, a, z, ye) denote the
value function of an agent whose parent is alive and dead, respectively, where
I stands for “inherited.” In the former case, the household’s parents are still
alive, and might die with probability pt+7 , in which case the value function
for the orphan household applies, and assets are augmented of inheritances in
per-capita terms. That is,

                                      (

where N is the average number of kids determined by the growth rate of
the population. The expected values of the value functions are taken with
respect to (z ′ , zp′ ), conditional on (z, zp ). The agent’s resources depend on
labor endowment y and asset holdings a.
    To compute defined benefits and Social Security payments, we keep track
of yearly lifetime average labor income ye. Since current income y refers to
a five-year period, current income is divided by five when the yearly lifetime
average labor income (ey ) is updated. Average yearly earnings for children and
parents thus evolve according to equations (4) and (5), respectively. Equation
(6) is the law of motion of assets for the parents, which uses their optimal
decision rule.
    The value function of an agent whose parent is dead is
                                    (                                      )

subject to (2), (3), and (4 ).
   From 65 to 85 years of age (t = 10 to t = 14), the agent does not work
any more and receives Social Security benefits and pensions from the defined
benefit plan. He also faces a positive probability of dying, in which case he
derives utility from bequeathing the remaining assets. Following Hubbard et
al. (1995), we assume that government transfers T r provide a consumption
floor c as specified in equation (10).

              Table 1: Exogenous parameters used in the benchmark model

    Unless stated otherwise, we report parameters at an annual frequency.
Table 1 lists the parameters that are either taken from other studies or can be
solved independently of the endogenous outcomes of the model. The tax rate
on labor income and the contribution rate to the defined benefit plan, belong
to the latter group because, due to the assumption of exogenous labor supply

                                             10
and retirement decisions, they only depend on the earnings shocks and the
population demographics, which are exogenous to the model.
   We set the population growth rate, n, to the average value of population
growth from 1950 to 1997 from the Council of Economic Advisors (1998). The
pt ’s are the vectors of conditional survival probabilities for people older than
65 and are set to the survival probabilities for people born in 1965 (Bell et al.
(1992)). We take the risk aversion coefficient, γ, to be 1.5.
   The deterministic age-profile of labor productivity ǫt has been estimated
by Hansen (1993). Since we impose mandatory retirement at the age of 65,
we set ǫt = 0 for t > 9. The labor productivity persistence ρz and variance σµ2
were estimated from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data using
five-year periods by Altonji and Villanueva (2002).2 We take the persistence
ρh of the productivity inheritance process from Zimmerman (1992) and Solon
(1992) and the variance σh2 from De Nardi (2004).
   The minimum consumption floor c is 0.21 of average household income,
                                      ¯
because in 1992 the consumption floor was $8, 159 (Scholz et al. (2006)),
while the average income was $38, 840 (Census Bureau).
   The capital income tax rate τa is set at 20% as recommended by Kotlikoff
et al. (1999). The tax rate on labor τl is set at 21.7%, so that the ratio of
government spending to output is 0.18 (Council of Economic Advisors (1998)).
    The Social Security benefit P (e
                                   y) mimics the Old Age and Survivor Insur-
ance component of the Social Security system and is set as

 P (e
    y) = 0.9 min(e
                 y , 0.2) + 0.32 max(0, min(e
                                            y , 1.24) − 0.2)+
                              0.15 max(0, min(ey , 2.47), 1.24).
   In this formula, the bend points are expressed in terms of average earnings
and the marginal rates of Social Security benefits are taken from Huggett and
Ventura (2000). More specifically, their formula applies to an economy with
average earnings of one. The bend points are multiplied by average earnings in
our model economy to make the formula consistent with our model economy.
The tax rate on labor income τss is set at 10.0% to balance the Social Security
budget.

   These bend points are also expressed in terms of average earnings, while
the marginal rates are chosen to match the holding of defined benefit wealth
relative to Social Security wealth by lifetime earning deciles from the Health
and Retirement Study (HRS) data set, as reported in Scholz et al. (2006).
Appendix A reports the details of these computations. According to this
formula and consistent with the data, households in the first three lifetime
earnings categories barely have any defined benefit wealth.
   The contribution rate τDB to the defined benefit plan that balances the
pension budget is 3.9%. The annual interest rate is set at 5%.

           Table 2: Parameters calibrated using the benchmark model

   Table 2 lists the parameters we use to calibrate the model. We choose
the parameters β, φ1 , φ2 to match the ratio of wealth to after-tax earnings
(Hendricks (2007a)), the bequest-wealth ratio (Gale and Scholz (1994)), and
the 90th percentile of bequest distribution normalized by income (Hurd and
Smith (2002)). We use the distribution for single decedents instead of the one
for all decedents. As is argued in De Nardi (2004), typically a surviving spouse
inherits a large share of the estate, consumes part of it, and only leaves the
remainder to the couple’s children.
   The discount factor affects saving and average wealth in the economy. The
term φ1 measures the strength of bequest motives, thus we choose the aggre-
                                      12
gate bequest as a moment. The term φ2 reflects the extent to which bequests
are luxury goods, affecting the bequest distribution, especially the high end of
it.
   To better gauge the quantitative implications of the model, we begin by
evaluating the lifetime earnings implications of the exogenous earnings process
that we feed into the model. Table 3 first reports the percentage of total
lifetime earnings earned at selected percentiles as a fraction of total lifetime
earnings generated by the model and then displays the corresponding figures
computed from the PSID observed data. The model earnings process produces
lifetime earnings earned by each lifetime earnings decile that are very close to
those from the PSID data.

  6. The role of pensions and Social Security.

  7. The role of measurement error in both earnings and wealth in the ob-
     served data.

   In each run, we solve for the dynamic programming problem and impose
budget balance for the government. We then simulate 100,000 households
starting from age 20, drawn from the initial distribution of each model. We
define retirement wealth to be the wealth at age 65 and lifetime earnings to
be the total earnings from ages 20 to 60, discounted to age 65.
   The contribution rate τDB is set to zero when pensions are removed. The
payroll tax τss is set to zero when Social Security is removed. When Social
Security payments are equalized, the payroll taxes τss are kept as in the bench-
mark model, while the payments are set to balance Social Security budget.

4.1     The Benchmark Model

Overall, the benchmark model fits the data well. The first subsection regarding
the benchmark model discusses its fit of the wealth distribution at retirement
and of wealth distribution across all ages. The second subsection focuses on
its implied correlation between wealth at retirement and lifetime income.

    The top panel of Table 4 reports wealth percentiles at retirement. The
first line of the top panel refers to data from the PSID4 and shows that, in
the data, wealth at age 65 is highly unevenly distributed. The richest 1%
of people at retirement time hold 16% of total retirement wealth, while the
richest 5% hold 34% of total net worth at retirement time. The second line
of the top panel reports the corresponding numbers for the benchmark model
with intergenerational links and bequest motives. That model succeeds in
generating a skewed retirement wealth distribution that is comparable with
the data, with the exception of the top 1% of the wealth holdings.
   The bottom panel of Table 4 reports values of the wealth distribution for
the whole economy. Wealth for the whole economy is more unevenly dis-
tributed than wealth at retirement, both in the data and in all models. This
indicates that a large amount of wealth dispersion in the economy is due to
differences in age. Here, too, the model fits the data well.

4.1.2     Wealth and Lifetime Earnings in the Benchmark Model

The benchmark model generates a correlation between lifetime earnings and
retirement wealth of 0.75. While this is a bit higher than the 0.61 in the PSID
data, the model does generate a good deal of wealth inequality even after
controlling for lifetime earnings and age.

       Table 5: Gini coefficient of retirement wealth by lifetime earnings decile

      Table 5 illustrates the Gini coefficients of retirement wealth for each life-
time earnings decile. We notice two important features. First, after controlling
for age and lifetime earnings, there is still large wealth inequality in the bench-
mark model: All the Gini coefficients are above 0.32. Second, the degree of

    The PSID data computations in Section 4 are all from Hendricks (2001) and Hendricks
(2007a).

                                             15
wealth inequality declines as lifetime earnings increases as is observed in the
data. Third, the model does generate significant wealth inequality conditional
on permanent income. In fact, the average of the Gini coefficients across per-
manent income quantiles turns out to be 0.53 in the model and 0.54 in the
data.
    To better gauge the amount of wealth dispersion at retirement generated by
the benchmark model, Figure 2 compares the retirement wealth distributions
for the 2nd, 5th, and 9th lifetime earnings deciles in the model with those in the
PSID. The model successfully replicates the fact that households with similar
lifetime earnings hold diverse amounts of wealth. At each lifetime earnings
decile, households in the lower wealth deciles hold very little wealth, while
households in the higher wealth deciles hold much more wealth. Compared
with the data, the model matches especially well for the households in the
middle deciles of the income distribution, while it overstates the high wealth
percentiles at the 2nd earnings decile but overstates low wealth percentiles at
the 9th earnings decile.

4.2                          The Role of Bequest Motives

In the benchmark model, retirement wealth inequality arises among house-
holds with similar lifetime earnings because households differ in the timing of

                                                                          16
earnings over the life cycle and in the amount and timing of inheritances re-
ceived. Let us now turn to understanding the effects of bequest and inheritance
heterogeneity on retirement wealth heterogeneity.
   The model with intergenerational links of bequests and earnings ability
endogenously generates differences in the timing and amount of inheritances.
To see how large the variation in inheritances is, Table 6 reports values for
the discounted lifetime inheritance distribution. In the PSID, inheritances are
highly unevenly distributed with a Gini coefficient of 0.89, and 50% of the
households receive very little or no inheritance. The top 1% of the households
receive 35% of all the inheritances.
   The model generates a skewed inheritance distribution that is compara-
ble with the one in the data, with the exception of its top 1%. Treating
bequests as luxury goods and modeling the transmission of earnings ability
across generations are essential to match the observed skewness in the inher-
itance distribution. Several modeling choices and aspects of the calibration
are important in generating this result. First, the marginal utility of leaving
a bequest is finite at zero bequests, which helps to generate a large fraction
of households receiving no inheritances. Second, some large inheritances are
transmitted across generations because of the voluntary bequest motive to hold
onto assets if alive at a very old age. Because the marginal utility of bequests
declines more slowly than the marginal utility of consumption, the richest
households have strong bequest motives to save to leave some assets to their
children even when they are very old. Moreover, in the presence of a positive
correlation between parents’ and children’s earnings, children are more likely
to be earnings-rich and to receive a large inheritance and thus tend to save
to leave more wealth to their offspring, hence generating a skewed inheritance
distribution.

    Table 7 shows the fraction of lifetime inheritance received by households
in each lifetime earnings decile. In the PSID, there is a positive correlation
between lifetime inheritance and lifetime earnings. The benchmark model
generates an increasing relation between inheritance and lifetime earnings.
Modeling the transmission of earnings ability across generations and a highly
correlated lifetime earnings process is key in generating this pattern. The
monotonicity relation is weaker in the data. This might due to the fact that in
reality, individuals differ by numbers of siblings and marital status and each
married couple might receive inheritances multiple times. More inheritances
at the lowest earnings decile might help the model to generate less correla-
tion between retirement wealth and earnings. Interestingly, assuming that the
parent’s productivity and his child’s initial productivity are perfectly corre-
lated increases the discrepancies between the fraction of inheritances received
by each lifetime earnings decile in the model and the data. The reason is
that higher intergenerational persistence in productivity generates a stronger
positive correlation between lifetime inheritance and lifetime earnings. As is
shown in Table 7, this implies that the fraction of inheritances received by the
lowest two earnings deciles is only 4.7%, compared with 14% in the data and
10% in the benchmark model.

   We now turn to discussing the effects of inheritance heterogeneity on retire-
ment wealth in the benchmark model. The upper panel in Table 8 shows extra
wealth holding at selected percentiles among those who did inherit, compared
with those who did not. At each earnings decile, those who never inherited
hold less wealth than those who have inherited, and the difference increases as
the wealth percentile increases. The reason is, with operative bequest motives,

4.3     The Role of Inheritance Distribution

To isolate the role of the distribution of inheritances from voluntary bequest
motives, we also compute two versions of the model without bequest motives.
In both cases, the inheritance distribution is exogenously taken from the data,
See Appendix B for more detail.

  1. All 50 year olds receive an inheritance of random size (taken from the
     data), whose size is uncorrelated with their earnings at age 50, as in
     Hendricks (2007a).

  2. The timing of inheritance receipt is random and consistent with the data.

      Table 9 reports several measures of inequality for the PSID data and the
model-generated data in various versions of the model.
  While the benchmark model that intergenerational links and bequest mo-
tives generates a skewed wealth distribution that is comparable with the one in
the data, the two models without intergenerational links and bequest motives
generate much less concentration than in the observed data.
    In the model with random bequests that are received at age 50, the correla-
tion coefficient between lifetime earnings and retirement wealth and the mean
Gini coefficient are farther away from the data compared with the benchmark
model, thus pointing out that a bequest motive is needed for those who have

received large inheritances to hold a significant portion of them by the time
retirement comes around. In the benchmark model, in fact, households hold
onto more wealth due to operative bequest motives, and this generates more
heterogeneity in retirement wealth for given lifetime earnings. As is shown
in Table 8, extra wealth holdings among those who have inherited are much
smaller in the random bequest model than in the benchmark model with be-
quest motives.
   Making the timing of bequest receipt more realistic further weakens the
relationship between lifetime earnings and retirement wealth: A borrowing
constrained household that receives an inheritance earlier consumes more of it
and holds onto less wealth at retirement than an otherwise identical household
that receives an inheritance later. However, the quantitative effect of this

                                        20

4.4       The Role of Intergenerational Transmission of Ability

To study the interaction of bequest motives and intergenerational transmission
of ability, we keep the bequest motive, but we change the intergenerational
persistence in earnings, which in turn endogenously changes the distribution
of inheritance. In particular, if there is no intergenerational link of earnings,
inheritances are evenly distributed by lifetime earnings decile.
   Higher intergenerational persistence of earnings ability leads to more wealth
accumulation across generations and increases wealth inequality.5
    In case of no intergenerational transfer of productivity (ρh = 0), the cor-
relation between retirement wealth and lifetime earnings is reduced to 0.73,
down from 0.75 in the benchmark economy. There are several reasons for this
drop. The first one is that without the intergenerational productivity link,
inheritances are evenly distributed by lifetime earnings decile, which is in con-
trast with the data (see Table 7). In this version of the model, some households
   5
    De Nardi (2004) provides a detailed discussion of the effects of intergenerational links
on the cross-sectional wealth distribution.


                                                21
in the low lifetime earnings deciles receive unrealistically large amounts of in-
heritances, weakening the correlation between lifetime earnings and retirement
wealth in an unplausible way. The second reason is that, as in the benchmark
model, with an operative bequest motive, those who inherit large estates from
their parents will consume only a small part of their inheritances by the age
of 65, thus helping to increase wealth heterogeneity at retirement.
    However, the modification that parents’ and children’s productivity are
perfectly correlated (ρh = 1) brings the correlation coefficient further away
from the data. The reason is that, higher intergenerational persistence in pro-
ductivity generates stronger positive correlation between lifetime inheritance
and lifetime earnings. As is shown in Table 7, the amount of inheritance
received by the lowest two earnings deciles is only 4.7%.

4.5      The Role of the Government-Provided Consumption Floor

Table 11 shows that setting the government-provided consumption floor to
zero reduces the mean Gini by 0.04 to 0.49, because a means-tested minimum
consumption guarantee provides strong incentives for low-income individuals
not to save. Due to the persistence of the earnings process, those low-income
households are more concentrated in low lifetime-earnings deciles. Without
a consumption floor, the Gini coefficients decrease a lot at the lowest three
earnings deciles, since there are fewer poor households in those deciles. The
Gini coefficients at the higher deciles barely change, since households in those
                                        22
deciles receive high pensions and Social Security income and do not qualify for
a transfer.

4.6    The Role of Pensions and Social Security

Eliminating pension benefits raises the correlation coefficient between lifetime
income and retirement wealth substantially because it raises average wealth
for households in the high earnings deciles. Compared with the benchmark
model with pensions, the Gini coefficients decrease a lot at the highest five
earnings deciles, since they now increase saving for retirement.
   Also, eliminating any kind of Social Security payments (in addition to re-
moving pension benefits) increases the Gini coefficients at the lower earnings
deciles: Wealthy households increase savings, while poor households do not in-
crease their saving to be able to qualify for the government-provided consump-
tion floor. The Gini coefficients at the higher earnings deciles decrease since
poor households, who are not likely to qualify for the government-provided
consumption floor, increase saving relatively more than rich households.
   As an additional test, after eliminating Social Security payments, we give
the same Social Security payment to all retirees, in addition to removing pri-
vate pensions. As a result of this change, the resulting Social Security pay-
ment to all retirees, determined from the government budget balance, is large
enough that no retiree qualifies for minimum consumption floor transfer any-
more. This experiment decreases the Gini coefficients at the lower earnings
deciles because rich households reduce saving while poor households, holding
no wealth before the experiment, do not reduce saving. The Gini coefficients
                                    23
at the higher earnings deciles increase because the poor households decrease
saving relatively more than rich households.

4.7     The Role of Measurement Error in Income and Wealth

In the data, both earnings and wealth are likely measured with error. To
evaluate the magnitude of this element, we add random noise to the sample
simulated from the benchmark model. We assume that the log of observed
earnings for household i at age t, eˆi , follows
                                        t
      eˆit = eit + vti , in which eit is the log of true earnings and vti is the random
error that follows vti = ρv eit + ιit , ιit ∼ N(0, σι2 ).
    The observed log wealth at age 65 follows
    Ŵ i = W i + η i , and η i ∼ N(0, ση2 ), where η i and ιit are uncorrelated with
each other.
   We use ρv = −0.104, and σι2 = 0.138 (Bound et al. (1989)). Using 1982
PSID earnings, Bound et al. (1989) reported that σv2 /(σv2 + σe2 ) = 0.15, and
ρv = −0.104. In the model, σe2 is 0.831, which gives σv2 = 0.147 and σι2 = 0.138.
   The measurement error of wealth may be substantial as well. To be con-
servative, we choose a small variance ση2 = 0.01 as a lower bound.
     Adding a small amount of measurement error reduces the correlation coef-
ficient from 0.75 in the benchmark model to 0.71. The mean Gini coefficient of
retirement wealth is slightly higher (0.55) than that in the benchmark (0.53).
The reason is that, adding random noise in earnings affects Gini coefficients
only when enough agents are regrouped into other deciles. Given the wide
range of earnings in each decile, not many agents are regrouped.


5      Conclusions

Empirical studies using micro data find that there is large heterogeneity in
retirement wealth among households with similar lifetime earnings and raise
doubts about the ability of a standard life-cycle model of saving behavior to
reproduce the observed facts.


                                            24
    We use an incomplete-market life-cycle model with intergenerational links
of bequests and earnings ability, government-provided minimum consumption,
a history-dependent Social Security system, and a defined benefit pension.
We show that this model with earnings heterogeneity and inheritance hetero-
geneity generates a substantial amount of heterogeneity in retirement wealth
for given lifetime earnings. This suggests that a properly specified life-cycle
model with bequest motives, consumption floor, and Social Security pensions
captures the fundamental determinants of households saving and wealth ac-
cumulation. This framework might shed light on the effects of policy reforms
that affect saving. We show that government-provided minimum consump-
tion, pensions, and Social Security have very different distributional effects.
In a separate paper, Yang (2013) studies the consequences of eliminating So-
cial Security in a similar environment to the one constructed in this paper and
finds that the presence of bequest motives reduces life-cycle saving and thus
reduces the gains from Social Security reform.
    We have assumed that households are ex-ante identical. Interesting direc-
tions for future work include allowing for heterogeneity in wealth holdings by
education (Hubbard et al. (1995) and Cagetti (2003)), and by marital status
(Cubeddu and Rios-Rull (2003) and Guner and Knowles (2007)). Other in-
teresting extensions include allowing for heterogeneity in preferences (Krusell
and Smith (1998), Samwick (1998), and Hendricks (2007b)) and in self-control
(Ameriks et al. (2007)), in number of children (Scholz and Seshadri (2007)),
in rates of return (Guvenen (2006)), and in health expenditures (De Nardi et
al. (2010)).

  Appendix A: Computation of Social Security and Defined Benefit
Payments
  The bend points in the Social Security and defined benefit formulas are
expressed in terms of average earnings, and the marginal rates at the bend
points of Social Security benefits are taken from Huggett and Ventura (2000).
More specifically, their formula applies to an economy with an average earnings
of one. The bend points are multiplied by average earnings to make the formula
consistent with our model economy.
   Here is more detail about the computation of defined benefit:

  1. Discretize average yearly lifetime earnings ye and calculate its distribution
     at age 65.

  2. Find the median of average yearly lifetime earnings in each decile.

  3. Use the formula of Social Security payment to calculate the median Social
     Security payment in each decile.

  4. Scholz et al. (2006, page 625) report median defined-benefit pension
     wealth, Social Security wealth, and net worth (excluding defined-benefit
     pensions) by lifetime earnings decile. We use these numbers to calculate
     the ratio of DB/Social Security wealth in the data.

  5. Using steps 3 and 4, back out the DB payment at each median of average
     yearly lifetime earnings in each decile in our model, so that it matches
     the same ratio as in Scholz et al. (2006).

  6. Use the median average yearly lifetime earnings from the 4th decile to
     the 10th decile as bend points and calculate the slope in each piecewise
     linear function of that formula. The first to third deciles are not used
     because the median DB in the data is zero.

    Appendix B: Computation Algorithm
    For a given set of parameters, we solve for the steady-state equilibrium as
follows:
   1. Solve the optimal consumption and saving plans recursively.
   2. Guess an initial joint distribution of parents and children at the beginning
of the life cycle; compute the associated stationary distribution of households using
the policy functions.
   3. Check whether the implied joint distribution of parents and children at the
beginning of the life cycle is consistent with the initial guess. If so, an equilibrium
is found. Otherwise, go back to step 2 with an updated initial guess.
    The above algorithm applies to models with voluntary bequests. For mod-
els without voluntary bequests, we skip step 3 because the initial distribution
at the beginning of the life cycle is exogenously given. In the random bequest
model, the probabilities of inheritances are given by (0.50, 0.20, 0.10, 0.10,
0.05, 0.04, 0.01), while the corresponding bequest amounts are (0.0, 0.3, 1.2,
3.0, 6.8, 18.5, 84.6), expressed in terms of average after-tax earnings. Those
numbers are taken from Table 8 in Hendricks (2007a), who calculates the dis-
tribution of the present value of lifetime inheritances received by the household
head and wife in PSID.
