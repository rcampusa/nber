                                               ABSTRACT

We explore the effects of local ethnic and religious diversity on individual donations to private charities.
 Using 10-year neighborhood-level panels derived from personal tax records in Canada, we find that
diversity has a detrimental effect on charitable donations. A 10 percentage point increase in ethnic
diversity reduces donations by 14%, and a 10 percentage point increase in religious diversity reduces
donations by 10%. The ethnic diversity effect is driven by a within-group disposition among non-minorities,
and is most evident in high income, but low education areas. The religious diversity effect is driven
by a within-group disposition among Catholics, and is concentrated in high income and high education
areas. Despite these large effects on amount donated, we find no evidence that increasing diversity
affects the fraction of households that donate. Over the period studied, ethnic diversity rises by 6 percentage
points and religious diversity rises by 4 percentage points; our results suggest that charities receive
about 12% less in total donations. As areas like North America continue to grow more diverse over
time, our results imply that these demographic changes may have significant implications for the charitable
sector.

I - Introduction


        Diversity is increasingly a fact in urban centers across North America and Europe, and is often

lauded as a virtue in and of itself. Recent research suggests, however, that despite other potential

positive benefits, diversity appears to dilute support for publicly funded goods and services. Ethnically

diverse communities appear to spend less on schools (Alesina, Baqir, Easterly, 1999 & 2000; Poterba,

1997, Goldin & Katz, 1999), less on roads and hospitals (Alesina, Baqir, Easterly, 1999 & 2000), and

to have lower Census form completion rates (Vigdor, 2004).


        Does a decrease in support for publicly provided goods indicate a similar decline in private

provision of public goods, like local charitable services? Using standard models of group affiliation

(Alesina and La Ferrara, 2000), the prediction is not clear. If people prefer to sort into social groups

that are similar to themselves in terms of ethnicity, religion, or income, then increased diversity may

mean that individuals are more likely to become increasingly willing to give to charitable causes that

benefit their own group, such as local religious organizations or neighborhood food banks.

Alternatively, if the charities are seen as helping those outside their group, then the same insular

feelings that lead to less support for publicly provided goods may pervade attitudes toward giving to

private charities as well.


        We study the effect of ethnic and religious diversity on individuals’ donations to private

charities. We use aggregated data on charitable donations derived from Canadian tax records linked to

Census data over 10 year time periods. Canada is an ideal place to study questions about diversity.

First, Canada is one of the world’s most diverse nations. It actively promotes multiculturalism and is

more open to immigration than most developed nations. Second, the data from the charitable sector in

Canada are perhaps the most complete and precise data on charitable organizations available, updated

annually. Third, the Canadian Census is collected once every five years, information on ethnicity and

religion is detailed, and data can be linked relatively easily over time. Moreover, the Census areas are
                                                     2
relatively small. As a result, key information needed to study diversity is both more detailed and more

frequently updated than data from other countries, like in the United States.


       Our empirical model is based on Vigdor (2002, 2004), where community-level regressions are

an aggregated version of an individual-level model with donations modeled as a function of a person’s

own ethnic or religious group share of the population. The advantage of this approach is that we can

make statements about average individual behavior even though we use aggregated data. Furthermore,

as we show below it provides a natural motivation for using a Fragmentation Index (FI) to measure

diversity. This measure is useful because it is widely used in the literature and also because it is easily

interpreted as the probability that any two randomly-selected individuals in the community belong to

different groups.


       The average adult in our sample donates almost $200 per year. We find that increasing the

ethnic FI by 10 percentage points reduces the average donation per adult by roughly $27 per year, a

14% reduction. By contrast, we find no statistically significant relationship between changes in the

ethnic FI and the fraction of households that make a donation. Ethnic diversity appears, therefore, to

affect the intensive rather than extensive margin. Looking deeper into which groups drive this effect,

we find that non-minorities contribute roughly $92 more per adult when their group share increases by

10 percentage points in the community, and Blacks contribute $390 more for the same increase in their

group share. By contrast, East Asians contribute $111 less per adult when their group share increases

by 10 percentage points. Finally, the effects are strongest in high income and low education

communities.


       Turning to religious diversity, a 10 percentage point increase in the FI reduces contributions by

about $20 per adult per year, a 10% reduction, though this estimate is noisy. Catholics increase their

donations by $69 per adult when their share in the population rises by 10 percentage points. We again

find no evidence that religious diversity affects the fraction of households that donate.
                                                     3
        In sum, our results indicate that the deleterious effects of diversity on public sector provision of

goods extends to privately provided public goods as well. Increases in ethnic and religious diversity

lead to significant declines in charitable giving in the urban Canadian areas in our sample. Over the ten

years of our study, ethnic diversity increased by six percentage points, and religious diversity by four

percentage points. Our estimates would suggest that, due to the negative effects of diversity on giving,

the charities we study receive twelve percent less in donations.


II – Existing Literature


        Many studies on diversity focus on the relationship between diversity and the amount or

distribution of public spending by governments or, more recently, on contributions or attitudes towards

activities or goods that generate public benefits (See reviews by Alesina and La Ferrara, 2005,

Stichnoth and Van der Straeten, 2009). The main conclusion from the literature is that diversity

reduces publicly provided goods, both across countries and across communities within a country

(mainly the United States). Ethnically diverse communities are found to spend less on schools (Alesina,

Baqir, Easterly, 1999 & 2000; Poterba, 1997, Goldin & Katz, 1999), less on roads (Alesina, Baqir,

Easterly, 1999 & 2000), and less on social programs in general as a fraction of GDP (Alesina, Glaeser,

and Sacerdote, 2001). One exception is that Cutler et al. (1993) find that changes in state-level

demographic characteristics have a negative effect on public spending, but at the county level the effect

is positive.


        A related literature also finds that diversity has a negative impact on individual behavior when

there are public benefits involved. In racially or ethnically heterogeneous communities, involvement in

social activities is lower (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2000), people are less likely to fill out census forms

(Vigdor, 2004), they contribute less to schools through voluntary fundraising events (Miguel and

Gugerty, 2005), and contribute less to community organizations (Okten and Osili, 2004). There are

several explanations offered for this effect. If different groups have different tastes or agendas for
                                                     4
public spending, then this disagreement may make it more difficult to raise the funds necessary to

provide those goods, and may make the goods themselves more costly1 (such as multilingual

education), and so overall provision is lower (Alesina et al. 1999). Other researchers have suggested

that individuals may be less willing to contribute to a good with public benefits if those benefits accrue

to other groups besides their own. There may be mistrust across groups (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2002,

Fershtman and Gneezy, 2001) or pro-social within-group norms that are not easily enforceable across

groups (Habyarimana et al., 2007).


        Several studies focus specifically on the relationship between diversity and altruistic behavior.

Hungerman (2009) finds evidence that charitable spending by all-white church congregations is more

sensitive to increases in the percent of the local community that is Black compared to more diverse

congregations. In an interesting contrast, Hungerman (2008) finds that government spending on

charities is less likely to crowd out charitable spending by United Methodist Churches in more

ethnically diverse communities. Experimental evidence by Fong and Luttmer (2009) shows that

giving to Hurricane Katrina victims is higher when the giver and recipient have the same racial

background, but there is no effect of race on the decision to give. In a different experiment, Fong and

Luttmer (2011) found that while non-Black participants view Black individuals as less worthy of

charity, it did not translate into less giving.


III – Empirical Strategy


        We are able to use our data to potentially draw shaper conclusions than prior studies. First, we

are able to consider a broader set of charities than churches alone. Second, U.S.-based studies are

limited by the racial categories available in the Census: Black, White, Hispanic, American Indian, and


1
  A nice example from Jackson (2010) is a fragmented community where some individuals want to provide public education
in one language, and other individuals want to provide it in another. It may be more costly to devise a system where
education is delivered in multiple languages compared to a more homogeneous community that funds education in one
language.

                                                          5
Asian/Pacific Islander. By contrast, the Canadian Census data have a broader set of groups available.

Third, Canada collects very comprehensive religious affiliation in the Census every 10 years, whereas

U.S. Census data has no measure for religion.


       Our empirical analysis is based on Vigdor (2002, 2004), who builds a community-level model

by aggregating an individual-level model. The main advantages of this exercise are that it provides a

behavioral interpretation to the coefficients we get from the community-level model, and motivates the

use of a Fragmentation Index (FI), which is the most common way to measure diversity.


       Suppose that the amount individual i in group g from community c at time t donates to charity

depends on the fraction of the community members who are in the same group:




where donationigct is an individual’s donation to any charity in dollars, and sharegct is the share of

group g in the population in community c at time t. Vigdor (2002) calls        the within-group affinity,

because it measures the extra amount a person is willing to donate when their group’s share in the

population increases. The coefficient      measures each group’s baseline contribution level. The

variables in      are individual-level factors affecting donations, such as income, and        are

community-level factors that may or may not vary over time.


       Aggregating to the community-year level, we get



                                                                           ̅             ̅ .


The overbars indicate community-level weighted averages at time t, where the weights are the group

shares in the community. In the aggregate, community-level donations are a function of the shares and




                                                     6
the squared shares, where the baseline and affinity effects are the coefficients on those shares. Use of

the FI as a regressor is motivated by restricting all of the squared shares to have the same effect,



                                                                                          ̅            ̅



           The FI is 1        ∑                  , so we can interpret –         as the effect of increasing heterogeneity

on donations. It measures the average effect of the individual squared shares. In practice, we estimate

models with and without the restriction that the squared shares have the same effect. In the regressions

where we restrict the coefficients on the squared shares to be the same we will use the FI as the main

independent variable (rather than the sum of the squared shares) for interpretation purposes. Note that

because aggregation creates heteroskedastic errors, we use standard errors that are heteroskedasticity

robust and clustered at the community level.2


           We control for the time varying factors in ̅              and        using data from the Census on the

variables most likely to be related to donations (discussed below). Additionally, we control for time-

invariant community factors in               with a set of community-level fixed effects. Our identifying

restrictions, therefore, are that the controls account for all time-varying factors that are related to both

diversity and donations, and any remaining unobservable measures are controlled adequately through

community-level fixed effects. For example there may be fundamental unobservable differences

between neighborhoods in Toronto and Kitchener in terms of both their diversity and charitable nature

that do not change over time; the fixed effects will control for these differences. One remaining issue

for identification is sorting across neighborhoods. Since our use of community fixed effects should

absorb most of the effects of sorting, we can maintain identification as long as there is no significant

migration based on charitableness of communities during our sample period. In particular, if more


2
    Also note that all regressions are weighted by the adult population size.

                                                                 7
charitable communities attract more diverse populations, then or estimates will be biased toward

finding a positive relationship between diversity and donations. As we show later, this is a minor

concern as the data does not suggest migration of this sort.




IV – Data


In this section we report the sources of our data, how we selected the sample for analysis, and provide

summary statistics for the observations we analyze.


IV.A – Data Description


         Data on donations come from the Summary of Charitable Donors, produced by Statistics

Canada. The dataset contains information on yearly total amounts contributed by residential

households, and number of contributors to charity aggregated to the Forward Sortation Area (FSA)

level (discussed below) from individual tax records.3 Data at this level of aggregation are only available

for FSAs in urban areas.4 We extract information on total amount contributed and total number of

contributors to registered charities for tax years 1991-2006. Registered charities include regular

charitable organizations providing any type of service, but also amateur athletic organizations,

universities inside and outside of Canada, tax exempt housing corporations in Canada, municipalities,

the United Nations, and charities outside of Canada that have been given a gift by the Government of

Canada (Statistics Canada, 2007).



3
  Specifically, information is based on line 340 of T1 federal tax forms.
4
  Statistics Canada produces the charitable donors data in such a way that users can aggregate to different levels, including
the city level. Because some FSAs straddle city borders, sometimes our data splits an FSA’s observation between all cities
within its border in a given year. In creating our sample, we simply added the donations across cities within an FSA
boundary in a given year. It is possible, however, that if a city within an FSA is very small, Statistics Canada could have
suppressed its data. To check whether the results were robust to excluding these areas, we reran all regressions eliminating
FSAs that straddled city borders (about 20% of the observations), and the results were very similar to those presented in the
manuscript. One notable exception is that the coefficient on the Religion Fragmentation Index in Table IX becomes
statistically significant, at roughly the same magnitude.

                                                              8
         From these data we create our two main outcome variables. First is the average donation per

adult, which we compute by dividing total donations by the adult (15+) population in each year.5 We

also divide number of charitable donors by the number of households to create our second outcome, the

fraction of households who donate. We divide by the number of households instead of the number of

individuals because of the tax treatment of charitable donations. Charity tax credits are transferrable

between spouses. Because the tax credit rates jump substantially after passing a monetary threshold, it

is most likely the case that one spouse claims all of the tax credits and the other spouse claims none.6

We therefore expect, as far as tax records are concerned, the number of donors more accurately reflects

the total number of households who donate, rather than the number of individuals.


         There are several unique features of donations data based on tax records. First, we cannot

identify the charity to which donations have been made. For example, donating to an arts organization

is equivalent to donating to a food bank or a church. This could be problematic if some types of

donations are sensitive to community composition and others are not. Donations also include those

made to large, international organizations, which again may not be sensitive to the composition of a

local community.


         Second, because data on donations are based on tax records, only donations reported on an

individual’s tax return are counted, and only for individuals who file a tax return. According to

documentation accompanying the charitable donors’ data, 66% of Canadians filed taxes in 1991, which

climbed to 74% in 2006. This may not be a substantial issue, however, because of the tax treatment of

donations discussed above: some individuals who do not file a tax return may have a spouse who does,



5
  In dividing total contributions derived from tax records by a measure of the adult population, we assume that people who
do not file a tax return have a contribution of zero. Alternatively, this measure could simply be interpreted as tax-receipted
donations per person.
6
  This is especially true if one spouse earns no income as the tax credit is non-refundable. The threshold levels and rates
vary over time. The thresholds are in the $200 to $250 range, the rate below the threshold is around 15%-17%, and the tax
credit rate roughly doubles for all dollars above the threshold.

                                                              9
and that spouse may claim the donation on his/her tax return. We are, therefore, likely picking up more

donations than the rate of filing might suggest.7


        We link data on donations to variables from the 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006 Census of Canada

aggregated to the FSA level. Statistics Canada collects data on a small number of variables such as

basic population counts and gender from 100% of the population (the “short form”), and other more

detailed information using a mandatory 20% sample (the “long form”).8 Data on ethnic groups,

collected through the long form, is based on an individual’s “visible minority” status, which assigns

people to one of twelve groups based mainly on skin tone. Because some groups are quite small, we

regroup individuals into the following categories: Black, East/Southeast Asian, South Asian,

Arab/West Asian, Latin American, Other, and not-visible-minority.9 Religious groups, also collected

on the long form, contain a much larger number of disaggregated categories, which we regroup for the

same reasons into: Catholic, Christian (other than Catholic), Jewish, Muslim, Other, and not religious.10

Data for visible minorities are available in the 1996, 2001, and 2006 Censuses, and data for religious

groups are available for 1991 and 2001.


        We draw all of our control measures from the Census. These include household income, family

structure, education, external and internal residential mobility, unemployment, population distribution,

language, housing stock, house values, home ownership, and rent. All controls are listed in Table I.




7
  We also control for the fraction of the population that files taxes in all regressions, to make sure we are comparing
communities with similar filing rates.
8
  Note, however, that in 2011 the long form portion of the Census was replaced with a voluntary survey of 30% of the
population called the National Household Survey. The short form remains mandatory.
9
  The groups available in the Census are: Chinese, South Asian, Black, Filipino, Latin American, Southeast Asian, Arab,
West Asian, Korean, Japanese, Visible Minority Not Included Elsewhere, and Multiple Visible Minority. Individuals who
report multiple visible minority groups or are not included elsewhere are sorted into the “other” group. Non-visible-
minorities include Aboriginal peoples.
10
   The groups are: Catholic ,United, Anglican, Presbyterian, Baptist, Lutheran, Pentecostal, Reform, Orthodox, Jehovah’s
Witness, Mennonite, Salvation Army, Mormon, Other Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh, Other, and No
Religion.

                                                           10
        Our data are aggregated to the FSA level, which is a relatively small geographic space used to

delineate postal routes. An FSA is the first three characters of the 6-digit Canadian postal code, where

the first identifies the province (in most cases) and the second identifies the area as urban or rural.

There are roughly 1,600 FSAs across Canada, and each is a relatively stable geographic area containing

only 7,000 households on average. FSAs in rural locations tend to occupy large areas, while those in

urban areas can be very small. Though they are generally stable, some FSAs do change boundaries

over time. This occurs mostly where an urban FSA is created out of part of a rural FSA, but urban FSA

are occasionally, though seldom, split into 2 or more urban FSAs. We refer to these as emerging FSAs.

Our solution to this was to regroup emerging FSAs back into their old boundaries, and use those

boundaries for all years. A detailed explanation of this procedure is available in Appendix B.11


IV.B – Sample


        Our sample universe consists of all urban FSAs between 1991 and 2006, the years when both

donations and Census data are available.12 There are 19,668 FSA-year observations over that time

period, or 1,269 FSAs. From this universe, we drop 1,159 observations (5.9%) where one of the key

Census measures contained missing data; 1,048 further observations (5.3%) from FSAs that are

missing donations data in one of the Census years; a final 353 observations (1.8%) that do not have a

link to Census data in at least one year. After these exclusions, we are left with 17,108 FSA-year

observations on charitable donations. Finally, a small number of emerging FSAs were regrouped with

other urban FSAs, leaving a final sample of 17,071 FSA-year observations.


        Because Census data are only available in 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006, whereas donations data

are available for all years, we linearly interpolate Census measures between Census years. Visible


11
   For example, splitting an urban FSA into two but maintaining the same label for one of them, we might observe what
appears to be large population drops or changes in other variables. But, this would simply be a product of redrawing
boundaries. By regrouping FSAs back into their own boundaries, we avoid such issues.
12
   This sample restriction also excludes FSAs that were regrouped back into rural FSAs, as explained in Appendix B.

                                                           11
minority information was not collected in 1991, so we therefore do not interpolate this measure

between 1991 and 1996. Likewise, religion information was not collected in 1996 or 2006, so we do

not interpolate between 2001 and 2006 for this measure. Because visible minority and religion data do

not fully overlap, we use different samples to analyze ethnic and religious diversity. To study ethnic

diversity, we use 12,056 FSA-year observations between 1996 and 2006. To study religious diversity,

we use 11,033 FSA-year observations between 1991 and 2001.


IV.C - Summary Statistics


       In Table I, Panel A, we present means of donation-related variables. Average donations per

adult (converted to constant year 2000 Canadian Dollars) increased by 79% between 1991 and 2006,

with most of the growth occurring between 1996-2006. On the other hand, the fraction of households

who make any donation falls by roughly 8 percentage points over the same period.


       In Table I, Panel B, we summarize Census information. Our key measure of diversity is the FI,

which measures the probability that any two randomly selected individuals are in different groups. In

1996 there was on average a 22% chance of two people being from different visible minority groups,

which climbs to 28% by 2006. There is much more diversity among religious groups: in 1991 there

was a 53% chance on average that individuals belong to different religious groups, which rose to 57%

by 2001. While the baseline level of diversity is much higher in terms of religion, growth in diversity

is higher in terms of visible minority status.


       We also present statistics showing changes over time in control measures that are related to

diversity and donations. Some noteworthy changes are that average household income grows by

roughly $5600, the fraction of the population who are immigrants grows by 4 percentage points, the

fraction with a university education grows by 7 percentage points, and housing value grows by roughly

$56,000.


                                                   12
           In Table II we take a closer look at the distribution of donations and diversity. In Panel A, we

report the overall distribution of each variable, pooling together FSAs over time. The overall mean

level of donations is roughly $205 and is quite variable, with the 10th percentile average donation of

about $55, and the 90th percentile of $364. The visible minority FI standard deviation of 0.218 is

roughly the size of its mean, 0.254. Religious FI has a slightly smaller standard deviation, but it is less

than half the size of its mean.


           Panels B and C of Table II examine the distributions of these variables between and within

FSAs. It is clear from comparing Panels B and C to Panel A that there is substantial variation between

communities. The within-FSA standard deviations are much smaller than the between-FSA standard

deviations. It is also interesting, but perhaps not surprising given the short period of our sample, that

the diversity measures in do not show a large amount of variation over time.


           To help visualize diversity in Canada, Figure I shows the spatial distribution of ethnic diversity

in the Golden Horseshoe (the populated area around Lake Ontario, including Toronto).13 Prior to

compiling the Figure, we grouped all FSAs into quintiles based on their FI, and represented by the

different colors. The delineated areas in the Figure are FSAs, and darker shades of yellow represent

more diverse areas. The most diverse communities are those located near Toronto; as one moves farther

away from the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), communities become more homogeneous. In similar maps

not reported, for other cities we do notice variance in this pattern across city size and geographic

location in Canada.


           In Table III we present data on the demographic shifts over time. Recall that the FI is the sum

of the squared visible minority or religion shares. Panel A shows baseline shares in 1996 and the

change in the shares over 10 years for visible minority groups. Clearly the largest group is non-visible-

minorities with an 85.47% share. East/Southeast Asian is the next largest with 6.43%. South Asians
13
     To save space we only present this Figure for ethnic diversity. Graphs for religious diversity are available upon request.

                                                                13
are roughly 3% of the population, Blacks are 2.6%, and other groups are smaller. The largest visible

minority groups are also the fastest growing: the East/Southeast Asian group increases its population

share by roughly 32%, and the South Asians increase their share by about 67%. Column 3 reports how

many of the FSAs in the sample experience growth in each of the groups listed. Generally speaking,

about 60% to 70% of FSAs in the sample have growing visible minority shares. Offsetting this growth

is a shrinking non-visible-minority group: they lose 5.6% of their share and only 12.5% of FSAs see

growth in this group over time.


       Religious groups do not move as uniformly. Catholics are the largest group with 45% of the

population in 1991, which shrinks slightly over the subsequent 10 years. Combined, all other Christian

religions make up 35.76% of the population in 1991, which also shrinks over time. On the other hand,

individuals claiming no religion, who comprise 13.72% of the population in 1991, increase their share

over time. Perhaps the most telling statistic is that 91.03% of all FSAs in the sample increase their

share of individuals reporting no religion.


       Table IV presents the mean relationship between diversity and donations. The first three

columns break up the visible minority FI into three quantiles and recomputes the means from Table I.

We see donations are higher and more people donate in more ethnically diverse FSAs. A similar

pattern is observed in columns 4-6, which separate the data by religious diversity. However, changes

in means of the other variables across the quantiles suggest that this may not be a causal relationship, in

particular because income is also higher in diverse neighborhoods. What is likely the case here is that

more diverse neighborhoods are also the major urban centers like Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver,

which will have more diverse and wealthier populations. We control for these factors in the regression

analysis below.


V – Results



                                                    14
In next two subsections we first look at ethnic diversity, then religious diversity, both using the

Fragmentation Index of diversity. In the third subsection we reconsider these results with a different

index meant to capture concentration or polarization of communities.


V.A – Ethnic Diversity


       In Table V we present regressions of average donations on diversity using various

specifications that add increasing amounts of control variables, and then use squared shares instead of

the FI. Column 1 is a simple OLS regression of donations on visible minority FI without controls

(except year effects), which we use a baseline for comparison. As we saw in the summary statistics,

there is a positive relationship between diversity and donations in this simple regression. The

coefficient on FI measures the effect of moving from complete homogeneity (FI = 0) to complete

heterogeneity (FI = 1). Column 2 adds a set of control variables from the Census; this changes the

sign of the coefficient from positive to negative. Our preferred specification is in column 3, which

adds FSA fixed effects to the control measures in the previous specification. Estimates from this

specification imply that an increasing of 0.1 in the FI visible minority diversity measure lowers the

average donation per adult by about $27 (that is, 271.02 times 0.1). This represents a 14 percent drop

in average donations per adult, which we consider to be a substantial effect. To put this into

perspective between 1996 and 2006 ethnic diversity in Canada increased by 0.06 points, which our

results suggests lowered giving in urban areas by eight percent.


       In column 4, we generalize the specification to allow the squared shares to enter separately into

the regression. These coefficients are interpreted as the change in a particular group’s willingness to

donate when the share of its own group in the population increases from zero to 100%. Identifying the

squared shares separately is more difficult when using fixed effects since, as the summary statistics

suggested, they do not vary substantially over time. For this reason, few of these coefficients are

statistically significant. Two notable exceptions are that an increase of 10 percentage points in the
                                                    15
share of non-minorities increases donations by $111 for this group, and a 10-point increase in the share

Black increases donations by $390.14 On the other hand, other visible minority groups display group

aversion. A 10 percentage point increase in the East Asian group reduces donations by roughly $111.

Others are not statistically significant. Therefore, while the result from column 3 suggests that on

average groups are more willing to donate when their group share rises, not all groups display the same

pattern.


        In columns 5 and 6 we check the robustness of our results to the linear interpolation between

Census years. Recall that for visible minorities the Census is only observed in 1996, 2001, and 2006.

Values in other years are interpolated. When we restrict the sample to only years when the Census data

are observed, we get very similar results, though less statistically significant in general. We are thus

confident that our results are not driven by the linear interpolation procedure.


        Digging deeper into what might be driving the diversity effect, in Table VI we break the sample

into quantiles based on household income and university education then analyze those subsamples

separately. Columns 1 to 3 show that while the diversity effect is negative for all income quantiles, the

strongest effect occurs in the richest FSAs, though these results are not statistically significant.15 Table

VI also reports on subsamples of the data based on the fraction of individuals in the FSA with a

university education. We see that the effect is highest in communities where university education is

low.


           Tables VII and VIII repeat the previous two tables using the fraction of households that donate

as the dependent variable. In Table VII, our preferred specification is column 3, which reports



14
   While the coefficient on share Black appears large relative to the overall mean donation, it would be more appropriate to
compare to the mean among Black individuals in the sample. Due to the aggregated nature of our data, we are not able to
compute the average donation among Black individuals in the sample. Thus, it is unclear whether this coefficient is large or
small.
15
   There are several possible explanations for this. The first is simply that wealthy individuals donate more to charity and
are more likely to give, which creates greater ability to reduce giving.

                                                            16
coefficients from regressions of fraction of households who donate on the visible minority FI, a set of

Census controls, year effects, and FSA fixed effects. Here we find no statistically significant effect.

Breaking out the FI into squared shares, we see that a 10 percentage point increase in the Black share

increases probability of donation by about 18 percentage points, and a 10 percentage point increase in

the Other share increases probability of donation by about 81 percentage points. Other coefficients are

statistically insignificant.


        Table VIII breaks the sample into quantiles based on household income and education. The

most notable result in this table is that increasing the FI by 0.1 leads to a 3.3 percentage point drop in

the fraction of households who donate in FSAs with low levels of university education. This is

consistent with the result for donations reported in Table VI.


        Overall, the results indicate that on average, charitable giving is sensitive to the demographic

composition of the community. We find evidence that the propensity to donate and the amount of the

donation are sensitive to the ethnic makeup of the community, though not all groups are sensitive in the

same way. Indeed, some groups actually donate less when their group share increases. On average,

however, the population does show group affinity.


V.B – Religious Diversity


        Table IX reports the results of regressions where both average donations and fraction of

households who donate are regressed on diversity measures. For brevity, we report only the results

from our preferred specifications, which include fixed FSA effects and Census controls. Using the FI

as our diversity measure, we find that increasing religious diversity by 0.1 reduces average donations

per adult by $20, but this coefficient is imprecisely measured. Using squared shares instead of the FI,




                                                     17
we find that Catholics have a statistically significant positive group affinity. Though none of the

coefficients on other groups are statistically significant, some are positive and some are negative.16


        In Table IX we also report that the fraction of households who donate is relatively insensitive to

religious fragmentation. In specifications that use squared group shares separately, we find that a 0.1

increase in the non-religious population leads to a 15.2 percentage point drop in non-religious

household donations, and a similar increase the fraction of Others lowers Other household donations by

7 percentage points. A 0.1 increase in the share Christian, on the other hand, decreases donations by 6

percentage points. Again, not all others display a group affinity, but on average the increasing diversity

reduces the fraction of households who donate by a small amount.


        In Table X, we break up the sample by income and education quantiles and estimate models

with donations per adult as the dependent variable. Though coefficients are generally not significant,

the pattern is that more high income and high education neighborhoods have stronger responses to

increased religious diversity. In Table XI we find no real evidence that the diversity effect varies

across income and education groups.


        To this point we have estimated the effect of ethnic and religious diversity in separate

specifications, the primary reason being data limitations. To the extent that these two measures are

correlated, part of the observed effect of ethnic diversity may actually be a religious effect, and vice

versa. To explore this possibility, in Table XII we estimate specifications with both measures of

diversity. For this exercise we use only data from 1996-2001, the time period when both visible

minority and religion data are available. In columns 1 and 2 we use the new sample to estimate our

preferred fixed effects specification with ethnic and religious diversity entering separately, for


16
  We also generated estimates based on two alternative groupings of religions. In the first, we simply joined Catholics with
the Christian group. In the second, we decompose Christians into finer groups, and also regroup the other religions. Results
and descriptions of the new groups are in Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2. The coefficient on FI remains negative, but the
magnitude is stronger when Catholics are grouped with Christians.

                                                            18
comparison purposes. In column 3, we include both diversity measures in the regression. When both

are included, we find that a 0.1 unit increase in ethnic diversity reduces donations by $48, whereas a

0.1 unit increase in religious diversity reduces donations by $11, though the latter is not statistically

significant. Comparing to columns 1 and 2, we see that the ethnic diversity coefficient is higher, but

the religion coefficient is significantly smaller in magnitude. Thus, while the effect of each measure on

donations partly reflects the effect of the other, each continues to exert an independent effect on

donations.


V.C – Diversity or Polarization?


        While our model motivates our use of the FI, we estimate models with an alternative measure of

community diversity frequently found in the literature called the RQ index (Montalvo & Reynal-

Querol, 2002), which is defined as:

              K
                 0.5  sharekjt 2
RQ jt  1                      sharekjt
            k 1                
                        0.5                   .


        Whereas the FI measures fragmentation, RQ measures polarization. The difference is best

illustrated by example. Suppose there are three ethnic groups in the population. FI takes a maximum

when the population is divided equally among the groups, whereas RQ takes a maximum when the

population is divided equally among only two of the groups. The distinction between fractionalization

and polarization could prove important if it is really two opposing groups that matter, rather than

diversity spread over many groups.


        Despite the differences in interpretation, both measures are highly correlated at low values of

the FI, not correlated at middle values, and negatively correlated at high values. Thus, relatively

homogenous societies that become more diverse also initially become more polarized, but highly

diverse societies that become more diverse can become less polarized.

                                                     19
       The results of regressions with the RQ index are presented in Table XIII. Using the visible

minority sample in Panel A, we estimate that ethnic polarization also reduces average charitable

donations per adult. A 0.1 change in this index reduces donations by roughly $17. Note that this index

is not in the same scale as the FI, so the coefficients are not directly comparable. Nevertheless, the

effect is in the same direction, which is not surprising because at low levels of the FI, the two measures

are highly correlated. Similar to prior results, polarization does not have a statistically significant

effect on the fraction of households who donate.


       In Panel B, we show that an increase in religious polarization by 0.1 reduces donations by $13.

By contrast, more polarized communities are estimated to increase the probability of donation slightly.

A 0.1 increase in the RQ index increases the fraction of households who donate by 1 percentage point.

This result is in direct contrast to the regressions using FI, but are not surprising since at high values of

the FI the two measures are negatively correlated. A more polarized community in this case is a less

fragmented one, so to the extent that it is fragmentation that matters, the opposite sign is expected.


VII – Conclusion


       In this paper we examine the relationship between ethnic diversity, religious diversity, and

charitable donations. Previous literature has shown that publicly provided goods can be lower in

jurisdictions that are more heterogeneous along these dimensions. Our results confirm this finding in

the case of privately provided public goods, in particular private charity. We find that the average

donation per adult in our sample drops by $27 per year when the ethnic FI increases by 0.1 points. This

adds up to a substantial drop in the level of this public good. This effect is mainly driven by non-

minorities, who contribute $9 less for each percentage point their group share drops, and Blacks, who

contribute $39 less. The average effect of ethnic diversity on donations occurs most strongly in high

income, and in low education neighborhoods. We find no evidence that ethnic diversity affects

donations per household on average.
                                                     20
       We also estimate that more religious diversity might also lower contributions. We find

significant evidence that Catholics are more willing to donate when their group share rises in the

population. The effect of religious diversity on donations per adult is highest in high income and

highly educated neighborhoods, though these estimates are less precise than the estimates based on

ethnic diversity.


       Our results imply that the recent and continuing demographic changes across North America

and Europe may have a significant and sizable impact on charitable services provided through

voluntary contributions of individuals. As communities grow more diverse, charity revenues may fall.

This raises further public policy concerns, especially in urban areas, as religious and ethnic diversity

inevitably grow.

Notes: "Overall" uses the pooled sample of FSAs over time. "Between FSA" takes the average for each FSA across time.
Within FSA takes the deviation of each FSA from its mean. The statistics for average donations and fraction of households
who donate are computed using all data between 1991 and 2006. The distribution of the visible minority Fragmentation
Index is computed with data from 1996-2006 because no data is available in 1991 for this measure. For the religion
Fragmentation Index, data from 1991-2001 is used because there is no data in 2006.

Notes: Bolded coefficients are significant at the 5% level; bold-italic coefficients are significant at the
10% level. Full sample includes data from all years 1996-2006, including linearly interpolated census
data between years. Census years includes data from 1996, 2001, and 2006 only. Visible minority
shares were demeaned prior to estimation, so the coefficients are interpreted as the effect of increasing
the share on donations when the share is at its mean. F is the F-statistic of overall significance of the
model. Census controls are all variables listed in the previous tables.

Notes: Bolded coefficients are significant at the 5% level; bold-italic coefficients are significant at the 10%
level. Income and Education terciles are based on 2001 data, and applied to all years. Income terciles are based
on average household income, education terciles are based on the fraction of individuals with a university
degree. Visible minority shares were demeaned prior to estimation, so the coefficients are interpreted as the
effect of increaseing the share on donations when the share is at its mean. F is the F-statistic of overall

Notes: Bolded coefficients are significant at the 5% level; bold-italic coefficients are significant at the 10%
level. Full sample includes data from all years 1996-2006, including linearly interpolated census data between
years. Census years includes data from 1996, 2001, and 2006 only. Visible minority shares were demeaned
prior to estimation, so the coefficients are interpreted as the effect of increasing the share on donations when the
share is at its mean. F is the F-statistic of overall significance of the model. Census controls are all variables

Notes: Regression contains data from 1996-2001, the overlapping years of religion and visible minority data.
Bolded coefficients are significant at the 5% level, and bold-italic coefficients are significant at the 10% level.
Religion and Visible Minority shares were demeaned prior to estimation, so the coefficients are interpreted as
the effect of increasing the share on donations when the share is at its mean. F is the F-statistic of overall
significance of the model. Census controls are all variables listed in the previous tables.

Notes: Bolded coefficients are significant at the 5% level, and bold-italic coefficients are significant at the 10%
level. RQ is a measure of polarization of groups, as discussed in Montalvo & Reynal-Querol (2002). Religion

increasing the share on donations when the share is at its mean. F is the F-statistic of overall significance of the

Appendix B: Method for Regrouping FSA Boundaries


       Our analysis uses the Forward Sortation Area (FSA) to approximate an individual’s community

or local neighborhood. We chose this area partly because data is readily available for this level of

aggregation, and partly because with an average of 7000 people inside its boundaries, it is a reasonable

proxy for the group of people with whom an individual interacts regularly.


       The boundaries of each FSA are drawn by Canada Post to accommodate mail delivery, and over

time they are occasionally redrawn as the local populations change. This occurs mostly as parts of

rural areas grow large enough to require their own FSA, at which point Canada Post will reconfigure

the boundaries. While less common, an urban FSA can become large enough to split into two urban

FSAs, or shrink enough to be absorbed into an existing FSA.


       Changes in FSA boundaries pose a problem for our analysis mainly because they might lead to

“false” population or demographic changes. For example, suppose that within an FSA all of the visible

minorities live in a rapidly expanding sub-area of the FSA. Suppose also that this sub-area grows large

enough over time to become its own FSA. Upon separation, it will seem as though the original FSA

becomes completely homogeneous (i.e. it loses all of its visible minorities), even though no individuals

have left the original boundaries of that area and the demographics may not have changed by much.

Unchecked, these boundary changes might cause spurious results in our regression models – especially

our preferred specification, which uses FSA fixed effects.


       We solve this problem using the method described below. We refer to new FSAs that appear

over time as “emerging” FSAs, and FSAs that disappear as “retiring” FSAs. Our solution to the

problem of changing boundaries is to combine each emerging FSA with the FSA it emerged from, and

each retiring FSA with the FSA it retires into. The FSAs we use to combine with the emerging and

retiring FSAs are identified by hand using various methods, such as: GIS software to overlay FSA

                                                   41
boundary maps from different years; Google Maps to identify other FSAs in close proximity;

coordinates of the centroid of each FSA to determine the proximity between any pair of FSAs.17 We

only recombine emerging and retiring FSAs from 1996 forward, because we do not have FSA

boundary maps or data on rural FSAs for 1991. Before applying our sample exclusions, in our tax data

we identified 119 emerging FSAs and 4 retiring FSAs between 1991 and 1996. After applying our

sample exclusions, we are left with 84 emerging FSAs and no retiring FSAs. We drop these 84 FSAs

from the data for years 1991 to 1995, and do not use them for religion regressions in 1996. Note that

this has no impact on the Visible Minority analysis because it uses only data from 1996 forward. We

suspect that this would have a minimal impact on the Religion regressions also, because most emerging

FSAs tend to come from rural areas, which would be dropped from the analysis anyway.18


         In our tax data, we have identified 159 emerging FSAs between 1996 and 2006, and 5 retiring

FSAs. 19 Of the emerging FSAs, 142 are linked back to a rural area, and are not considered as part of

our sample universe because we do not analyze rural FSAs. We therefore have to worry only about 17

emerging FSAs and 5 retiring FSAs. After applying our sample restrictions, we have only 5 remaining

emerging FSAs and no retiring FSAs. These emerging FSAs are combined with the urban FSA from

which it emerged. As noted in the main text, there are 17,108 FSA-year observations prior to the

recombining emerging FSAs into their old boundaries, and 17,071 observations after.

   We created a file that links an FSA to its group based on this hand-checking procedure, which is available upon request.
18
   Recall that because we have no data on rural FSAs in 1991, we are unable to map these emerging FSAs back into the
rural locations.
19
   Our sample excludes all rural FSAs and those that have missing census data in at least one year, missing tax data in at
least one year, or do not link to the census at in at least one year.
