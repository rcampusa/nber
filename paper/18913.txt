The Articulation Effect of Government Policy: Health Insurance Mandates Versus Taxes

                                            ABSTRACT

We examine how the articulation of government policy affects behavior. Our experiment compares
a government mandate to purchase health insurance to a financially equivalent tax on the uninsured.
Participants report their probability of purchasing health insurance under one of the two articulations
of the policy. The experiment was conducted in four waves, from December 2011 to November 2012.
We document the controversy over the Affordable Care Act’s insurance mandate provision that changed
the political discourse during the year. Pre-controversy, articulating the policy as a mandate, rather
than a financially equivalent tax, increased probability of insurance purchase by 10.6 percentage points
— an effect comparable to a $1000 decrease in annual premiums. After the controversy, the mandate
is no more effective than the tax. Our results show that how a policy is articulated affects behavior
and that persuasion and public opinion management can help achieve policy objectives at lower cost.

1. Introduction
        Governments aim to discourage or encourage certain behaviors of their citizens, and they
employ a variety of policy levers to achieve this goal. Economists analyzing these policies
typically assume that the efficacy of a policy is driven exclusively by the extrinsic incentives it
creates. 1 For example, decision makers are assumed to care about the size of a penalty along with
the probability of having this penalty imposed (Becker 1968). This assumption has a natural
appeal, since it allows the analysis of government policy to be simplified to easily observable
incentives (e.g. financial penalties in the form of fines, taxes, or subsidies, or criminal penalties
such as forced community service or incarceration).
        However, the way a policy is articulated to the public might also impact how individuals
respond to it. Compliance with a given policy might depend not only on its explicit financial or
criminal incentives, but also on how it is perceived by agents. For example, if the goal is to
discourage a behavior, the government could prohibit the behavior and enforce the prohibition
with a fine. Alternatively, the government could tax the behavior without an explicit prohibition.
Traditional models of tax policy would treat the tax and the fine as equivalent so long as the
magnitude and probability of their being imposed were equal. However, articulating the policy
with a prohibition may emphasize a moral obligation or invoke different levels of moral suasion
(see Lieberman, Samuels and Ross 2004). In addition, the prohibition could carry different
information about social norms or directly shape social norms regarding a behavior (Benabou
and Tirole 2011, Elster 1989). As a result, a penalty articulated as a prohibition and a fine might
affect compliance differently than a penalty framed as a tax.
        How a policy is articulated is determined both by political actors and popular discourse,
as each influences how individuals understand a policy’s meaning, motivation, authority, and/or
legitimacy. Policy-makers act first, choosing, for example, whether a financial incentive should
be initially articulated as a fine, a tax, or a price. For instance, a real-estate developer can face
identical financial incentives articulated as either: (1) a “requirement” to include affordable
housing or else pay a fine, (2) a “requirement” to include affordable housing but have the option
to pay a fee instead, or (3) a “suggestion” to provide affordable housing through a discount on
higher base development fees. Similarly, late tax filers may be assessed a “penalty” from the IRS


1
  A notable exception is Auerbach et al. (2010), which partially motivates this study, as well as the
literature on tax salience (e.g. Chetty, Loony and Croft 2009; Finkelstein 2009).

                                                   Page 2
or receive a “loan” from the IRS with a high interest rate. Parking can be regulated with fees or
fines. More broadly, policy-makers can allocate the nominal assignment of tax liability to
consumers or producers. While standard theory suggests that who you tax is irrelevant for tax
incidence (which is simply determined by supply and demand elasticities), assigning a carbon tax
to individuals as opposed to firms might affect behavior differently by highlighting the
government’s goal of dissuading individuals from polluting. After policy-makers choose an
articulation, popular discourse acts second: statements by political actors and commentators, as
well as news media coverage, all influence the perceived meaning and legitimacy of a policy.
       We study how the articulation of government policy affects behavior by analyzing the
decision to purchase health insurance in the context of a policy that either taxes individuals who
do not purchase insurance or mandates purchase and fines those who do not comply. This setting
has a particular appeal for the study of the articulation of government policy. The individual
mandate to purchase insurance was a cornerstone of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act (PPACA). Our study takes place before the policy was implemented, during a time of
policy uncertainty.
       The articulation of this policy was actively debated. At first, government officials
attempted to articulate the policy as a mandate to purchase insurance, with an associated fine for
disobeying the mandate, rather than as a tax on remaining uninsured; President Obama
specifically denied it was a tax (Pear 2010). The stated logic for employing this articulation was
that a mandate would affect behavior beyond the fine’s financial incentive in a way a tax would
not, presumably because the mandate implies an obligation to comply with the law (Elmendorf
2011, Auerbach et al. 2010). During the months leading up to the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling
on PPACA, political opponents and discussions in the popular press undermined the
government’s desired policy articulation. Positions articulated in the press suggested that the
mandate had no particular moral suasion (i.e. it was unconstitutional). Throughout the paper we
denote this period as a “controversy” over the policy, and we document its beginning using the
frequency of mandate-related articles in the press. Third, Justice Robert's decisive opinion in the




                                               Page 3
Supreme Court case on PPACA upheld the mandate as constitutional precisely because it could
be re-articulated as a tax. 2
        We use an experimental survey to investigate whether the articulation of government
policy affects behavioral intentions (rather than public opinion; see Jacoby 2000). 3 We find that
before the controversy over the mandate, individuals behaved differently when the policy was
articulated as a mandate with a fine compared to when it was articulated as a tax. Relative to the
tax, the mandate articulation increased insurance purchase intentions by 10.6%, comparable to a
$1,000 decrease in premiums. After the controversy, which undermined the legitimacy of the
mandate, this effect was gone.
        To estimate our effects, we asked a sample of U.S. residents to report their probability of
purchasing health insurance at two different prices ($3000/year and $2000/year) under one of
two government policies: either (1) a mandate with a fine of $700 for not having insurance, or
(2) an uninsurance tax of $700 that must be paid by anyone without insurance. The two policies
are exactly financially equivalent, as in each case the individual’s wealth is reduced by $700 if
insurance is not purchased (and by the insurance premium if it is purchased). 4 This methodology
allows us to vary, in a controlled way, how the policy is articulated. While it would be ideal to
investigate the articulation effect in practice by observing real insurance purchase decisions, such
a test is infeasible. The ideal test would require variation in how a policy is articulated (i.e. what
the government called the policy and how it was discussed in the news) among otherwise
identical individuals. Furthermore, indirect evidence is sparse, particularly in the context of an
insurance mandate. Before the passage of the 2010 federal health reform, Massachusetts was the
only U.S. state to have a mandate to purchase individual insurance. Compliance with the
Massachusetts mandate was high (Steinbrook 2008; Gruber 2011), but it is unknown whether the
mandate was more effective than a similarly sized or tax or subsidy would have been. Similarly,
while some U.S. states have mandates to purchase auto insurance, it is unknown whether these
mandates would affect behavior differently if articulated as taxes.
2
  As Roberts wrote in the majority opinion: “it is reasonable to construe what Congress has done as
increasing taxes on those who have a certain amount of income, but choose to go without health
insurance...” (National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius 2012)
3
  Individuals may support or oppose a policy without it affecting their compliance with that policy.
4
   Moreover, the mandate and tax are both very similar to a $700 subsidy that is received if and only if an
individual purchases insurance, except that the subsidy effectively increases the individual’s wealth. This
income effect is likely to have little effect on behavior if $700 per year is small relative to an individual’s
lifetime wealth.

                                                     Page 4
        As noted above, we find a strong effect of the mandate articulation in the first two waves
of the study, which took place before the controversy and extensive debate about the insurance
mandate that occurred leading up to the Supreme Court ruling. In these waves, calling the policy
a mandate rather than a tax had the same 10.6 percentage point increase on insurance purchase
intentions as decreasing the annual premium from $3000 to $2000.
        We document an increase in news media mentions of the health insurance mandate
beginning in March 2012, with the public debate continuing through the Supreme Court ruling
on PPACA and its individual mandate in June 2012. The controversy has a complex effect,
including challenging the legitimacy of the mandate and highlighting the financial equivalence of
the mandate and tax. Because our study analyzes the effect of government policy articulation
before, during, and after the controversy (including before and after the Supreme Court ruling on
PPACA), we are able to examine how the relative effectiveness of the mandate changed during
this debate. After the controversy surrounding the mandate, the relative effectiveness of the
mandate disappeared.
        These two sets of results demonstrate that there is (1) an articulation effect of government
policy and (2) that it is malleable. The results suggest that policy makers who want to encourage
or discourage a particular behavior have a lever to pull in the way they articulate policy, but that
this framing is not entirely under the government’s control.
        Our finding that the articulation of policy affects behavior is similar in spirit to the
hypothesis within Law and Economics that law has an “expressive function” (Sunstein 1995).
The “expressive function” hypothesis suggests that a law can affect behavior by being codified
even without being enforced (Funk 2007). Researchers have argued that the law has an
expressive function because it provides information to people about what others think of a
particular behavior (Dharmapala and McAdams 2003) or because it otherwise alters norms
(Sunstein 1996). Here, we take this logic a step further and argue that even after a law has been
codified, how it is articulated to the public can affect behavior. Moreover, we provide an
empirical test of this effect.
        Articulation is a broad concept. It includes framing manipulations that present identical
information in different ways: for instance, describing probabilistic outcomes with frequencies
versus probabilities (e.g. 1 in 25 versus 4%; see Hoffrage et al. 2000), or survival rates versus
mortality rates for a surgical procedure (McNeil, Pauler and Tversky 1988). However, various


                                                 Page 5
articulations of a given policy may also provide different information about intentions, beliefs, or
norms. As noted above, articulations can vary in whether there is a moral component associated
with the policy: setting a price does not necessary attach a moral dimension to a decision, but
setting a fine typically implies that (at least someone) thinks the behavior is “wrong.” An
important dimension of articulation includes manipulations of loss aversion, as evidence shows
that individuals can be loss averse regarding items they own or expect to receive (Kahneman,
Knetsch and Thaler 1990, Ericson and Fuster 2011). For instance, an incentive can be presented
as a fee plus a surcharge, or as a higher fee minus a discount. Loss aversion is not the focus of
this paper, however, as we examine two different articulations in which the incentives are in the
loss domain: fines and taxes.
          Finally, our work is distinct from previous research that has found that the salience of a
government policy can alter its effects. For instance, Chetty, Loony and Croft (2009) show that
posting sales-tax inclusive prices lead people to respond to the tax-inclusive price, and
Finkelstein (2009) shows that drivers who receive a monthly bill for tolls (EZ Pass) have worse
recall of the toll amount. 5 In our experiment, the policy and its associated monetary incentives (a
fine or tax for not purchasing insurance) are equally salient in both conditions.


2. Behavioral Model
          This section formalizes how the articulation of policy affects behavior. In the standard
economic model, individuals maximize utility subject to a budget constraint and do not care
about how a government policy is described. Let p be the price of doing the action favored by the
policy (in our example, purchasing insurance). Let f be the penalty (whether a tax or fine), paid
with probability 1, for with failing to comply with the policy (here, remaining uninsured). Let an
individual’s wealth be given by w. We write utility as U(w,i) where 𝑖 ∈ {0,1} indicates whether
the person has purchased insurance and the term i in the utility function represents the standard
utility component of having insurance (e.g. as derived from protection against risk).
          In the standard model, an individual will take the desired action (e.g. buy insurance) if
and only if:
                                       𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑝, 1) > 𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑓, 0)



5
    Similarly, attention (Lacetera, Pope and Syndor 2012) may matter.

                                                   Page 6
Since 𝑈 is strictly increasing in wealth, more people purchase health insurance when 𝑓 > 0 than
when 𝑓 = 0. Notice that the model does not distinguish between a fine and a tax since only the
penalty associated with failing to fulfill the government policy enters the utility function.
       We augment this standard model to include an additional moral or normative motive for
responding to government policy. This normative component is 𝑣(𝑎, 𝑖) that depends on the way
the government policy is articulated, 𝑎, and whether the individual purchases insurance, 𝑖.
       We assume for simplicity that this normative component of utility is separable from the
rest of the utility function, but this is not essential. Now, the individual purchases insurance
whenever:
                       𝑣(𝑎, 1) − 𝑣(𝑎, 0) > 𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑓, 0) − 𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑝, 1)
       As will be described in detail below, our experimental design holds constant the financial
penalty f for remaining uninsured but changes the articulation 𝑎. Notice that the articulation a
encompasses not only what the government calls the policy, but also how it is perceived by
individuals as a result of public discourse. A policy called a “mandate” may or may not be
perceived as legitimate (or, for example, constitutional) and that may affect whether a mandate
carries normative weight. While the articulation 𝑎 is the product of both what the policy is called
and the broader political discourse, for simplicity in describing the experiment, we will simply
refer to 𝑎 as being an element of {𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒, 𝑡𝑎𝑥}.
       Since random assignment in each wave of our experiment will give us the same
distribution of 𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑓, 0) − 𝑈(𝑤 − 𝑝, 1) in both treatments, we will be able to identify the
relationship between 𝑣(𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒, 1) − 𝑣(𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒, 0) and 𝑣(𝑡𝑎𝑥, 1) − 𝑣(𝑡𝑎𝑥, 0) in each
wave. If people are more likely to buy insurance under the mandate condition than under the tax
condition in a wave, we can conclude that
                 𝑣(𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒, 1) − 𝑣(𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒, 0) > 𝑣(𝑡𝑎𝑥, 1) − 𝑣(𝑡𝑎𝑥, 0)
and consequently that the articulation of the policy as a mandate is more effective at generating
the desired behavior in this wave than the articulation of the policy as a tax.


3. Experimental Design
       In our experiment, all participants read a single policy vignette and decided how likely
they would be to purchase health insurance. Participants were randomly assigned to a mandate or



                                                Page 7
tax condition (a between-subject design). Participants were told that the state of healthcare policy
was in flux and asked to suppose that the government decided: 6
    •   Mandate Condition: “to mandate everyone purchase insurance, or else pay a fine of $700
        each year”
    •   Uninsurance Tax Condition: “to recommend that everyone purchase health insurance,
        and charge people without insurance an uninsurance tax of $700 each year”


        Then, participants were asked what they would do if their current health insurance policy
were no longer available and they were to become uninsured. Particularly, they were asked to
choose between purchasing “coverage that is as good as the coverage that members of Congress
get” at a market price of $3000 per year, or staying uninsured (i.e. this was the only insurance
policy to which they had access). Participants indicated how likely they would be to purchase the
policy on a 7 point scale, ranging from “almost certain to buy the policy (96-100% chance of
buying the policy)” to “almost certain to stay uninsured (0-4% chance of buying the policy)”; see
Online Appendix for the details of the question and response scale. After answering this question,
participants were asked, on the same scale, how likely they would be to purchase the policy if it
instead cost $2000 per year. They then saw a number of follow-up questions, which are
described below and in the Appendix.
        Participants’ purchase intentions are hypothetical choices. Measuring actual choices is
preferable but infeasible, as doing so would require policy makers to randomize how the actual
policy is articulated to different individuals. Hypothetical choices are regularly used to provide
valuable information when actual choices are unavailable, most often in valuing environmental
attributes (Carson and Hanemann 2005) (e.g. pollution), but also in health insurance (Krueger
and Kuziemko 2013). Evidence shows that reported intentions and hypothetical choices predict
actual choices in a variety of contexts (Ajzen 1991, Camerer and Hogarth 1999), including in
Medicare Part D insurance purchase (Kesternich, Heiss, McFadden, and Winter 2012). Indeed, in
our data, higher prices are associated with lower reported probability of purchase and those who
currently have insurance report significantly higher likelihood of purchase. Moreover, while the
most common concern with hypothetical choices is inflated willingness-to-pay, our hypothesis is
6
 In the first and second wave pilot, some participants were also assigned to a subsidy, or status quo
condition. These conditions were discontinued as a result of a power calculation and because the status
quo eventually became a mandate.

                                                  Page 8
about differences between government policy articulations, rather than about absolute
willingness-to-pay levels.


4. Data and Waves
        We conducted our experiment in four waves from December 2011 to November 2012,
which spanned the controversy about the constitutionality of the individual mandate in the
PPACA. See Figure 1 for the timeline of events and when our survey waves were conducted.


                      Figure 1: Timeline of Survey Waves and Major Events




        We analyze results from 1670 participants recruited for our study from an online labor
market. Each participant completed our study in one of the four waves. Participation was limited
to U.S. residents, and while not a representative sample of the U.S. population, this labor market
(Amazon’s Mechanical Turk) is regularly used for research studies (Horton, Rand, and
Zeckhauser 2011; Paolacci, Chandler, and Ipeirotis 2010). We excluded participants aged 65 and
over a priori because they are covered by Medicare. Our participants vary significantly on
educational background, age, employment status, and are geographically diverse, as reflected in
Table 1.
        The individual mandate in PPACA was the target of much discussion and controversy in
in 2012. In March 2012, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding the constitutionality
of elements of PPACA, including the individual mandate. 7 There was an increase in political
discussion of the mandate in March, leading up to and following the hearings; that discussion
became less intense in the April and May, but was followed by increased attention in June 2012

7
  The minimum coverage provision was argued March 27th in Department of Health and Human Services,
et al., Petitioners v. Florida, et al. However other aspects of the case were argued before and after this,
and news media covered the issue in advance of the arguments, with some discussion in late February and
the first two weeks of March.

                                                   Page 9
surrounding the release of the Court’s ruling on PPACA. We will use this controversy to look for
a changing effect of the policy articulation on insurance purchase behavior.
        Figure 2 provides a proxy for the intensity of political discussion regarding the mandate.
It reports the number of articles published in U.S. newspapers by month that mention the terms:
“health insurance mandate”, “mandate AND ACA”, and “(individual mandate OR insurance
mandate) AND unconstitutional”. 8 The three individual measures are all highly correlated
(pairwise correlations range from 0.63 to 0.81) and show the same pattern, so we simply display
their sum. 9 The two peaks are occasioned by the oral argument (March 2012) and ruling (June
2012). 10

  Displaying the sum of the three measures double or triple counts articles that include more than one of
our search terms. We think this is reasonable given that the individual mandate is more likely to be central
to an article that involves multiple search terms. Regardless, the individual measures show a similar
pattern.
10
   Moreover, there is evidence that individuals were paying attention to the controversy. The Kaiser health
tracking poll asked individuals how much they had seen in the news about the health reform law twice: in
Nov. 2011 and April 2012. Over that time, the fraction of people saying “a lot” rose from 18 to 36% and
the fraction saying “a lot” or “some” rose from 41% to 60% (Kaiser Family Foundation 2012).

5. Results
       Our primary analysis uses the reported probability of purchase from the participants’
response scale. We set the probability of purchase to the midpoint of the probability range for the
selected option. We present means by condition and linear regression estimates that control for
individual characteristics. With these methods, differences in choices between conditions can
easily be interpreted as differences in reported probability of purchase. We also replicate our
results using an ordered probit specification, which treats the probability of purchase as an
ordinal variable and simply assumes that higher choices reflect higher likelihood of purchase.
This specification is more robust in a statistical sense, but it does not have a natural interpretation
in terms of purchase probability.
       When we regress reported probability of purchase on insurance price, we use two
observations per participant, since each participant was asked about their likelihood of buying
insurance at a high price ($3000) and a low price ($2000). In those specifications, standard errors
are clustered at the participant level to account for interdependence between the participant’s two
choices. We obtain similar results if we limit our analysis to an individual’s first choice.


Mandate versus Tax Pre-Controversy


Result 1: Before the controversy (i.e. in Waves 1 and 2), the mandate articulation generates
more insurance purchase than a financially equivalent tax. The increase is comparable to a
$1000 reduction in annual premiums.


       Table 2 analyzes the effect of the mandate articulation, as compared to the tax
articulation, in the first two waves. Columns 1 and 2 use a linear probability model, with
probability of purchase set at the midpoint of the probability range that the participant selected.
In each column, two choices per participant are used: probability of purchase at both the $3000
and $2000 premiums. This allows us to also estimate a price response and thereby put a dollar
magnitude on the articulation effect.
       The mandate articulation increases insurance purchase by 10 to 11 percentage points
relative to the tax, a difference that is significant at p<0.05. The average probability of purchase


                                                Page 11
in the tax condition is 49.1%, so our estimated effect is equivalent to a 20% increase in
probability of purchase. Comparing columns 1 and 2, we see that adding demographic controls
improves precision but does not change the point estimate of the treatment effect. We pool
Waves 1 and 2 together, since they predated the measured controversy over the mandate. When
we estimate the model in column 2 separately for each of these waves, we get similar results: an
11.9 percentage point increase in purchase associated with the mandate articulation in wave 1
(p<0.10), and a 13.8 percentage point increase in wave 2 (p<0.05).
       Because each person sees two different premiums, $3000 and $2000, we can estimate the
effect of price on choice, as well as benchmark the articulation effect in dollar terms. Higher
insurance premiums lead to significantly lower insurance purchase: a $1000 increase in annual
premiums reduces insurance purchase by 8.6 percentage points. Dividing the coefficient on the
mandate by the coefficient on price gives a dollar estimate of the mandate’s articulation effect
relative to the tax. Articulating the policy as a mandate rather than a tax has an estimated effect
equivalent to an $1175 (column 1) or to a $1260 (column 2) decrease in price.
       The ordered probit specifications in Table 2 treat the probability of purchase as an ordinal
variable. The positive and statistically coefficient on mandate in columns 3 and 4 indicates that
the mandate articulation induces more insurance purchase. In the ordered probit model, the
coefficients represent changes in the probit index, with response cutpoints also estimated via
maximum likelihood. A positive sign on mandate indicates that the model predicts that
probability of purchase increases under the mandate. Comparing the coefficient on mandate to
that on premiums confirms again that the effect of the mandate articulation is comparable $1000
change in premiums.


Mandate versus Tax Post-Controversy


Result 2: After the political controversy over the mandate, there is no longer a differential
effect between the mandate and the tax articulations.


       In response to the controversy that developed in March and April 2012, we decided to run
additional waves of the experiment to identify how the relative effectiveness of the mandate and
tax articulations were changing over this time period. We ran wave 3 on two subsequent days,


                                               Page 12
launching the evening of June 27 (the day before the Supreme Court ruling) and then the evening
of June 28th (the day of the ruling). 11 Wave 4 began on October 31st, 2012 , ran through election
day (Nov. 6th), and continued until Nov 8th.
        Table 3 presents the results of regressions based on these waves. Each regression includes
all four waves of the experiment. The coefficient on Mandate gives the relative effect of the
mandate in the pre-controversy waves 1 and 2. The coefficient on “Mandate * [Wave 3 (June)]”
gives the change in the mandate’s relative effectiveness in Wave 3, compared to the pre-
controversy waves; the coefficient in the row below gives the analogous comparison between
wave 4 and the pre-controversy waves.
        The positive pre-controversy articulation effect of the mandate is seen again in Table 3.
The coefficient 10.18 on mandate in column 1 exactly replicates the unconditional pre-
controversy effect of the mandate treatment estimated in Table 2, column 1. (The coefficient on
mandate in column 2 differs slightly from that estimated in Table 2, column 2, since the
coefficients on the demographic controls are slightly different when estimated combined with the
post-controversy waves.)
        Post-controversy, the articulation effect of the mandate disappears. The mandate has a
significantly different effect pre- and post- controversy, as seen by the terms that interact the
mandate articulation with waves 3 and 4. Post-controversy, the point estimate on net effect of the
mandate, compared to the tax, is virtually zero in wave 3 (10.18 - 12.06 = -1.88; similarly for
column 2) and in wave 4 (10.18 -11.28 = -1.10; similarly for column 2). In both post-controversy
waves, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the articulation effect of the mandate is zero (F-
test; p=0.98 and p=0.33 respectively). Moreover, the estimated effect of the mandate is similar
across the two post-controversy waves, and the coefficients on the wave 3 and 4 mandate
interaction terms are not significantly different from each other (p=0.48). Finally, the ordered
probit results again confirm the findings of the linear probability model.




11
  We increased the sample size and ran on subsequent days to see if we could identify a discrete change
in the articulation effect of the mandate. The secular trend in the articulation effect turned out to be much
more important than the event of any given day.

Channels Through Which Articulation Might Have an Effect


Result 3: The articulation effect of the mandate is not substantially affected when we
control for three measures of social incentives to be insured: estimates of others’ purchase,
stated deservingness of the uninsured, and judgments of the social appropriateness of
remaining uninsured.


       The mandate articulation might affect behavior through moral suasion (a perceived
individual obligation to comply with the law), but might also affect behavior through social
channels. For instance, the social pressure to have insurance that an individual feels from other
people might differ under the mandate versus tax articulation, and the level of support an
uninsured individual receives might change across these articulations.
   To examine these channels, each participant was asked to answer three additional questions,
under the same mandate or tax articulation, after giving their purchase intentions:

   1. Suppose an individual in your neighborhood was uninsured, but was given the
      opportunity to get themselves coverage by purchasing the same health insurance policy
      just described at the cost of $3000 per year. How likely do you think they would be to
      purchase this policy versus staying uninsured? (Same response scale as own purchase
      question.)

   2. Suppose someone in your community of average income was offered health insurance but
      chose not to buy it, despite the government's recommendation. After showing symptoms
      of weight-loss, nausea, abdominal pain, they were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and
      needed expensive treatment to stay alive. Because they were uninsured, they might not be
      able to pay for this care. How much support should this person get from charity care
      and/or government safety net programs, such as Medicaid? (6 categories of response,
      from “A very generous amount of support: 81-100% of medical bills,” to “No Support:
      0% of medical bills.”)

   3. Suppose someone in your community chose not to buy health insurance, despite the
      government's recommendation. How would you evaluate their decision not to buy health
      insurance? (Response options: “Very socially inappropriate,” “Somewhat socially
      inappropriate,” “Somewhat socially appropriate,” “Very socially appropriate.”)

Because these channels might be affected by the articulation of the policy, Table 4 includes them
as control variables in a model of insurance purchase estimating an effect of the mandate
articulation. The pre-controversy effect of the mandate drops slightly, from about 10 or 11


                                               Page 14
percentage points before controlling for these channels (Table 3) to about 8 percentage points
with these controls (Table 4). To the extent that these questions capture the social incentives to
get insured, the results indicate that the mandate has an additional effect beyond the social effect,
which we interpret as moral suasion. This moral suasion effect disappears in the post-controversy
waves.
         The channel controls are included linearly in column 1 of Table 4, allowing us to see how
responses to these questions are related to insurance purchase probability. The responses are
sensible: own purchase is positively correlated with estimates of neighbor’s purchase, and
negatively correlated with judgments of how socially appropriate it would be to remain
uninsured. (We do not find an association between “Deserving of Support if Uninsured” and
probability of purchase.) Column 2 includes controls for each category of response to the three
social questions, as the linearity assumption may be inappropriate. The estimated effect of the
mandate is unchanged. 12


6. Discussion
         The experimental results presented here demonstrate that the way a government policy is
articulated can alter the extent to which it affects behavior. Before the sustained controversy over
the PPACA mandate, individuals are particularly inclined to obey a mandate to purchase health
insurance, as compared to a tax with the same financial consequences. Our data suggest that this
effect of the mandate is driven by moral suasion rather than perceptions of the social
appropriateness of remaining uninsured. In addition, after the controversy about the individual
mandate, we observe that the differential effect of the mandate disappears; the mandate and the
tax then encourage insurance purchase at the same rate. This result demonstrates that the
articulation of government policy can be influenced by political discourse.
         Why might the articulation effect have dissipated in response to the political discourse
between wave 2 in March and the later waves? We have two, potentially complementary,
hypotheses. First, the political discussion may have changed individuals’ beliefs about the
mandate’s legitimacy and moral claim. A related version of this first hypothesis is that the

12
  Table A1 in the appendix directly examines the effect of the mandate on these social measures, and
how mandate’s effect on these measures varies by wave. The results show that the mandate articulation
has a small and insignificant impact on these questions. Moreover, the effect of the mandate articulation
does not vary much by wave.

                                                  Page 15
controversy gave individuals “moral wiggle room” (i.e. an excuse) to avoid complying with the
mandate, even if they did not themselves dispute its legitimacy. 13 Second, the increased attention
to the issue may have made the mandate and the tax equivalent in the minds of individuals — in
fact, advocates for the mandate’s constitutionality frequently pointed out this financial
equivalence.
        Our results give guidance to policymakers attempting to advance policy prescriptions and
who may articulate their policy in different ways. The results suggest that the articulation of
policy can substitute for financial incentives. Before the controversy, a larger tax would have
been needed to achieve the same effect on behavior as a mandate with an accompanying fine.
Individuals respond to these articulations in significant ways. Consequently, the effectiveness of
a particular government policy depends not only on its financial incentives but on how it is
articulated.




13
  See Dana, Weber and Kuang (2007) for an experimental demonstration that giving individuals moral
wiggle room reduces pro-social behavior.

Experimental Materials

Vignettes: Participants were shown the text below and then one of the treatments, named in
{Brackets}, which were randomly assigned to each subject.

Please read the following carefully: The law around health insurance is currently in flux, and
changes from year to year. Many people are concerned about the health consequences of being
uninsured and the effects this has on health care costs of other people.

Imagine that the following were true:

{Mandate}
     The government considered a number of options to reduce the uninsurance rate.
     Ultimately, the government decided to mandate everyone purchase insurance, or else pay
     a fine of $700 each year. Thus, if you purchased insurance that cost $3000 per year, you
     would simply pay its cost: $3000. If you did not purchase insurance, you would pay a
     fine of $700 each year.

       {Shown on following pages:} Recall: The government decided to mandate everyone
       purchase insurance, or else pay a fine of $700 each year.

{Uninsurance Tax}
      The government considered a number of options to reduce the uninsurance rate.
      Ultimately, the government decided to recommend that everyone purchase health
      insurance, and charge people without insurance an uninsurance tax of $700 each year.
      Thus, if you purchased insurance costing $3000 per year, you would simply pay its cost:
      $3000. If you did not purchase insurance, you would pay the uninsurance tax of $700
      each year.

       {Shown on following pages:} Recall: the government decided to recommend that
       everyone purchase health insurance, and charge people without insurance an uninsurance
       tax of $700 each year.

Questions: All participants then answered these questions below:

1. Imagine the following scenario: Suppose your current health insurance policy were no longer
available, and you became uninsured. The only health insurance policy you could get offered you
coverage that is as good as the coverage that members of Congress get. If it cost $3000 per year
($250 per month) to cover yourself, would you purchase this policy, or stay uninsured?

What if, instead, that insurance policy cost only $2000 per year ($166 per month) to cover
yourself. Would you purchase this policy, or stay uninsured?

Suppose an individual in your neighborhood was uninsured, but was given the opportunity to get
themselves coverage by purchasing the same health insurance policy just described at the cost of
$3000 per year. How likely do you think they would be to purchase this policy versus staying
uninsured?
       Their annual costs:      {Varied} Buy Insurance         {Varied} Stay Uninsured

Suppose someone in your community of average income was offered health insurance but chose
not to buy it, despite the government's recommendation. After showing symptoms of weight-
loss, nausea, abdominal pain, they were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and needed expensive
treatment to stay alive. Because they were uninsured, they might not be able to pay for this
care. How much support should this person get from charity care and/or government safety net
programs, such as Medicaid?
         A very generous amount of support (81% to 100% of medical bills)
         A generous amount of support (61% to 80% of medical bills)
         A moderate amount of support (41% to 60% of medical bills)
         A relatively small amount of support (21% to 40% of medical bills)
         A very small amount of support (1% to 20% of medical bills)
         No support (0% of medical bills)
