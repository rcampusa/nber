A vast literature suggests that economic inequality has important consequences for politics and
public policy. Higher inequality is thought to increase demand for income redistribution in
democracies and to discourage democratization and promote class conflict and revolution in
dictatorships. Most such arguments crucially assume that ordinary people know how high
inequality is, how it has been changing, and where they fit in the income distribution. Using a
variety of large, cross-national surveys, we show that, in recent years, ordinary people have had
little idea about such things. What they think they know is often wrong. Widespread ignorance
and misperceptions emerge robustly, regardless of data source, operationalization, and
measurement method. Moreover, perceived inequality—not the actual level—correlates strongly
with demand for redistribution and reported conflict between rich and poor. We suggest that most
theories about political effects of inequality need to be reframed as theories about effects of
perceived inequality.

1 Introduction

Economic inequality is believed to have important consequences for politics and public policy. In democracies,

where the poor majority can vote to tax the rich, higher inequality is thought to produce more generous social

spending. Ceteris paribus, unequal democracies should redistribute more than equal ones. In dictatorships, the

greater the income gap, the more the poor can gain by overthrowing and expropriating their rulers. Unequal

autocracies should be more prone to revolution. Similarly, the more skewed are the distributions of property and

income, the more elites should fear to extend the franchise. High inequality should discourage democratization.

    These arguments—familiar from works of Aristotle, Marx, and many more recent scholars—seem plausible.

But what if most citizens do not know whether they are relatively rich or poor? Everyone knows his own income,

but not necessarily the distribution into which it fits. What if most citizens have no idea how much wealth elites

have accumulated and whether the gap is growing or shrinking? Even the rich may fail to gauge how strong the

motive is for the poor to revolt. In such cases, the neat link between actual inequality and political outcomes

evaporates.

    We provide evidence that such uncertainty and misperception are extremely widespread. Results from nine

large, cross-national surveys suggest that in recent years ordinary people have known little about the extent of

income inequality in their societies, its rate and direction of change, and where they fit into the distribution.

What they think they know is often wrong.1 This finding is robust to data sources, definitions, and measurement

instruments. For instance, perceptions of inequality are no more accurate if reinterpreted as being about wealth

rather than income.

    A strange inconsistency underlies much recent scholarship. On one hand, theories assume that individuals

know the income distribution. On the other, scholars complain that data available to test these theories—even

in developed democracies—are “dubious” (Ahlquist and Wibbels 2012) and “massively unreliable” (Cramer

2005). If experts despair at the quality of data, it seems odd to assume the public is perfectly informed. And if

analysts fault the figures available today—despite the most sophisticated statistical agencies in history—quality

must have been worse during the nineteenth century heyday of revolution and democratization.

    The implications for theories of redistribution, revolution, and democratization are potentially far-reaching.

To be convincing, these must be reformulated as theories about not actual inequality but perceptions of it, with

no presumption the two coincide. Although actual inequality—as captured by the best current estimates—is

not related to preferences for redistribution, we show that perceived inequality is. Actual poverty correlates
    1
      And since beliefs will correlate among those who interact or use the same media, the “wisdom of crowds” will not ensure average
estimates are unbiased. Nor is it clear how any available “information shortcuts” could close this gap (see Conclusion).




                                                                                                                                   1
only weakly with reported tension between rich and poor, but the perceived poverty rate strongly predicts such

inter-class conflict.

    A number of previous papers have noted inconsistencies in perceptions of inequality, using surveys and

experiments, mostly within a single country (Norton and Ariely 2011; Chambers, Swan and Heesacker 2014;

Cruces, Perez-Truglia and Tetaz 2013; Kuhn 2011, 2016; Niehues 2014). We build on these works. Our

contribution is to provide the most general and comprehensive investigation of the topic to date, using nine cross-

national surveys, comparing multiple countries, exploring numerous aspects of income and wealth inequality,

and developing the implications for influential arguments about the politics of redistribution, revolution, and

democratization.

    To preview the results, we find that, when asked about the level of and recent trend in inequality in their

country, respondents performed only slightly better than chance. Many could not even approximately identify

the average wage nationwide, average salaries in different jobs, the top one percent’s share of wealth, or the

current poverty rate. Respondents who were almost certainly near the top of the distribution thought they were

near the bottom, and vice versa. Both within and across countries, perceptions of inequality closely tracked

demand for government redistribution and reported class conflict, while the relationship with actual inequality

was tenuous at best.

    We believe the accumulation of evidence from the multiple surveys we consider is more compelling than

any individual piece. Although one can—by assuming respondents misunderstood a question or interpreted

it idiosyncratically—construct scenarios in which the respondents were better informed on a particular point

than might appear, it would require a huge number of ad hoc rationalizations to eliminate all the anomalies we

document. And an assumption that rationalizes answers in one setting would often make those in other settings

more puzzling.

    The next section reviews major theories relating inequality to politics. Section 3 uses cross-national surveys

to demonstrate widespread misperceptions of the income distribution, the respondent’s place in it, and recent

trends in inequality. Section 4 shows that preferences for redistribution and perceptions of political and social

tension correlate more strongly with beliefs about inequality than with actual levels. Section 5 concludes.



2 Inequality and politics

Various theories associate countries’ levels of economic inequality with important political outcomes. Such

outcomes include the extent of income redistribution (in democracies); the incidence of revolution and other



                                                                                                                 2
political violence (in non-democracies); and changes in regime type.

    One argument contends that democracies with greater market-generated inequality redistribute more. In

a stylized model, Meltzer and Richard (1981) showed that the larger is the gap between median and mean

incomes, the greater the fiscal transfer from rich to poor produced by majority-rule voting. Subsequent papers

built this mechanism into models aiming to explain the pace of economic growth, the fiscal consequences of

decentralization, and the extent of government debt (Persson and Tabellini 1994a,b; Cukierman and Meltzer

1989).

    A second literature blames inequality for revolutions, coups, civil wars, and other political violence. The

greater the incomes and land-holdings of the rich, the more the poor can gain by expropriating them (Hunt-

ington 1968, p.375). “A large group of impoverished citizens, facing a small and very rich group of well-off

individuals, is likely to become dissatisfied with the existing socioeconomic status quo and demand radical

changes,” write Alesina and Perotti (1994, p.362). “As a result, mass violence and illegal seizures of power are

more likely the more unequal the distribution of income is.” One review called it “almost a universal assumption

that an inequitable distribution of resources and wealth will provoke violent rebellion” (Cramer 2005; see also

Goldstone 2014, p.11, and Gurr 1970).

    A third related approach links inequality to the evolution of political regimes. Since elites in unequal autoc-

racies anticipate high redistribution under democracy, they fight to prevent it. Boix (2003), therefore, predicts

a negative relationship between inequality and democratization, unless elites are protected from expropriation,

for instance by mobility of their assets. Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) agree but add that the poor have weak

incentives to seek democracy if inequality is low (taxing the rich yields little). Thus, odds of democratization

should trace an inverted U: it is unlikely at either high or low inequality, but more probable at intermediate

levels. Both theories crucially assume that poor citizens know the extent of inequality.

    Despite their appeal, all three sets of theories have proved hard to substantiate empirically. Reviewing recent

literature, Lupu and Pontusson (2011, p.316) report a “current consensus. . . that inequality does not matter for

the politics of redistribution, at least not in any direct and particularly significant way.” Ansell and Samuels

(2011, pp.2-3) concur that: “results have consistently called into question. . . that pressures for redistribution

increase with inequality.”2 Does economic inequality prompt political violence? “For almost half a century,”

writes Ostby (2013, p.206), “scholars have tried to test this assumption, finding little empirical support for

a statistical relationship between the two variables.” What about regime type? The search for a connection

has yielded only “mixed results” say both Houle (2009, p.598) and Haggard and Kaufmann (2012, p.495). A

redistribution across American states.



                                                                                                                                3
sophisticated statistical inquiry found “no evidence that domestic inequality is related to regime outcomes once

spatial correlation is accounted for” (Ahlquist and Wibbels 2012, p.461).

    Scholars have suggested several reasons why the simple relationship might not hold—from conditional

effects to non-linear functional forms. Inequality might not prompt redistribution because attitudes towards it

are mediated by: beliefs about the fairness of the distribution (Alesina and Angeletos, 2005a, 2005b; Alesina,

Cozzi, and Mantovan 2012), beliefs about social mobility (Piketty 1995, Benabou and Ok 2001, Alesina and

Ferrara 2005; Ravallion and Lokshin 2000), or other societal norms (Alesina and Giuliano 2009). Religious

organizations might build multi-class coalitions, alleviating conflict (Huber and Stanig 2011). Inequality might

not produce civil unrest if the poor cannot mobilize or if assets are in forms hard to expropriate (Boix 2003).

    While these factors may indeed matter, we suggest a simpler explanation. All theories discussed so far

assume key actors accurately perceive the degree of income inequality. Yet, given how hard it is to estimate dis-

tributions of income and property—for skilled professionals, let alone statistically unsophisticated citizens—this

assumption is implausible. People may not respond to inequality as posited because, quite simply, they do not

know its level.

    A few papers have explored misperception of the income distribution, but usually in a single country. Norton

and Ariely (2011) found respondents underestimated wealth inequality in the US. Americans also assessed

change poorly: respondents “overestimated the rise of income inequality over time” since 1960, and beliefs

about this varied systematically between political liberals and conservatives (Chambers, Swan, and Heesacker

2013; see also Bartels 2008). Using a survey experiment in Argentina, Cruces, Perez-Truglia, and Tetaz (2013)

found “biases in individuals’ perceptions of aggregate income distributions” as well as in assessments of their

own relative position. Where respondents thought they stood in the national distribution turned out to correlate

strongly with their place in the local income distribution, or in some other reference group. Obviously using

small, non-representative samples produces bias. Among respondents in Spain, only 14 percent could correctly

identify their decile in the national income distribution (Fernandez-Albertos and Kuo 2013, p.16).

    In an important paper, Niehues (2014) used the International Social Survey Project (ISSP 2009) to estimate

average perceptions of inequality in 23 European countries plus the USA. She demonstrated systematic errors

and noted a correlation between perceived inequality and the belief that it was too high, as well as with prefer-

ences for redistribution.3 Engelhardt and Wagener (2014) also noted a correlation between perceived inequality
    3
      We accept as a starting point the idea, suggested first by Niehues, of estimating subjective Gini coefficients. However, where she exam-
ined a truncated sample from one survey, we document systematic misperceptions using nine cross-national surveys and multiple questions,
together covering a total of 110 countries of all types. We examine: (a) perceptions of the level of inequality, (b) individuals’ beliefs about
their place in the distribution—including their belief about the average income, the key variable for theories such as Meltzer Richard (1981),
and (c) perceptions of recent changes in inequality. Besides the relationship between perceptions and demand for redistribution, we analyze
how inequality perceptions relate to perceived conflict between rich and poor, examining these relationships at the individual as well as



                                                                                                                                             4
and redistribution preferences. They distinguished between a measure of perceived social mobility and actual

mobility and found that perceived mobility reconciled people better to inequality than actual mobility.



3 Misperceiving the income distribution

3.1 Do people understand the level of inequality?

The ISSP survey, conducted in 2009 in 40 countries, focused on social inequality. One question (14a) showed

respondents five diagrams, accompanied by verbal descriptions, of different “types of society.” Respondents

were asked which diagram and description best fit their country. While the question does not explicitly refer

to income or wealth, the previous questions asked about “pay” and “earnings,” so an interpretation in terms of

income is the most natural one.

    Responses varied greatly across the 40 countries (see Table A1 in the online appendix).4 While in Latvia 68

percent chose the steep pyramid (Type A), in Denmark fewer than 2 percent picked this option; 56 percent of

Danes saw their country as a diamond, with most people in the middle (Type D).

    How often were respondents right? A simple point emerges directly from the distribution of answers.

Barring exact ties—in which case the correct answer would surely be “don’t know”—only one of the five

diagrams can “best describe” each country. It follows that in 29 of the 40 countries a majority of respondents

who ventured a guess guessed wrong. For a majority to guess right, they must all pick the same diagram—but

in 29 countries, the leading choice attracted fewer than 50 percent of those who guessed. (Another 5 percent on

average chose “don’t know” and 1 percent refused to answer.) So, in almost three quarters of countries, most

respondents who thought they could identify the general pattern of inequality got it wrong.5 This conclusion

does not require any assumptions about the actual distributions.

    To explore further, we estimate Gini coefficients corresponding to each diagram. We assume each of the

seven bars represents an income class and—initially—that the income gap between each two adjacent categories

is the same (we code average income in the bottom bar as 1 and that in the top bar as 7).6

cross-national level. We derive implications for theories of politics and public policy, which remain unexplored in previous papers.

    5
       Even if we combine diagrams D and E since they are quite similar, this only raises the maximum number of countries where the
majority could have been right from 11 to 12.
    6
      This might, at first, seem an arbitrary assumption, but in fact the diagrams are meaningless if one does not assume this or something
similar. If, instead, income gaps between the seven bands were allowed to vary, then each diagram could be made to fit almost any
distribution simply by adjusting the cutoffs. We also tried a variety of other assumptions about the values (see below).

observations (i.e. the total area of the figure), and yi is the income of the i’th observation. Since the number

of groups is small (seven), we correct for the bias associated with calculating the Gini from grouped data, as

recommended by Van Ourti and Clarke (2011).7 The resulting Gini coefficients for the five diagrams are: (A)

.42, (B) .35, (C) .30, (D) .20, (E) .21.

      Next, we calculated what proportion of respondents chose the diagram with the Gini coefficient closest to

their country’s actual Gini (we call this the “correct” diagram). For actual Ginis, we refer to those for equivalized

household disposable income from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID, version 5.0;

see Solt 2009, 2014). This standardizes observations from a variety of sources, including the United Nations

University’s World Income Inequality Database, the OECD Income Distribution Database, Eurostat, and the

World Bank, and employs multiple imputation to fill in certain missing data points.8 We use data for 2009,

the ISSP survey year, and, since the questionnaire did not specify whether diagrams referred to pre- or post-

tax-and-transfer incomes, we consider the Gini coefficients for both. Since the Ginis for diagrams D and E are

almost identical, we combine them to avoid penalizing respondents who pick one rather than the other.9
  7
      The correction is to multiply the Gini by k2 (n2 − 1)/n2 (k2 − 1), where k is the number of groups, seven in this case.
  8
      The database provides 100 imputations for each data point; we use the average.
  9
      Even fewer guess corectly if types D and E remain separate.


                                                                                                                                6
    Respondents turn out to pick the wrong diagram most of the time. Worldwide, 29 percent chose “correctly”

if we use their country’s post-tax-and-transfer Gini and 24 percent were right if we use the pre-tax-and-transfer

measure. For reference, a purely random choice among the five answers would be correct 23 percent of the time

for post-tax-and-transfer incomes and 20 percent of the time for pre-tax-and-transfer incomes.10 In other words,

respondents picked correctly only slightly more often than they would have by chance. The percentage correct

varied across countries (Table 1). Assuming post-tax-and-transfer incomes, the proportion correct ranged from

5 percent in Ukraine—where almost all overestimated inequality—to 61 percent in Norway. In only five of

the 40 countries did a majority guess correctly. In five countries—Estonia, Slovakia, Croatia, Hungary, and

Ukraine—90 percent or more picked the wrong distribution.11 (Using pre-redistribution incomes, a majority

guessed right in only three countries.)

    In some countries, errors were not just widespread but extreme. Ukraine had one of the most equal income

distributions in 2009: it came first (out of 114 countries with data) for pre-redistribution equality and 14th for

post-redistribution equality. Its Gini, for either, was around .28, less than that for Diagram C. Yet fewer than

5 percent of Ukrainians chose C, while 63 percent picked the steep pyramid of Diagram A. Many respondents

in some countries simply said they did not know—11 percent in Austria, 13 percent in Russia, 16 percent in

Portugal, and 24 percent in the US—while up to 7 percent refused to answer.

    Were most people at least close? Often the correct Gini lay between those of two adjacent diagrams. We

calculated how often respondents chose a diagram that was the nearest on one or the other side of the correct

Gini. The probability of doing this purely by chance is 25 percent for pre-tax-and-transfers Ginis and 44

percent for post-tax-and-transfer Ginis.12 In fact, in the average country, 28 percent were “correct” under this

rule for pre-tax-and-transfer income and 48 percent for post-tax-and-transfer income. Were most respondents

at least within one diagram of the correct one (for instance, if B was correct, did most at least pick A, B, or

C)? With only five options, getting within one place of the right one is not very difficult. Choosing randomly,

respondents should achieve this 63 percent of the time for post-tax-and-transfer income and 43 percent of the

time for pre-tax-and- transfer income.13 In fact, for post-tax-and-transfer income, 69 percent were within one
   10
      The rate is not simply 20 percent in the first case because Ginis for options D and E are combined. Denote the proportions of
respondents for whom (A), (B), (C), and (D or E) are correct as, respectively, a, b, c, and d. The proportion correct under random choice
is: .2a + .2b + .2c + .4d. Using pre-tax-and-transfers Ginis, for this group of countries: a = .863, b = .101 , c = .036, and d = 0; for
post-tax-and-transfers Ginis: a = .213, b = .256 , c = .379, and d = .153. So the expected proportion of answers correct is 20 percent for
pre-tax-and-transfer Ginis and 23 percent for post-tax-and-transfer Ginis.
   11
      This assumes post-redistribution incomes; using pre-redistribution incomes, 90 percent answered incorrectly in 11 countries.
   12
      Denoting the correct Gini g, the proportion correct under random choice (combining options D and E) is: .2*Pr(g > .35) + .2*Pr(.30
< g < .42) + .2*Pr(.21 < g < .35) + .4*(g < .3), where Pr(x) denotes the frequency with which expression x was true for ISSP respondents.
This equals .25 for pre-tax-and-transfer Ginis and .44 for post-tax-and-transfers Ginis.
   13
      Again denoting the frequencies with which (A), (B), (C), and (D or E) are correct as, respectively, a, b, c, and d, the proportion within
one diagram of the correct one under random choice will be: .2(a+b)+.2(a+b+c) + .2*(b+c+d)+.4*(c+d). Again, for pre-tax-and-transfers
income, a = .863, b = .101 , c = .036, and d = 0, while for post-tax-and-transfers Ginis: a = .213, b = .256 , c = .379, and d = .153. So the

Note: Diagrams D and E combined. If these kept separate, expected percent correct is 20 in both columns, and
total percent correct is 24 for both. The two columns correlate at r = -.34: since the pre-tax-and-transfer Gini
is almost always substantially above the post-tax-and-transfer Gini, the diagram that is “right” for pre-tax-and-
transfer income tends to be “wrong” for post-tax-and-transfer income.


                                                                                                               8
diagram of the right one. For pre-tax-and-transfer income, 58 percent were within one diagram, 15 percentage

points better than random. Still, 42 percent were very far from the correct choice. And the errors were highest

in countries where one might expect people to be best informed. If focusing on pre-tax-and-transfer income,

more than 70 percent missed by at least two places in Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, and—perhaps less

surprisingly—Ukraine.

    Might we be exaggerating respondents’ ignorance because we do not know whether they had pre- or post-

tax-and-transfer income in mind? To check, we tried coding respondents correct if they picked either the

diagram that was “right” assuming pre-tax-and-transfer income or the diagram that was “right” assuming post-

tax-and-transfer income. The probability of picking one or other of these purely by chance was .38.14 In fact,

on average 45 percent got the “correct” answer, thus-defined. Even giving respondents generous benefit of the

doubt, they only slightly out-performed chance.

    Assigning values 1 to 7 to the bars is probably the most natural interpretation. But results are almost identical

if we make different assumptions. We tried using one tighter distribution, with the bars representing incomes

of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4, and two more spread-out distributions: (A) bars equalling 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and

13, and (B) bars valued 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, and 22. We even tried assuming that respondents in more genuinely

unequal societies supposed the bars to be more widely spaced—specifically, we used the values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

6, 7) for countries with actual Gini coefficients in the bottom third of the sample; (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13) for

countries in the middle third; and (1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22) for those in the third with the highest actual inequality.

Re-doing the analysis under these four alternative assumptions, and using Ginis for both post-tax and pre-tax

incomes, results proved remarkably consistent. Across all eight permutations, the share choosing the “right”

diagram ranged between 22 and 26 percent.

    Figure A1 (see appendix) plots perceived inequality in the 40 countries against their actual post-tax-and-

transfer inequality. The measure of perceived inequality, GPI, is simply an average of the Gini coefficients

for diagrams (A) to (E), weighted by the proportion of respondents who chose that diagram. The GPI ’s

thus calculated range from just under .25 for Denmark and Norway to .39 for Ukraine. Perceived and actual

inequality turn out to be quite weakly correlated (r = .37).15 By construction, the GPI ’s cannot exceed the Gini
expected proportion correct is .43 for pre-tax-and-transfer Ginis and .63 for post-tax-and-transfer Ginis.
   14
      In 25 countries (containing 58 percent of respondents), the two “right” answers were different options from among A, B, and C; the
probability for a respondent to pick one or other of these at random is .4. For eight countries (containing 27 percent of respondents), the
same option (from among A, B, and C) was right for both pre- and post-tax-and-transfer income; for these, the probability of guessing right
by chance is .2. For the remaining seven countries (15 percent of respondents), the two “right” answers were either A or B and “D or E”;
the probability of being right by chance in these cases is .6. So on average the probability of being right is .58*.4+.27*.2+.15*.6 = .376.
   15
      Although it is reassuring that the correlation is not zero, this suggests distortions in individuals’ perceptions produce significant
distortion in the crossnational pattern. (Whereas correlations in the .2 to .4 range might seem adequate to establish an association between
two different variables, r = .37 suggests an abnormally weak relationship between two supposed measures of the same thing.) As we will
see, these distortions are enough to eliminate correlation between the crossnational pattern of inequality and demand for redistribution.



                                                                                                                                          9
for the most unequal diagram, .42. In four countries—the Philippines, Chile, China, and South Africa—the

actual Ginis were higher than this. Yet even dropping these countries, the correlation is only r = .41.16 Some

countries where respondents perceived the greatest inequality—such as Ukraine—had among the lowest levels.

In others—such as the US—respondents underestimated inequality.

       Another way to explore this is to examine people’s beliefs about salaries in their country. The ISSP

asked respondents how much they thought employees in five occupations—from “unskilled factory worker”

to “chairman of a large national corporation” —typically earned.17 Comparing respondents’ answers to infor-

mation on actual average earnings, we found guesses were often far off the mark (Table A3). Out of 45 cases

with information on actual salaries, the average respondent guessed within plus or minus 10 percent of the cor-

rect answer in only nine. In the Philippines, the typical general practice doctor earned about $5,500 in 2008,

according to a World Bank survey; Filipino respondents guessed $144,000. South Africans surveyed thought

the typical CEO earned $77,000; in fact, the average across 56 major South African companies was $1.7 mil-

lion (for sources, see Table A2). Not only were average guesses often wrong, the dispersion was sometimes

extreme. Almost all respondents missed by more than plus or minus 33 percent when guessing top CEOs’

salaries. Inequality between doctors (or cabinet ministers) and factory workers (or shop assistants) was overes-

timated in most countries. But the gap between corporate executives and low-paid occupations was massively

underestimated everywhere we had data.18

       A third question is whether people know how rich the rich are. This is important if citizens are to judge

how much could be expropriated by redistributive policies or revolution. In 2015, the polling firm Ipsos MORI

asked about 1,000 residents in each of 29 countries what proportion of total household wealth in their country

they thought the wealthiest 1 percent owned (Ipsos MORI 2015). We compared the answers to estimates of the

correct figures calculated by the investment bank Credit Suisse (CS), using household balance sheet and other

data (Credit Suisse 2010, pp.84-7). In the average country, the average repondent’s guess was 17 percentage

points off—usually an overestimate. In the UK, for instance, respondents thought the wealthiest percentile

owned 59 percent of total household wealth, compared to CS’s estimate of 23 percent. In only eight of the 29

countries was the average guess within plus or minus 10 percentage points of the correct answer (Table A4).

       A fourth source of evidence relates to poverty. Ordinary people might know more about the underclass
  16
       The Spearman correlation coefficient (between countries’ ranks in actual and perceived inequality) —.41— is also low.
  17
       Unfortunately, the question’s wording sometimes referenced pre-tax and sometimes post-tax income. We focus on countries for which
it referred to pre-tax income since media accounts, the most likely source, usually report gross pay for different professions.
    18
       Does such misperception matter for policy preferences? One 2015 US poll suggests it does. When respondents were asked to
guess the average public school teacher’s salary in their state, the average was $38,294. In fact, nationwide the average was $57,379
(https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15 _211.50.asp?current=yes). Among those not given more information, 63 percent fa-
vored increasing teachers’ salaries. Among those who were told the correct figure for their state, support for raising salaries was only 45
percent (http://educationnext.org/2015-ednext-poll-school-reform-opt-out-common-core-unions/).



                                                                                                                                       10
than about the top wealth-holders. In fact, ignorance and misconceptions were common here too. A 2010

Eurobarometer survey asked respondents what proportion of people in their country were poor. Of course, re-

spondents might have their own definitions of poverty, but using either the EU-favored or the national definition

(usually very close), almost one third of respondents in the average country guessed more than 10 percentage

points above or below the true level (Table A5). In Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, Malta, and Spain, a majority of

those who answered were more than 10 percentage points off.19 Since the average poverty rate in these countries

was 16 percent, an error of more than 10 percentage points is substantial.

       Even if individuals are often wrong about their society’s level of inequality, average perceptions might still

correlate cross-nationally with the actual levels. In fact, as already noted, the correlation between perceived and

actual inequality is low (r = .37). Still, that might be because of the particular measures we used or because of

the assumptions we had to make to construct Gini coefficients for the perceived distributions. To check, Table 2

shows the correlation coefficients between five alternative measures of actual economic inequality and four mea-

sures of perceived inequality. It is possible respondents were thinking about wealth—not income—inequality

(Bagchi and Svejnar 2013). So we include CS’s estimates of the wealth share of the top 10 percent (for 2009)

and the Gini for wealth (for 2010, the first year available).20 We also include another common indicator of in-

come inequality, the 90/10 ratio (i.e. the ratio between incomes at the 90th and 10th percentiles). For perceived

inequality, we add three other measures derived from the ISSP survey. First, to miminize assumptions, we

simply use the percentage of respondents who selected diagram (A), the most unequal. Second, we constructed

a measure of the average choice among the diagrams where (A), the most unequal, was scored 5 and (E), the

least unequal, was scored 1. Finally, we calculated the ratio of perceived earnings of a CEO in a large national

company to those of an unskilled factory worker, averaging in each country across all respondents who gave

estimates for both. As Table 2 shows, no pair of these measures of objective and perceived inequality correlated

at higher than r = .40; many were not correlated at all.

       In sum, respondents only slightly outperform chance when asked to identify the shape of the income distri-

bution in their country. They are often quite wrong about what various occupations pay and what share of total

wealth belongs to the top one percent. Many European respondents think poverty is either much higher or lower

than it is. And, measured in various ways, actual and perceived levels of inequality correlate at most weakly.

       Aalberg (2003, p.97) found that, in 1991, German, Dutch, British, and US respondents all overestimated poverty.
  20
       Estimated Ginis for wealth ranged from .57 in Spain to .88 in Switzerland (Credit Suisse 2010).

3.2 Do people know their place in the distribution?

According to Meltzer and Richard (1981), the median voter will favor redistribution if his income is below the

mean. But does the median voter know whether his income is below the mean?

    In its 2015 survey, Ipsos MORI asked respondents: “What do you think the average annual wage for a full-

time worker is in [country]?”21 The results were surprising. Comparing the answers in each country to our best

estimate of the actual average wage, we found that in all countries except New Zealand people underestimated

the average wage, often by a lot.22 For instance, the average US respondent thought the average annual wage

was about $26,000; in fact, the OECD estimated it was $57,417. In only one of 27 cases was the average guess

within 30 percentage points of the correct level (Table 3).

    If the median voter in each country had the average belief about the mean wage in his country, his estimate

would almost always be wrong. Would it at least be on the right side of the median wage? That is, would he

still support redistribution when Meltzer-Richard logic suggests he should, and oppose it when that was in his

self-interest? Among the 22 countries for which official estimates of the median wage were available, it turns

out he would have been right in only two.

offered here are ours and not those of Ipsos MORI.
   22
      In the interest of consistency, we used the OECD’s estimates from national accounts where available, and figures from national
statistical offices or the ILO where not.




                                                                                                                                    12
       Errors were so large in some cases that we wondered if respondents might have misunderstood the question.

So we tried to adjust for possible misinterpretations. For instance, in some countries it is common to discuss

monthly rather than annual salaries. Although the pollsters’ question explicitly asks about the annual wage, we

nevertheless tried multiplying the average guess by 12 whenever that produced something closer to the correct

answer. It is also possible some respondents took the question to refer to post-tax rather than pre-tax wages. We

therefore adjusted again, using OECD estimates of the total tax rate on labor income to convert the guess from

post-tax to pre-tax, whenever this rendered it more accurate (Table A7). Reinterpreting respondents’ answers in

these ways reduces the errors, but not by much. Even adjusting in either or both of these ways when that helped,

the average guess about mean income remained about one third too high or too low in the average country. And

still respondents placed the average income on the right side of the median in only seven out of 17 countries.

With these misperceptions, following Meltzer-Richard logic would lead the median voter astray more often than

not.

       A final possibility is that respondents misunderstood the word “worker” in the question to mean either an

industrial worker or, more generally, a manual worker, not just an employee. Using data from Eurostat, the ILO,

and national statistical agencies on the average wages of “machine operators,” the category in common use that

seemed closest to “industrial worker,” we checked whether this could make sense of respondents’ estimates.

Among the 14 countries for which we found data, the average guess was 53 percentage points above or below

the actual average wage of machine operators (Table A8a). And even if we adjust as before—multiplying by

12 and/or adjusting for taxes if that helps—the average guess still misses the actual average wage for machine

operators by 30 percentage points. Results are similar using instead the average wage for “manual workers”

(Table A8b). In sum, people in many countries appear to have extremely unreliable ideas about the average

wage.23 Were they to act politically on the basis of these ideas, they would very often do the opposite of what

influential theories predict.

       More generally, do people know where in the national income distribution they fall? To examine this,

we exploit data from the 2010 Life in Transition Survey (LiTS 2010). LiTS includes 30 emerging (mostly

transition) economies and five advanced European economies. The ideal survey to answer this question would

record: (A) respondents’ own income, and (B) their beliefs about their place in the national distribution. Using

the country’s true distribution, one could then judge how often respondents were right. However, neither LiTS

nor any other crossnational survey we know collects data on both (A) and (B). We therefore present indirect

evidence.
  23
       Although the average wage is not average per capita income, we see no reason perceptions of the latter would be more accurate.

    LiTS asked respondents into which decile in the national income distribution they thought they fell. As-

suming the survey samples were as representative as intended and as subsequent scrutiny confirmed (Cojocaru

and Diagne 2015), one tenth of respondents should fall within each of the 10 deciles. A histogram of responses

should resemble the uniform distribution: a flat line at 10 percent, with no hills or valleys. That is not what one

sees (Figure A2). In most countries, the two central deciles (5th and 6th) together capture not 20 percent but

more than 40 percent of respondents. Many seem to believe they are relatively richer or poorer than they are.24

    Although the LiTS samples have withstood critical examination, it remains possible they do not adequately

represent all income groups. If they oversampled the middle of the distribution, that would explain why re-

spondents disproportionately placed themselves in the middle. To address this, we adopt a different tactic.

From respondents’ answers to other questions, we identify some who are almost certainly among the richest

in their societies and others almost certainly among the poorest, and see where they placed themselves in the

distribution.

    LiTS surveys ownership of various consumer durables, including cars. Of course, in developed countries car

ownership is common, but in six of those sampled—Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova,

and Ukraine—one third of households or fewer owned cars, according to national statistics (Table A10). Given

the expense of automobile ownership, one might expect car-owning households to be among the richest. In

Azerbaijan, the average car cost $13,300 at the time of the survey—almost four times per capita income.25

However, if car-owners in these countries belonged in the top income deciles, they did not realize this. More

than 60 percent of them in all six countries thought they earned less than the median income (Table A10).

    Owning two houses usually indicates wealth. In all 35 LiTS countries, at most one in four respondents

said her family owned a second residence, and in all but three it was less than one in six. However, most

secondary residence owners did not think themselves particularly rich (Table A11). On average, 60 percent

placed themselves in the bottom half of the income distribution. In Uzbekistan, only 3 percent of respondents

lived in households with a second residence, yet almost two thirds of these thought their incomes were below

the national median. Developed countries had fewer such anomalies. Still, in France, Italy, and Great Britain,

40 percent or more of second home owners placed themselves in their country’s bottom half.

    Neither of these indicators is perfect. Even clearer evidence of high income might be owning both a car and

a second home. In the average LiTS country, about 7 percent of respondents fit this description (Table A12).

But, again, most did not consider themselves rich. On average, 57 percent of such property-owners thought they
  24
     We also examined a similar question in the fifth wave of the World Values Survey (WVS). The histograms for this survey also tend to
bunch in the center, and for a few countries towards the bottom of the scale. However, Donnelly and Pop-Eleches (2012) raise questions
about the representativeness of the WVS samples.

belonged in the bottom half of the distribution, and only 3 percent put themselves in the top two deciles. Similar

patterns emerge for other consumer durables.

    In these cases, many respondents who were almost certainly among the wealthiest in their country thought

their incomes below average. Their guesses ranged widely, suggesting considerable doubt. Might they have

been answering insincerely out of embarrassment or even fear? If so, they would surely not have admitted to

owning a second home—an even clearer indication of wealth than their self-placement in a high income decile.

Acknowledging possession of expensive property while claiming to be relatively poor is more consistent with

confusion than with deliberate deception.

    Do the poor understand their relative position? By design, it is the poor who receive targeted income

support from the state. In the five developed LiTS countries, national statistics suggest very few received such

aid—about 6 percent of households in France and Sweden and less than 1 percent in Germany. Yet among those

who said that they had been approved to receive “targeted social assistance/guaranteed minimum income” in

the previous year, only a few thought they belonged right at the bottom of the distribution (Table A13). Most

aid recipients in all five countries located themselves above the bottom fifth.

    Going hungry is another sign of poverty. Strapped for cash, some LiTS respondents reported having recently

“reduced consumption of staple foods such as milk, fruits, vegetables, or bread.” In the developed European

countries, the share saying this ranged from 3 percent in Sweden to 20 percent in Italy. We might expect such

food-deprived respondents to fall in the bottom two deciles. Again, they thought otherwise. In Italy, more than

half of those cutting food purchases placed themselves in the fifth decile or higher, and in France and Sweden

more than one third did so (Table A14, Panel A). Similarly, in the sixth round of the World Values Survey

(2010-14), very few respondents in the richest countries said that they had “gone without enough food to eat”

during the previous year. Yet in most such countries, many who confessed to having gone hungry nevertheless

placed themselves in the top six of ten income groups (Table A14, Panel B). In short, these surveys suggest the

rich often think they are poorer—and the poor think they are richer—than they actually are. Both think they are

closer to the median than is, in fact, the case.


3.3 Do people know how inequality is changing?

Perhaps ordinary people do not know the level of inequality or their place in the distribution but can still sense

when the gap between rich and poor is growing. If so, the dynamics of inequality might still drive political

behavior. To measure such change, we use the Gini coefficient for pre-tax-and-transfers income from SWIID

5.0. Between 2007 and 2012, change in the Gini ranged from a fall of 7.7 percentage points in Bolivia to a rise


                                                                                                               16
of 6.5 points in Spain. Among the 61 countries with SWIID data for both 2007 and 2012, inequality increased

in 32 and decreased in 29.

    Could citizens detect the trend? To check, we exploit a survey taken in spring 2013 by the Pew Global

Attitudes project. Respondents in 39 countries were asked: “Do you think the gap between the rich and the

poor in (survey country) has increased, decreased, or stayed the same in the last five years?” For 22 countries,

we had data on actual changes in the Gini coefficient.

    We categorize countries where the Gini changed by less than plus or minus 1 percentage point as having

“stayed the same.” With this classification, the Gini fell in eight of these 22 countries, increased in six, and

stayed the same in eight. If respondents chose randomly between these three options, they would be right about

one third of the time. In fact, the average percentage correct was just slightly higher—34.6 percent (Table

A15).26 In more than 90 percent of countries, a plurality of respondents—usually a large majority—believed

the gap between rich and poor had grown in the previous five years. The only exceptions were Malaysia, El

Salvador, and Bolivia, where a plurality said it had “stayed the same.”

    Perhaps repondents focused on wealth rather than income inequality. If we use Credit Suisse’s wealth

estimates, a larger share were right. This is simply because wealth inequality rose in more countries than did

income inequality between 2007 and 2012, so the tendency to assume rising inequality was more often correct.27

But whereas the proportion of respondents that thought inequality was rising at least correlated cross-nationally

with actual change in the Gini for income (r = .58), there was no correlation with the actual change in wealth

inequality. In other words, although most respondents worldwide thought inequality had risen, respondents were

not more likely to believe this in countries that actually experienced the biggest increases in wealth inequality.28

    People appear equally ignorant of trends in poverty. In 2010, Eurobarometer asked respondents how poverty

had changed in their country in the previous three years. Again coding change of less than plus or minus 1

percent as “stayed the same,” actual poverty had increased in just eight of the 27 countries. Yet in all 27,

more than 65 percent of respondents thought it had risen. Moreover, the percentage who thought poverty had

increased correlated negatively with the actual change (r = -.23; Figure A3). In Romania, where poverty had

fallen almost four percentage points, 89 percent thought it had risen.

     Using post-tax-and-transfer income Ginis, the percentage correct was lower. For another nine of the 39 countries, change in the Gini
between 2007 and 2011 (but not 2012) was available. Including these countries, the average percentage right increases to 38.7 percent.
Might people be more sensitized to change at the top of the distribution? Using the income share of the top decile instead of the Gini to
measure the “gap between rich and poor,” only 29 percent got the trend right—fewer than would have done so by chance (Table A17).
  27
     We use the change in the share of wealth of the top 10 percent to assess the trend since CS provides Ginis only from 2010.
  28
     In a similar Pew survey for 2002, the proportion correctly identifying the direction of change averaged 36.6 percent, again only slightly
better than chance (Table A16).




                                                                                                                                          17
    In short, in recent years respondents worldwide have assumed that inequality and poverty were rising. If

focusing on the income distribution, they guessed the trend only slightly better than chance. If focusing on

wealth, they were right more often because inequality did increase in more countries. However, the proportion

convinced that inequality was rising bore no relation to the actual change in the wealth gap. Even where the

wealth share of the top 10 percent and top 1 percent fell slightly in 2007-12—e.g., in Canada and the US—two

thirds or more believed it had risen.



4 Perceived inequality, demand for redistribution, and class conflict

If people do not know how high inequality is, we should not expect actual inequality to predict public prefer-

ences and behavior. But perceived inequality could still matter. The evidence we can offer here is only sugges-

tive; we do not take a strong position on causality. Still, results of various surveys suggest it is perceptions—not

the reality—of inequality that shapes political outcomes.29

    First, consider preferences over redistribution. In one question, the ISSP asked whether it was “the respon-

sibility of the government to reduce the differences in income between people with high incomes and those

with low incomes.” Respondents could choose among the options: “strongly agree,” “agree,” “neither agree

nor disagree,” “disagree” “strongly disagree,” and “can’t choose.” Since the first five of these represent ordinal

categories, we constructed a dependent variable measuring support for government redistribution that takes the

values one to five.

    We then explored how support for redistribution related to both actual and perceived inequality. For actual

inequality, we used the country’s Gini for income; for perceived inequality, we used the perceived Gini (GPI,

based on answers to Question 14a, as described earlier).30 We conducted analysis at both the country and in-

dividual level (see Table 4).31 At the country level, we regressed (by OLS) the average level of support for

redistribution on the country’s actual Gini and the perceived Gini (GPI). At the individual level, we regressed

(by ordered probit) the individual’s support for redistribution (on the 5-point scale) on her country’s actual Gini

and on that individual’s perceived Gini. In fact, in the individual case we could distinguish between the effect

of the average perception of inequality in the country (GPI) and the individual’s idiosyncratic perception (the
   29
      Using a different method to estimate perceived wage inequality, Kuhn (2016) finds this is related to belief in the degree of meritocracy
in labor markets.
   30
      This question came after the one about attitudes towards redistribution in the questionnaire, so the perceived inequality question can
not have primed respondents’ attitudes towards redistribution.
   31
      Since some data were missing for some controls, we used multiple imputation in the individual level regressions, using Amelia to
impute 10 datasets which were then combined using STATA’s mi command. Results are very similar deleting listwise instead of imputing
(Table A19). Table A18 adds controls for the country’s growth rate and exposure to trade (exports plus imports as a percent of GDP).
Neither of these is ever significant, and they affect results little.




                                                                                                                                          18
Gini of her chosen diagram, controlling for GPI) (Table 4, columns 9-11). The former may measure com-

mon perceptions based on shared cultural or media stimuli, while the latter captures the individual’s particular

impressions.

    Neither the pre-tax nor the post-tax actual income Ginis are related to support for redistribution at either the

country or individual level. However, perceived inequality is highly significant in both cases. Where inequality

was believed to be high, more people supported government redistribution. Given beliefs about inequality,

higher actual inequality was in fact associated with lower demand for redistribution (columns 4, 5, 10, and

11). Breaking down perceptions into their general and idiosyncratic components, we found a stronger effect of

the general perception than of the individual’s idiosyncratic perceptions (columns 9-11). Still, both seemed to

matter. And the importance of perceived inequality was robust to including a variety of individual level controls.

(Other things equal, women, the old, those without higher education, and those who identified with a left-wing

political party, as classified by ISSP, tended to support redistribution more.)

    What about the idea that greater inequality prompts class conflict and even revolution? One ISSP question

asked respondents how much conflict existed in their country “between poor people and rich people.” The four

possible answers (besides “can’t choose”) ranged from “no conflicts” to “very strong conflicts.” Again, we cre-

ated an ordinal scale and ran probit regressions to analyze relationships at the individual level; we used OLS

to measure country level relationships. At the country level, post-tax-and-transfer inequality was significantly

associated with greater reported inter-class tension, although pre-tax-and-transfer inequality was not (Table 5,

panel A). However, the effect of perceived inequality was two to three times larger than that of actual inequality.

Moreover, controlling for income and population eliminated the effect of actual inequality (column 5). At the

individual level, results are similar: the post-tax-and-transfer Gini and individual perceptions are both signifi-

cant; but perceptions have a much larger effect, and that of actual inequality disappears controlling for income

and population.32 (Women, the young, the unmarried, those without higher education, and backers of left-wing

parties tended to perceive more conflict between rich and poor.)




  32
     This might be, in part, because some effect of actual inequality is mediated through perceptions of it. However, the inaccurate part of
perceptions is also clearly important. If we split the variation in the perceived Gini into two parts—that which is correlated with the actual
post-tax-and-transfer Gini and that which is not—and put both into the Table 5 regressions, both are significant (not shown).

     independent variables; 10 datasets imputed with Amelia. See Table A19 for results without imputation.
   Tables 4 and 5 use measures of perceived inequality and redistributive preferences from the same survey.

As noted, we do not make strong claims about causality. Inequality perceptions might affect demand for re-

distribution. But it also could be that advocates of redistribution “perceive” more inequality than there is, to

rationalize their preferences; or both might result from some third factor. We defer systematic examination to a

future paper.

   Still, we used data from other surveys to assess robustness. In 2009, Eurobarometer asked respondents how

much tension existed in their countries: A) between poor and rich, and B) between managers and workers.

The limited overlap between the Eurobarometer and ISSP surveys reduces our sample to just 17 countries. But

among them, perceived inequality (from ISSP) related strongly and positively to perceived tension between rich

and poor and between managers and workers (from Eurobarometer); actual inequality was either insignificant

or negatively related to reported class conflict (Table A20).

   Finally, how do beliefs about poverty relate to preferences over social policy and perceptions of inter-class

tensions? As Tables A21 and A22 demonstrate, using Eurobarometer data from 2010, both the actual poverty

rate and the belief that it was high correlated with the demand for government anti-poverty measures. However,

only perceived—not actual—poverty was positively associated with reported tension between rich and poor.

   In sum, we found little evidence of a link between actual inequality and citizens’ demands for government

redistribution or perceptions of class conflict. However, the levels of inequality and poverty that citizens imag-

ined to exist correlated strongly and robustly with such demands and perceptions. Although we cannot make

strong causal claims, the patterns are consistent with the notion that beliefs about inequality—rather than the

actual phenomenon—drive political outcomes.



5 Conclusion

Various theories contend that economic inequality influences the characteristics and policies of governments.

Most assume that citizens accurately observe the level of inequality, at least on average. The evidence presented

here casts doubt on this assumption.

   Meltzer and Richard (1981) showed that, under majority rule, redistribution should rise with the gap between

median and average incomes. However, when respondents around the world were asked to guess their country’s

average wage, a large proportion placed it on the wrong side of the median wage. Respondents were confused

about their relative incomes. Many who reported that they could not afford enough to eat nevertheless thought

they belonged in the middle or even upper half of the distribution. Others whose assets suggested relative wealth



                                                                                                               22
thought their incomes were below average. Given such confusion, it seems doubtful the median voter generally

knows whether she would gain or lose from redistribution. And, in fact, demand for redistribution appears to

vary with not actual inequality but the perception of it.33

       Acemoglu and Robinson (2006, p.36) argued that, ceteris paribus, more “inter-group inequality makes revo-

lution more attractive for the citizens” of a dictatorship. If they revolt, the poor “get a chance to share the entire

income of the economy (minus what is destroyed in revolution).” The rich should respond with repression (if

inequality is high) or by democratizing (if inequality is intermediate). Yet, as we saw, citizens often have little

idea about the income and wealth of the rich. They hardly outperform chance when guessing how income is

distributed. And, on average, they missed by 17 percentage points when guessing the share of wealth owned

by the top 1 percent. Revolution, repression, and democratization might relate to predominant beliefs about

inequality, and perceptions of class conflict appear to vary with those beliefs. But if potential revolutionaries

know so little about actual inequality levels, these are unlikely to predict revolution.

       Not all arguments about inequality assume individuals perceive it accurately. The claim that concentration

of wealth enables elites to dominate politics, depressing participation, presupposes no widespread knowledge of

the Gini coefficient (Goodin and Dryzek 1980, Solt 2008). Nor does the point that inequality can lead the poor

to underinvest in human capital if their borrowing is constrained (Galor and Zeira 1993). Ansell and Samuels’

(2010) argument that inequality motivates the rich to seek democracy as a defense against state expropriation

could still work even if rich and poor are uncertain of the distribution.

       A growing literature contends that belief in high social mobility or the fairness of the economic system, as

well as various norms, may reconcile people to large income gaps (Alesina and Giuliano 2009, Bénabou and

Tirole 2006). We find these arguments plausible and intuitive—with one modification. What such beliefs and

norms reconcile people to is not actual inequality but the level they believe to exist.

       In making this argument, we do not assume offical inequality statistics are necessarily accurate. For many

reasons, inequality is difficult to measure. But that does not invalidate our main point: it makes it in another

way. If experts cannot gauge inequality, how can the man in the street? And the accuracy of official measures

does not affect our second point: that perceptions of inequality—whether accurate or not—do correlate with

political preferences. The strength of this link is significant in its own right, even though establishing causal
  33
      The Meltzer Richard (1981, p.941) model assumes “fully informed” voters. Even if voters are misinformed about inequality, one might
be able to construct a version of the game in which parties still converge on the policy the median voter should prefer if correctly informed
(we thank John Huber for this point). However, for this to hold one must assume that parties can only propose policies that genuinely
balance the budget (rather than those voters believe are feasible) and that they compete by offering voters a vector of net transfers. If, by
contrast, parties compete by proposing a tax rate (as in Meltzer Richard, pp.920-21) and voters infer—based on perhaps incorrect beliefs
about the income distribution—what the equal lump sum transfers will be, then, at least in a one-shot model, parties should converge on the
tax rate the median voter believes he prefers. The transfers feasible at that rate may not be what voters expect. However, if a party offers
a different tax rate, the other party can win by offering the rate the median voter thinks he prefers. In this case, higher inequality will not
necessarily produce more redistribution.


                                                                                                                                           23
priority is difficult.

    A few possible objections are worth considering. First, some might argue that all models—including that

of Meltzer and Richard—are simplifications and not meant to be taken too literally. Friedman (1953) famously

contended that the realism of assumptions is irrelevant if a theory yields accurate predictions. However, the

arguments we critique have not yielded accurate predictions, and the implausibility of their assumptions might

explain why. That models are simplifications does not mean that all simplifications are useful.

    Second, it could be that people have accurate intuitions about inequality but that the polls fail to elicit

these. Certainly, the polls we cite are imperfect in various ways, and, therefore, we use different surveys and

instruments to measure perceptions in different country contexts. However, if people know the true level of

inequality—and influential theories get the logic right—these theories should do a better job of explaining

the crossnational and over-time variation in behavior. We should see a strong link between high inequality

and, respectively, revolution, resistance to democratization (in autocracies), and demand for redistribution (in

democracies). By the same logic, we should not expect to see such a strong correlation between inaccurate

“perceptions of inequality” and support for government redistribution. If people respond as if they do not know

something and act as if they do not know it, Occam’s razor would suggest the reason may well be that—they do

not know it.

    A third objection might be that detailed factual knowledge is unnecessary if informational shortcuts can

achieve the same result. Lupia (2015) rightly urges scholars to stop equating competence with the recall of

obscure facts. “Low information rationality” is often enough. Yet, in this case, it is hard to see what shortcuts

or heuristics could enable peasants to infer when the benefits of revolution exceed the costs or voters to deduce

their place within the income distribution. Arguments of this type often assume that some informed agent—a

party leader, revolutionary, or activist—exists to guide the uninformed or make decisions on their behalf. Yet

such actors have incentives to mislead or serve their own interests. Professional revolutionaries have a stake in

revolution, just as the authorities have one in the status quo. Parties have established positions on government

redistribution and rarely change these to match undulations in the Gini.

    It might be that people only become informed about the income gap when economic disruptions make it

salient or when some decision—such as voting—looms. If so, it is hard to imagine a year when inequality

would have been more salient than 2009, as the global financial crisis tipped the world into deep recession. To

check whether people become better informed around the time of elections, we recalculated Table 1 using just

those 13 countries where the ISSP’s polling occurred within six months of a national vote. The proportions of

respondents “correct” about their country’s distribution—26 percent and 24 percent—were if anything lower



                                                                                                              24
than in the full sample (29 and 24 percent).

       Protests, revolutions, and even elections turn on the actions of a subset of citizens. Does it, then, mat-

ter whether the majority gauges inequality correctly? Again, the theories we critique here—based on the

Meltzer-Richard framework—assume that it does. They suppose that all voters know their interests and act

upon them—whether by voting, rebelling, or resisting democracy. Perhaps if most citizens realized they did not

know the right answer and deferred to those who did, the actions of the informed would carry the day. But the

evidence suggests citizens are not just passively ignorant; they hold non-randomly inaccurate beliefs, which will

not wash out in the mix. It may be reasonable to switch to a theory in which what matters is the mobilization of

groups, with different identities and organizational potential (Achen and Bartels 2016). But that requires aban-

doning the approaches we critique. It also eliminates the straightforward connection between political outcomes

and inequality. In a group-based theory, such outcomes would have more to do with the structure of identities,

the preferences of group leaders, and the organizational resources at their disposal.

       We defer to future research the question what causes perceptions of inequality.34 But several hypotheses

seem plausible. First, individuals may over-generalize from their immediate reference group, thus making bi-

ased inferences (Cruces, Perez-Truglia, and Tetaz 2013, Xu and Garand 2010). Since, in everyday life, most

people tend to see some around them who are richer and some who are poorer, it is natural to think they belong

in the middle of the distribution. This would be consistent with the tendency we noted for respondents to dis-

proportionately place themselves around the center. People may also—wrongly—take the range they observe in

day-to-day interactions as a measure of the range nationwide. Inhabitants of villages where incomes and prop-

erty are relatively equal may underestimate their country’s gap between rich and poor. Those in professionsS

with large earnings variation may think inequality is higher than those in jobs with uniform wages.

       A second likely influence is the media, and television in particular.35 Globalization of media might cause

people in poor countries to compare their consumption to that glimpsed in rich states, generating impressions

of relative deprivation (Pop-Eleches 2009). Sensationalistic and celebrity-focused television may foster percep-

tions of extreme wealth. At the same time, media that publicize data about actual incomes might reduce mis-

perceptions. In Norway, after newspapers created websites on which citizens could learn each others’ salaries,

perceptions of relative income became more accurate and attitudes towards redistribution changed accordingly

(Perez-Truglia 2016). Besides media effects, greater travel—domestic and international—could broaden the

reference group.
  34
       For an interesting theory of how information about inequality is spread, see Iversen and Soskice (2015).
  35
       The strong effect of the average perception of inequality in the country in Tables 4 and 5 is consistent with media influences.




                                                                                                                                         25
    A third possible determinant is ideology, which may predispose people to “see” the level of inequality their

beliefs and values convince them must exist (Alesina and Fuchs-Schundeln 2007). Citizens in post-socialist

countries appear particularly sensitive to inequality, perhaps reflecting the ideological legacy of communism

(Corneo and Gruner 2002). Socialists everywhere may exaggerate income gaps, while conservatives may un-

derestimate them. A Marxist may see capital concentrating, while a free marketeer sees wealth trickling down.

Shocks experienced early in life can also leave lasting scars in values and perceptions (Guiliano and Spilimbergo

2014).

    Fourth, other psychological effects could matter. A desire to blend in may cause individuals to think their

income close to average; “self-enhancement bias” might lead them to overestimate their standing (Loughnan

et al 2011). Some may conflate reports of high inequality worldwide with assessments of their own country.

They may confuse changes in the trend with information about the level: hearing inequality is rising, they may

assume it is high, and vice versa. They may suppose that recession—which reduces incomes of the poor—must

increase inequality, when in fact recessions often shrink the capital income of the rich more than wage income.

On the other hand, reports of rapid growth that arouse unrealistic expectations could generate suspicions that

income has been diverted to the wealthy (Verme 2014).

    Whatever the causes, the gap between perceptions and reality—or, at least, statisticians’ best estimates of re-

ality—is clear. And misperceptions were probably even greater in less data-rich and scientifically sophisticated

eras. Besides inequality, we suspect misperceptions affect how people respond to inflation, unemployment, and

other economic phenomena (Gimpelson and Oshchepkov 2012). More generally, respondents misperceive facts

about various social phenomena (Hochschild 2001) and often resist changing their views and policy preferences

even when confronted with accurate information (Kuklinski et al. 2000, Lawrence and Sides 2014, Kuziemko

et al. 2015).
