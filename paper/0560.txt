                      The Importance of Lifetime Jobs
                             in the U.S. Economy



                                  ABSTRACT


     Though the U.S. labor market is justly notorious for high turnover and

consequent high unemployment, it also provides stable, near—lifetime employment

to an important fraction of the labor force. This paper investigates patterns

of job duration by age, race, and sex, with the following major conclusions:

     1. The typical worker today is holding a job which has lasted or will

         last about eight years. Over a quarter of all workers are holding

         jobs which will last twenty years or more. Sixty percent hold jobs

        which will last 'five years or more.


     2. The jobs held by middle—aged workers with more than ten years of

         tenure are extremely stable. Over the span of a decade, only

         twenty to thirty percent come to an end.


     3. Among workers aged thirty and above, about forty percent are currently

        working in jobs which eventually will last twenty years or more. Three—

        quarters are in jobs which will last five years or more.

    4. The duration of employment among blacks is just as long as among

        whites. Even though the jobs held by blacks are worse in almost

        every other dimension, they are no more unstable than those held

        by whites.


    5. Women's jobs are substantially shorter than men's, on the average. Only

        about a quarter of all women over the age of thirty are employed in jobs

        which will last over twenty years, whereas over half of men over thirty

        are holding these near—lifetime jobs.

  Introduction

       Though the U.S. labor market is justly notorious for high turnover

  and consequent high unemployment, it also provides stable, near—lifetime

 employment to an important fraction of the labor force. This paper

 investigates patterns of job duration
                                            by age, race, and sex, with the
 following major conclusions:

      1. The typical worker today is holding a job which has lasted or

 will last about eight years. Over a quarter of all workers are holding

 jobs which will last twenty years or
                                        more. Sixty percent hold jobs which
 will last five years or more.

      2. The jobs held by middle—aged workers with more than 10
                                                                years of
 tenure are extremely stable. Over the span of a decade, only twenty to

 thirty percent come to an end.

      3. Among workers aged thirty and above, about 40 percent are

 currently working in jobs which eventually will
                                                     last twenty years or
more. Three—quarters are in jobs which will last five years or more.

     4. The duration of employment
                                     among blacks is just as long as among
whites. Even though the jobs held by blacks are worse in almost
                                                                every other
dimension, they are no more unstable than those held by whites.

     5. Women's jobs are substantially shorter than men's, on the
                                                                  average.
Only about a quarter of all women over the age of thirty are employed in

jobs which will last over twenty years, whereas over half of men over

thirty are holding these near—lifetime jobs.


These findings are highly relevant in the debate over the existence and

nature of long—term employment contracts.      I have elaborated this point
elsewhere (Hall, 1980) and have given
                                        extensive citations, which will not
                                   2




be repeated here. If most workers in the U.S. were holding relatively

brief jobs, then theories of long—term employment arrangements would be

off the point. The findings reported here of the considerable importance

of lifetime work do not clinch the case in favor of any particular theory

of long—term contracts. Even in markets for completely homogeneous

products, where simple ideas of competitive spot markets work perfectly,

it is conceivable that the typical buyer deals with the same seller year

after year. But the finding of extensive long—term employment in the

U.S. labor market does add to the interest in understanding long—term

employment arrangements.

     All of the results in this paper are derived from published

tabulations of job tenure, that is, the length of time that workers have

been employed to date in their jobs. Most of the results rest on

projections of how much longer workers will remain on their current jobs.

These projections are most important for workers in mid—career, where many

have just started jobs which will ultimately last twenty or thirty years.

The techniques used in this research were inspired by the related

 literature on the duration of unemployment, launched by Hyman Kaitz (1970).

My concentration on the distribution of job duration across workers was

 suggested by the work of Kim Clark and Lawrence Summers (1979) on the

 distribution of the duration of unemployment across unemployed workers.

 This paper will not make any explicit use of a very different distribution,

 that of the duration across jobs. It is true, but not relevant for the

 points to be made here, that the typical job is extremely brief, lasting

 only a matter of months (R.A. Jenness, 1979). Most workers hold very

 stable jobs, even though stable jobs are a small fraction of the flow of

 jobs filled each month. The relationship between the distribution of the
                                    3




lengths of jobs, sampled randomly from the universe of newly started jobs,

and the distribution obtained by sampling randomly among workers, is

explained in detail by Salant (1977) and by George Akerlof and Brian Main

(1980). Everything in this paper is based on sampling workers.

     The stability of jobs among middle—aged and older workers has been

noted by a number of earlier authors, though the computation in this paper

of additional time on the job is new, as far as I know. My own earlier

work (Hall, 1972) presented low estimates of separation rates from the

National Longitudinal Survey of Work Experience for older men, but without

any comment on the significance of the low rates. Martin Neil Baily (1976)

cited the same source in defense of theories of long—term employment

contracts. Kazuo Koike (1978) has compared data on tenure for the U.S.

and Japan and concluded that tenure of 15 years or longer is actually more

common in the U.S., in spite of the celebrated nenko system of lifetime

employment in Japan. I hope in later work to apply the techniques of this

paper to a comparison of the U.S., Japan, and France, all of which have

tenure surveys. Finally, Akerlof and Main (1980) present computations of

the mean length of jobs held by workers in the U.S., with results that are

fully compatible with the complete distributions reported here.



Data on Job Tenure

    On six different occasions in the postwar period, the Current

Population Survey has inquired about the starting date of the current

job of each of the roughly 100,000 workers included in the survey.1 A

(1967), (1960), (1975), and (1979).

job is defined as continuous employment with the same employer, possibly

in different occupations. Interruptions in jobs for vacation, illness,

strikes, and layoffs of less than 30 days are not counted. For the self—

employed and household service workers with multiple employers, the entire

spell in the same line of work is counted as a single job.1 Tenure is

defined as the number of years since the workers' current job began.

     The data on tenure do not immediately suggest that lengthy employment

is an important feature of the American labor market. The median job

tenure among workers in general was only 3.6 years in 1978; 40 percent

had tenure of less than two years and only 9.5 percent had been on the

same job for twenty years or more. The distribution of workers among the

categories of tenure was

                     3—5                       12.5

  'Only 1.5 percent of workers are in household service, and, in any case,
their distribution by tenure is very similar to the distribution for workers
in general. The self—employed form 8.4 percent of all workers and have
typically longer tenure (especially farmers). However, for most of the
self—employed, the definition of a job used in the survey is probably quite
reasonable.
                                    5




However, the labor force contains a large proportion of young workers who

could not possibly have long tenure even if lifetime jobs were the general

rule. A better way to diagnose long—term employment from data on tenure

is among older workers. The percentages of workers who have had the same

jobs for 20 or more years are:


                       Age                 Percent

                      35—39                    1

                      40—44                    7


                      45—49                   17

                      50—54                  25

                      55—59                  30

                      60—64                  33

                       65+                   35



     From these data, one might reasonably infer that lifetime employment

is the exception in the U.S. labor market. Only about a third of older

workers are currently in jobs which have lasted a large fraction of their

careers. But this inference is obscured by the failure to count large

numbers of middle—aged workers who are now working in jobs which ultimately

will last 20 or 25 years, but which have lasted less than 20 years to date.

Among the 45 to 49 year olds, for example, in addition to the 17 percent

who are working in jobs which have lasted at least 20 years so far, another

44 percent are in jobs which have lasted 5 to 20 years, and, as I will

demonstrate, there is a large probability that these jobs will last a good

many more years. Over 40 percent of all 45 to 49 year olds are in near—

lifetime jobs. This inference is not inconsistent with the small fraction——
                                   6




again about a third——of workers near retirement age who have twenty or

more years of tenure. Ages of retirement vary widely; many of the workers

in this age group are now holding new jobs after retiring from near—

lifetime jobs in the recent past. There is no single age at which the

fraction of workers with long tenure reveals the true importance of long—

term jobs.



Inferring the prospective length of a job

     In order to get a clearer picture of the importance of long jobs,

it is necessary to project the likely additional time a worker will spend

in his current job. Then what I will call "eventual tenure" can be

computed as the sum of actual reported tenure and the projected additional

time on the job. The key element in the projection is the probability

that a worker with a given age and tenure will retain his current job for

one, ten, twenty years, and so on. In the work presented here, the

retention probabilities are measured from the number of workers in one

age—tenure category who move on to higher age—tenure categories. If the

fraction is large, it means that there is considerable prospective

additional time on the job for a worker in the first category. This kind

of comparison can be made for widely separated categories; for example,

to compute the probability that a worker aged 25 to 29 who has been on

the job for 5 years will remain on the job for 10 more years, I use

         number of workers aged 35 to 39 with 15 years of tenure
          number of workers aged 25 to 29 with 5 years of tenure


     The computation of job retention rates can be done historically by

comparing the number of workers in an age—tenure category in one survey
                                    7




with the number in a later survey in correspondingly higher age and

tenure categories. Job retention rates computed in this way appear in

Table 1 for the 10—year period 1968 to 1978. Alternatively, what I will

call "contemporaneous job retention rates can be computed by comparing

two categories in the same survey. In this approach, an adjustment for

differences in the population by age must be used. The effect of the

adjustment is to compare the fraction of the population in an age group

who have a specified amount of tenure with the fraction of the population

in an older group with correspondingly higher tenure. The two methods of

calculating job retention rates will give the same results if the

distribution of tenure within age groups remains stable over time. Both

are just estimates of future retention rates, and it is not clear as a

theoretical matter which is better. At the practical level, the

contemporaneous retention rates are the only ones that can be calculated

for less than five—year spans because the survey has been taken only at

five—year intervals in the past decade. Examples of the differences

between the two rates appear in Table 1 for the most important age—tenure

groups. The only important discrepancy occurs among 40 to 44 year olds

with 15 to 20 years of tenure. An unusually large fraction of this age

group in 1968 took jobs in the immediate postwar period, 1948 to 1953.

As a result, the numerator in the contemporaneous retention rate, which

contains the same group 10 years later, is biased upward as an estimate

of the likely fraction of 50 to 54 year olds with 25 to 30 years of

tenure in 1988. Biases of this kind are largely offsetting because the

same high number appears in the denominator of other estimates of

retention rates. The fact that the disturbance in job—taking patterns

caused by World War II shows up clearly in the 1978 data on job tenure is

an illustration in itself of the importance of long—term jobs.

    The computation of retention rates in Table 1 takes account of all

the major sources of departure from jobs——movements to other jobs and

departures from the labor force through permanent retirement or temporary

withdrawal. This is achieved by taking the percent of the population in

each age—tenure category, rather than the percent of workers (which is

what is reported in the tabulations of the survey). Data on the civilian

non—institutional population were used to restate the data in this form;

the resulting distribution is given in the appendix. Two other less

important sources of departure from jobs are not counted in Table 1:

death and emigration. An examination of data on deaths and on population

changes within cohorts showed that neither flow has any perceptible effect

on the calculation of retention rates. In the modern U.S. economy, almost

nobody dies or emigrates while holding a job. Finally, the restriction

to civilian employment and population means that military service is not

included——the reported retention rates are correct estimates for non-

military jobs.




Computed job retention rates and the distribution of eventual tenure for
the U.S. labor force

     Table 1 shows that both measures of job retention rates agree that

all but the youngest workers face a substantial probability of remaining

on their current jobs for at least another ten years. Eventual tenure

is far greater than tenure to date, especially for workers in their

forties. About half of those 40 to 44 who have been on their current
                                  10




jobs for 5 to 10 years so far will retain their jobs 10 years from now.

And for those in their forties who have spent most of their working lives

in their current jobs, the great majority (65 to 79 percent) will remain

in those jobs for the next 10 years as well. Job retention rates are

lower among younger workers, who are still in the process of finding good

lifetime matches, and for older workers, who have substantial probabilities

of retirement in the next 10 years.

    With a complete set of job retention rates, it is possible to

calculate the distribution of additional years of work for workers in

each observed age—tenure category. Results for 40 to 44 year olds are:

Although the entire distribution can be inferred, all that is shown here

is the fraction of workers whose additional years of work will be enough

to give them eventual tenure of at least 20 years on the current job. As
                                   11




in every group in the labor force, those aged 40 to 44 who have just taken

new jobs have only a small likelihood of remaining in those jobs for the

next 20 years. But those who have been on their current jobs for 5 to 10

years have a 35 percent chance of keeping their current jobs for the 10 to

15 additional years necessary to give them an eventual tenure of 20 years

or more. Those who have already lasted 10 to 15 years have a 59 percent

chance of lasting the additional 5 to 10 years, and those with 15 to 20

years on their current jobs are 98 percent likely to reach 20 years of

eventual tenure. In the entire age group, just under 40 percent will have

eventual tenure on their current jobs of 20 years or more. This should be

compared to the much smaller figure——7.5 percent——who have already reached.

20 years of tenure. Very long—term jobs are quantitatively important in

this age group, but that fact is not apparent directly in the distribution

of tenure. Computations of eventual tenure from job retention rates are

needed to appraise the incidence of very long jobs.

     Following is the distribution of eventual tenure across all age and

tenure categories for U.S. workers in 1978:

The typical worker is currently on a job which will last about eight years

in all, counting the years it has already lasted. An important minority——

about 28 percent——are currently employed in near—lifetime jobs lasting 20

years or more, and 17 percent are in jobs which will last 30 years or more.

An equally important minority are at work in what will turn out to be very

brief jobs——about 23 percent will have eventual tenure of less than two

years. A clear majority of workers——58 percent——are currently holding

reasonably long jobs, those which will last five years or more.

The process of moving into long—term work

     The data on job tenure reveal a good deal about the probability process

through which most workers eventually settle into near—lifetime jobs. The

typical pattern is to hold a number of very brief jobs in the first few

years after leaving school. Eventually one job turns out to be a good

match and lasts several years. The probability that any given new job will

become a lifetime job is extremely low for young workers and never rises

above six percent in any age group. But after a job has lasted five years,

the probability that it will eventually last 20 years or more in all rises

to close to one—half among workers in their early thirties. As a general

matter, the data suggest that most job changes occur in the first few years

after a job begins, because the worker or the employer or both perceive

that the worker and the job are poorly matched. Once this period of job—

shopping reaches a successful conclusion, workers have very low probabilities

of losing or leaving jobs. Again, it is important to emphasize that good

matches are not necessarily good jobs in any absolute sense——a worker who

is placed above his competence will not last any longer than will a worker

who realizes he would be happier in another job for which he is qualified.

     At no age is the probability very high of a given new job becoming a

lifetime job:

The very low chance of success in any given new job means that the typical

worker has to take a number of different jobs in order to have a good

chance of finding a lifetime match. The small probability in each new

job presumably reflects the paucity of information available to workers

about prospective jobs before they try them out and the similar paucity

of information available to employers about the talents of prospective

workers before they can be observed at work. Even workers in their

thirties and forties, who generally have substantial amounts of experience,

face low chances of landing lifetime jobs on any given try.

     Still, most workers do wind up in lifetime work, as earlier parts of

this paper have shown. Table 2 illustrates how multiple tries eventually

succeed. It uses the point of five years of tenure as an intermediate

milestone in describing the process. The first column gives the fraction

of workers who are in new jobs, that is, jobs which began in the six

months before the survey. The fraction declines smoothly from a majority

Explanation:     Column 1 is the reported fraction of workers in the age
                 group who have 0 to 6 months of tenure. Column 2 is the
                 contemporaneous 5—year job retention rate from 0—6 months
                 tenure to 5—10 years tenure. Column 3 is the reported
                 fraction of workers in the age group with 5 or more years
                 of tenure. Column 4 is the 15—year contemporaneous job
                 retention rate from 5—10 years tenure to 20—25 years

of teenagers to about six percent of workers aged 55 to 64; it rises

slightly around retirement age. The second column gives the probability

that a newly employed worker will reach the milestone of five years on

the job. The chances are insignificant among teenagers, rise to a peak

of about one in four among workers in their early fifties, and then fall

back to low levels for workers near retirement age. The third column

shows the fraction of all workers in each age group who have reached the

five—year point on their current jobs. The fraction rises smoothly from

close to zero for teenagers to about three—quarters for workers in their

early sixties. At age 40, a majority of workers have passed the five—year

milestone, generally after a number of trials. For example, if the chances

are about 10 percent that any given job will last at least five years, and

half of all workers have made it, then the typical worker has taken roughly

five tries. The last column gives the prospects for a total duration of

20 years or more at the five—year point. The probability reaches a peak

of nearly half among workers in their early thirties and then declines

among older workers, who will probably retire within the next 15 years.

     The result of this process of moving into long—term jobs is the

following fraction of workers with eventual tenure of at least 20 years:

The fraction rises until the late thirties, as more and more workers find

good job matches, and then remains remarkably constant at about 40 percent

until retirement age. However, these aggregate results conceal very

important differences between men and women, a topic I will take up

shortly.

     Another way to express the movement of workers into stable jobs is

by the number of jobs held by the average worker. The flow of new jobs

is recorded directly in the tenure data in the form of the number of

workers who have tenure of six months or less. The annual number of new

jobs started by the average person in an age group is twice the fraction

of the age group that is found in the 0 to 6 month tenure category. The
                                      18




average number of jobs held over a two—year span is twice the annual rate,

and the average over a five—year span is five times the annual rate.

These simple computations yield the following results for the number of

jobs held by the average worker:

Job—shopping is most intense in the early twenties——by age 24, the average

worker has held four jobs out of the 10 he or she will hold in an entire

career. The next 15 years, from age 25 through 39, will contribute another

four jobs. Then, during the ages when near—lifetime work is characteristic,

less than three more jobs will be held on the average.

Long—term jobs among blacks and women

    Many accounts of the disadvantages facing blacks and women in the

labor market emphasize their lack of success in finding and holding

permanent jobs. The techniques of this paper reach a surprising conclusion

in testing this view——it is upheld strongly for women but not at all for

blacks. Lifetime employment is almost as common among blacks as among

whites, and long—term employment is actually more common:'

          All whites, 1978        57.3                  28.7


The lower—paying jobs where blacks are concentrated are not systematically

briefer than are the better jobs typically held by whites. Discrimination

against blacks does not take the form of exclusion from lifetime jobs.

Blacks are heavily represented in certain occupations with lower status

and pay, but these are not occupations with systematically shorter jobs.

Moreover, the vastly higher incidence of unemployment among blacks—--

generally double the white rate——is not at all the result of larger flows

of workers out of jobs. Further investigation of the surprising finding

of equal or higher job stability among blacks relative to whites cannot

be done with the published data and will require tabulation of the survey

itself.

(1976) using personnel data from three firms.

     On the other hand, the comparison between men and women confirms the

general impression that men typically hold longer jobs than do women:

           Men, 1978            63.8                37.3


Shorter job duration among women is almost unrelated to their concentration

in certain occupations. For example, more than a third of all employed

women (34.9 percent) in 1978 were in clerical occupations, against 6.4

percent of men. Median tenure for women clerical workers was 2.6 years

compared to 4.7 years for men. The gap between women and men in the total

labor force was close to the same——median tenure was 2.6 years for women

and 4.5 years for men. Similarly large sex differences in tenure are found

in the other two major occupations employing women, professional—technical

and service workers. It is not possible to compute the distribution of

eventual tenure by occupation with the published data, but it seems likely

that large differences in eventual tenure would be found within occupations

as well.

     Although lifetime work is much less common among women than among men,

the typical number of jobs held over a lifetime is about the same for both

sexes——about ten or eleven jobs. Longer periods spent out of the labor

force by women almost exactly offset the shorter durations of the jobs they

hold. In other words, although the time between starting one job and

starting the next is the same for women and men, women spend a larger part

of that time not working. This is roughly true within age groups as well

as over the typical entire career:

Women slip behind men by about 0.6 jobs during the period of most intense

job—shopping and then recover a little after age 35.



Further results for men

     Because lifetime work is so much more common for men than for women,

it seems worthwhile presenting some further detailed results for men alone.

Actual and eventual tenure are:

Once past the years of job—shopping, half of all men are in lifetime jobs.

     The jobs held by middle—aged men are remarkably stable——ten—year job

Monthly separation rates, which are of the order of three percent for

workers in general, are about 0.25 percent for middle—aged men with at

least 10 years on the job.

       The contemporaneous job retention rates in Table 1 are simply ratios

of entries in this table. For example, the 12.6 percent retention rate

for 20—24 year olds with 0—5 years of tenure is the fraction of the

population in that group (21.2 + 9.9 + 12.6 ÷   6.9 + 8.2    =   58.8 percent)

divided into the fraction aged 30—34 years with 10—15 years of tenure

(7.4 percent).

       The computation of the distribution of eventual tenure within an age

group proceeds as follows. To compute the fraction with, say, 20+ years

of eventual tenure, first count those with 20+ years of actual tenure.

Then add the fracticn with 15—20 years of tenure multiplied by the 5—year

job retention rate, the fraction with 10—15 year tenure multiplied by their

10—year retention rate, and so on. For 40—44 year olds, the computations

are:
