We investigate a neoclassical economy with heterogeneous agents, convex technologies and

idiosyncratic production risk. Combined with precautionary savings, investment risk generates rich

effects that do not arise in the presence of pure endowment risk. Under a finite horizon, multiple

growth paths and endogenous fluctuations can exist even when agents are very patient. In infinite-

horizon economies, multiple steady states may arise from the endogeneity of risktaking and interest

rates instead of the usual wealth effects. Depending on the economy's parameters, the local dynamics

around a steady state are locally unique, totally unstable or locally undetermined, and the equilibrium

path can be attracted to a limit cycle. The model generates closed-form expressions for the

equilibrium dynamics and easily extends to a variety of environments, including heterogeneous

capital types and multiple sectors.

1        Introduction
How does incomplete risk-sharing aﬀect the level and volatility of macroeconomic activity? We
investigate this question in a neoclassical economy with missing markets and decentralized produc-
tion. Idiosyncratic technological risks, unlike endowment shocks, introduce private risk premia on
capital investment. The interaction of these premia with the precautionary motive can generate
endogenous fluctuations and multiple equilibria even when agents are very patient, technology is
strictly convex, and the wealth distribution has no eﬀect on endogenous aggregates.
        We conduct the analysis in the GEI growth framework introduced in Angeletos and Calvet
(2003). Each agent is both a consumer and a producer, who can invest in a private neoclassical
technology with diminishing returns to scale. In contrast to the traditional Ramsey model, individ-
uals are exposed to idiosyncratic shocks in productive investment and possibly in some exogenous
endowment. Agents also trade in financial markets. They can borrow or lend a risk-free bond,
and partially hedge their idiosyncratic risks by exchanging a finite number of risky assets. All
securities are real and there are no constraints on short sales. When markets are complete, the
economy reduces to a Ramsey growth model with identical agents, as in Cass (1965), Koopmans
(1965), and Brock and Mirman (1972). With missing markets, on the other hand, the economy
cannot be described by a representative agent; explicit aggregation is nonetheless possible under a
CARA-normal specification for preferences and risks.
        We previously established two main results on macroeconomic performance in the neighbor-
hood of complete markets. First, idiosyncratic production shocks, unlike endowment risk, tend to
discourage investment. Thus in contrast to Bewley models (e.g. Aiyagari, 1994; Huggett, 1997;
Krusell and Smith, 1998), incomplete risk-sharing can lead to lower steady state levels of capital
and output than under complete markets.1 Second, financial incompleteness can increase the per-
sistence of the business cycle. In the traditional Ramsey framework, a negative wealth shock has
some persistence because agents seek to smooth consumption through time. When markets are
incomplete, productive investment is risky and becomes even less attractive relative to current con-
sumption. This can slow down convergence to the steady state, and thus increase the persistence
of aggregate shocks.
        The present paper extends our earlier work in a number of useful directions, including high levels
of financial incompleteness and finite-horizon economies. We show that idiosyncratic production
risk can generate rich dynamics that cannot be generated by endowment risks.
        We begin by investigating finite-horizon economies. In contrast to the complete market Ramsey
model, agents accumulate large precautionary wealth in later periods, because shocks received
around the terminal date cannot be smoothed through time by borrowing and lending. In economies

with large uninsurable risks, the anticipation of these movements lead to endogenous fluctuations
along the entire equilibrium path.
      The interaction between investment risk and precautionary savings can also generate non-
monotonicities in the equilibrium recursion. As a result, there exist multiple growth paths in
some economies with investment risks.
      We next examine infinite horizon economies. Multiple steady states can then arise from idiosyn-
cratic production risks and the endogeneity of interest rates. Under incomplete markets, individual
risk-taking is encouraged by the ability to self-insure against future consumption shocks, and thus
by the anticipation of low borrowing rates in later periods. This property can generate multiple
steady states in infinite horizon economies. In a rich equilibrium, a low real interest rate encourages
a high level of risk-taking and investment, which in turn implies a low marginal productivity of
capital and therefore a low interest rate. Conversely in a poor steady state or poverty trap, high
real interest rates, high private risk premia and low investment are self-sustained. Poverty traps
thus originate from the interaction between borrowing costs and risk-taking, a source of multiplicity
that, to the best of our knowledge, is new to the literature. In contrast, earlier work has obtained
poverty traps from wealth eﬀects, building on the idea that poorer agents have lower ability to
borrow and invest and may thus be trapped at low wealth levels (e.g., Banerjee and Newman,
1991; Galor and Zeira, 1993). We eliminate wealth eﬀects by assuming CARA preferences, and
highlight another channel through which financial incompleteness may aﬀect the development of
an economy: the impact of real interest rates on risk-taking.
      The local dynamics around the steady state have a rich structure under incomplete markets.
Depending on the economy’s parameters, a steady state is locally unique, totally unstable or lo-
cally undetermined, and the equilibrium path can be attracted to a limit cycle. We observe that
the complicated dynamics arise even when agents are very patient. This suggests that financial
incompleteness may help mitigate the role of heavy discounting in neoclassical growth models of en-
dogenous cycles (e.g. Boldrin and Montrucchio, 1986).2 For instance, Mitra (1996) and Nishimura
and Yano (1996) prove that a period-three cycle only exists if the discount factor β is less than
               √
the constant [( 5 − 1)/2]2 ≈ 0.38. By contrast, our GEI growth economy generates determinis-
tic fluctuations with a Cobb-Douglas technology for large values of the discount factor, such as
β = 0.95.
      We observe that like in finite horizon case, complicated dynamics arise even though technology
is convex and there are no credit constraints. Our results thus complements earlier work examining
how equilibrium multiplicity and endogenous cycles may originate from production non-convexities
(e.g. Benhabib and Farmer, 1994), overlapping generations (Benhabib and Day, 1982; Grandmont,
  2
      Note that it is possible to observe fluctuations in a multi-sector growth model for more patient agents (Benhabib
and Nishimura, 1979).

1985) or credit constraints (Galor and Zeira, 1993; Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997; Aghion, Banerjee and
Piketty, 1999; Aghion, Bacchetta and Banerjee, 2000). The paper also extends the results obtained
in the incomplete-markets endowment economy of Calvet (2001). Idiosyncratic production risks,
unlike endowment risks, generate cycles even though storage and productive capital can be used as
smoothing devices. They also induce novel dynamic eﬀects, such a complementarity between future
and current investment, and a negative feedback between future capital and current consumption.
        Finally, we show that the tractability of our framework is preserved under a number of ex-
tensions. For instance, we introduce a storage technology with fixed positive returns, as well as
randomness in the depreciation of productive capital. The model also generalizes to physical and
human capital, and multiple sectors. Idiosyncratic production risks then also aﬀect the alloca-
tion of savings across diﬀerent types of capital or diﬀerent sectors, thus introducing additional
ineﬃciencies.
        Section 2 presents the model. We solve the individual decision problem and calculate the
equilibrium path under a finite horizon in Section 3. In Section 4 we investigate the infinite-horizon
economy and examine the comparative statics and local dynamics of the steady state. Extensions
to multiple capital types and sectors are considered in section 5. We conclude in Section 6. Unless
stated otherwise, all proofs are given in the Appendix.


2        The Model
We consider a neoclassical growth economy with a finite number of heterogeneous agents, indexed
by h ∈ {1, ...H}. Agents are born at date t = 0, and live and consume a single good in dates
t ∈ {0, 1, .., T }. The horizon is either finite (T < ∞) or infinite (T = ∞). The economy is stochastic
and all random variables are defined on a probability space (Ω, F, P).


2.1        Production and Idiosyncratic Risks

Each individual is an entrepreneur who owns his own stock of capital and operates his own pro-
duction scheme. The technology is standard neoclassical, convex, and requires neither adjustment
costs nor indivisibilities in investment. These assumptions would lead to the standard neoclassical
growth model, if it were not for the following: production is subject to (partially undiversifiable)
idiosyncratic uncertainty. An investment of kth units of capital at date t yields

                                           h
                                          yt+1 = Aht+1 F (kth ) + (1 − δ ht+1 )kth

units of the consumption good at date t + 1. The production function F is increasing, strictly
concave, and satisfies the Inada conditions.3 The total factor productivity Aht+1 and the depreciation
    3
        The function F satisfies F 0 > 0, F 00 < 0, F (0) = 0, F 0 (0) = +∞, F (+∞) = +∞, and F 0 (+∞) = 0.


                                                             3
rate δ ht+1 are random shocks specific to individual h, which introduce investment risk. They are
the key ingredients of the model.
      The productivity shocks (Aht+1 , δ ht+1 ) allow us to capture the impact on growth of a wide range
of technological risks. The uncertainty of an entrepreneurial project obviously influences specific
investment in capital or R&D. More generally, the riskiness of a worker’s human capital aﬀects a
wide range of decisions such as labor supply,4 education, learning-by-doing, job search and career
choices. As will be seen in Section 5, the model can be conveniently extended to explicitly include
multiple sectors or the accumulation of human and physical capital.
      For comparison purposes, we introduce two additional sources of income. First, individuals
have access to a linear storage technology with gross rate of return ρ ∈ [0, 1]. An investment of
sht units of the good yields ρsht with certainty at date t + 1. Second, agents receive an exogenous
stochastic endowment stream {eht }Tt=0 . Income eht+1 captures the eﬀect of risks that are outside the
control of individuals and do not aﬀect production capabilities. Like productivity and depreciation,
exogenous income eht+1 is unknown at t and revealed at t + 1.


2.2      Asset Structure and Preferences

Individual risks can be partially hedged by trading a limited set of real securities. Each asset
n ∈ {0, .., N } is short-lived: it is worth π n,t units of the good at date t, and yields dn,t+1 units of
the good at date t + 1. Security n = 0 is riskless and delivers d0,t+1 ≡ 1 with certainty next period.
The quantity Rt ≡ 1/π 0,t denotes the gross interest rate between t and t + 1, and rt = Rt − 1 is
the corresponding net rate. Assets are in zero net supply, there are no short-sale constraints, and
default is not allowed. It is convenient to stack asset prices and payoﬀs into the vectors

                                    π t = (π n,t )N                       N
                                                  n=0 and dt+1 = (dn,t+1 )n=0 .


Without loss of generality, we assume that (dn,t+1 )N                                2
                                                    n=0 is an orthonormal family of L (Ω), implying
that risky assets have zero expected payoﬀs and are mutually uncorrelated.
      At the outset of every period t, investors are informed of the realization of the asset payoﬀs dt and
idiosyncratic shocks {(Aht , δ ht , eht )}H                                                 5
                                          h=1 . Information is thus symmetric across agents. Conditional
on available information, agent h selects a portfolio θht = (θhn,t )N
                                                                    n=0 in period t.
      We assume by construction that all the assets traded in one period are short-lived, in the sense
that they only deliver payoﬀs in the next period. In the next sections, we will focus on equilibria with
zero risk premia and deterministic interest rate sequences {Rt }0≤t<T . For this reason, equilibrium

      The results of this paper would not be modified under the weaker assumptions that income shocks are privately
observed and the structure of the economy is common knowledge (provided of course that the financial structure
remains exogenous).

The variable wth , called wealth, represents the trader’s net financial position at date t. When the
horizon T is finite, we use the convention that shT = 0 and θhT = 0. Under an infinite horizon, we
instead impose the transversality condition limt→∞ E0 β t u(wth ) = 0.


2.3      CARA-Normal Specification

Agents have identical exponential utilities

where Γ > 0 is the coeﬃcient of absolute risk aversion. The asset payoﬀs dt+1 and idiosyncratic
        ¡                      ¢
shocks { Aht+1 , δ ht+1 , eht+1 }h are jointly normal and independent of past information. There is thus
no distinction between the conditional and unconditional distribution of these variables. The (un-
conditional) distribution of payoﬀs and shocks can vary through time, which in future applications
may prove useful to capture the dynamic eﬀect of financial innovation or business cycle variations
in uninsurable risk (e.g. Mankiw, 1986; Constantinides and Duﬃe, 1996).
      We obtain a tractable model when investment opportunities are symmetric across agents and
idiosyncratic shocks cancel out in the aggregate. Specifically, we assume that the mean of idiosyn-
cratic shocks is both constant and homogeneous across the population:

                             A ≡ EAht+1 > 0,       δ ≡ Eδ ht+1 ∈ [0, 1],     e ≡ Eeht+1 ≥ 0.

We rule out aggregate risk by imposing in every period the                  cross-sectional restriction:
                                         ⎡         ⎤ ⎡                      ⎤

                                                                            ⎥.

                                            eht+1        e

This assumption implies that the endogenous fluctuations observed in equilibrium will be unrelated
to aggregate shocks.

      More generally, traders can dynamically replicate a large class of long-lived risky assets.

    Finally, we must guarantee that idiosyncratic risk is symmetrically distributed across the pop-
ulation. For all h, project the idiosyncratic risks on the asset span available at date t:

and that the standard deviations σ t+1 = (σ A,t+1 ; σ δ,t+1 ; σ e,t+1 ) are identical for all agents. The com-
ponents of σ t+1 represent useful measures of financial incompleteness, which can deterministically
vary through time.
    The CARA-normal specification will ensure that, given a deterministic price sequence, aggregate
quantities are independent of the wealth distribution. This will overcome the curse of dimensionality
that arises when the distribution of wealth — an infinite-dimensional object — enters the state space
of the economy.


2.4     Equilibrium

Given a price sequence {π t }Tt=0 , each agent chooses an adapted contingent plan {cht , kth , sht , θ ht , wth }Tt=0 .

Definition. A GEI equilibrium consists of a price sequence {π t }Tt=0 and a collection of individual

(i) Given prices, each agent’s plan is optimal.

We make two immediate observations. First, if Rt < ρ, agents want to borrow an infinite amount at
rate Rt and invest it in the storage technology. The absence of arbitrage thus requires that Rt ≥ ρ
in any date-event. Second, the absence of aggregate risk in the CARA-normal framework implies
that deterministic price sequences {π t }Tt=0 can be obtained in equilibrium. We henceforth focus on
price sequences satisfying these two conditions.

3     Equilibrium under a Finite Horizon

3.1       Decision Theory

Consider an exogenous, deterministic path of asset prices {π t }Tt=0 satisfying the no-arbitrage con-
dition Rt ≥ ρ in every period. We focus on a fixed agent h and denote by J h (w, t) her indirect
utility of wealth along the price path as of date t. Indirect utility satisfies the Bellman equation:

                           J h (wth , t) =          max                u (c) + βEt J h (wt+1
                                                                                         h
                                                                                             , t + 1)
                                              {ch   h h h
                                                t ,kt ,st ,θ t }


subject to the budget constraints (1) and (2). Since J h (w, T ) ≡ u(w) at the terminal date, the
value functions J h (., t) can be solved by a backward recursion.
     The results are conveniently presented using

                                  Φ(k) ≡ AF (k) + (1 − δ)k + e,
                             G(k, a, σ) ≡ Φ(k) − Γa[F (k)2 σ 2A + k 2 σ 2δ + σ 2e ]/2.

The function Φ(k) denotes the expected non-financial wealth when investing k units of capital. In
contrast, G(k, a, σ) is the risk-adjusted level of non-financial wealth corresponding to productive
investment k, marginal propensity to consume next period a, and residual risks σ = (σ A , σ δ , σ e ) .

Lemma 1 The value function belongs to the CARA class in every period:

                                   J h (w, t) = −(Γat )−1 exp[−Γ(at w + bht )].

The coeﬃcients at and bht are defined recursively by the terminal conditions aT = 1, bhT = 0, and

The agent does not use the storage technology if Rt > ρ, and is indiﬀerent between the bond and
storage if Rt = ρ

Forward iteration of (3) implies that the marginal propensity to consume is inversely related to
the price of perpetuity: at = 1/(1 + Πt ). The intercept bht decreases with the standard deviations
of uninsurable risks σ t+1 , an implication of the precautionary motive for savings (Leland, 1968;
Sandmo, 1970; Caballero, 1990). The demand for investment exhibits more novel features. The
optimal capital stock decreases not only with productivity risks σ A,t+1 and σ δ,t+1 , but also with
at+1 = 1/(1 + Πt+1 ) and therefore future interest rates Rs (s ≥ t + 1). This property reflects the
sensitivity of current risk-taking to the future cost of self-insurance.


3.2       Equilibrium Characterization

Let Ct , Wt , Kt , and St denote the population average of consumption, wealth, capital and storage
                                                     P
investment in a given date t. Initial wealth W 0 = H         h
                                                        h=1 w0 /H is an exogenous parameter of the
economy.
       Since idiosyncratic shocks cancel out in the aggregate, we focus on equilibrium paths with zero
risk premia.7 Risky assets, whose expected payoﬀs are normalized to zero, therefore trade at zero
prices: π n,t = 0 for all n ∈ {1, ..., N }. Condition (6) then reduces to

                                     kth ∈ arg max[G(k, at+1 , σ t+1 ) − Rt k].                               (8)
                                                 k≥0

Individual investment maximizes risk-adjusted output net of capital costs. Since all agents have
the same marginal propensity to consume at = 1/(1 + Πt ) and the same objective function (8), the
same capital stock can be chosen by all agents: kth = Kt for all h. We then aggregate across the
population and obtain the equilibrium dynamics in closed form.

Proposition 1 The aggregate equilibrium dynamics are deterministic and risk premia on financial
assets are equal to zero. All agents have identical marginal propensities to consume and choose
   7
       As shown in the Appendix, the risk premium is necessarily zero in any equilibrium if the economy contains a
single type of idiosyncratic investment risk (i.e., only productivity risk or only depreciation risk).

and the boundary conditions W0 = W 0 , aT = 1 and KT = 0.

While individuals are subjected to idiosyncratic shocks, macroeconomic quantities are deterministic
functions of time. Nevertheless, the economy cannot be represented by a representative agent with
consumption flow {Ct }, because equilibrium investment (6) and consumption growth (12) depend
on idiosyncratic risk.
    Mean consumption growth increases with the variance of future individual consumption, V art (cht+1 )
= a2t+1 [F (Kt )2 σ 2A,t+1 + Kt2 σ 2δ,t+1 + σ 2e,t+1 ], which is a familiar consequence of the precautionary mo-
tive. The optimal capital stock, on the other hand, satisfies the FOC:

                    Rt = 1 − δ + AF 0 (Kt ) − Γat+1 [F (Kt )F 0 (Kt )σ 2A,t+1 + Kt σ 2δ,t+1 ].             (14)

In the absence of undiversifiable productivity risk (σ A,t+1 = σ δ,t+1 = 0), the marginal product of
capital is equated with the interest rate: Rt = Φ0 (Kt ) = 1 − δ + AF 0 (Kt ). This relation, which
is well-known in complete market models, holds more generally in the presence of uninsurable
endowment shocks (σ e,t+1 ≥ 0). But when production risks cannot be fully hedged (σ A,t+1 or
σ δ,t+1 > 0), the interest rate is equal to the risk-adjusted return to capital Gk (Kt , at+1 , σ t+1 ). The
diﬀerence Φ0 (Kt ) − Rt = Γat+1 [F (Kt )F 0 (Kt )σ 2A,t+1 + Kt σ 2δ,t+1 ] represents a private risk premium
on investment. Note that it does not include the endowment coeﬃcient σ e,t+1 . Under idiosyncratic
production shocks, risk aversion thus induces the sensitivity of current investment Kt to future
marginal propensity at+1 = 1/(1 + Πt+1 ), and thus to future interest rates. When high real rates
are anticipated in the near future, agents know that it will be costly to smooth adverse future
productivity shocks by borrowing. The anticipation of a high marginal propensity at+1 then implies
low productive investment in the current period.
    Idiosyncratic production risk, unlike endowment risk, thus implies that current investment is
sensitive to future interest rates. This eﬀect introduces a dynamic complementarity in general
equilibrium. The anticipation of low income, low savings, and high real interest rates in future
periods discourages current risk-taking and investment, which in turn imply low income and high
real interest rates in the future. The expectation of low economic activity is thus partly or fully


                                                        9
self-fulfilling. In Angeletos and Calvet (2003), we highlighted how this positive feedback between
future and current investment can increase the persistence of the transitional dynamics. We will
see below that this complementarity, coupled with the precautionary motive, may also generate
multiple growth paths and steady states.
       We finally note that although the production function F (k) is strictly concave, the risk-adjusted
output G(k, a, σ) need not be concave in k when σ A > 0. The function G, however, is single-peaked
under the following condition.

Assumption 1 One of the following conditions holds: (i) The function F (k)2 is strictly convex;
(ii) There is no idiosyncratic depreciation risk and ρ ≥ 1 − δ.

We then easily show

Lemma 2 The optimal capital stock kth is the unique solution to FOC condition (14).


3.3       Equilibrium Analysis

Equilibrium paths can be calculated by a backward recursion. To simplify the discussion, we now
specialize to a stationary economy, in which residual standard deviations are constant through time:
σ t = (σ A , σ δ, , σ e ) for all t. Consider the macroeconomic vector xt = (at , Ct , Wt , Kt , St , Rt ) and the
reduced vector zt = (at , Ct , Wt ). We easily show

Lemma 3 For any zt+1 ∈ (0, 1] × R × [e, +∞), there exists a unique macroeconomic vector xt ∈
(0, 1) × R2 × R3+ satisfying the equilibrium recursion (9) − (13).

                                        e t+1 ) and
This property defines the mappings xt = H(z

                                                    zt = H(zt+1 ).                                               (15)

The equilibrium dynamics are thus fully characterized by the three-dimensional vector zt .8
       The equilibrium calculation is similar to the method used for the complete-market Ramsey
model. At terminal date T , individuals consume all their wealth, which implies the terminal
conditions aT = 1 and CT = WT . The initial wealth level provides the third boundary condition:
W0 = W 0 . For any choice of WT ∈ [e, +∞), we can define zT = (1, WT , WT ) and recursively
calculate the path zt = H(zt+1 ). Note that the condition Wt+1 ∈ [e, +∞) does not guarantee that
Wt ∈ [e, +∞). Some terminal wealth levels imply that Wt < e and the algorithm stops at some
instant t > 0. Other values WT generate an entire path {zt }Tt=0 , leading to initial wealth level
   8
       The dimensionality of the equilibrium dynamics is determined by the financial structure and the productivity of
capital. More specifically, our model reduces to: a two-dimensional system in (Ct , Wt ) when A > 0 and markets are
complete; a one-dimensional system in at when agents do not produce (A = 0, δ = 1, ρ = 0, σ A = σ δ = 0).


                                                           10
W0 . The recursion thus defines a function W0 (WT ), whose domain is a subset of [e, +∞). Since the
initial wealth W 0 is exogenous, an equilibrium corresponds to a terminal wealth level WT such that
W0 (WT ) = W 0 .
       In the Appendix, we extend the function W0 (·) to a continuous mapping defined on [e, ∞), and
examine its behavior when WT → e and WT → +∞. It is then easy to prove that W0 (WT ) = W 0
admits at least one solution for any W 0 .

Proposition 2 There exists an equilibrium in any finite-horizon economy.

We now investigate the properties of equilibrium paths.


3.4       Finite-Horizon Growth Paths

When uninsurable risks are relatively small, we may expect that the GEI equilibrium remains
close to the complete-market growth path. In fact, the GEI growth path combines two features:
a turnpike property and a strong precautionary eﬀect around the terminal date, as illustrated in
Figure 1A.9 Starting from a low capital stock, the economy accumulates wealth and remains many
periods in the neighborhood of the GEI steady state.10 This is evident in Figure 1B, which plots
equilibrium wealth normalized to its steady-state level. In the traditional Ramsey model, aggregate
wealth progressively decreases around the terminal date T . Under incomplete markets, however,
individuals have a very strong precautionary motive in later periods, because shocks around T
cannot be easily smoothed by borrowing and lending. As a result, aggregate wealth overshoots
the steady state before being consumed in the very last periods. Note that the large accumulation
of wealth is financed by a reduction of consumption and an increase in productive investment
some periods before the terminal date. These results thus contrast with finite-horizon complete
market dynamics, in which the capital stock never exceeds its steady-state level in an initially poor
economy.
       When markets are very incomplete, the growth paths of the economy can be startlingly diﬀerent
than in the traditional Ramsey model. The diﬀerences originate in nonmonotonicities embedded
in the equilibrium recursion. Consider for instance the impact of a higher future wealth level
Wt+1 in the absence of storage.11 Higher wealth next period requires higher current investment
Kt = Φ−1 (Wt+1 ) and a lower interest rate Rt , leading to an increase in the component − ln(βRt )/Γ
of current consumption:
                                                       £                               ¤
                        Ct = Ct+1 − ln(βRt )/Γ − Γa2t+1 F (Kt )2 σ 2A + Kt2 σ 2δ + σ 2e /2.                 (16)
   9
       The economy in Figure 1 is specified by the Cobb-Douglas production function F (k) = kα and the parameters
Γ = 10, A = 1, α = 0.4, β = 0.95, δ = 0.05, ρ = 1 − δ, e = 0, σ A = 0.5, σ δ = 0, σ e = 0, T = 1000.
  10
     We discuss the steady state of the infinite-horizon economy in the next section.
  11                                                   ∗
     The analysis corresponds to the case Wt+1 < Wt+1    , as defined in the proof of Lemma 3.


                                                          11
Under complete markets, this is the only eﬀect. Current consumption Ct and wealth Wt = Ct + Kt
are increasing functions of future wealth Wt+1 . The function W0 (·) monotonically increases in
WT and there exists a unique equilibrium growth path. More generally, we show in the Appendix
that the monotonicity of W0 (·) and thus equilibrium uniqueness also hold in economies with only
endowment shocks (σ e ≥ 0, σ A = σ δ = 0).
       With uninsurable production risks, however, the equilibrium recursion need not be monotonic.
High output next period requires a high level of capital investment Kt and therefore high individual
risk-taking in the current period. Agents then have a strong precautionary motive, which implies
a large risk adjustment F (Kt )2 σ 2A + Kt2 σ 2δ and a possible reduction of current consumption in
equation (16). As a result, consumption Ct and wealth Wt = Ct + Kt can be decreasing functions
of future wealth Wt+1 . The anticipation of high wealth in the future may thus imply a precautionary
reduction in current consumption and wealth. In other words, the interaction of investment risk
with the precautionary motive can generate a negative feedback between future and current wealth.
       The non-monotonicities generated by productivity shocks have two possible implications: mul-
tiple equilibria and complicated dynamics, which we successively examine.

Proposition 3 There robustly exist multiple equilibrium paths in some finite-horizon economies
with idiosyncratic production risks. In contrast, equilibrium is unique in any economy with either
complete markets or only endowment risks.

Figure 2 illustrates the function W0 (WT ) for appropriate values of the economy’s parameters.12
Given an initial wealth level W 0 , agents can coordinate on several paths. For instance, they can
choose a high level of risky investment, and low consumption for precautionary reasons. Conversely,
they can coordinate on low investment, which is matched by weak precautionary savings and
high consumption. Under uninsurable production risks, two economies with identical technologies,
preferences and financial structures can thus coordinate on diﬀerent paths of capital accumulation,
savings and interest rates.
       Complicated dynamics can also arise. To simplify the discussion, we consider an economy with
a single equilibrium. The unique growth path illustrated in Figure 3 displays large endogenous
fluctuations. The graph illustrates the kind of complex dynamics that the introduction of incomplete
markets may generate in an otherwise standard neoclassical economy. Such behaviors do not
necessarily require a high degree of impatience. For instance in Figure 3, we obtain endogenous
fluctuations along the unique equilibrium path with a high discount factor (β = 0.99) and a low rate
of capital depreciation (δ = 0.1).13 Large undiversifiable production risk thus generates endogenous
  12
       The economy in Figure 2 is specified by the Cobb-Douglas production function F (k) = kα and the parameters
Γ = 10, A = 10, α = 0.35, β = 0.9, δ = 0.5, ρ = 1 − δ, e = 0, σ A = 100, σ δ = 0, σ e = 0, T = 40.
  13
     We also assume in Figure 3 that Γ = 1.625, A = 10, α = 0.55, ρ = 0.3, e = 0, σA = 50, σ δ = 0, σ e = 0, T = 50.


                                                         12
fluctuations with more patient agents than in earlier models considered in the literature. We also
observe in Figure 3 that the interest rate frequently reaches the lower bound imposed by the storage
technology. Thus, storage does not preclude the existence of endogenous fluctuations, but dampens
variations in the interest rate and macroeconomic aggregates.
    Overall, the analysis of the finite-horizon economy illustrates the strong distinction between
idiosyncratic endowment and productivity shocks. When investors receive only endowment shocks,
the equilibrium recursion is monotonic and there exists a unique growth path. On the other hand,
the presence of undiversifiable productivity shocks generates non-monotonicities, multiple equilibria
and endogenous cycles. Note, however, that large idiosyncratic risks seem to be required for such
complicated dynamics. This suggests that when building macroeconomic models, investment risk
should probably be used in combination with traditional sources of endogenous fluctuations.


4     Equilibrium with Infinite Horizon

4.1   Decision Theory and Equilibrium

Given a deterministic sequence of asset prices {π t }+∞
                                                     t=0 , we calculate the optimal decision of an
individual investor h by taking the pointwise limit of the finite horizon problem. Specifically
                          P+∞
in every period, let Πt =    s=t+1 1/(Rt ..Rs−1 ) denote the exogenous price of a perpetuity and
at = (1 + Πt )−1 the implied marginal propensity to consume. We also consider the solution kth to
equation (14), the variables Mth defined by (5), and
                                        Ã         +∞
                                                                    !
                                                  X        Msh
                                 h          h
                                bt = at Mt +                            .                            (17)
                                                        R ...Rs−1
                                                   s=t+1 t

The convergence of the series at and bht is guaranteed by the following suﬃcient conditions:

Assumption 2. The sequences {π t }+∞         +∞           +∞
                                  t=0 , {Rt }t=0 and {Πt }t=0 are bounded.


We can then show

Lemma 4 Under Assumption [2], the value function belongs to the CARA class every period:
J h (W, t) = −(Γat )−1 exp[−Γ(at W + bht )], and the consumption-portfolio decision satisfies (7).

Since the optimal decision is the limit of the finite horizon problem, Ponzi schemes are ruled out
in the strongest conceivable way, along any possible path.
    As in the finite-horizon case, we focus on GEI equilibria in which asset prices are deterministic,
there is no risk premium, capital investment is identical across agents, and Assumption [2] holds. It
is then straightforward to show that the vector zt = (at , Ct , Wt ) satisfies the recursion zt = H(zt+1 )


                                                   13
in every period. Furthermore, Assumption [2] implies that at = 1/(1 + Πt ) is bounded away from
0.
     Conversely, consider a sequence {zt }∞
                                          t=0 satisfying equilibrium recursion (15) and the condition
inf t at > 0. The perpetuity price Πt = 1/at − 1, the corresponding interest rate Rt and the price
sequence π t = (1/Rt , 0, ..0) are bounded across t. By Lemma 4, each agent has a unique optimal
plan and markets clear in every date-event. This establishes

Proposition 4 Any sequence {zt } satisfying the condition inf t at > 0 and the recursion zt =
H(zt+1 ) defines a GEI equilibrium.

We henceforth focus on infinite horizon paths with these properties.


4.2    Steady State

A steady state is a fixed point of the recursion mapping H. By Assumption [2], the perpetuity has
a finite price Π∞ every period. The net interest rate r∞ is therefore positive, and the gross rate
is larger than unity: R∞ = 1 + r∞ > 1. Since storage has a lower rate of return (ρ ≤ 1 < R∞ ),
agents never allocate their savings to this low-yield technology: S∞ = 0. The marginal propensity
                                 −1 . It is then easy to show
to consume is given by a∞ = 1 − R∞

Proposition 5 In a steady state, the interest rate and capital stock satisfy
                                      £                            ¤
            ln(R∞ β) = −Γ2 (1 − R∞
                                 −1 2
                                   ) F (K∞ )2 σ 2A + K∞ 2 2
                                                         σ δ + σ 2e /2                           (18)
                                                       £                               ¤
                R∞ = 1 − δ + AF 0 (K∞ ) − Γ(1 − R∞ −1
                                                      ) F 0 (K∞ )F (K∞ )σ 2A + K∞ σ 2δ           (19)

The first equation corresponds to the stationary Euler condition for consumption, and the second
to the optimality of capital investment. We note that R∞ ≤ 1/β, and that the upper bound
1/β is reached when markets are complete. This result is a possible solution to the low risk-free
rate puzzle, as has been extensively discussed in the literature (e.g. Weil, 1992; Aiyagari, 1994;
Constantinides and Duﬃe, 1996; Heaton and Lucas, 1996).
     The closed-form system (18) − (19) allows us to conveniently analyze existence, multiplicity
and comparative statics. We observe that equations (18) and (19) define two weakly decreasing
functions R1 (K) and R2 (K), which intersect at a steady state. A continuity argument implies

Proposition 6 There exists a steady state in every infinite-horizon economy.

We now turn to comparative statics. As can be seen in equation (18), the idiosyncratic risks σ e , σ A
and σ δ all increase the precautionary demand for savings, which tends to reduce the interest rate
and increase capital investment. The capital stock K∞ therefore increases with the endowment


                                                  14
risk σ e , as in Aiyagari (1994). We note, however, that uninsurable technological shocks σ A and σ δ
also reduce the risk-adjusted return to investment and can thus discourage capital accumulation.
While better insurance against endowment risk always reduces output through the precautionary
eﬀect, aggregate activity may actually be increased by new instruments for hedging technological
risks. These conflicting eﬀects lead in some cases to a non-monotonic relation between capital and
idiosyncratic technological shocks, as can be checked numerically.
       The steady state is unique when markets are complete, or more generally when agents are
exposed only to uninsurable endowment shocks (σ e ≥ 0, σ A = σ δ = 0).14 We prove this property
by observing that Euler equation (18) is then independent of the capital stock and implies a unique
real interest rate R∞ . In the presence of productivity shocks, however, productive investment aﬀects
Euler equation (18). The functions R1 (K) and R2 (K) are then both strictly decreasing in K, and
multiple steady states can arise.15

Proposition 7 There robustly exists a multiplicity of steady states in some economies with unin-
surable production risks. In contrast, the steady state is unique in economies with either complete
markets or only endowment risk.

While the wealth eﬀects considered in earlier work (e.g. Banerjee and Newman, 1991; Galor and
Zeira, 1993) play no role in our model, Proposition 7 shows that the interaction between the bond
market and idiosyncratic production risk is a possible source of poverty traps. In an economy with
a low capital stock K∞ , agents have a weak precautionary motive and the equilibrium interest rate
is high, as seen in (18). By investment equation (19), the low capital stock is also consistent with
high marginal productivity and interest rate. The economy is thus stuck at a low wealth level as
agents coordinate on a large real interest rate on the bond market.
       The multiplicity of steady states can be viewed as a natural consequence of the dynamic com-
plementarity in investment discussed in Section 3.2. When low investment K∞ and high interest
rate R∞ are anticipated in future periods, investors are unwilling to make a large risky investment
in the present. This implies in turn a high marginal productivity of capital, low precautionary
savings and thus a high interest rate in the current period. This type of positive feedback nat-
urally generates multiple equilibria, as has been emphasized in the literature on macroeconomic
complementarities. Proposition 7 establishes that the complementarity between future and current
investment can impact the number of steady states. It can also aﬀect the local dynamics, as is now
discussed.
  14
       Note that the uniqueness of the steady state is specific to the the pure endowment version of our model. In
general Bewley economies, multiple steady states can arise from the nonmonotonic impact of the interest rate on the
aggregate demand for the bond (e.g. Aiyagari, 1994).
  15
     It is easy to show that the number of steady states is generically odd.



                                                          15
4.3       Local Dynamics

The local dynamics around the steady state can be examined by linearizing the recursion mapping.
Wealth Wt is the only predetermined variable in the model, while consumption and marginal
propensity are free to adjust. When markets are complete, the stable manifold has dimension 1,
the system is determined, and the economy converges monotonically to a unique steady state. None
of these results need hold under incomplete markets.
       We begin by considering economies with a single steady state.

Proposition 8 When the steady state is unique, it is either locally determined or locally undeter-
mined depending on the economy’s parameters.

We show this property by computing numerically the eigenvalues of the linearized system in some
examples. A continuum of equilibria is obtained in an economy with patients agents (e.g. β =
0.95) and large idiosyncratic production risk. Note that it is not easy to rule out this form of
indeterminacy, because there is no obvious focal equilibrium on which agents can coordinate.
       We provide in the Appendix an example of a supercritical flip bifurcation as σ A increases. This
result is obtained in a class of economies with fixed psychological discount factor β = 0.95. We infer
that cycles of period 2 exist on an open set of economies.

Proposition 9 Some economies robustly contain attracting cycles.

These cycles arise with reasonably patient investors, but their existence appears to require high
levels of idiosyncratic production risk.
       Slightly diﬀerent results are obtained in economies with only undiversifiable endowment risk
(σ e > 0, σ A = σ δ = 0). Let β ∗ = 1/e ≈ 0.368. We show in the Appendix that the unique steady
state is locally determined whenever the discount factor β is larger than β ∗ . Uninsurable investment
risk is thus indispensable to obtain indeterminacy and cycles with very patient agents.16 Consistent
with the analysis of Section 3, these findings also suggest that idiosyncratic production shocks may
help to generate cycles under less heavy discounting than is required in nonconvex complete-market
growth economies (Boldrin and Montrucchio, 1986; Deneckere and Pelikan, 1986; Sorger, 1992).
       We now examine economies with multiple steady states. The Appendix provides an example
with three equilibria, in which the two extreme steady states (lowest and highest W∞ ) are locally
unique and the middle one is totally unstable.

Proposition 10 When there are multiple steady states, some can be totally unstable.
  16
       When β → 0, indeterminacy and cycles are obtained in any economy with fixed production function F and
parameters Γ, A, F, δ, ρ, σ A = σ δ = 0, σ e > 0. This result is consistent with the indeterminacy obtained in Calvet
(2001) for exchange economies with suﬃcient impatience and large uninsurable endowment shocks.


                                                         16
Several mechanisms help to explain the rich local properties uncovered in this subsection. First,
idiosyncratic production risks induce a dynamic complementarity between future and current in-
vestment. Second, we showed in Section 3.3 that endogenous fluctuations can arise from a negative
precautionary feedback between future and current wealth. While a precise decomposition is un-
available for our nonlinear system, we conjecture that both eﬀects contribute to indeterminacy in
infinite horizon economies. Intuition suggests that the negative feedback also helps to generate en-
dogenous cycles, while complementarities in investment induce multiple steady states. We observe
that uninsurable production risk is in any case crucial to obtain the negative feedback and dynamic
complementarity, and thus the rich dynamics, along the infinite-horizon growth paths.


5     Extensions
We now show that our framework remains tractable under multiple capital types and sectors.


5.1   Physical and Human Capital

We consider a one-sector economy with two types of capital, and investigate the impact of specific
idiosyncratic risks on investment and production eﬃciency. To simplify notation, the bond is the
only traded asset and there is no exogenous endowment or storage. Let k and x respectively denote
the stocks of physical and human capital. The output of agent h is given by

                        h
                       yt+1 = Aht+1 F (kth , xht ) + (1 − δ hk,t+1 )kth + (1 − δ hx,t+1 )xht ,

where δ hk,t+1 and δ hx,t+1 are the stochastic depreciation rates on each capital type. The agent satisfies
the budget constraints

                   cht + kth + xht + θht /Rt = wth ,
                    h
                   wt+1 = Aht+1 F (kth , xht ) + (1 − δ hk,t+1 )kth + (1 − δ hx,t+1 )xht + θht ,

where θht denotes bond holdings in period t.
    Agents have identical CARA preferences and are exposed to idiosyncratic shocks

                                          (Aht , δ hkt , δ hxt ) ∼ N (1, Σ) ,

where 1 = (1, 1, 1)0 and                          ⎡                       ⎤
                                                      σ 2A        0   0
                                              ⎢                            ⎥
                                           Σ =⎢
                                              ⎣ 0             σ 2k     0 ⎥ ⎦.
                                                       0          0   σ 2x
The coeﬃcient σ A specifies the idiosyncratic productivity risk common to both types of capital,
whereas σ k and σ x quantify specific depreciation shocks.

                                                             17
   We focus on equilibrium paths along which capital investment is identical across agents and
macroeconomic aggregates are deterministic. Risk-adjusted output is defined as:
                                           Γa h                                  i
                  G (k, x, a) ≡ F (k, x) −     F (k, x)2 σ 2A + k2 σ 2k + x2 σ 2x .
                                            2
We easily check that the optimal individual decision (Kt , Xt ) maximizes G (k, x, at+1 ) − Rt (k + x).
The risk-adjusted returns to physical and human investment are therefore equated: Gk = Gx = Rt ,
implying
                                                           Γat+1 (σ 2x Xt − σ 2k Kt )
                        Fx (Kt , Xt ) − Fk (Kt , Xt ) =                               .           (20)
                                                          1 − Γat+1 σ 2A F (Kt , Xt )
Undiversifiable depreciation risk can thus create a wedge between the marginal productivities of
physical and human capital (Fk 6= Fx ). The allocation of savings is then ineﬃcient, in the sense
that decentralized production plans do not maximize aggregate output for a given level of savings:

                        (Kt , Xt ) ∈
                                   / arg max {F (k, x) s.t. k + x = Kt + Xt } .
                                          (k,x)

   To provide additional intuition, consider a Cobb-Douglas production function F (k, x) = k α xη ,
where α > 0, η > 0 and α + η < 1. The first-best (complete-market) allocation of savings is
characterized by the relation Xt /Kt = η/α. We can then show that under incomplete markets,
                                  p
Proposition 11 If σ k /σ x 6=      η/α, the equilibrium allocation of savings is ineﬃcient:

                        F (Kt , Xt ) < max {F (k, x) s.t. k + x = Kt + Xt } .
                                        (k,x)
                                                          p
In particular, Xt /Kt < η/α if and only if σ k /σ x <      η/α.

The allocation of savings remains eﬃcient under incomplete markets only if the type-specific risks
                                            p
are “balanced”, in the sense that σ k /σ x = η/α. In an arbitrary economy, an increase in σ k
generally shifts savings from physical to human capital. The eﬀect on overall productivity then
                                                                      p
depends on the relative magnitude of depreciation risks. If σ k /σ x < η/α, an increase in σ k will
actually increase investment eﬃciency and output for any level of savings, whereas an increase in
σ x will decrease productivity.
   This simple model of human capital thus confirms and extends the analysis conducted by Krebs
(2003) in the context of endogenous growth. While Krebs considers only idiosyncratic shocks to
human capital depreciation, our framework includes shocks to overall individual productivity and
to the specific depreciation rates of each type of capital. This may be a useful extension, since
the relative importance of undiversifiable shocks to human and physical capital remains an open
empirical question. From a theoretical perspective, our model also suggests that capital-specific
incompleteness may substantially influence the macroeconomic impact of financial innovation.


                                                    18
5.2       Multiple Sectors

Our benchmark model easily extends to a neoclassical economy with a single good and multiple
technologies j ∈ {1, ..., J}. As in the previous example, we simplify notation by assuming that the
average depreciation rate is equal to unity, the endowment shock is zero, there is no storage, and
                                                                  h units in technology j in period
the riskless bond is the only traded asset. When agent h invests kj,t
t, she obtains next period the random output
                                                  h
                                                 yj,t+1 = Ahj,t+1 Fj (kj,t
                                                                       h
                                                                           ),

where Ahj,t+1 is an idiosyncratic technology-specific shock and Fj is a production function satisfying
the Inada conditions. The budget constraints are then given by
                                    Pj             h
                              cht +          h
                                       j=1 kt + θ t /Rt = wt ,
                                                                    h

                                h

       Consider the risk-adjusted output of technology j:

We easily show that the optimal capital stock kj,t          j     t+1 ) − Rt k. The first-order
condition is then
                                    ∂Gj
                                         (Kj,t , at+1 ) = Rt .
                                     ∂k
Agents equate the interest rate with the risk-adjusted return to capital in every sector. As a
result, the cross-sectoral allocation of capital does not maximize aggregate output given the level
of savings.

Proposition 12 The allocation of capital is generically ineﬃcient: for almost every Σ, the indi-
vidual plan (Kj,t )1≤j≤J satisfies

       For instance if J = 2, σ 1 > 0 and σ 2 = 0, we can interpret sector 1 as private equity and sector 2 as public equity.


                                                                    19
    As an example, let F1 = F2 = ... = FJ . Aggregate output is then maximized if and only if
capital is allocated equally across sectors. This is obtained under incomplete markets if and only
if σ 1 = σ 2 = ... = σ J . If instead risks are asymmetric across sectors, the allocation of capital is
biased towards the least risky sectors. In our benchmark one-sector model, incomplete markets
induce lower income and savings because production risk discourages capital accumulation. With
multiple sectors, the allocation of any given amount of capital is also ineﬃcient and can further
reduce aggregate output.


6    Conclusion
This paper investigates a missing market economy with decentralized production and idiosyncratic
technological risk. Agents are unconstrained in their borrowing and lending, and incomplete risk-
sharing is the only source of market imperfection. Macroeconomic aggregates and financial prices
are deterministic but can follow complicated dynamics and cycles even when agents are very pa-
tient. The results illustrate that endowment and productivity shocks can have profoundly diﬀerent
implications for aggregate dynamics. Investment risk thus appears to be a promising new direction
for business cycle research. In multisector settings, cyclical variations in sectoral risks may also
lead to cyclical variations in the cross-sectoral allocation of resources and thus further amplify the
business cycle. We leave the further examination of these issues for future research.

Appendix

Proof of Lemma 1

We establish the lemma by a backward recursion. The results trivially hold at terminal date T .
We now assume that the lemma has been proven for dates t + 1, t + 2,..., T, and seek to show that
it also holds at date t. An entrepreneur chooses consumption cht , capital expenditure kth , storage
sht and asset holdings θht that maximize
                              h                                                                     i

subject to the budget equality cht + kth + sht + π t · θht = wth , and the non-negativity constraints:
kth ≥ 0, sht ≥ 0. The agent never uses storage if Rt > ρ, and is indiﬀerent between investing in
                                                                                h
storage and investing in the bond if Rt = ρ. It is then convenient to consider b
                                                                               θ = ρsh + θh .               0,t     t       0,t
    The solution to the Bellman equation is simplified by the following observations. Since                                    h
                                                                                                                            wt+1   is

thus reduces to maximizing

    We begin by considering the demand for risky assets. Conditional on productive investment
and consumption, the optimal portfolio maximizes

The solution to this mean-variance problem is thus
                                              h,t             h,t h

The agent fully hedges the endowment and productivity shocks, and takes a net position in risky
assets to take advantage of possible risk premia. We plug asset holdings into (2) and infer that
future wealth satisfies

                                                               21
    We now consider the optimal level of productive investment. Substitute next-period wealth (22)
into the objective function:
                   "                            P              h,t             h,t h
                                                                                                      #
         h           G(kth , at+1 , σ t+1 ) + Rt N                     h                  h,t
                                                  n=1 π n,t [β A,n F (kt ) − β δ,n kt + β e,n ]
      u(ct ) + β J                                             Rt2 PN                           ;t + 1 .   (23)

                                                                       n=1 π n,t

The optimal level of productive investment therefore maximizes the criterion (6). Since F 0 (0) =
                                   P       h,t
+∞, we infer that kth > 0 if A + Rt Nn=1 β A,n π n,t > 0.
    We finally turn to optimal consumption. We diﬀerentiate equation (23), take logs and infer that
consumption is a linear function of wealth: cht = at wth + bht , with slope at and intercept bht given by
(3) and (4). The consumption-investment plan satisfies the Euler equation u0 (ct ) = βRt Et u0 (ct+1 ).
                                                                                P
Since u0 = −Γu, we infer that u(ct ) = βRt Et u(ct+1 ). Hence J h (W, t) ≡ E0 Ts=t β s u(cs ) = (1 +
                                                      £               ¤
Πt )u(ct ), or equivalently J h (W, t) ≡ −(Γat )−1 exp −Γ(at W + bht ) . We conclude that the lemma
holds in period t.


Proof of Proposition 1

We show the theorem by a backward recursion. At date t = T , agents have identical propensities
aT = 1 and make no risky investment: kTh = 0. Assume now that the properties of the theorem
hold at instants t + 1, .., T. Step 1 shows that when there is only one type of technological risk, the
risk premium is necessarily zero in any finite-horizon equilibrium. Step 2 derives the equilibrium
conditions for all economies.

Step 1. Assume that agents are exposed to shocks to total productivity Aht+1 but not to the
depreciation rate δ ht+1 . It is convenient to define the truncated price vector π
                                                                                 bt = (π n,t )N
                                                                                              n=1 and the
                                                                                          PH
individual vectors β A = (β A,n )n=1 . Since there is no aggregate shock, we know that h=1 β h,t
                      h,t        h,t N
                                                                                                   A =0
              PH              h,t
and therefore h=1 π    bt · β A = 0. Without loss of generality, we index households so that

                        bt · β 1,t
                        π                bt · β L,t
                               A ≥ ... ≥ π           bt · β L+1,t

                              Γ     2
Aggregation of this relation then yields equation (12).


Proof of Lemma 2

The objective function G(k, at+1 , σ t+1 ) − Rt k is conveniently rewritten as

               AF (k) + (1 − δ − Rt )k + e − Γat+1 [F (k)2 σ 2A,t+1 + k2 σ 2δ,t+1 + σ 2e,t+1 ]/2.      (24)

The condition F 0 (0) = +∞ implies that the optimal capital stock is strictly positive.

Condition (i). The objective function is strictly concave in k, and diverges to −∞ as k → +∞.
The optimal capital stock is finite, and FOC (14) has a unique solution.

Condition (ii). Since Rt ≥ ρ ≥ 1 − δ, the objective function (24) diverges to −∞ as k → +∞, and
the optimal capital stock is finite. Let k0 = F −1 [A/(Γat+1 σ 2A )]. The function Gk (k, at+1 , σ t+1 ) =
F 0 (k)[A − Γat+1 F (k)σ 2A,t+1 ] + 1 − δ is decreasing and larger than 1 − δ when k ∈ (0, k0 ], and is
strictly smaller than 1 − δ on [k0 , +∞). We conclude that the equation Gk (k, at+1 , σ t+1 ) = Rt has
a unique solution.


Proof of Lemma 3

Let Kt∗ = min {k : Gk (k, at+1 , σ t+1 ) = ρ} and Wt+1
                                                   ∗ = Φ(K ∗ ). Any solution x can be calculated by
                                                          t                   t
                                ∗ , equations (9) and (10) imply that K = Φ−1 (W
following procedure. If Wt+1 < Wt+1                                    t        t+1 ), St = 0,
                                                                   ∗ , we infer from (9) and (10)
and Rt = Gk (Kt , at+1 , σ t+1 ) > ρ. On the other hand if Wt+1 ≥ Wt+1


                                                        23
that Rt = ρ, Kt = Kt∗ , and St = [Wt+1 − Φ(Kt )]/ρ. Equations (11) − (13) then assign unique values
to at , Ct and Wt . Finally, we observe that (at , Kt , St , Rt ) ∈ (0, 1) × R∗+ × R+ × [ρ, +∞), while no
simple restrictions seem to be imposed on current consumption and wealth.


Proof of Proposition 2

Consider a ∈ R and the mapping
                         (
                           W0 (WT ) if W0 (WT ) is defined and larger than a,
                ϕ(WT ) =
                           a        otherwise.

Since ϕ is continuous on its domain [e, +∞), its image is an interval of the real line. When WT → e,
productive investment KT −1 and ST −1 decline to zero, implying that RT −1 → +∞, aT −1 → 1,
CT −1 → −∞, WT −1 → −∞, and ϕ(e) = a. On the other hand when WT → +∞, we observe that
Rt = ρ for all t and ϕ(WT ) → +∞. This establishes that ϕ[e, +∞) = [a, +∞). Since the argument
applies to any choice of a, we conclude that ϕ(WT ) = W0 has a solution for any W0 ∈ R.


Proof of Proposition 3

Consider an economy with only undiversifiable endowment shocks (σ e ≥ 0 and σ A = σ δ = 0). We
establish the strict monotonicity of W0 (·) and thus equilibrium uniqueness by recursively showing
the following

Property. The wealth function Wt (WT ) is strictly increasing in WT . Mean consumption Ct (WT ),
productive investment Kt (KT ) and storage St (ST ) are weakly increasing in WT , while marginal
propensity at (WT ) and the interest rate Rt (WT ) are weakly decreasing.

The statement is true for t = T. Assume that it is true for period t. In the absence of storage, the
capital stock Kt−1 = Φ−1 (Wt ) locally increases with future wealth Wt and thus terminal wealth
WT ; the interest rate Rt−1 = Φ0 (Kt−1 ) is decreasing in Kt−1 and thus in WT . In the presence of
storage, the safe investment St−1 locally increases in Wt while Rt−1 and Kt−1 are locally constant.
In either case, Kt−1 + St−1 strictly increases with WT . Since at and Rt−1 are both decreasing in
WT , we infer that at−1 = 1/[1 + (at Rt−1 )−1 ] is decreasing as well. Consumption

                                 Ct−1 = Ct − ln(βRt−1 )/Γ − Γa2t σ 2e /2

is therefore increasing in WT . We conclude that Wt−1 = Ct−1 + Kt−1 + St−1 strictly increases with
the terminal wealth level WT .




                                                   24
Proof of Lemma 4

We begin by checking the convergence of the series (17) defining bht . By Assumption [2], the se-
quences {at }∞            ∞
             t=0 and {Rt }t=0 are contained in compact intervals of the form [a, 1] and [R, R], where
a > 0 and R > 0. It follows that the sequences {kth }∞         h ∞
                                                     t=0 and {Mt }t=0 are bounded. The determin-
istic sequence {bht }∞
                     t=0 is thus well-defined and bounded.
     We easily check that the consumption-investment plan defined by (7) satisfies the Euler equation
u0 (ct )
      = βRt Et u0 (ct+1 ). Since u0 = −Γu, we infer that u(ct ) = βRt Et u(ct+1 ). The candidate plan
                                        P
thus generates utility J h (W, 0) ≡ E0 ∞       t                                           h
                                          t=0 β u(ct ) = (1 + Π0 )u(c0 ), or equivalently J (W, 0) ≡
             £                  ¤
−(Γa0 )−1 exp −Γ(a0 W + bh0 ) .
     We must now verify that J h (W, 0) is indeed the value function. For a given W , consider
an admissible plan {c0t , kt0 , s0t , θ0t , Wt0 }∞                   0
                                                 t=0 that satisfies W0 = W and the transversality condition
limT →∞ β T E0 u(WT0 ) = 0. We know that

condition implies that β T E0 J h (WT0 , T ) = −(ΓaT )−1 β T E0 exp −Γ(aT WT0 + bhT ) converges to 0 as

for any admissible strategy, and conclude that J h (W, 0) is the value function.


Proof of Proposition 6

Letting ϕ(R) ≡ Γ−2 (1 − 1/R)−2 ln( Rβ
                                    1
                                      ), we rewrite system (18) − (19) as:
                                        £                            ¤
                                 ϕ(R) = F (K)2 σ 2A + K 2 σ 2δ + σ 2e /2                              (27)
                       ∙         µ      ¶      ¸      µ          ¶
                   0           2      1                        1
                  F (K) A − Γσ A 1 −      F (K) − Γ 1 −             Kσ 2δ + 1 − δ − R = 0.            (28)
                                      R                        R
The function ϕ(R) decreases on (1, 1/β] and satisfies ϕ(1, 1/β] = [0, +∞). Equation (27) thus defines
the decreasing function R1 (K), which maps [0, +∞) onto (1, ϕ−1 (σ 2E /2)]. Similarly, equation (28)
implicitly defines the decreasing function R2 (K) that maps (0, K ∗ ] onto [1, +∞), where K ∗ =
(F 0 )−1 (δ/A).

                                                              25
       Consider the function ∆(K) = R1 (K) − R2 (K). When K → 0, we observe that R1 (K) →
ϕ−1 (σ 2E /2), R2 (K) → +∞, and therefore ∆(K) → −∞. We also note that ∆(K ∗ ) = R1 (K ∗ ) − 1 >
0. The graphs of the functions R1 and R2 therefore intersect and there exists at least one steady
state.
       Finally, we analyze the monotonicity of the steady state with respect to the economy’s parame-
ters. We consider the case |R20 (K∞ )| > |R10 (K∞ )|. An increase in σ e or β pushes down the function
R1 (K) and leaves the function R2 (K) unchanged. The steady state is therefore characterized by
a lower interest rate and a higher capital stock. Similarly, an increase in 1 − δ and A pushes up
R2 (K), also leading to a lower interest rate and a higher capital stock. We note that an increase
in Γ, σ A or σ δ pushes down both R1 (K) and R2 (K) and can have ambiguous eﬀects, as is verified
in simulations.


Proof of Proposition 7

It is enough to provide an example of multiplicity. We numerically check that there exist three
equilibria when Γ = 1.2, A = 20, α = 0.95, β = 0.05, δ = 0.5, σ A = 9, σ δ = 0, σ e = 0, e = 0.


Local Dynamics around the Steady State

There is no storage around the steady state. For computational simplicity, we focus on economies
without undiversifiable depreciation risk. The iterated function H is then implicitly defined by:

                            Kt    = Φ−1 (Wt+1 ),
                                             £                     ¤
                            Rt    = F 0 (Kt ) A − Γat+1 F (Kt )σ 2A + 1 − δ,
                            at    = 1/[1 + (at+1 Rt )−1 ],
                                                              £                    ¤
                            Ct    = Ct+1 − ln(βRt )/Γ − Γa2t+1 F (Kt )2 σ 2A + σ 2e /2,
                            Wt = Ct + Kt .

An increase in at+1 and Wt+1 leads to a decline in the current interest rate, which has a positive
eﬀect on current consumption. On the other hand, the increase in at+1 and Wt+1 implies that the
agent bears more risk between time t and time t + 1. The precautionary motive can then lead to a
decrease in current consumption and current wealth, which may generate endogenous fluctuations.
   The characteristic polynomial P (x) = det(∂H − xI) can be rewritten as

The roots of P are the eigenvalues of the backward dynamical system. Since P (−∞) = +∞ and
P (+∞) = −∞, there always exists a real eigenvalue. Simple calculation shows that P (1) > 0 if
and only if |R20 (K∞ )| > |R10 (K∞ )| . Thus when there is a unique steady state, the Jacobian matrix
∂H has an eigenvalue in (1, +∞), and the dimension of the stable manifold is at least 1.

This implies that x = β is an eigenvalue, which is contained in the interval (0, 1). We observe that
Q(0) > 0 and Q(1) < 0, and infer the polynomial Q has one root in the interval (0, 1) and one root

in (1, +∞). Overall, the Jacobian matrix ∂H has two eigenvalues in the interval (0, 1), and one
eigenvalue larger than 1. The stable manifold has thus dimension 1.

to characterize the other roots x2 and x3 . It is useful to observe that P (0) = R∞
   If the roots x2 and x3 are complex, we know that x3 = x̄2 . The relation P (0) = x1 |x2 |2 < 1
implies that |x2 | < 1. The economy is then stable and locally determined.
   If the roots x2 and x3 are real, the inequalities x1 > 1 and x1 x2 x3 = P (0) > 0 implies that
x2 and x3 have the same sign. Furthermore since P (0) < 1, one of these roots is contained in the
interval (−1, 1). We assume without loss of generality that x2 ∈ (−1, 1). We can then consider two
cases:

   • If x2 and x3 are both positive, the inequalities P (0) > 0 and P (1) > 0 imposes that x2 , x3 ∈
         (0, 1). The steady state is stable and locally determined.

   • If on the other hand x2 and x3 are both negative, we know that x3 > −1 if and only if
         P (−1) > 0. Since ln(R∞ β) = −Γ2 (1 − R∞

         Let β ∗ = 1/e ≈ 0.368. Any economy with β ≥ β ∗ has a locally determined steady state.
         When agents only face uninsurable endowment shocks, it is thus impossible to obtain local
         indeterminacy and flip bifurcations with patient agents (i.e. with β ≥ β ∗ ).

   Conversely, we can easily show that indeterminacy can arise in economies with suﬃcient im-
patience and large uninsurable shocks. When σ e → +∞, the steady state satisfies R∞ → 1,

K∞ → (F 0 )−1 (δ/A) and Γ2 a2∞ σ 2e → 2 ln(1/β). The characteristic polynomial is then

We infer that P (−1) < 0 for a suﬃciently low value of β. This result is consistent with the
indeterminacy obtained in Calvet (2001) for exchange economies with suﬃcient impatience and
large uninsurable endowment shocks.

C. Uninsurable Productivity Shocks
Consider the parameter values: β = 0.95, Γ = 2, A = 10, α = 0.35, δ = 0.1, σ δ = 0, σ e = 0.
We check numerically that the steady state is unique and that the characteristic polynomial has
one eigenvalue x1 > 1 and two eigenvalues in the unit circle when σ A ≤ 30.5. On the other hand
when σ A = 31.5, the steady state remains unique but there is one eigenvalue in each of the interval
(−∞, −1), (−1, 1) and (1, +∞). This establishes Proposition 8. We also note that the system
undergoes a flip bifurcation as σ A varies between 30.5 and 31.5, which proves Proposition 9.
    Finally, consider the economy Γ = 1.2, A = 20, α = 0.95, β = 0.05, δ = 0.5, σ A = 9, σ e = 0,
σ δ = 0, e = 0 examined in the proof of Proposition 7. This economy has three steady states, and
it can be checked numerically that the steady state with the intermediate interest rate is totally
unstable, thus establishing Proposition 10.


Proof of Proposition 11

We know that Gk (Kt , Xt ) = Rt , we infer that Fx (Kt , Xt ) [1−Γat+1 σ 2A F (Kt , Xt )] = Rt +Γat+1 σ 2x Xt ,
which implies
                                           1 − Γat+1 σ 2A F (Kt , Xt ) > 0.

Equation (20) can be rewritten as
                        µ          ¶
                   α η     η     α                                    Γat+1

                          Xt Kt                               1 − Γat+1 σ 2A F (Kt , Xt )
                                               p
We consider parameters satisfying σ k /σ x < η/α, and assume that Xt /Kt ≥ η/α. The left-hand
side of (31) is weakly negative. On the other hand since Xt /Kt ≥ η/α > σ 2k /σ 2x , the right-hand
side of (31) is strictly positive - a contradiction. We conclude that Xt /Kt < η/α.


Proof of Proposition 12

The proposition is a direct application of Sard’s theorem. We assume for notational simplicity that
there are two sectors (J = 2). For a given sequence {Rt }∞           t=0 , consider the function
                                      ∙                                                                  ¸

            H(k1 , k2 ; σ 1 , σ 2 ) =       (k1 , σ 1 ) − Rt ;     (k2 , σ 2 ) − Rt ; F1 (k1 ) − F2 (k2 ) .
                                         ∂k                     ∂k

                                                           29
It is easy to check that the Jacobian matrix of H has rank 3 whenever H(k1 , k2 ; σ 1 , σ 2 ) = 0. We
conclude that the system H = 0 has no solution for almost every choice of (σ 1 , σ 2 ).

       We plot the time paths of wealth, interest rate, capital, storage, consumption and
       marginal propensity to consume for a finite-horizon economy (T = 1000) with
       uninsurable idiosyncratic production risk (σA > 0).

The figure plots ln(Wt / W), which quantifies the distance between the wealth Wt in
period t of a finite-horizon economy (T = 1000) and the steady-state level of wealth
W under infinite horizon (T = ). The economy is the same as in Figure 1A.

Multiple equilibria in a finite-horizon economy with idiosyncratic production risk and
patient agents (β = 0.9). The figure illustrates the non-monotonic relation between
initial and final wealth. For any given W0 ± [1,3], there are multiple WT corresponding
to different equilibrium paths.
