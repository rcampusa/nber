This paper explores the effects of labor and product market reforms in a New Keynesian, small open
economy model with labor market frictions and endogenous producer entry. We show that it takes
time for reforms to pay off, typically at least a couple of years. This is partly because the benefits materialize
through firm entry and increased hiring, both of which are gradual processes, while any reform-driven
layoffs are immediate. Some reforms—such as reductions in employment protection—increase unemployment
temporarily. Implementing a broad package of labor and product market reforms minimizes transition
costs. Importantly, reforms do not have noticeable deflationary effects, suggesting that the inability
of monetary policy to deliver large interest rate cuts in their aftermath—either because of the zero
bound on policy rates or because of membership in a monetary union—may not be a relevant obstacle
to reform. Alternative simple monetary policy rules do not have a large effect on transition costs.

1       Introduction

Calls for market reforms to improve economic performance have become a mantra in policy dis-
cussions. One only needs to read the transcripts of ECB President Mario Draghi’s speeches and
press conferences over the last three years or the statements of other European policymakers to
substantiate the point. Structural reforms appear to have become a crucial ingredient of the policy
menu at a time when the conventional tools of demand-side macroeconomic policy are constrained
and unconventional tools are being deployed without certainty of their eﬀectiveness. In the acad-
emic literature, a large body of economic theory points to long-term gains from reforms designed
to increase the flexibility of labor and product markets. However, most of this literature provides
insights into the long-term impact of such structural reforms from a static perspective.1 Much less
consensus exists on the short-run eﬀects and transition dynamics triggered by changes in product
and labor market regulation, leaving the issue of whether market reforms imply trading short-term
pain for long-term gains largely unsettled. Yet this issue bears major implications for the political
feasibility of reforms, as transition costs may be viewed by policymakers called upon to implement
reforms as a daunting obstacle to action.
        The nature of the short- and medium-term impact of reforms also matters for their desirability
in the context in which they are advocated now–where traditional, demand-side macroeconomic
policy cannot be used to smooth potential short-run costs and help front-load beneficial long-run
eﬀects. This issue is especially relevant at the current juncture, with monetary policies constrained
by the zero lower bound (ZLB) on interest rates and/or monetary union membership, and fiscal
policies tied by austerity requirements. With respect to monetary policy, a debate has emerged
recently in the literature as to whether a binding ZLB could exacerbate potential short-run costs of
reforms. According to this argument, in a ZLB situation, reform-driven shocks to current output
supply may lower prices, raise the real interest rate, and thereby depress rather than stimulate the
economy (a situation labelled the “paradox of toil” in Eggertsson, 2010). Eggertsson, Ferrero, and
Raﬀo (2014) build on this argument in their analysis of structural reforms and monetary policy in
Europe. On the other hand, market reforms may generate a positive wealth eﬀect on consumption
by increasing future income levels, and thereby stimulate current aggregate demand and output.
When the ZLB is binding, this wealth eﬀect should typically be larger as it is not dampened by
the increase in interest rates that would occur in “normal times” (Fernández-Villaverde, Guerrón-
    1
        For instance, this is the approach in an influential paper by Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003).

Quintana, and Rubio-Ramírez, 2011). Ultimately, the short-term impact of reforms, not only in
a ZLB situation but also more broadly, will depend inter alia on their impact on current versus
future supply and the implications for output gaps, prices, and real interest rates.
    A number of recent papers have used large-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
models to assess both the short- and long-run eﬀects of reforms (Everaert and Schule, 2008, using
the IMF’s Global Economy Model; Gomes et al., 2010, using the ECB’s EAGLE model; Hobza
and Mourre, 2010, and Arpaia et al., 2007, using the European Commission’s QUEST model).
Reforms appear to pay oﬀ only gradually–it typically takes several years for half of the long-term
eﬀects to materialize, depending on the model and the reform considered–and can even entail
short-run losses due to adverse demand or terms-of-trade eﬀects. However, these exercises diﬀer
with respect to which of labor or product market reforms are more likely to lead to short-term
losses. Labor market reforms are generally modeled to weaken the bargaining position of workers
and thereby initially reduce real wages. This stimulates labor demand but at the same time can
weaken consumer demand, especially if–as in an individual country within a monetary union–
monetary policy cannot react. Product market reforms are treated as reductions in price markups
that immediately raise real wages, and quickly stimulate output and employment–although some
of the associated income gain may be dampened by a decline in terms of trade associated with
increased supply of domestic goods. However, if carried out in a monetary union or if implemented
gradually, inducing households to expect lower prices in the future, they may raise the domestic
real interest rate and thereby reduce short-term consumption and output.2
    This paper studies the dynamic eﬀects of labor and product market reforms in a DSGE, New
Keynesian small open economy model that addresses two main weaknesses of the existing literature:
(i) Structural reforms of product and labor markets are modeled in a very stylized–“reduced-
form”–way, as exogenous reductions in price and wage markups; and (ii) the models are not
ideally suited to capture the full range of dynamic eﬀects of structural reforms as both firm and
labor market (hiring-firing) dynamics are absent. We address these shortcomings by modeling labor
and product market dynamics and the policy factors that drive them, building on the framework
developed by Cacciatore and Fiori (forthcoming). Our model integrates two leading frameworks
developed to study product and labor market dynamics: Endogenous variation of monopolistically
competitive producers subject to sunk entry costs builds on Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz (2012),

OECD countries over the last three decades, see Bouis et al. (2012).

while labor markets are characterized by search-and-matching frictions, with endogenous job cre-
ation and destruction, as in Diamond (1982a,b), Mortensen and Pissarides (1994), and den Haan,
Ramey, and Watson (2000). Nominal rigidity implies that the monetary policy regime matters for
the short-term consequences of market reforms. Deregulation of the product market reduces sunk
producer entry costs (by cutting “red tape”). Deregulation of labor markets lowers unemployment
benefits and employment protection (worker bargaining power and firing costs). We focus on a
small open economy scenario to capture the situation of weak Euro Area countries for which such
market reforms have been advocated to improve economic performance. In so doing, we contribute
to the debate on non-conventional policy instruments to boost economies out of persistent weak-
ness.3 A contribution of this paper relative to the existing literature is to consider a wider menu
of possible market reforms.
       We find that product market and labor market reforms have positive eﬀects on and consumption,
and also reduce unemployment, in the long run.4 However, it takes time for reforms to pay oﬀ in
terms of aggregate consumption and employment, typically at least a couple of years, consistent
with studies referred to above. This is partly because the benefits of reforms materialize through
firm entry or increased hiring, both of which are gradual processes, while any reform-driven layoﬀs
are immediate. The gains from product market reforms accrue more slowly than those from labor
market reforms, although they are also typically larger.
       Some reforms can entail transition costs, temporarily increasing unemployment–typically for
one to two years. In particular, employment protection reform initially increases layoﬀs more than
it creates jobs, and product market reform can also temporarily lead to net job destruction as
incumbent firms downsize, and reallocation of laid-oﬀ workers takes time. By contrast, cuts in
unemployment benefits or strengthening of activation policies (improvement of matching eﬃciency
in the labor market) quickly reduce unemployment as they stimulate hiring without aﬀecting firing.5
   3
      Andrés, Arce, and Thomas (2014) explore the role of structural reforms as an instrument to push economies
out of recession in the presence of debt deleveraging. Following Eggertsson, Ferrero, and Raﬀo (2014), they model
reforms as exogenous reductions in price and wage markups. Cacciatore, Fiori, and Ghironi (forthcoming, a) use a
model with product and labor market dynamics to study the consequences of market reforms for optimal monetary
policy in a two-country monetary union, and Cacciatore, Fiori, and Ghironi (forthcoming, b) focus on how reforms
in the Euro Area aﬀect U.S.-Europe interdependence. We study the eﬀects of implementing market reforms during
recessions in Cacciatore, Duval, Fiori, and Ghironi (2015). Langot, Patureau, and Sopraseuth (2014) focus on the
fiscal side of the structural reform debate–the reduction of tax-induced ineﬃciency wedges–in a model with labor,
but not product, market dynamics.
    4
      These findings are qualitatively in line with existing DSGE model-based and empirical literature, with the partial
exception of employment protection reform, which has been found to have ambiguous eﬀects on unemployment in
other theoretical and empirical studies. In our model and calibration, employment protection reform (a reduction of
firing costs and the bargaining power of individual workers) reduces unemployment.
    5
      For tractability, we assume that agents engage in perfect risk sharing within their households. Thus, we do not

    The short-term eﬀects of structural reform in one area depend in part on existing policy and
institutional settings in other areas. For instance, short-term dynamics in the aftermath of product
market reform are smoother if the labor market is more flexible. However, the long-term gains
from product market reform are then smaller, i.e., there is long-run substitutability (rather than
complementarity) between product and labor market reforms.
    Policy can exploit the interdependence in the consequences of institutional settings across mar-
kets to minimize the transition costs of reforms. This is accomplished by implementing broad
packages of labor and product market reforms. Specifically, reducing entry barriers in product
markets in parallel to labor market reforms reverses the real wage losses and implied unfavorable
demand eﬀects that would result from the latter alone.6
    Importantly, structural reforms are not found to have noticeable deflationary eﬀects. This
result contrasts with the implications of exogenous price and wage markup cuts in Eggertsson,
Ferrero, and Raﬀo (2014) and other studies that use the same approach to modeling reforms. It
suggests that inability of monetary policy to deliver interest rate cuts in the aftermath of reforms–
either because of the ZLB or because the country belongs to a monetary union–may not be an
obstacle to reform implementation.7 Alternative simple, empirically relevant monetary policy rules
do not imply large changes in transition costs. This is because the dynamic adjustment to reform
is primarily driven by firm and consumer expectations of long-run eﬀects of reforms that do not
depend on monetary policy. The welfare costs of transition dynamics are only marginally smaller
if the reforming country has a floating exchange rate than belonging to a monetary union.
    Finally, the paper abstracts from the existence of political incentives and constraints in im-
plementing market reform: We take deregulation as given and study its macroeconomic eﬀects.
Nevertheless, our results have implications for the political economy literature. On one side, the
existence of short-run costs following individual reforms (e.g., barriers to entry and employment
address the distributional consequences of reforms. While this is an important topic for future research, we believe
that the channels through which market reforms aﬀect aggregate macroeconomic dynamics in the present study
are likely to be robust to future analysis. For instance, in a search-and-matching model featuring Bewley—Huggett—
Aiyagari incomplete markets, Krusell, Mukoyama, and Sahin (2010) show that raising unemployment benefits reduces
long-run welfare, since aggregate labor-market ineﬃciencies significantly outweigh the benefits from insurance beyond
self-insurance. In a similar model, Nakajima (2012) shows that the cyclical properties of unemployment and vacancies
are little aﬀected by strengthening or shutting down the uninsured individual unemployment risk.
    6
      This result is consistent with the view that deregulating product markets first (or in conjunction to labor) can
both mitigate the negative short-term impact of labor market reforms and facilitate their implementation–a point
made by Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003), though in a static framework.
    7
      Cacciatore, Fiori, and Ghironi (forthcoming, a and b) find that the optimal monetary policy response to market
reform is expansionary, but this is driven by an incentive to front-load long-run gains rather than a response to sizable
deflationary eﬀects in the short run.

protection legislation) oﬀers an alternative explanation for the historical aversion of governments
to implement market deregulation, adding to the traditional sources of status-quo bias highlighted
by the political economy literature.8 On the other side, since joint deregulation in product and
labor markets reduces short-run costs, a broad reform agenda may weaken the political opposition
to reforms, helping to break the deadlock in highly regulated economies. This finding is consistent
with the view in the political economy literature that reform packages are politically more viable
than individual reforms (Saint-Paul, 2000).
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 presents
the calibration and results of our baseline exercise. Section 4 analyzes the consequences of reform
packages. Section 5 focuses on the role of monetary policy. Section 6 concludes.


2       The Model

Household Preferences

We consider a small open economy populated by a unit mass of infinitely lived, atomistic households.
Each household is thought of as a large extended family with a continuum of members on the
unit interval. In equilibrium some members will be employed while others will be unemployed.
Unemployed workers receive a fixed amount   0 of household production units. As customary
in the literature, family members perfectly insure each other against variation in labor income due
to employment status, so that there is no ex-post heterogeneity across individuals (see Andolfatto,
1996, and Merz, 1995). We assume habit persistence in consumption utility as this improves the
quantitative performance of the model by slowing down the response of consumption to shocks.
                                                                             ¡P∞ −              ¢

consumption  is defined as
                                              ≡  +  (1 −  )

    These factors include, among others, the concentration of losses and diﬀusion of gains (Olson, 1965), the ex-ante
uncertainty regarding the distribution of gains and losses (Fernandez and Rodrik, 1991), the conflict between insiders
and outsiders (Blanchard and Giavazzi, 2003), and what Saint-Paul (2000) labels the constituency and identifiability
eﬀects. The former captures the notion that existing product and labor market institutions create their own political
support, generating resistance to reform. The latter reflects the fact that gainers and losers from an institution
currently in place are better identified than those from an institution not currently prevailing.

as  .


Production

Household members are employed by perfectly competitive firms to produce a non tradable in-
termediate input that is sold to monopolistically competitive wholesale producers. These use the
intermediate input to produce diﬀerentiated consumption goods. Importantly, the number of pro-
ducers in the wholesale sector is endogenous, and it varies in response to aggregate shocks.9 In the
final stage of production, perfectly competitive retailers combine bundles of domestic diﬀerentiated
goods and imported varieties to produce a final homogeneous good,  .

    In Cacciatore, Duval, Fiori, and Ghironi (2015), we focus on producer entry dynamics and market deregulation
in a non-traded sector that produces services used as an input in manufacturing production. There, we study the
argument often made in policy discussions that reform of the domestic service sector can be beneficial for exter-
nal competitiveness by lowering costs for tradable production. Our findings suggest that the alternative modeling
structure does not aﬀect the main results of this paper.

Incumbent Wholesalers

Each incumbent wholesale firm serves both domestic and foreign retailers. Exporting is costly due
to the presence of iceberg trade costs   : Delivering one unit of good to the export market requires
shipping    1 units. Wholesale producer  uses the intermediate input to produce with the linear
technology  () =  (), where  () is the amount of intermediate input used by producer .
       Domestic demand for home good  is given by:
                                                         µ               ¶− µ           ¶−

positive but negligible from the rest of the world’s perspective. Export demand for the same

open economy maintains the ability to aﬀect its terms of trade.

iceberg trade costs) requires  () =     (), where  is the nominal exchange rate. Following
Rotemberg (1982), wholesale good prices are sticky in the form of a quadratic price adjustment
cost Γ () defined as:

      Notice that  is denominated in units of consumption and the total price adjustment cost is proportional to the
firm’s total revenue. The latter assumption captures the idea that larger firms need to purchase larger amounts of
materials when implementing price changes as standard in the literature that builds on Rotemberg’s (1982) model of
price rigidity.

The markup reduces to the familiar constant  =  ( − 1) if prices are flexible.14 The export price

The Number of Firms and Producer Entry

Building on Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz (2012), the number of firms operating in the wholesale
sector at home and abroad is endogenous and varies in response to shocks.15 Denote with  the
  13
     We are implicitly assuming that all firms are fully owned domestically.
  14
     Since the assumption of C.E.S. Dixit-Stiglitz aggregation of wholesale goods implies constant flexible-price
markups, the model of this paper does not capture a pro-competitive eﬀect of product market deregulation via
through lower flexible-price markups. The models in Cacciatore and Fiori (forthcoming) and Cacciatore, Fiori, and
Ghironi (forthcoming, a) capture such eﬀect by assuming translog preferences (and, therefore, flexible-price markups
that decrease if the number of producers in the economy increases).
  15
     While we refer to the producers of individual wholesale goods as firms for convenience, it should be noted that we
could also interpret them as product lines within multi-product firms whose boundaries we leave unspecified, as long
as these firms are small relative to the overall size of the market. In this interpretation, entry refers to the within-firm
product creation margin, which has been shown to be quantitatively important over the length of business cycles.
See Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz (2012) for discussion.



                                                             9
mass of domestic wholesale producers on the market in period  (the mass of the set Ω ). As implicit
in the specification of costs above, there are no fixed costs of production. Therefore, all the firms
that enter the economy (a mass  in period ) produce in every post-entry period unless they
are hit by an exogenous exit shock which occurs with probability  ∈ (0 1) at the end of every
period.16
    Prior to entry, firms face a sunk entry cost  in units of intermediate input. This is interpreted
as a combination of technological requirements for business creation,  , and regulatory barriers
to entry,  . Both components of entry costs are exogenous and potentially subject to shocks (for
simplicity, there is no time index on  because we will consider only permanent changes in this
component). Prospective entrants are forward looking and anticipate their future profits  ()
in any period    as well as the exogenous probability  of incurring the exit-inducing shock
As in Bilbiie et al. (2012), we assume that entrants at time  will start producing only from
 + 1.17 Prospective entrants compute their expected post-entry value  (), given by the presented
discounted value of the expected stream of per-period profits  () that they will generate from
period  + 1 on:                                 "                              #

                                                  =+1

Entry occurs until this firm value is equalized to the entry cost, leading to the free entry condition
 () =   .18 Note that  () =  is also the value of incumbent firms in period . Given
the time-to-build assumption, the law of motion for the number of wholesale producers is given by
 = (1 − )(−1 + −1 ). The number of producing firms represents the stock of capital of the
economy. It behaves much like physical capital in standard real business cycle models and has an
endogenously fluctuating price given by (5).


Intermediate Sector

Perfectly-competitive firms in this sector produce a non-traded intermediate input using labor.
The labor market is characterized by search-and-matching frictions as in Diamond (1982a,b) and
   16
      We abstract from endogenous firm exit to simplify the model. Endogenous exit would require firm heterogeneity
and fixed production costs. As noted by Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz (2012), the simpler model is suﬃcient to capture
important features of product market and aggregate dynamics with plausible calibrations of .
   17
      To simplify the model, we assume that the first price setting decision by new entrants in period  (which will
take place at  + 1) is subject to the same rigidity as for incumbent firms. As shown in Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz
(2008), assuming that new entrants set their first price in flexible fashion does not alter the properties of the model
significantly for realistic values of .
   18
      This condition holds with equality as long as the mass of new entrants  is positive in all periods. We verify
that this condition is never violated in our exercises.

Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). Each firm employs a continuum of workers. The stock of labor
varies because of endogenous variation in hiring (job creation) and firing (job destruction). To hire
new workers firms must post vacancies, incurring a fixed cost  denominated in units of final output
 . The probability of finding a worker depends on a constant-returns-to-scale matching technology

Labor market tightness is defined as  ≡   . Each firm meets unemployed workers at a rate
 =   . As in Krause and Lubik (2007), we assume that newly created matches become
productive only in the next period. For an individual firm, the inflow of new hires in  + 1 is
therefore    where  is the number of posted vacancies.
       Firms and workers can separate for exogenous and endogenous reasons. When the firm finds a
match to be no longer profitable, it can dismiss the worker but, to do so, it has to incur a firing
cost  denominated in units of final output  . This cost is constant and proportional to the
steady-state (aggregate) real wage :  =   , where   is a positive parameter, and we denote
steady-state levels of variables by dropping the time index.19
       Production is subject to both aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks. Specifically, each filled job
produces   units of output, where  indexes a particular job. Aggregate productivity  is
common to all firms and follows an (1) process in logs, while the specific job’s productivity 
is idiosyncratic. Job-specific productivity is an  draw from a time invariant distribution with
cumulative distribution function (), positive support, and density ().20
       For a generic intermediate input producer, total output  is determined by the measure  of
jobs, aggregate productivity  , and the average of idiosyncratic job-specific shocks, ̄ :

     Firing costs are not a transfer to workers here and are treated as a pure loss (administrative costs of layoﬀ
procedures). Severance transfers from firms to workers would have no allocative eﬀects with Nash wage bargaining
as assumed below. See Mortensen and Pissarides (2002).
  20
     As common in the literature, the  assumption is for analytical tractability. A more realistic assumption
would be to allow idiosyncratic shocks to display persistence. Results in den Haan, Ramey, and Watson (2000) lead
us to conjecture that this would not aﬀect our results significantly.

period. Total separation is then given by  ≡  +  , where  ≡ (1 −  )( ) is the fraction
of jobs that are endogenously destroyed. It follows that the law of motion of employment at the
representative intermediate sector firm is given by:

its expected discounted value to the firm, net of the firing cost that may be incurred next period.
Equation (9) states that the value of an extra worker must equate its (average) net cost plus the
expected continuation value of the match. Equation (10) states that the marginal revenue product
of the threshold worker must be equal to its wage cost net of the costs the firm has to bear to fire
the worker and post the vacancy to seek a replacement.

    In Cacciatore, Duval, Fiori, and Ghironi (2015), we extend the model to include endogenous physical capital
accumulation. The presence of physical capital enhances the persistence of macroeconomic dynamics in response to
deregulation, yet leaves unaﬀected the qualitative pattern of transition dynamics.

Wage Determination

The wage schedule is obtained through the solution of an individual Nash bargaining problem.
Without loss of generality, we consider a worker with idiosyncratic productivity . The bargaining
solution splits the surplus of the match between the worker and the firm in shares determined by
an exogenous bargaining weight  between 0 and 1 according to the sharing rule:


                                         () = (1 − )( () −  )                                        (11)


where  () is the firm’s surplus from employing worker ,  () represents the worker’s asset
value of being employed, and  is the value of unemployment.22 As pointed out by Mortensen
and Pissarides (2002), the firm surplus corresponds to the value of the job to the firm,  (), plus
savings from firing costs:  () =  ()+ .23 The value of the job to the firm is determined by the
marginal revenue product of the employment relation minus its costs, plus its expected discounted
continuation value:

                                          ¡      ¢ ©        £                          ¤ª

where  is defined by equation (9). Using equation (8), the firm surplus can be written as

     This bargaining weight  captures the bargaining power of individual workers. We will introduce real wage rigidity
below by assuming gradual adjustment of real wages from their initial (pre-reform) levels to their Nash-bargaining
levels (which will diﬀer from the initial steady-state levels insofar as reforms change the Nash-bargaining weight ).
  23
     The outside option for the firm in wage negotiations is firing the worker, paying  .

government interpreted as unemployment benefits. Worker surplus equals the wage net of the
outside option plus expected discounted future surplus, accounting for endogenous variation in the
future firing threshold.

Substituting (12) and (14) into the bargaining rule (11) yields the equation for the individual real
wage:                      ©               £    ¡       ¢                 ¤ ª

      The bargained wage is a weighted average between the marginal revenue product of the match
(plus a firing costs component) and the worker’s outside option. The wage is intuitively increasing
in the marginal revenue product of labor, the tightness of the labor market, and the worker’s outside
option. Firing costs aﬀect  () in the following way: The firm rewards the worker for the saving
in firing costs today (the first term in the square bracket in equation (15)), but it penalizes the
worker for the fact that, in the case of firing, it will have to pay firing costs tomorrow.
      As shown in Hall (2005) and Shimer (2005), real wage rigidity improves the performance of the
search-and-matching model in terms of the dynamics of labor market variables. We introduce a
simple form of real wage rigidity that well serves the purposes of this paper by borrowing from
Hall (2005). In particular, we assume that the individual real wage actually paid to worker  is
a weighted average of the one obtained through the Nash bargaining process in period  and its
constant steady-state level:  () ≡  ()+(1−)(), with  between 0 and 1.24 The aggregate

    The labor market structure of the economy can be summarized by a job creation equation, a
job destruction equation, and the expression for the aggregate wage provided by (16). Combining
(8) and (9) yields the job creation equation:
                              ½                   ∙                               ¸¾

stating that the expected cost of posting a vacancy today,  , has to be equal to its expected
marginal benefit (determined by the probability of match survival, its marginal revenue product net
of wage cost, and vacancy cost saving next period). The job destruction condition (10) determines
the cutoﬀ productivity for firing,  , a suﬃcient statistic for the behavior of job destruction. At the
margin, the producer has to be indiﬀerent between maintaining the match and firing the threshold
worker.


Household Budget Constraint and Intertemporal Decisions

International financial markets are assumed to be incomplete. The representative household in the
small open economy can invest in three types of assets: domestic and foreign bonds, and shares in
a mutual fund of wholesale firms.25 Let  be the share in the mutual fund of wholesale firms held
by the representative household entering period . The representative household buys +1 shares
in a mutual fund of all the firms existing at time –incumbents and new entrants,  +  –even
though only a fraction (1 − ) of these firms will be producing in  + 1. The household does not
know which firms will be hit by the exit shock at the end of the period. Therefore, it finances
continued operation of all incumbents, and the entry of new firms, and factors the exit risk in the
pricing of the equity as determined below. The real price of one share at time  is equal to the
price of claims to future real profits  . Let +1 denote nominal holdings of Home bonds (in home
currency) and ∗+1 nominal holdings of foreign bonds (in foreign currency) entering period  + 1.
Fiori, and Ghironi (forthcoming, a and b).
  25
     New entrants finance entry costs by issuing equity on the stock market in this model. See Cacciatore, Ghironi,
and Stebunovs (2015) for a version of the entry model based on bank finance.

As in Turnovsky (1985) and, more recently, Benigno (2009), we assume quadratic costs of adjusting
international bond holdings to pin down their steady-state level and ensure stationary responses
to temporary shocks. These adjustment costs are paid to intermediaries whose only function is to
collect them and rebate them to the household in lump-sum fashion. (Home currency bonds are
held only domestically, so no adjustment cost is needed to pin down their steady-state level.) The
period budget constraint of the household can be written as:

side of this equation is home’s current account (or the change in home’s net foreign asset position).
This must be equal to the income balance (interest income on net foreign assets entering the period)
plus the trade balance.
   We define the terms of trade as the price of imports relative to exports:   ≡  ∗  .

of monetary policy for the small open economy. Since we focus only on domestic shocks, and
the small open economy has a negligible impact on the rest of the world, we simply assume that
foreign variables are constant and normalized to initial steady-state levels as standard practice in
the literature.


Welfare-Consistent versus Data-Consistent Variables

A well established property of preferences or production functions that exhibit “love for variety”
is that aggregate output and prices increase if the number of available products expands even if
individual good quantities and prices do not change. For instance, under our assumptions,

                                                           1−                  1−

                                               
                                                    1−

As the home economy experiences entry, the welfare-consistent aggregate price level  fluctuates,
even if individual product prices remain constant. As noted in Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz (2012)
and Ghironi and Melitz (2005), consumer price data do not correctly account for this variety eﬀect–
not only because adjustments for variety do not happen at the frequency required for consistency
with the model, but also because adjustments are not designed to match the preference specification

adopted in it.26 As a result, central banks decide monetary policy by using price index (and
quantity) data that do not account for variety in model-consistent manner.
    To obtain model-based price and quantity variables that are close to available data, we follow
Feenstra (1994) and Ghironi and Melitz (2005) and observe that a data-consistent price index can
                              1                            1−         1−
be constructed as e = Ψ−1  , where Ψ ≡ (1 − )1− +  ∗ 1− . The correction Ψ removes
the pure variety eﬀect from the price index  , leaving us with an index of average prices that is
                                                                                    ³          ´
consistent with CPI data. Data-consistent CPI inflation is then defined as ̃ 
                                                                              
                                                                                 
                                                                                   ≡ e e−1 − 1.
Finally, given quantity  in units of consumption (therefore, including the variety eﬀect), its
data-consistent counterpart can be defined as  ≡   e .


Monetary Policy

The model is then closed by specifying the conduct of home’s monetary policy. Under the bench-
mark scenario, we assume a floating nominal exchange rate regime and an interest rate reaction
function according to which the central banks responds to movements in data-consistent CPI infla-
tion and a data-consistent GDP gap relative to potential (defined as GDP in the equilibrium with
flexible prices and wages):

                                          h       ¡           ¢ ³        ´ i1−

    As alternative scenario, we consider a currency union between the small open economy and the
rest of the world. The union-wide monetary authority sets the nominal interest rate ∗+1 without
responding to inflation and output dynamics of the small open economy, since the latter has a
negligible impact on union-wide price indexes and macroeconomic aggregates.


3   The Eﬀects of Product and Labor Market Reforms

In this section, we use a calibrated version of the model to study the consequences of alternative
reforms of product and labor markets.
  26
     Broda and Weinstein (2010) document that gains from variety go mostly unmeasured in CPI data. See also
Feenstra (1994).




                                                    19
Calibration

We interpret periods as quarters and set several parameters at standard values in the literature.
Specifically, we set the discount factor  at 099, implying an annual real interest rate of 4 percent.
The risk aversion coeﬃcient  is equal to 2. The elasticity of substitution across domestic wholesale
goods, , is set to 11 to imply a relatively low degree of monopoly power of the small economy’s
wholesale producers. The elasticity of substitution between home and foreign bundles of products,
, is equal to 15. The degree of home bias, (1 − ), is set to 08. The quadratic cost of adjusting
prices  is set to 80 as in Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz (2008). This is a standard value for models
that build on Rotemberg (1982). The parameter governing habit persistence, , is set to 06, and
the scale parameter for the adjustment cost on foreign bonds is set to 0004.
       We base the calibration of product and labor market regulation and other characteristics of
these markets mostly on Euro Area evidence before the recent crisis. Product market regulation is
calibrated based on evidence in Pissarides (2003), who compiles an index for producer entry delay
as the number of business days that it takes (on average) to fulfill entry requirements, weighted
by the number of procedures that must be performed. Following the procedure proposed by Ebell
and Haefke (2009), we convert the average of this index for Euro Area countries into months of lost
output. We then set the regulatory component,  , of firm entry costs so that the costs required
to fulfill entry requirements amount to 081 quarters of lost output (based on 230 business days in
a year). To pin down exogenous exit of firms, , we target the portion of job destruction due to
exit. Empirical evidence suggests that job destruction induced by plant exit ranges between 25 and
55 per cent in OECD countries. We choose a midpoint of those estimates and set  that firm exit
accounts for 40 percent of overall job destruction.27
       Turning to the labor market, we set the elasticity of the matching function  to 06, a midpoint
of estimates reported in Petrongolo and Pissarides (2003). The parameter that determines the
bargaining power of workers versus firms, , is set to 06 to ensure that the Hosios condition  = 
is satisfied in the initial steady state, and the parameter that governs real wage rigidity, , is set
to 07 as in Campolmi and Faia (2011). Exogenous separation  is set equal to 068, as in den
Haan, Ramey, and Watson (2000). The replacement rate   is taken from OECD (2004) and set to
069. Given  =   , we follow Thomas and Zanetti (2009) and set   = 02. The idiosyncratic
job productivity shock  is assumed lognormally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation
  27
    Note that we identify firms and plants in our model. Recall that firms in the model can be reinterpreted as
product lines, making it more plausible for us to appeal to plant evidence for calibration.



                                                      20
04, consistent with Thomas and Zanetti (2009). Since we focus only on the implications of the
model for market reforms, we assume that exogenous aggregate productivity  is constant and
normalized to 1 in all periods.28
       Three labor market parameters are left to calibrate: the cost of vacancy posting, , the flow
value of home production , and the eﬃciency of the matching function, . As common practice
in the literature, we chose the values of these parameters to match the steady-state unemployment
rate,  , probability of filling a vacancy, , and total separation rate, . Total average separation,
, is 5 percent in Hobjin and Sahin’s (2007) empirical evidence, and ECB (2002) and Weber (2000)
estimate values of  and  at 9 percent and 07, respectively.
       Finally, we need to calibrate the parameters of the monetary policy rule under flexible exchange
rates. We compare the adjustment to reform under three diﬀerent scenarios that illustrate the
consequences of diﬀerent approaches to policy In the benchmark case,  = 08,  = 2, and
 = 02. These parameter values fall within the standard ranges estimated from the behavior of
many central banks since the 1990s. In the first alternative scenario, we increase the response of
policy to inflation to  = 9 to capture the consequences of a stronger concern for price stability.
In the second alternative scenario, we keep  at the benchmark level and increase the response of
policy to the GDP gap to  = 08 to capture the eﬀects of stronger concern for output dynamics.
The model calibration is summarized in Table 1.


Structural Reforms and Their Calibration

We explore the eﬀects of structural reforms by studying the dynamic adjustment to the new long-run
equilibrium following one-time, permanent change in product and labor market policy parameters.
We consider four types of market reforms, treating them as unanticipated: (i) a relaxation of em-
ployment protection, modeled as a simultaneous reduction in firing costs and the bargaining power
of individual workers29 ; (ii) a cut in the unemployment benefit replacement rate; (iii) a strength-
ening of activation labor market policies (ALMPs), modeled in a stylized way as a simultaneous
increase in the eﬃciency of the job matching process and a reduction in the utility of being unem-
  28
     Cacciatore, Fiori, and Ghironi (forthcoming, a and b) show that the type of model used in this paper successfully
reproduces a number of features of business cycle data. See Cacciatore, Ghironi, and Turnovsky (2014) for the
business cycle properties of a small open economy version of the framework calibrated to New Zealand.
  29
     In the data, employment protection refers to all types of employment protection measures, whether grounded pri-
marily in legislation, court rulings, collectively bargained conditions of employment, or customary practice. Blanchard
and Giavazzi (2003) focus on a reduction in worker bargaining power in their model.




                                                          21
ployed30 ; (iv) a reduction in barriers to firm entry. The size of the changes in unemployment benefit,
employment protection, and product market reform is pinned down by assuming that all relevant
policy parameters are lowered from average levels prevailing across Euro Area countries (the val-
ues in the benchmark calibration above) to average levels prevailing across a group of (non-Euro
Area) OECD countries where such parameters are estimated to characterize more flexible market
conditions. Specifically, we assume that firing costs and worker bargaining power are reduced by
25 percent, and the replacement rate is lowered to   = 058. Product market deregulation is a
permanent decrease of regulatory barriers,  , to 040 quarters of lost output.31 For the ALMP
reform, we consider a more arbitrary 25 percent change in the level of the parameters  and  ,
which are, respectively, increased and reduced.32 Given the large size of the reform shocks, we solve
the model using a Newton-type algorithm, first proposed by Laﬀargue (1990). The details of the
algorithm can be found in Juilliard (1996).
    We use the model to assess whether the dynamic eﬀect of a given reform changes depending
on policy settings in other areas. Specifically, we simulate the dynamic impact of reforms to
employment protection and unemployment benefits under diﬀerent levels of barriers to entry, and
vice versa. All dynamic simulation results are presented in Figures 1 to 6, while the steady-state
eﬀects are shown in Table 2. We carried out sensitivity analysis which showed that results remain
qualitatively unchanged under alternative values of key model parameters including the elasticity
of substitution across domestic wholesale goods, the elasticity of substitution between domestic and
foreign goods, bargaining power, or the variance of idiosyncratic productivity shocks.33
   30
      This modeling choice can be justified on the grounds that stronger activation policies can deliver positive labour
market outcomes through at least two channels: improving the eﬃciency of matching between workers and jobs, and
increasing the motivation and ability of the unemployed to look eﬀectively for a job. Regarding the latter channel,
so-called “threat eﬀects” from institutional mechanisms such as compulsory participation in active labor market
programs or referral to ALMPs under threat of benefit sanctions have been identified in the literature (see Black
et al., 2003, Geerdsen and Holm, 2007, and Kluve, 2010). Such activation mechanisms are not unusual in OECD
countries, for instance, Denmark and Sweden, but also Australia and the United Kingdom. The basic idea is that
unemployed individuals may find that compulsory participation lowers their well-being, e.g., if participation in the
programme entails scarring eﬀects or is seen as a tax on leisure.
   31
      Due to data limitations and diversity of sources, the composition of the country group used to determine the
size of each reform is slightly diﬀerent across policy parameters. In particular, the target for flexible product market
regulation is constructed as an average of Australia, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United
States. The target for unemployment benefits and employment protection includes Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea,
New Zealand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. To pin down the change in firing costs and
worker bargaining power that capture a reform of employment protection, we consider the ratio of OECD indexes of
employment protection (excluding the component relative to temporary workers) for this group of countries and the
Euro Area in 2008. In the data, this ratio is equal to 075.
   32
      While arbitrary, the assumed 25 percent change in these parameters does not drive the main results from the
ALMP reform simulations, as these results are qualitatively robust to alternative choices for the size of the reform.

The Dynamic Adjustment to Deregulation

Labor Market Reforms

Employment Protection Reform Figure 1 presents selected impulse responses to a weakening
of employment protection under the alternative calibrations of the monetary policy rule mentioned
above.34 This reform reduces real wages by lowering individual workers’ bargaining power, and
it reduces the expected cost for firms of terminating a job match (Figure 1). This boosts job
creation. In the short run, however, the reduction in firing costs also reduces the profitability of
less-productive job matches, inducing firms to layoﬀ less productive workers. While the destruction
of existing jobs is immediate, job creation is only gradual because it takes time to match firms and
unemployed workers–both newly unemployed ones and incumbent members of the unemployment
pool. Therefore, the unemployment rate increases in the aftermath of the reform, before declining
gradually as new jobs are created.
       The initial decline in employment and real wages reduces aggregate demand, ceteris paribus.
However, households also anticipate a future increase in income, which leads them to reduce current
saving. As a result of these two oﬀsetting forces, consumption remains roughly unchanged, before
increasing gradually as employment and income rise. GDP falls before rising above its pre-reform
level already after a couple of quarters.
       The relative price of home goods (i.e., the terms of trade) falls slightly due to a small decline
in marginal costs, which in turn reflects lower wages and firing costs.35 This terms-of-trade depre-
ciation generates a negative wealth eﬀect due to the smaller revenue per exported good, but also
expenditure switching toward home goods as these become cheaper than foreign ones, and a small
improvement in the current account.
       Despite the small decline in marginal costs associated with lower wages, there is a small initial
pick-up in CPI inflation in equilibrium, reflecting mainly higher prices of imported goods. Over
time, the benefits from employment protection reform strengthen. As jobs are created, unem-
ployment declines, gets back to its pre-reform level–after less than a year–and ultimately falls
further. This leads to higher GDP gains, which materialize fully roughly after two years. Real
wages, however, remain permanently below their pre-reform levels (Table 2).
  34
      The solid line denotes the benchmark calibration of monetary policy, the dot-dash combination denotes the more
aggressive response to inflation, and dashes denote the more aggressive response to the GDP gap.
   35
      The overall decline in marginal costs is small, however, because the costs of recruiting new workers increase due
to the congestion externality in the labour market–i.e., the fact that firms posting a vacancy do not take into account
its impact on overall labor market tightness, which in turn makes it harder for other firms to fill their vacancies.



                                                          23
       Responses to this reform are very similar across calibrations of the monetary policy rule, and
policy responds to the reform by increasing the interest rate: Under all calibration of the policy
rule, higher inflation ends up determining the direction of the policy response.


Unemployment Benefit Reform Figure 2 presents the impulse responses to a reduction in
the unemployment benefit replacement rate. Responses are qualitatively comparable to the case of
employment protection reform, but the eﬀects of lower unemployment benefits are more favorable
in the short term. This is essentially because lower unemployment benefits boost job creation but
do not increase job destruction, unlike lower firing costs. This results in an immediate decline in
unemployment–which also turns out to be ultimately more significant for a plausible calibration
of the reforms.36
       Consumption increases as a result of lower unemployment and higher income both in the short
run and in the future. GDP also rises immediately. Despite the decline in marginal costs associated
with lower wages, there is a small pick-up in CPI inflation in equilibrium, reflecting higher aggregate
demand and higher prices of imported goods. The current account improves slightly as the decline in
the relative price of home goods induces expenditure switching toward them and away from foreign
goods. Again, the interest rate is increase. Over time, the gains from unemployment benefit reform
increase: Unemployment continues to decline and GDP rises further as jobs are created, with the
full eﬀects being felt about two years after the reform. As with employment protection reform,
real wages remain durably below their pre-reform levels, and there are very small diﬀerences across
calibrations of monetary policy.37


Activation Policy Reform Figure 3 presents the responses to ALMP reform, which are qual-
itatively comparable to those of a benefit replacement rate cut. Strengthening activation policies
through enhanced matching eﬃciency and lower utility value of unemployment boosts job creation
in the short run without aﬀecting job destruction. As a result, there is an immediate and large
decline in unemployment, which continues until about two years after the reform. Consumption
and GDP increase as a result of lower unemployment and higher income both on impact and in
the future. Wages decline and remain persistently below their pre-reform levels, putting downward
  36
     Sensitivity analysis not reported here also suggests that unemployment benefit reform has a larger long-term
impact on GDP than employment protection reform, with product market reform yielding the largest gain.
  37
     A word of caution is warranted in drawing strong conclusions on the eﬀects of unemployment benefit reforms,
which inevitably rely on specific modeling choices. In particular, we assume that worker productivity is unaﬀected
by the generosity of the system. Assuming that more generous unemployment benefits encourage the development of
high-risk but high-productivity activities, as in Acemoglu and Shimer (2000), could deliver diﬀerent results.


                                                       24
pressure on the price of home goods. Nevertheless, higher aggregate demand and higher prices of
imported goods push inflation somewhat higher, and the current account strengthens slightly as a
result of the decline in the relative price of home goods. Again, the interest rate rises and there
are very small diﬀerences across monetary policy calibrations.38


Product Market Reform

Figure 4 presents the responses to product market deregulation. Consumption declines in the
short term, because profitable investment opportunities in new firms induce households to save
more, oﬀsetting the positive impact of higher expected future income on current consumption.
Nevertheless, consumption falls less than it would in a closed economy as households borrow from
abroad, resulting in a sizable weakening of the current account.39 This is consistent with results in
Cacciatore, Fiori, and Ghironi (forthcoming, a and b) and injects some caution in naive readings
of results in existing literature. For instance, Corsetti, Martin, and Pesenti (2013) correctly point
out the benefit of easier business creation for long-run net foreign debt sustainability, but they do
so in a static model. A dynamic model such as ours highlights that easier business creation can
plausibly lead to a worsened current account at least for some time.40
    Firm entry boosts job creation, but the fall in consumption reduces aggregate demand. On
impact these two eﬀects oﬀset each other, leaving unemployment essentially unchanged under the
benchmark monetary policy rule. As the new firms that entered the market start producing, fiercer
competition erodes the market share of incumbents, who downsize. Unemployment temporarily
rises, as job destruction initially dominates job creation.
    Product market reform increases the marginal production costs of incumbents for two reasons:
(i) Only the more productive workers keep their jobs as downsizing firms immediately lay oﬀ less
productive workers, and because remaining workers are better paid–even when accounting for their
   38
      Note that improvements in matching eﬃciency alone could theoretically increase rather than reduce unemploy-
ment. This is because enhanced matching eﬃciency does not only facilitate new hires, but also encourages firms to
lay oﬀ less productive workers by reducing the expected cost of posting vacancies to replace them. This can result in
greater labor market turnover in equilibrium.
   39
      In Cacciatore, Duval, Fiori, and Ghironi, (2015), we make a start at introducing financial frictions (other than
incomplete international financial markets) in our analysis of structural reforms, and we show that lack of access to
international lending can amplify the costs of adjustment to product market deregulation: Under financial autarky,
domestic households must reduce consumption and investment in physical capital by more to finance product creation,
leading to lower aggregate demand in the short run. Andrés, Arce, and Thomas (2014) explore the consequences of
financial frictions in the form of collateral constraints in their analysis of markup cuts.
   40
      This worsening of the current account also contrasts with the immediate improvement from a “reduced-form”
reform of the product market via exogenously slashing markups (as in Eggertsson, Ferrero, and Raﬀo, 2014) that
would automatically lead to terms of trade depreciation.




                                                         25
higher productivity—, marginal labor costs rise; (ii) Current and expected firing costs (which are
a component of the marginal production cost) increase because of the higher probability of laying
oﬀ existing workers. Higher production costs push the price of domestic goods higher, albeit less
than proportionally due to price stickiness, resulting in temporarily lower markups.41 The relative
price of home goods (i.e., the terms of trade) rises.42 Reflecting productivity gains, GDP increases
along the transition towards its new long-run level.
         Upward pressure on domestic goods prices induces the central bank to raise the interest rate,
so that CPI inflation changes only modestly in equilibrium–with some variation across diﬀerent
monetary policy calibrations, however. Higher domestic goods prices trigger substitution away from
home goods toward foreign ones, further weakening the current account.
         Over time, producer entry boosts job creation. Unemployment declines and eventually falls
below its pre-reform level, but this process is slow. Along this process, wages and consumption
increase. It takes longer to reach the new steady state after product market reform than after labor
market reforms, however, though the long-term gains from product market reform are also larger
(see Table 2 for long-run eﬀects).


4        Interactions across Market Policies and Reform Packages

The eﬀects of structural reform in one area depend in part on existing policy and institutional
settings in other areas. Most importantly, the dynamics of the economy in the aftermath of product
market reform are smoother if the labor market is “flexible”–as measured here by less stringent
employment protection and lower unemployment benefits.43 We illustrate this in Figure 5. When
entry barriers are lowered, new job vacancies are filled more quickly and laid-oﬀ workers find new
jobs more rapidly in a flexible labor market. However, the long-run gains from product market
reform are smaller if labor markets are flexible (Table 2). This is because employment is higher to
    41
      Increased input costs are not uncommon in the handful of DSGE model-based simulations of the dynamic eﬀects
of product market reforms (see De Bandt and Vigna, 2008, or Everaert and Schule, 2008, for reforms in the tradable
sector). In the model used here, and unlike in these papers, the inflationary impact of higher input costs is not
dominated by the deflationary eﬀect of lower markups. This is partly because product market reforms are modeled
as a decline in entry costs rather than an exogenous markup cut–indeed while markups vary during the transition,
they remain unchanged in the steady state of our model. Alternative model specifications (not reported here) with
translog preferences and endogenous flexible-price markups that decline with the number of firms did not alter this
finding, i.e., the price of domestic goods still increases in the wake of a decline in firm entry barriers.
   42
      As noted above, this contrasts with the implications of exogenous price markup cuts and suggests that the benefits
of product market reforms do not accrue via improved competitiveness, at least for some time.
   43
      ALMP reforms are excluded from the simulations in this section because of the more arbitrary choice of policy
parameter changes they entail. Results are qualitatively unaﬀected by this exclusion. In particular, results are
qualitatively similar if the definition of a flexible labor market also includes higher matching eﬃciency and lower
home production.


                                                          26
begin with, so that reducing barriers to firm entry leads to a tighter labor market–i.e., to higher
matching frictions–, lower profitability of firm entry, and, ultimately, a smaller number of new
firms. Likewise, the long-run gains from reforms of employment protection, unemployment benefits,
and activation are smaller if product markets are more flexible (Table 2), although the stringency of
product market regulation does not significantly aﬀect the short-term eﬀects of these labor market
reforms, because the latter do not have much impact on firm dynamics (results available on request).
These results imply that there is long-run substitutability (rather than complementarity) between
labor and product market reforms, i.e., a combination of both yields smaller gains than the sum of
the eﬀects of each of them undertaken in isolation.44
         Although substitutability between product and labor market reforms mitigates the long-run
gains from joint reforms of both markets, a broad reform package is still highly beneficial. This is
because it does not only deliver larger long-term gains than individual reforms (Table 2), but also
smooths short-term dynamics and speeds up the transition to the new steady state, as illustrated
in Figure 6. A combination of product market, employment protection, and unemployment benefit
reforms boosts GDP, employment, and wages immediately, in contrast with the eﬀects of some of
these reforms in isolation. In particular, reducing entry barriers in product markets in parallel to
labor market reforms reverses the wages losses that would result from the latter alone. Likewise,
unemployment benefit reform reverses the short-term rise in unemployment that would otherwise
be associated with employment protection and product market reforms. More broadly, compared
with individual reforms, a broad package yields a larger income gain, the expectation of which
immediately boosts aggregate demand and job creation–although this eﬀect is not suﬃciently
large to prevent some small short-term decline in consumption associated with product market
reform.45


5        The Role of Monetary Policy

Despite some transition costs in some cases, none of the reforms considered in the previous sections
has deflationary eﬀects that would call for interest rate cuts. Therefore, the model suggests that the
ZLB constraint may not be an obstacle to the implementation of structural reforms in practice.46
    44
     This point remains empirically debated. Fiori et al. (2012) find support for this theoretical prediction. Bassanini
and Duval (2009) instead find evidence of complementarity across a broad range of product and labor market reforms.
  45
     Note that the reform package still implies a worsening of the current account for over two years, as the home
country borrows to finance increased firm creation.
  46
     This would no longer be the case if reforms instead turned out to have deflationary eﬀects, as in Eggertsson
(2010), where supply-side policies are assumed to boost only current supply, or Eggertsson, Ferrero, and Raﬀo (2014)


                                                          27
    As noted above, diﬀerences in the characteristics of monetary policy, conducted by means of
simple, empirically relevant rules, do not appear to play a major role for the dynamic adjustment
to labor market reforms (Figures 1-3). This is essentially because transition dynamics are largely
driven by firm and consumer expectations of the long-run eﬀects of reforms, which do not depend
on the conduct of monetary policy as specified in this paper. As a result, diﬀerent monetary policy
rules do not substantially alter marginal cost dynamics along the transition path, generating only
small diﬀerences for markups and domestic producer prices.47 There are slight diﬀerences across
monetary policy scenarios, however. In particular, a rule that assigns greater weight to inflation
achieves somewhat quicker stabilization of price markups (for employment protection, unemploy-
ment, benefit and activation policy reforms). These findings also hold, but are quantitatively
stronger, in the case of product market reform, because this has larger eﬀects on marginal costs,
price markups, and domestic producer prices (see Figure 4 and Figure 5 for similar findings when a
broad package of product and labor market reforms is implemented). A central bank that responds
more aggressively to inflation dampens the decline in price markups at the cost of higher and more
persistent unemployment.48
    Finally, short-run gains from labor market reforms are only marginally smaller if the reforming
country belongs to a large monetary union than if it has a flexible exchange rate regime. Labor
market reforms slightly reduce marginal costs and domestic producer prices (results not reported).
As a result, the real interest rate tends to be somewhat higher than under a flexible exchange rate
if, as in a large monetary union, the domestic central bank cannot respond to the shock imparted by
the reform. Aggregate demand and the short-run gains in employment and GDP are then slightly
smaller, and it takes a bit longer for the full benefits of labor market reforms to materialize. For
product markets, by contrast, since a decline in barriers to firm entry raises domestic producer costs
and prices, a fixed exchange rate implies a lower real interest rate in the short run. This results
in short-run gains in GDP and employment (see Figure 7). These results suggest that inability of
monetary policy to deliver interest rate cuts in the aftermath of reforms because of the ZLB may
not be an obstacle to reform implementation, in contrast to Eggertsson, Ferrero, and Raﬀo (2014)
and other recent studies, where reforms are modeled as markup cuts that have an immediate negative eﬀect on prices.
  47
     Cacciatore, Fiori, and Ghironi (forthcoming, a) study optimal monetary policy following market deregulation in
a monetary union of comparable-size countries. They show that the transition adjustment implied by the optimal
policy diﬀers from the one implied by the type of simple policy rule studied here. The reason is that optimal policy
implies an endogenous inflation target that changes following market deregulation, unlike the simple rules of this
paper, with consequences for the dynamic adjustment to reforms.
  48
     Cacciatore, Fiori, and Ghironi (forthcoming, a) show that a policy of zero producer price inflation is suboptimal
in response to market reforms. In general, the optimal policy must strike a balance between minimizing price markup
and unemployment fluctuations relative to their (eﬃcient) equilibrium levels.

and other studies that use the same approach to modeling reforms.


6   Conclusions

This paper studied the consequences of product and labor market reforms in a New Keynesian,
small open economy models with endogenous producer entry subject to sunk costs and labor market
frictions. We showed that the benefits of reforms take time to materialize, and some reforms can
entail short-run transition costs. However, our results suggest that reforms do not impart significant
deflationary pressure. Therefore, concerns about the zero lower bound on interest rates (or inability
to use independent monetary policy in a monetary union) may not be stumbling blocks on the way
to increased market flexibility.
