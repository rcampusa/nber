                                         ABSTRACT

Eye-tracking is becoming an increasingly popular tool for understanding the underlying behavior
driving economic decisions. However, an important unanswered methodological question is
whether the use of an eye-tracking device itself induces changes in the behavior of experiment
participants. We study this question using eight popular games in experimental economics. We
implement a simple design where participants are randomly assigned to either a control or an eye-
tracking treatment condition. In seven of the eight games, eye-tracking did not produce different
outcomes. In the Holt and Laury risk assessment (HL), subjects with multiple calibration attempts
behave like outliers under eye-tracking conditions, skewing the overall results. Further
exploration shows that poor calibrators also show marginally higher levels of negative emotion,
which is correlated with higher risk aversion in both HL and in the Eckel and Grossman gambling
tasks. Because difficulty calibrating is correlated with eye-tracking data quality, the standard
practice of removing participants who did not have good eye-tracking data quality resulted in no
difference between the treatment and control groups in HL. Our results suggest that experiments
may incorporate eye-tracking equipment without inducing changes in the economic behavior of
participants, particularly after observations with low eye-tracking quality are removed.

1     Introduction

The application of eye-tracking technology to investigate human behavior is gaining pop-
ularity in economics (Lahey and Oxley, 2016). Eye-tracking has proved to be a versatile
methodological tool to evaluate intrinsic human responses (Fengs, 2011; Knoepfle et al.,
2009; Reutskaja et al., 2011; Rosch and Vogel-Walcutt, 2013; Sharafi et al., 2015; Wang et
al., 2010; Wedel, 2014). Specifically, within economic experiments, eye-tracking has been
previously used to assess visual attention, pupil dilation, mental effort, and, more recently,
strategic interaction during economic games (Wang et al., 2010). Eye-tracking has also been
used extensively in psychology and related fields to study cognitive load, reading efficiency,
complexity of information, attention, decision making under time pressure, and more (Fiedler
et al., 2013; Pieters and Wedel, 2007; Reutskaja et al., 2011). Eye-tracking technology is
frequently used to evaluate the nuances of behavior in game theory. With the influx of
experiments conducted with eye-tracking in the past decade, the use of eye-tracking will
continue to gain popularity in economics (see Lahey and Oxley (2016) for a literature re-
view, also Sickmann and Le (2016), and Wang et al. (2010)). The beauty contest (Chen et
al., 2018; Chen and Krajbich, 2017), prisoner's dilemma (Devetag et al., 2016; Fiedler et al.,
2013; Hristova and Grinberg, 2005; Peshkovskaya et al., 2017; Stewart et al., 2016), leader
games (Stewart et al., 2016), public goods (Tanida and Yamagishi, 2010), two-armed bandit
learning (Hu et al., 2013), variations of the normal form game of the prisoner's dilemma
and stag hunt (Knoepfle et al., 2009; Polonio et al., 2015; Popovic, 2014), sender-receiver
(Wang et al., 2010), and coordination games (Kr´
                                               ol and Kr´
                                                        ol, 2017) have been studied using
eye-tracking and other biometric equipment.
    Even though eye-tracking provides rich data that enables researchers to better under-
stand individual decisions, it is possible that participants may modify their behavior when
they know their eye movements are being recorded (Wang et al., 2010). People may behave
in a more socially desirable way if, by monitoring their eyes, they feel pressured to conform
to social expectations (Kaminska and Foulsham, 2013). Yet, the question of whether the

                                              1
use of an eye-tracking device itself induces a change in experiment participant behavior has
not been comprehensively studied (Lejarraga et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2010). In this paper,
we investigate whether the use of an eye-tracking device induces changes in the economic
behavior in incentivized laboratory experiments. If it does, external validity would be lim-
ited to situations in which participants know they are being watched. We also study if any
such effects go away over time. If they do, then later eye-tracking results can be used. We
address these issues using eight standard economic games in which participants are randomly
assigned to either an eye-tracking treatment or no eye-tracking control. Social desirability
is the tendency of some respondents to report an answer in a way they deem to be more
socially acceptable (Lavrakas, 2008; Zerbe and Paulhus, 1987). This behavior can be exhib-
ited through behaviors observed while engaging in social tasks through self-deceptive and
impression management styles, thus causing measurement error (Holtgraves, 2004; Paulhus,
2002). Social Desirability Bias (SDB) has been observed extensively in field and laboratory
experiments. For example, Bateson et al. (2006) implemented a field experiment to evalu-
ate how a pair of "watching" eyes affected donations to a university coffee fund. Subjects
contribute to the coffee fund nearly three times as much when they are being "watched by
the eyes" compared to the absence of the eyes watching control. Similarly, showing subjects
computer-generated eyespots during dictator games increases generosity; players give twice
as many tokens to their partners relative to the control group (Haley and Fessler, 2005;
Sparks and Barclay, 2013). Controlling for SDB can be difficult. Therefore, it is important
to understand the experimental context in which SDB may arise (Norwood and Lusk, 2011;
Zizzo, 2010; Paulhus, 2002).
   Researchers from other fields have found evidence of brief-lived social desirability bias
with eye-tracking technology. In one study, only 36% of subjects who wore eye-tracking
glasses looked at a provocative swimsuit calendar in a waiting room while 92% of those who
did not wear the eye-tracking glasses looked at the calendar while being observed with a
hidden camera (Risko and Kingstone, 2011). When the eye-tracker was turned off and the


                                             2
subjects believed they were not being observed, 83% of the eye-tracking treatment looked at
the calendar. However, even with wearable technology, this effect is short-lived; in a follow-
up study, Nasiopoulos et al. (2015) found that after ten minutes without recalibration, a
treatment group with wearable eye-trackers looked at the calendar at the same rate as those
without eye-trackers. In another experiment, using eye-tracking equipment mounted on
a computer screen, the knowledge of eye-tracking occurring during the experiment caused
subjects to alter their gaze behavior to focus on female facial features rather than their chest
and waist in the presence of eye-trackers even when the eye-trackers were not turned on
(Wong and Stephen, 2019). In this experiment, the "eye-trackers" were made more salient
by the researchers providing dual fake web-cameras with lights (either on or off depending
on condition) on the top of the monitor while the actual unobtrusive eye-tracker secretly
recorded eye-movements in all conditions. Both of these studies involved implicit deception
and did not incentivize outcomes. Additionally, in both studies eye-trackers are more salient
than they would be in a standard economics experiment in which the eye-tracker is generally
a small black box at the base of a monitor (as shown for our experiment in Figure 1).
   In economics, eye-tracking papers sometimes check their own experiments for Hawthorne
effects induced by eye-tracking. For example, Wang et al. (2010) reports a null effect in a
check comparing eye-tracking and non-eye-tracking participants in a sender-receiver game.
Similarly, Harrison and Swarthout (2019) had the same group do their experiment with
and without eye-tracking and found no difference in a risk lottery game. However, it is
possible that there is publication bias for any individual experiment; papers not showing
such an effect may be more likely to be published than those that do. Presently, to our
knowledge, there is no economic study with the goal to comprehensively determine whether
the physical presence and explicit knowledge of eye-tracking equipment influences subjects'
decisions in incentivized laboratory settings. The economic games for this experiment are
canonical games with varied ex ante expectations depending on the game. The games used
in this experiment include the Dictator game, Ultimatum game, Public Goods game, Trust


                                               3
game, Eckel and Grossman gambling risk task, Holt and Laury risk task, Double Auction,
and a Cheating game. The null hypothesis is that there is no effect of eye-tracking on the
economic behavior of participants for each economic game.
   Overall, we do not find evidence of an eye-tracking effect in the economic behavior for
seven of the eight games. Subjects neither behave more generously nor selfishly in the
Dictator game, Ultimatum game, Public Goods game, and Trust game in the eye-tracking
conditions. Meanwhile, they did not take less risk by choosing less risky gamble choices in
the Eckel and Grossman gambling risk task, nor are they less likely to cheat by reporting a
higher number in a Cheating game relative to the control conditions. In the Double Auction
task, in the raw data, there are no statistical differences in the average profits, transaction
price, bids or asks between the two groups, but there is a slight statistical difference in the
transaction volume between the two groups. However, this difference disappears once the
standard errors are clustered at the session label, and the indifference holds after controlling
for the number of subjects and other demographic characteristics.
   Only the Holt and Laury (HL) risk task showed a difference in means. Further exploration
of these differences determined that both in the Holt and Laury risk task and the Eckel and
Grossman risk task (using different sample populations), the number of calibration attempts
was directly correlated with higher risk aversion. That is, for each additional calibration
attempt, a participant's number of safe choices increased 0.2 points in both games. In
the Holt and Laury game, these calibration outliers drove statistical differences between
the treatment and control group. Further exploration of these results using choice process
data on facial expressions collected by the facial engine coding, Affectiva AFFDEX, while
participants were doing the study suggest that multiple calibration attempts are marginally
correlated with feelings of fear, which are correlated with anxiety and guilt (Saxena et al.,
2020), and that these feelings of fear are significantly correlated with taking less risky choices
in both risk games.
   In eye-tracking research, it is common practice to remove participants who do not have


                                                4
eye-tracking accuracy above a certain "quality" threshold, such as 85% (according to iMo-
tions). When we removed these observations from the treatment group, as would a researcher
interested in the eye-tracking results themselves, the difference between the treatment and
control groups in the Holt and Laury game is no longer significant. This result is likely be-
cause people who have difficulty calibrating also generate additional eye-tracking problems
(Holmqvist et al., 2011; Hornof and Halverson, 2002; Nystr¨
                                                          om et al., 2013). Thus, for re-
searchers who follow this standard practice of removing observations with poor eye-tracking,
it appears that even with a risk assessment task, a Hawthorne effect caused by use of the
eye-tracker is not a problem in eye-tracking research using these standard economics games.
    The rest of the paper includes the following sections: Section 2 illustrates the experimen-
tal design, Section 3 describes the results of each game, Section 4 delves deeper into how
calibration problems are correlated with risk aversion, and Section 6 concludes this paper.



2       Experimental Design

A total of 404 students from Texas A&M University were recruited to participate over the
course of 50 sessions ranging from 4 to 16 participants.1 Session times were available in the
morning and afternoon during regular university hours of 8:00 A.M. ­ 5:00 P.M. Data were
collected from July 2019 to February 2020. The experiment was conducted at the Human
Behavior Lab at Texas A&M University. The lab has 16 stations equipped with computers
mounted with eye-tracking devices and web cameras (Figure 1). Each station is surrounded
by individual partitions six feet apart to prevent subjects from looking at other subjects.
The experiment was computerized using Z-tree (Fischbacher, 2007).
    The experiment consisted of eight economic games, including five social interaction games:
Dictator, Double Auction, Public Goods, Trust and Ultimatum games; and three non-social
    1
     Treatment Group 1 in the eye-tracking condition with 8 participants was dropped due to data loss by
computer failure. So, we used 396 (248 in Group 1 and 148 in Group 2) and 49 sessions in total for our
analysis. An a priori power analysis required a minimum of 164 subjects for two-player games (82 per role)
and a minimum of 82 subjects for games other than two-player to have 80% power and a medium effect size
(Cohen's D=0.50).

interaction games: Cheating game, and the Holt and Laury (HL) and Eckel and Grossman
(EG) risk preference tasks. Conventional game instructions were used for all eight games
(Andersen et al., 2018, 2011; Andreoni, 1995; Attanasi et al., 2016; Berg et al., 1995; Eckel
and Grossman, 2002; Holt and Laury, 2002; Smith, 1962).2 Because of the large number of
games, we will present the details of game play for each game as well as predictions for social
desirability bias along with its respective results in the results section.
   We divided the eight games into two groups of four games to prevent subject fatigue.
The games assigned to each group were selected to be balanced in terms of the game type
and the amount of time required to complete the experiment. The games within Group
1 consisted of a one-shot Dictator game, Trust game, HL risk preference task, and a 10
period Double Auction. The games within Group 2 consist of the EG risk choice task, a 10
period Public Goods game, one-shot Ultimatum game, and 10 period Cheating game. The
games for Group 1 were ordered from the most socially affecting to the least social affecting,
while the games for Group 2 were ordered from the least socially affecting to the most social
affecting.

       Experimental instructions are available in Appendix B.

   The treatment conditions and Groups were randomized at the session level. The experi-
ment was conducted using a between-subject design with an Eye-tracking treatment condition
and a no eye-tracking control. For the no eye-tracking condition, the eye-tracking device and
video camera were turned off before the subjects entered the lab. The subjects were read
a script with no verbiage about eye-tracking equipment or calibration. To balance the two
conditions, they looked at a blank screen for 4.5 minutes, the average amount of time it
takes for calibration in the eye-tracking condition, to align the time required to complete
the experiment. Table 1 presents the number of subjects for each experimental condition.
Group 1 has 100 more subjects than Group 2.3 However, the number of subjects between
the treatment and control conditions are balanced.
   Subjects were asked to sign one of two consent forms depending on their treatment
assignment. The consent form for the eye-tracking condition included specific language
consenting to the use of eye-tracking during the experiment. The no eye-tracking condition
consent form had no language about eye-tracking procedures and equipment. Once the
consent form was signed, subjects were randomly seated at one of the eye-tracking stations.
For the eye-tracking condition, the subjects were read a script indicating that they would be
calibrated before the session began. Before starting each game, the subjects were verbally
reminded about the eye-tracking equipment and re-calibrated. We intentionally recalibrated
after each game to remind the subjects of the presence of the equipment in the eye-tracking
condition before each game, similar to Nasiopoulos et al. (2015) so that the presence of
the equipment would be salient at the beginning of each game and so that any potential
treatment effect would not diminish over the 90-minute study.
   To make the average expected payoffs similar across games, the exchange rate for each
game varied from the original game play. Once all the subjects finished making decisions for
all games, the experimenter asked for a volunteer to draw a chip to determine the binding
game and decision for payment. One of the four games was randomly selected for payment
   3
    The Double Auction game in Group 1 requires larger number of subjects to play than do any of the
games in Group 2.


                                                 7
then the subjects viewed their individual payoffs on their respective screens. After viewing
their payoffs, the subjects were asked to complete a demographic survey. After all the
subjects completed the survey, they received their payment in private. Subjects received a
$10 show up fee plus the earnings they made based on their decisions of the binding game.
Subjects were asked to sign a payment receipt form after they received their payment. The
average payoff was $15.93 with a range of $14 to $20.



3     Game Results

Table 2 reports a test of whether the demographics, including gender, age in years, education,
race, and income level, are balanced across the two conditions within group.4 The eye-
tracking condition in Group 1 has older, more educated, but less-White individuals than
does the no eye-tracking control.5 Additionally, the eye-tracking condition in Group 2 is
younger and less educated than the no eye-tracking control. We control for these differences
using regression analysis.
    We present the results for each game in the following subsections based on ex ante expec-
tations for each game and the order of play beginning with Group 1. Each game is examined
with mean and distribution comparisons using Mann-Whitney test and Kolmogorov­Smirnov
test. We also report OLS regression results for each game. Robust standard errors are clus-
tered at the session level.
    4
      Education is categorized as Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior+ , Master, and Ph.D. Race includes
White, African American, Asian, and Others. Income is categorized as <$45,000, $45,000-$49,000, $50,000-
$59,000, and >$60,000.
    5
      A balance test was conducted after collection in September. Age and race were unbalanced so data
collection was initiated in October and again in February 2020. The balance check includes the results of a
Kruskal-Wallis test of each Treatment Group of the difference for demographic characteristic. The detailed
table is in Table 2.

3.1                    Dictator game

The first game in Group 1 was the Dictator game, with instructions based on Andersen et
al. (2018). In this game, subjects were matched randomly into pairs and were randomly
assigned either the role of Player 1 or Player 2. Player 1 was asked to decide the number
of tokens (out of 10) to split between themselves and Player 2. The exchange rate was 1
token equals $1. Both Players 1 and 2 read through the instructions then Player 1 made
their decision while Player 2 was notified that Player 1 was making their choice. Subjects
did not see the final result of the game unless it was chosen for payment at the end of the
experiment. We hypothesized that if subjects feel the SDB in the eye-tracking condition,
then they would transfer more tokens to Player 2 than in the no eye-tracking control. By
doing this, they could be perceived as a generous person.
                    The giving behavior for Player 1 between the eye-tracking and no eye-tracking conditions
is not significantly different. Figure 2 shows the comparison of the average amount of tokens
sent between the conditions. There is no significant difference in the average number of tokens
sent between the two conditions (MW, p =0.37; regression,  = -0.325, p =0.66). Like the
mean comparison, we do not find differences in the distributions between the treatment and
control (KS, p =0.866).

   We also estimate OLS regressions with demographic controls in Table 3 and find no
change in sign or significance from the regressions without controls clustered at the session
level. Additionally, the average number of tokens sent in both conditions, 2.77 tokens, is
within the range that has been previously found in the literature (Engel, 2011).


3.2    Trust game

Trust game instructions were based on Berg et al. (1995). Subjects were again paired with a
random partner and randomly assigned either the role of Player 1 or Player 2. Both Players
were endowed with 10 tokens. Player 1 was asked to decide the number of tokens they want
to transfer to Player 2. Then, Player 2 received tripled the number of tokens from Player 1.
Player 2 selected the number of tokens to return to Player 1 from the available funds they
had. The exchange rate was 1 token equals $0.5. In this game, there is a chance that subjects
might behave in a more socially desirable way in the eye-tracking condition. Player 1 in the
eye-tracking condition might act more trusting or generous by sending a higher number of
tokens to Player 2 than Player 1 in the no eye-tracking control and Player 2 may return more
tokens to Player 1 in the eye-tracking condition compared to the no eye-tracking control.
   We do not find evidence of differences in behavior for either Players 1 or 2 across con-
ditions. As a measure of trust, we used the fraction of tokens they could send for Player
1. As a measure of trustworthiness for Player 2, we used the fraction of what they could
return. Figure 3 presents the mean difference in the proportions of tokens sent and returned
between conditions. There is no difference in the proportion of tokens sent by Player 1 (MW,
p =0.76) and no difference in the proportion of tokens returned by Player 2 across conditions
(MW, p =0.93). Along with the mean comparisons, the distributions are not different be-
tween the eye-tracking condition and no eye-tracking control for either Player 1 (KS, p =0.35;
regression,  = -0.37, t =0.77) or Player 2 (KS, p =1.00; regression,  = -0.013, t =0.27).
   Results from OLS regressions controlling for different demographics, as provided in
columns (2) and (3) of Table 3, are similarly insignificant for both Player 1 and Player

tokens sent and returned in our study is consistent with previous studies (Eckel and Wilson,

3.3                                               Holt and Laury Risk Task

Subjects played the risk lottery game from Holt and Laury (2002) (HL). This risk task
consists of 10 Decisions with two safe and risky options labeled as A and B. As subjects
progress through the Decisions, the probabilities for the payoffs in Option A and B change.
Subjects are asked to choose one of the options in each Decision. Unlike the conventional
HL game, in which all ten choices are displayed on a single screen, the game was modified so
                                              6
     There is also no significant effect on trustworthiness in any regression results.
                                              7
     Eckel and Wilson (2004) report that Player 1 sent an average of 70 percent of the endowment and the
reciprocity, including only those who returned at least 10 tokens (endowment for Player 2), of Player 2 is
45 percent with the Texas A&M University students. On the other hand, the meta-analysis report that the
Player 1 sent 0.5 proportion of the endowment and the Player 2 returned 0.37 proportion of the available
funds they could return, which is only the tripled amount the Player 2 received (Johnson and Mislin, 2011).
In our study, for the Player 1, the average number of tokens sent in our study, 0.39, is lower than but similar
to the meta-analysis. For the Player 2, the average proportion of tokens returned, accounting the tripled
amount they received, is 0.36, which aligns with the meta-analysis.




                                                                                                                 11
that each lottery decision was displayed on separate screens to ensure incentive compatibility
(Brown and Healy, 2018). The exchange rate was 1 token for $4. The subjects read through
the instructions and went through one example. Then they participated in 10 real rounds in
sequential order with a separate screen for each decision, meaning that the number of safe
choices could vary between 0 and 10. We did not have strong predictions about the direction
of socially desirable behavior; a person might prefer to choose more safe options in the eye-
tracking condition than in the control in order to be perceived as a less risk-taking person.
However, it is also possible that they might prefer to be perceived as more risk-taking and
thus choose the opposite.
                            In contrast to the previous games, we observe an eye-tracking effect in HL. On average,
subjects in both treatments showed risk averse behavior, meaning the average number of
safe choices is greater than 4 (Holt and Laury, 2002), as can be seen in Figure 4a. However,
subjects in the eye-tracking condition have more risk averse behavior than those in the no
eye-tracking condition (MW, p =0.04;  =0.50, t =2.18). This difference also appears in the
frequency distribution in Figure 4b (KS, p =0.07). The distribution is slightly skewed to the
right in the no eye-tracking condition compared to the eye-tracking condition.

characteristics are controlled for ( =0.545, t =2.31), as shown in column (4) of Table 3. This

difference still holds marginally for estimations that exclude participants showing inconsistent
behavior, aka "multiple switchers" ( =0.505, t =1.85 without controls;  =0.490, t =1.73 with
demographic controls).8 In our study, the average number of safe choices for both conditions
is 4.76. This number is similar to the original risk task study (Holt and Laury, 2002).9
However, subjects make more safe choices in the eye-tracking condition when there are
multiple failed calibration attempts. We further investigate the number of failed calibrations
attempts taking eye-tracking and emotions data into account in Section 4.


3.4     Double Auction

The last game in Group 1 was the Double Auction, with instructions based on Smith (1962)
and Attanasi et al. (2016). In this game, subjects were randomly assigned the role of either
Buyer or Seller. The market consisted of 10 periods, each 2 minutes in length, and each
subject had 1 unit of a fictitious good to buy or sell in each period depending on their role.
The value for the Buyer varied from 1 to 8 and the cost for the Seller varied from 3 to 10.
Buyers could not buy the goods at a price higher than their values and Sellers could not sell
their goods at a price lower than their costs. Participants were informed that they could
post their bids and asks in increments of 0.50 tokens. Before each period started, subjects
were informed of their role and value or cost; these were fixed over the 10 periods and were
displayed on the left side of the screen. Each period subjects could freely and simultaneously
place a bid or ask in the market by inputting their bid or ask price at the bottom of the
screen. If there was a price they wanted to buy or sell at, they could click the "Sell at this
price" or "Buy at this price" button on the bottom of the screen. All transactions in the
period were displayed on the right side of the screen. The remaining time was displayed on
   8
      A multiple switcher is someone who made multiple switches between option A and option B in which
they demonstrate inconsistent behavior. An example of a multiple switcher would be someone who chose
option A until Decision 4 then switched to option B in Decision 5 and switched back to option A in Decision
6 and so on. It is common to report results with and without multiple switchers included (Holt and Laury,
2002; Kassas et al., 2019).
    9
      The number of safe choices in Holt and Laury (2002) was 5.2 which is lower than the 6.3 safe choices
found with Texas A&M University students in Kassas et al. (2019).

standard economic theory, we would expect no difference in the competitive equilibrium for
the Double Auction game based on social desirability bias.
                   We use the average over the 10-periods of each of five dimensions to test for an eye-
tracking effect in the Double Auction: profits, transaction price, transaction volume, bids,
and asks. First, we examine the average profits over the 10 periods. We do not find any
treatment effect. Figure 5 shows no differences in the mean and distribution of profits
between conditions (MW, p =0.54 and KS, p =0.39). There is also no eye-tracking effect on
the average transaction price (MW, p =0.713 and KS, p = 0.965), average asks (MW, p =0.862
and KS, p =0.973), or average bids (MW, p =0.326 and KS, p =0.612). See the figures for
these additional variables in Figures A1-A4 in the appendix A.

                   We find marginally significant differences in the mean transaction volume between the
eye-tracking and no eye-tracking conditions (MW, p =0.073). However, once the standard
errors are clustered at the session level using OLS, these effects are no longer statistically
significant ( = -0.064, t = -1.43 for volumes), nor are they significant when we control for
the number of subjects ( = -0.031, t = -1.17).10 All auction results remain insignificant
         10
     The number of participants in a market should mechanically increase transaction volume, so to the
extent that market sizes differ between the treatment and control groups, it should be controlled for when
transaction volume is an outcome (Wang and Yau, 2000).

3.5     Eckel and Grossman Gambling Task

The first game in Group 2 was the Eckel and Grossman Gambling Task (EG), based on Eckel
and Grossman (2002). Like the HL Risk Task, this task was a gamble choice task. Subjects
were presented with six different gamble choices with two different payments in each choice
and a 50-50 chance of each occurring. The alternatives increased in risk and expected return
from Gamble 1 to Gamble 5. Gamble 6 had the same expected return as Gamble 5, but
higher risk. Subjects were asked to choose only one gamble choice. This method of eliciting
subject risk preferences has the advantage of requiring minimal math skills (Reynaud and
Couture, 2012; Eckel et al., 2012; Eckel and Grossman, 2008, 2002). The choice set in our
investigation contained no loss of money (or tokens) as opposed to "loss" framework found
in previous literature; the gambles were displayed as circles increasing in expected payoffs
clockwise instead of in a table format. The exchange rate was 1 token equals $0.50. As with
HL, subjects might pick more risk averse choices in the eye-tracking condition than subjects
in the no eye-tracking condition or vice versa if they wish to be perceived as more or less
risk seeking.
    For EG, unlike HL, subjects' behavior is not significantly different in the eye-tracking
condition compared to the no eye-tracking condition. The average mean gamble choice is
measured to examine the treatment effect. Like the HL Risk Task, subjects reveal risk
averse behavior by choosing Gamble Choices 1 and 2, as shown in Figure 6, which has been
reverse coded (subtracted from 7) to show the mean safe gamble choice in order to make it
comparable to HL. Again, unlike HL, there are no significant differences in the mean gamble
choices or the distributions between conditions (MW, p =0.56 and KS, p =0.38).
    Similarly, including demographic controls in an OLS framework provides no evidence
  11
     We also analyzed the convergence to the equilibrium price and quantity along with the demand and
supply. The results look as expected for double auctions, with no obvious differences between treatment and
control groups and are available from the authors.

of an eye-tracking effect, as demonstrated in column (6) of Table 3. The most frequently
chosen gamble choice, 2 (reverse coded as 5 in our charts), and the average gamble choice,
2.53 (reverse coded as 3.47 in our charts), are close to that from previous studies, including
one using the same sample population (Kassas et al., 2019; Eckel and Grossman, 2002).

3.6                          Public Goods game

The instructions for the Public Goods game were based on Andreoni (1995). Subjects were
randomly assigned into groups of 4 each round and they played the game for 12 rounds (2
practice and 10 real rounds). Each period each subject was endowed with 100 tokens. They
were informed that they had two accounts, public and private, and were asked to allocate
the number of tokens they wanted to go to each account. All tokens in the private account
yielded a return of 10 cents. Each token invested into the public account, by all members,
had a yield of half a cent. At the end of each round, the participants viewed the number
of tokens invested into their private account, the public account, and their earnings for that
period. The rounds were not timed. The exchange rate was 1 token for $0.10. If there is
social desirability bias, we would expect subjects to contribute a larger number of tokens to
the public account in the eye-tracking condition compared to the no eye-tracking condition.

periods.


                                  Subjects in the eye-tracking condition do not behave differently than subjects in the
no eye-tracking condition. The mean number of tokens kept in the private account is the
metric used in this game. Figure 7 presents that no difference exists in the mean tokens
kept and the distribution of the tokens kept (MW, p =0.99 and KS, p =0.79). According to
the distributions, allocating all tokens to the private account was chosen the most in both
conditions. Keeping 50 tokens was the second most frequent choice. The distribution of
tokens kept is centered around 65 in the eye-tracking condition whereas the tokens kept
in the range from 30 to 100 is more evenly distributed for the no eye-tracking condition.
Controlling for demographic characteristics does not change the lack of treatment effect,
as shown in column (7), Table 3. The percentage of tokens kept in our study, 61.26%, is
higher than a previous meta-analysis on the Public Goods game, but it is similar to studies
conducted at Texas A&M University (Zelmer, 2003; Eckel et al., 2015).12


3.7                                  Ultimatum game

Game instructions for the Ultimatum game were modified from Andersen et al. (2011).

     On average, 37.7% of the endowment was contributed in Zelmer (2003), whereas on average 67% was
contributed among the Texas A&M University students in Eckel et al. (2015).

Player 1 or Player 2. Similar to the Dictator game, Player 1 was endowed with 10 tokens and
asked to select the number of tokens to transfer to Player 2. However, in this game, Player 2
could either reject or accept the offer from Player 1. If Player 2 rejected the offer, then both
Players would receive nothing, otherwise the allocation was made according to the amount
proposed by Player 1. The exchange rate was 1 token for $1. Social desirability bias would
suggest that Player 1 would send more tokens in the eye-tracking condition compared to the
no eye-tracking condition. The prediction for Player 2 is ambiguous.

                     Subjects again did not behave differently between the eye-tracking treatment and control
in the Ultimatum game. We measured the mean number of tokens Player 1 sent and the
acceptance rate of Player 2. Figure 8 shows the mean and distribution comparisons in
the number of tokens sent and the acceptance rate between conditions. Both the average
number of tokens sent by Player 1 and the acceptance rate of Player 2 are no different
between conditions (MW, p =0.44 for Player 1 and MW, p =0.81 for Player 2). Similarly,
the distributions are not different between conditions for both Player 1 and Player 2 (KS,
p =0.99 for Player 1 and KS, p =1.00 for Player 2). OLS results available in columns (8)

characteristics do not find evidence of an eye-tracking effect. The average endowment in the
offers, 46.2%, and acceptance rates, 14%, in our study align with a previous meta-analysis
of the Ultimatum game (Oosterbeek et al., 2004).13


3.8     Cheating game

The final game in Group 2 was the Cheating game with instructions adapted from Aksoy and
Palma (2019), which is based on Fischbacher and F¨
                                                 ollmi-Heusi (2013). This game involves
10 periods. In each period, subjects see a random sequence of numbers consisting of 0, 2, 4,
6, and 8. They are asked to report the first number they see in each period and are told that
the number that they report is their payment. Since the order of the numbers is randomly
generated, and there is no enforcement or punishment for misreporting the number that
participants actually saw first, there is a chance they can lie by reporting a higher number
than what they actually saw and profit from it. As promised, subjects were paid for the
value that they reported. The exchange rate was 1 token equals $1. SDB would suggest that
subjects would be less likely to lie, that is, the average reported number would be lower, in
the no eye-tracking condition than in the eye-tracking condition.
    In our results, eye-tracking does not affect the subjects' propensity to lie. The average
number of tokens reported in 10 periods is used to measure the treatment effect in this game.
The expected average number of tokens from the random number placement is 4 tokens (i.e.
the expected value of the five numbers that appear on the computer screen in random order:
0, 2, 4, 6, 8). In our study, the average number of tokens reported in both conditions for
the 10 periods is higher than the expected number of tokens, about 4.75. Figure 9 shows
the mean and distribution comparisons between conditions with the expected likelihood of
20% for each number under truth telling. There is no difference in the average number of
tokens reported between conditions (MW, p =0.70). The distributions for both conditions
are slightly skewed to the right and there is no difference in the distribution (KS, p =0.98).
  13
     The average of 40 percent of the endowment is offered by Player 1 and the average of 16 percent of the
offers are rejected in Oosterbeek et al. (2004).

                                                    19
Again, controlling for demographic characteristics does not change the results, as shown in
column (10) of Table 3. We also confirm that the average number of tokens reported in
our study aligns with previous studies showing that there is a tendency for lying, but the
magnitude is small (Abeler et al., 2019).

4                         Number of Calibration Attempts and Risk Aversion

In the previous section, we show that there are no eye-tracking effects in the games except
for the HL Risk Task. In this section, we dive deeper into the HL result and explore the
effect of the number of calibration attempts on risk aversion in both the HL and EG risk
tasks. We first show that the number of failed calibration attempts is correlated with higher
measured risk aversion in both games. We then examine potential selection bias into who
has difficulty eye-tracking and do not find significant demographic differences between those
who do and do not have difficulty calibrating in our sample. We next remove participants
who have trouble during the calibration stage of the experiment and find that the significant
eye-tracking effect in HL goes away. These results are robust to different thresholds for


                                                                            20
defining calibration difficulty as explained in section 4.3. Then, given that people who have
trouble calibrating on the eye-tracker often do not have usable eye-tracking data and are
thus excluded from reported results, we drop likely excluded participants, those with poor
eye-tracking, from our analyses to see if the significant difference in HL goes away, which it
does. Finally, we use unobtrusive facial expression analysis software, which does not require
calibration, to explore why increased eye-tracking calibration attempts may affect measured
risk aversion.


4.1    Poor calibration is correlated with higher measured risk aver-

       sion

We first show that the number of failed calibration attempts is correlated with higher mea-
sured risk aversion in both risk games. We calculate the number of failed calibration attempts
for HL and EG by summing the failed calibration attempts prior to the start of each game.
Using OLS estimation in Table 4, columns (1)-(6), we find that the number of failed cal-
ibration attempts significantly increases the number of safe choices in both risk games by
about 0.2, even with the inclusion of the demographic characteristics and the removal of
participants with inconsistent preferences. Recall that HL and EG were played by different
participants and in different orders, with HL as the third game in Group 1, and EG as the
first game in Group 2.


4.2    Demographic characteristics of poor eye-tracking calibrators

We examine the characteristics of subjects across the number of failed calibration attempts
for HL and EG to determine if differences in risk aversion are driven by differences in de-
mographic characteristics related to calibration difficulty rather than being caused by failed
calibration attempts themselves. In the literature, calibration difficulties are caused by
things like unusually wet eyes, highly reflective glasses, air bubbles under contact lenses,



                                             21
droopy eyelids, small pupils, or lighting conditions (Harezlak et al., 2014; Nystr¨
                                                                                  om et al.,
2013; Holmqvist et al., 2011). Using the Kruskal-Wallis test for means comparison of the
cumulative number of calibrations, we find no significant differences across demographic
characteristics of gender, age, educational status, race, or income in the cumulative number
of calibrations for either HL or EG. These results are available from the authors.14 There
may be demographic characteristics that we did not observe that are correlated with both
difficulty calibrating and increased risk aversion, but we do not find any correlations for these
first-order possibilities.


4.3     Results of removing subjects with poor eye-tracking/calibration

        data

Given that the number of failed calibration attempts is significantly related to the risk averse
behavior in both HL and the EG and does not seem to be correlated with major demographic
characteristics that would cause selection bias, we explore the potential solution of simply
removing poor calibrators directly and then removing those with poor eye-tracking data
overall, something that is standard in eye-tracking research.
   The cumulative number of calibration attempts ranges between 1 and 10 for HL, the only
game in which an eye-tracking effect was found. Using the Mann-Whitney test and OLS
estimation, where standard errors are clustered at session level, we find that the eye-tracking
effect disappears when we exclude subjects who had a cumulative number of calibration
attempts greater than 6 by HL ( 10 percent of observations), with and without demographic
controls included (MW, p =0.130). Table 5, columns (1)-(4) present the OLS results gradually
removing people with the most difficulty calibrating (results, not shown, are similar including
  14
     We also examined the average number of calibration attempts for each game. The average number
of calibration attempts per subject per game varies from 1 to 6. Using the Kruskal-Wallis test for means
comparison of the average number of calibrations, we find no significant differences across demographic
characteristics in the average number of calibrations. Testing the demographic characteristics separately,
the average number of calibrations is marginally lower among African Americans when compared to Whites
in the OLS estimation result. These results are also available from the authors.



                                                   22
controls). Just removing the one person with 10 calibration attempts does not remove
the significant eye-tracking result ( =0.501, t =2.17), but removing subjects with 9 and 8
calibration attempts reduces the magnitude of the effect and makes it marginally significant
( =0.441, t =1.88, and  =0.439, t =1.83, respectively). Removing subjects with 7 calibration
attempts reduces it further to  =0.383, t =1.55. This pattern continues (in results not shown)
with the sign of the eye-tracking effect eventually flipping negative when people with more
than 2 calibration attempts are removed (N = 138).
    Multiple calibrations were attempted when the eye-tracker could not perfectly catch the
subject's eyes. Thus, multiple calibration attempts are correlated with low quality eye-
tracking data, something that is generally measured as the fraction of frames the eyes were
detected (valid samples) over the total number of recorded frames (total samples) (Tobii
                                                 om et al. 2013).15 Dropping low quality

data (i.e. lower than 85 percent threshold according to iMotions) is standard practice in
many eye-tracking studies. We first test for an eye-tracking effect in HL with this standard
85% threshold cut, which drops 18 percent of the observations. As shown in Table 5, column
(6), the eye-tracking effect goes away when these low eye-tracking data quality are removed
( =0.084, t =0.44). For researchers who want a lower quality threshold, we also tested the
effect of removing observations at the 80% threshold shown in Table 5 column (5), and found
that although the magnitude is larger ( =0.383, t =1.55), it is not significant and is similar
to what is found by dropping observations with 7 or more calibration attempts.16 The results
presented in Table 5 columns (5) and (6) assume a normal filter, but results with medium
and high filters are similarly insignificant, with magnitudes diminishing as expected, and are
available from authors. We also test the EG data to make sure that the null result is robust

      The Pearson correlation between calibration attempts greater than 6 and the low eye tracking data
quality is 0.055 (p =0.023), validating that the subjects who experienced difficulties during the calibration
stage have the low eye tracking data quality.



                                                     23
to dropping calibrators or poor quality data and it is. Similarly, null eye-tracking effect in
the other 8 games are also robust to removal of poor calibrators and those with poor quality
eye-tracking data (results available from authors).


4.4     Biometric analysis for subjects who had trouble with eye-

        tracking calibration

Having shown that an eye-tracking effect is correlated with difficulty calibrating with our
two groups in two separate risk games, and that removing these poor calibrators removes the
eye-tracking effect, we further investigate plausible mechanisms underlying the cumulative
calibration attempts and decision-making behaviors in the two risk games. In section 4.2,
we showed no relationship between the simple demographics we measured and difficulty
calibrating. In this section, we turn to the potential effects of emotions utilizing measures
of facial expression.17
    We use Affectiva AFFDEX, the facial expression engine analysis, to measure the emo-
tional state of subjects. We examine these metrics on the first instruction screen presented
right after the calibration stage. We test, as our outcome variables, seven measures of emo-
tional states (joy, anger, surprise, fear, contempt, disgust, and sadness). In Table 6 Panels
1 and 2, we show a series of simple bivariate regressions with difficulty calibrating (defined
as being in the worst 10% of calibrators for each game) as the X variable and our seven
different measures of emotional states as Y variables in each column. Panel I shows results
for HL, while Panel II shows results for EG.
    Subjects who had trouble calibrating show fear with marginal significance for both games.
Panel I, Column (4) shows that subjects who have difficulty calibrating show a marginally
significant increase of 2.93 in the Fear measure (t =1.74) for HL, more than 2x the average
fear level of 1.25 for HL, while Panel II, Column (4) shows a marginally significant increase
   17
      We also collected and tested eye tracking pupil data to measure arousal and engagement and find mixed
results depending on game, but given that difficulty with calibration is correlated with inability to track pupil
data, we do not want to put weight on these results.


                                                       24
of 1.84 in the same Fear measure (t =1.86), which is also more than 2x the average fear
level of 0.80 for EG. At the same time, we do not observe any significant differences in Joy,
Anger, Surprise, Contempt, Disgust, or Sadness for HL, and while Joy is significant in EG
in Panel II, Column (1), the value is much larger than the not significant corresponding
value for HL. While it is true that it is likely in any set of seven regressions that one result
may be marginally significant, we think that it is suggestive that the same emotional state
is marginally significant in both risk games with the same sign and similar magnitudes.
    There are several possible paths that could lead this fear measure to increase risk aver-
sion. First, psychology literature recognizes secondary emotions as the combination of these
measured primary emotions. In this regard the coexistence of joy and fear in the EG task
could provide an indication of guilt (Coulter and Pinto, 1995), and this guilt from difficulty
calibrating could be driving results. Second, Saxena et al. (2020) find that anxiety is an
auxiliary emotional state that is strongly correlated (0.97 correlation) with fear. The strong
correlation between fear and anxiety may be a possible explanation for the link between fear
and higher levels of risk aversion (Eisenbach and Schmalz, 2016). Finally, if trouble cali-
brating leads directly to fear (possibly of not getting paid), and fear then leads to more risk
averse behavior, then these findings align with earlier research showing that negative emo-
tions drive people to choose a greater number of safe choices (Campos-Vazquez and Cuilty,
2014; Bassi et al., 2013; Kuhnen and Knutson, 2011). Still, we caution that these emotional
results are at best suggestive and merit future research.



5     Discussion and Conclusion

Our study reveals that eye-tracking equipment does not affect individual behavior in eco-
nomic decision making for seven out of eight popular economic games. Participants, on
average, behaved the same in both eye-tracking and no eye-tracking conditions, particularly
after implementing standard procedures, such as controlling for the number of participants



                                              25
per session or clustering at the session level in the Double Auction. Additionally, results
from the individual games are in line with previously done studies using the same games.
In one of our risk preference games, HL, there is a significant difference between the out-
comes of the eye-tracking and no eye-tracking groups. Further exploration into this outcome
suggests that subjects who have difficulty with the eye-tracking calibration procedure are
driving these differences. The differences in the number of safe choices are still prevalent
when we control for demographic differences between subjects who have difficulty calibrating
and those who do not, suggesting that the calibration effect is not just driven by selection
on observables. Instead, potentially increased fear (or anxiety/guilt) from having multiple
calibration trials results in the risk averse behavior in HL.
   We began our research with a hypothesis about SDB, and that any eye-tracking effect,
if it exists, will be more prevalent in games that are more susceptible to SDB. We feel
confident suggesting that SDB emerging from eye-tracking is not a concern in standard
economics games. Even the cheating game, where we expected the highest amount of SDB,
did not show differences between eye-tracking and no eye-tracking groups. We speculate,
like Andersen et al. (2011), that the equipment in these types of eye-tracking experiments
might be inconspicuous enough that it is not intrusive to the subjects as the equipment
rests on the bottom of the computer monitor and is not physically placed on the subjects'
bodies. Additionally, university students are of a generation of individuals who have been
continuously immersed in technology from a young age. They might not be as averse to
being observed through technology because of the normalized presence of webcams on their
phones and computers as well as security cameras in stores and homes.
   Although we find no evidence of SDB with eye-tracking, we do find evidence that calibra-
tion difficulty can potentially create negative emotions that can affect the risk preferences of
bad calibrators. The one game that showed significant differences between the eye-tracking
group and no eye-tracking group was a risk aversion game, HL. Although testing the effect
of calibration on risk aversion was not part of our pre-analysis plan, this correlation holds


                                              26
across two different games (HL and EG) taken by two different sets of people (Group 1 and
Group 2), lending credence to the idea that this is a real effect. We suspect that differences
in significance between the two games are likely because of the different order that the games
were presented, with one of them presented as the first game and the other showing the cu-
mulative effects of calibration difficulties, though we cannot rule out differences in the games
themselves or differences between the two subject pools.
    Our results suggest that in games that are affected by fear, difficulty with calibration may
affect the results of risk preference instruments. However, given that calibration difficulty is
correlated with eye-tracking data quality, this effect is limited and easy to remedy. It appears
that the standard process of removing poor-quality eye-tracking data also removes subjects
likely to be affected by calibration problems. Another potential solution to this problem
is that researchers could keep track of the number of calibration attempts per subject, and
should test their results for robustness with and without observations with abnormal numbers
of calibration attempts or controlling for the number of calibration attempts.18 Finally, as
eye-tracking software and hardware get better, this calibration effect should diminish.

     We obviously cannot control for calibration attempts in the eye-tracking vs. no eye-tracking results here
given that the no eye-tracking group does not calibrate at all. However, most researchers using eye-tracking
will not have a no eye-tracking group and thus should be able to include those controls.

  Note. Coefficients from OLS estimations are reported. Standard errors are presented in parentheses and
 clustered at the session level. Columns (5) and (6) use a normal filter which discards the observations
 that have both eyes have values of 4 or 2 (i.e. (4,4) or (2,2)). Results using a medium and high filter
 are similarly insignificant, though the magnitudes using the high filter (both eyes have values of 0) are
 smaller. * Statistically significant at 10% level; ** at 5% level; *** at 1% level.

 Note. Each column represents the results from a separate OLS regression. Robust standard errors are in
parentheses. Trouble calibrating is 1 if the subject is in the worst 10% of calibrators for each game. Number of
observations are 101 in the first panel and 62 in the second panel. Observation numbers decrease compared to
Table 1 because of lack of sensitivity in the facial recognition software. * Statistically significant at 10% level;
** at 5% level; *** at 1% level.

Appendix B. Abbreviated Instructions
This section presents a transcription of the abbreviated instructions for each game. The full script is available
from the authors upon request.



                                            General Instructions

Welcome and thank you for participating in our study. You will receive $10 for participating; this will be
yours to keep. You will also have the opportunity to make more earnings based on your decisions, the
decisions of the other players, and luck. So, please pay attention to the instructions.

Today you will play 4 games. At the end of the session, one of the games will be randomly selected for
payment. The total amount you earn today will be paid to you in cash and privately at the end of the
experiment. Please do not talk to other participants.

                                              1. Dictator game

[Page 1 ] Instructions
In this game there are two players: Player 1 and Player 2. You will be randomly matched with another
person in this room. You will not be told the identity of the person that you are matched with and the other
person will not know your identity. One of you will be randomly assigned the role of Player 1 and the other
the role of Player 2. Player 1 begins with 10 tokens and Player 2 begins with 0 tokens. There will be one
period only.
                                    In this game, 1 token is equal to $1.
        Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.

[Page 2 ]
Player 1's Decision:
Player 1 will be asked to decide to split 10 tokens between Player 1 and Player 2. Player 1 can choose any
integer amount between 0 and 10 tokens.
Player 2's Decision:
Player 2 will be told the offer and has no choice to make.
Payoffs:
That is, if this game is selected for payment, Player 1's payoff (not including show-up fee) = 10 tokens minus
the number of tokens transferred to Player 2. Player 2's payoff (not including show-up fee) = the amount
Player 1 transferred.
Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.

[Page 3 ] Once all decisions have been made the game will end. We will calculate payoffs based on the
decisions made. Again, you will be randomly paid for one of the games at the conclusion of the experiment.

                                                2. Trust game

[Page 1 ] Instructions
In this game there are two players: Player 1 and Player 2. You will be randomly matched with another
person in this room. You will not be told the identity of the person that you are matched with and the other
person will not know your identity. One of you will be randomly assigned the role of Player 1 and the other
the role of Player 2. Your payoffs will be determined by the decisions that you both make. Player 1 and
Player 2 both begin with 10 tokens.
                                   In this game, 2 tokens are equal to $1.
        Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.

[Page 2 ] Player 1's Decision:
Player 1 moves first. Player 1 may send some, all, or none of the 10 tokens to Player 2. Each token sent to
Player 2 will be tripled.For example, if Player 1 sends 2 tokens, Player 2 receives 6 tokens = (2 tokens ×
3). If Player 1 sends 9 tokens, Player 2 receives 27 tokens = (9 tokens × 3).Player 2 will then decide how
many tokens to send back to Player 1 and how many tokens to keep. Player 1 indicates how much to send
to Player 2 by typing the appropriate amount of tokens on the decision screen.

[Page 3 ] Player 2's Decision:
Player 2 begins with 10 tokens. In addition, Player 2 receives three times the amount sent by Player 1.
Player 2 may send back some, all, or none of the tripled amount to Player 1 (Player 2 keeps the 10 tokens
they started with). Any tokens sent back to Player 1 will not be tripled. Once Player 1 has sent some, none,
or all of their tokens, Player 2 will then decide how many tokens to send back to Player 1 and how many
tokens to keep.

[Page 4 ] Once all decisions have been made the game will end. We will calculate payoffs based on the
decisions made. Again, you will be randomly paid for one of the games at the conclusion of the experiment.

[Page 5 ] You are Player 1./You are Player 2.

                                       3. Holt and Laury Risk Task

[Page 1 ] Instructions
In this game you will make ten decisions. Please make your choices carefully. The Decision Screen shows
a choice between Option A and Option B. You will make one choice and record it in the choice column.
Then you will move to the next Decision Screen. Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise
please click NEXT to continue.

[Page 2 ] Even though you will make ten decisions, if this game is selected for payment only one decision will
affect your earnings. One of the decisions you make will be selected randomly for your payment. Since you
do not know in advance which decision will be selected, your best approach is to make each decision as if it
is the one that will be selected for payment. Each decision has an equal chance of being selected.
                                      In this game, 1 token is equal to $4.
         Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.

[Page 3 ] If this game is selected for payment, we will ask one of you to volunteer to draw a chip from a
bag. The bag contains 10 chips numbered 1 through 10, one for each decision in this game. The chip will
determine which decision will be the real decision. After pulling the chip, your payment will be determined
based on your decision and a roll of a dice. This will be explained in the following screens.
Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.

[Page 4 ] Once all decisions have been made the game will end. We will calculate payoffs based on the
decisions made. Again, you will be randomly paid for one of the games at the conclusion of the experiment.

[Page 5 ] The following gives you an example of the decision screen. It reproduces the first decision. Option
A pays either 2.00 toknes or 1.60 tokens. It depends on the roll of a ten-sided dice. The same is true for
Option B, which yeilds either 3.85 tokens or 0.110 tokens depending on the roll of the dice.
Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.

                          Option A                        Option B           Your Choice A or B
                   2.00 tokens if Dice is 1      3.85 tokens if Dice is 1

                                               4. Double Auction

[Page 1 ] Instructions
In this game there are two players: Seller and Buyer. You will be randomly matched with another person in
this room. You will not be told the identity of the person that you are matched with and the other person
will not know your identity. One of you will be randomly assigned the role of Seller and the other the role
of Buyer. If this game is selected for payment, your payoffs will be determined by the decisions made by the
Buyers and Sellers.
                                      In this game, 1 token is equal to $1.

[Page 2 ] Every Seller can sell at most one unit of a fictitious good.The minimum assigned price at which the
Seller can sell the unit of this good in any period will appear on the top left corner of the screen. The Buyer
can buy at most one unit of the fictitious good. The maximum assigned price at which the Buyer can buy
a unit of this good will appear on the top left corner of the screen.
Your assigned value will be private information. There will be 10 trading periods of 2 minutes each. Your
assigned price will remain the same for all ten periods.
Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.

[Page 3 ] Before the game starts, the computer will randomly assign half of the participants the role of Buyers
and the other half of the participants the role of Sellers. At the beginning of each trading period, two pieces
of information will appear on the top left corner of your screen: your role (either Buyer or Seller) and your
assigned price for the good. Please remember that your role and assigned price will remain the same for all
ten trading periods. The first trading period will start when every player is done reading the instructions.

[Page 4 ] The goal of every trader is to maximize their payoff at every trading period. Thus, each Seller has
to try to sell the good at the highest possible price, and each Buyer has to try to buy the good at the lowest
possible price. Prices must be multiples of 0.5.
Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.

[Page 5 ] Important remarks:
Buyers cannot bid above their assigned maximum prices. That is, Buyers are only allowed to propose prices
below or equal to their assigned prices for the good. If Buyers do not make a purchase, Buyers do not earn
anything in the period. Similarly, Sellers cannot ask values below their assigned minimum prices. That is,
Sellers are only allowed to propose prices above or equal to their assigned prices for the good. If Sellers do
not make a sale, Sellers do not earn anything or incur any cost in that period.

[Page 6 ] A transaction is finalized when a Buyer accepts a Seller's offer, or when a Seller accepts a Buyer's
bid. The Buyer and Seller making the deal are to drop out of the market, making no more bids, offers, or
contracts for the remainder of that trading period. This process continues for up to two minutes depending

                                                       41
on the volume of trading.If Buyers or Sellers resubmit bids or offers, a transaction will automatically cancel
all prior bids and offers made by the Buyers and Sellers involved. Bids and offers made by those who are
not involved in the transaction do not have to be reentered. The highest bid and the lowest offer will be
displayed at all times on your screen.

[Page 7 ] Your payoff will be equal to:
-the difference between the closing price and your assigned minimum price if you are a Seller;
-the difference between your assigned maximum price and the closing price if you are a Buyer.
Once you complete a transaction, your payoff for that period will appear on the screen.

[Page 8 ] Once all decisions have been made the game will end. We will calculate payoffs based on the
decisions made. Again, you will be randomly paid for one of the games at the conclusion of the experiment.

[Page 9. 10 Periods of auctions were conducted.]

                                5. Eckel and Grossman Gambling Task

[Page 1 ] Instructions
In this game, you will be selecting from one of six available gambles. The six different gambles will be listed
on your GAMBLE SELECTION screen. You must choose one, and only one, of these gambles. To select a
gamble, type the option that corresponds to that gamble into the form on the Decision Screen. Each gamble
has two possible outcomes, High Amount or Low Amount, with equal probability of the event occurring. If
this game is selected for payment, your compensation for the study will be determined by:
1) which of the six gambles you select; and
2) which of the two possible events occur.

[Page 2 ] Remember, every gamble has two possible outcomes that can occur with equal chance. At the end
of this session, if this game is selected for payment, we will ask one of you to volunteer to draw a chip from
a bag. The bag will contain two chips. One chip has an H on it representing High Amount. The other chip
has an L on it representing Low Amount. If the volunteer pulls out the H chip, you earn the High Amount
from the choice you picked. If the volunteer pulls out the L chip, then you earn the Low Amount from the
choice you picked. Because there are only two chips, each chip has equal chance to be pulled out of the bag.
                                      In this game, 2 tokens are equal to $1.
Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.

[Page 3 ] Once all decisions have been made the game will end. We will calculate payoffs based on the
decisions made. Again, you will be randomly paid for one of the games at the conclusion of the experiment.

                                         6. Public Goods game

[Page 1 ] Instructions
In this game, you will participate in a total of 12 periods (2 practice and 10 real). In each period, you will
be randomly assigned to a group of 4 members. Each member will be endowed with 100 tokens and must
decide how to divide the tokens between two accounts:
1) Private Account
2) Public Account
                             In this game, 1 token is equal to 10 cents ($0.10).

[Page 2 ] The composition of your group will change every period. Each period, you will be randomly reas-
signed to a new group of 4 members. At no point in the experiment will the identities of the other group
members be revealed to you, nor will your identity be revealed to them. In other words, the group members
will remain anonymous to one another. You will be endowed with 100 tokens in every period and must de-
cide how many tokens to invest in the private account and how many tokens to invest in the public account.
Information about the two accounts is presented in the next four screens.

[Page 3 ] Private Account: Every token you invest in the private account will yield you a return of 10 cents.
The other members in your group will not be affected by your investment in the private account. Here are
a few examples to illustrate:


                                                     43
Example 1 : Suppose you invest 100 tokens in the private account. Then you will get 1,000 cents (or $10.00)
from this account and the other members of your group will not be affected for that period.
Example 2 : Suppose you invest 50 tokens in the private account. Then you will get 500 cents (or $5.00)
from this account and the other members of your group will not be affected for that period.
Example 3 : Suppose you invest 0 tokens in the private account. Then you will get 0 return from this account
and the other members of your group will not be affected for that period.
Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.

[Page 4 ] Public Account: Every token you invest in the public account will yield a return of half a cent to
each member of your group. Also, every token that any of your group members invests in the public account
will yield a return of half a cent to each member of your group.
This means that your return from the public account will depend on the total number of tokens that you and
the other members of your group invest in this account. The more the group invests in the public account,
the greater the return to each member of the group from this account.
Here are a few examples to illustrate:
Example 1 : Suppose you invest 0 tokens in the public account and the other three members of your group
invest a total of 200 tokens in the public account. Then, the total number of tokens invested by your group
in the public account is 200 which means that every member of your group earns 200 × 0.5 = 100 tokens ×
10 cents = 1,000 cents (or $10.00) from the public account for that period.
Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.

[Page 5 ] Important remarks:
Example 2 : Suppose you invest 100 tokens in the public account and the other three members of your group
invest a total of 0 tokens in the public account. Then the total number of tokens invested by your group in
the public account is 100 which means that every member of your group earns 100 × 0.5 = 50 tokens × 10
cents = 500 cents (or $5.00) from the public account for that period.
Example 3 : Suppose you invest 100 tokens in the public account and the other three members of your group
invest a total of 300 tokens in the public account. Then the total number of tokens invested by your group
in the public account is 400 which means that every member of your group earns 400 × 0.5 = 200 tokens ×
10 cents = 2,000 (or $20.00) from the public account for that period.
Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.

[Page 6 ] Your decisions and earnings in every period are confidential. This means that you will not be given
information about the investment decisions or earnings of any of your group members, nor will they be given
information about your investment decisions or earnings. So you must make your decision without knowing
what the other members in your group are deciding.
After each period, the only information you will be given is:
1) Number of tokens you invested in the private and public accounts
2) The total number of tokens invested by your group (including you) in the public account
3) Your earnings for that period
At the end of the session, if this game is selected for payment, 1 of the 10 real periods will be randomly
selected as binding. We will ask one of you to volunteer to draw a chip from a bag. The bag will contain
ten chips, one for each period in this game.



                                                     44
Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.

[Page 1 ] Instructions
In this game, you will see 5 numbers on the screen. You will determine your own payoff by recording the
first number that you see. Then, you will move to the next period. You will play this game for 10 periods.
                                     In this game, 1 token is equal to $1.
In other words, if you report seeing "0" first, you receive 0 tokens. If you report seeing "2" first, you receive
2 tokens, or if you report seeing "4" first, you receive 4 tokens.

[Page 2 ] Each screen will present to you 5 numbers. The numbers are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 in different orders.
Your task is to report the first number that you see and record the number on the next screen. The position
of the numbers on the screen are determined by a computer generated output. Before this session began, we
called a participant to monitor the randomization process.
Please raise your hand if you have any questions, otherwise please click NEXT to continue.

[Page 3 ] At the end of this session, if this game is selected for payment, we will ask one of you to volunteer
to draw a chip from a bag. The bag will contain ten chips, one for each of the periods in this game. Each
period has an equal chance of being selected.
Once all decisions have been made the game will end. We will calculate payoffs based on the decisions made.
Again, you will be randomly paid for one of the games at the conclusion of the experiment.
