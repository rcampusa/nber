                                             ABSTRACT

The American social welfare system was transformed during the 1930s. Prior to the New Deal public

relief was administered almost exclusively by local governments. The administration of local public

relief was widely thought to be corrupt. Beginning in 1933, federal, state, and local governments

cooperatively built a larger social welfare system. While the majority of the funds for relief spending

came from the federal government, the majority of administrative decisions were made at state and

local levels. While New Dealers were often accused of playing politics with relief, social welfare

system created by the New Deal (still largely in place today) is more often maligned for being

bureaucratic than for being corrupt. We do not believe that New Dealers were motivated by altruistic

motives when they shaped New Deal relief policies. Evidence suggests that politics was always the

key issue. But we show how the interaction of political interests at the federal, state, and local levels

of government created political incentives for the national relief administration to curb corruption

by actors at the state and local level. This led to different patterns of relief spending when programs

were controlled by national, rather than state and local officials. In the permanent social welfare

system created by the Social Security Act, the national government pressed for the substitution of

rules rather than discretion in the administration of relief. This, ultimately, significantly reduced the

level of corruption in the administration of welfare programs.

       Prior to the New Deal almost all public social welfare spending, or what contemporaries

called “relief,” was provided by local governments. The administration of local public relief had

long been associated with patronage, political manipulation, and corruption. Between 1933 and

1940, federal, state, and local governments combined to spend $2 billion per year to provide

relief to at least 2 million cases (families) per month. In 1933, when unemployment reached 25

percent, the federal government introduced a relief program redistributing 4 percent of GNP to a

quarter of all the nation's families. The possibility of providing cash payments to a quarter of the

nation’s families offered an opportunity for corruption unique in the nation’s history.

Surprisingly, however, while the administration of public relief was widely regarded as corrupt

before 1933, the modern federal/state public welfare system that developed out of the New Deal

reforms is often castigated as bureaucratic, but rarely corrupt. What changed? How did the

country enter the Depression with a public welfare system riddled with political manipulation

and emerge with one that was not?

       Our answer is straightforward. The President, Franklin Roosevelt, and other members of

the executive branch gained little or nothing from the kinds of local corruption involved in

public relief. But they stood to incur enormous losses if the New Deal relief program was

perceived as corrupt by the voting public. Roosevelt and the Democrats brought relief to

millions of families every month and the gratitude of relief recipients was Roosevelt's political

payoff. Other politicians – Senators, Representatives, governors, and mayors – wanted to

control relief and use it for political gain. Both houses of Congress, the states, and local

governments maneuvered, manipulated, and cajoled to get their hands on a share of the billions

spent each year on relief. Although Roosevelt made substantial concessions to Congress and to

state and local governments in the administration of relief, he was able to curb corruption at the
state and local level by his influence over the discretionary allocation of relief funds, by

establishing offices to investigate complaints of corruption, and, in the long run, by

bureaucratizing the administration of public welfare. During the New Deal, when the relief

programs were reorganized to give the Roosevelt administration more control over the

distribution of funds within states, it used that control to limit state and local political

manipulation and increased the responsiveness of the allocation of funds within states to the

high-minded goals of relief, recovery, and reform. Politics were paramount in the structure of

New Deal relief programs, it just turned out that the best political outcome meant a reduction in

corruption at the state and local level. This does not mean that Roosevelt did not use the

administration of relief for his own political ends. There is ample evidence that presidential

politics mattered in the distribution of relief funds. Corruption by others was curbed because it

was in Roosevelt’s political interest to see it curbed.

        We begin by discussing the types of corruption involved with relief during the New Deal.

We present a brief overview of the New Deal programs, followed by a more detailed history.

We then trace how political influences shaped the administration of relief programs and

document how relief administered by the national government differed from relief administered

by states.



I. Defining Corruption

        Corruption has many dimensions. During the Great Depression the New Deal Democrats

were often accused of “playing politics with relief.” This dimension of corruption differed by

level of government. Roosevelt explicitly stated the goals of the New Deal as “relief, recovery,

                                                                                                    2
and reform.” A growing political economy literature has tried to evaluate whether Roosevelt

pursued those goals or whether he used New Deal policies, particularly the allocation of federal

grants among the states, to pursue political goals.1 For example, if the level of unemployment in

states did not affect the allocation of relief spending across states, but the margin of Roosevelt’s

victory in the 1930s presidential election did affect allocations, this is evidence of political

corruption. At the state level, governors occasionally required administrative employees to make

contributions to political parties. At the local level, political machines were often accused of

selecting from potential relief recipients on the basis of party or requiring recipients to vote for

machine candidates. These are all examples of politics corrupting the administration of relief, in

the large and in the small.

       Corruption also occurred through time honored methods of fraud and featherbedding.

For example, relief workers could be assigned to work on projects that benefited private land

owners rather than the public;2 suppliers could over bill for materials and make kickbacks to

project supervisors;3 or workers could pad their hours and receive benefits for work they never

performed.4 At their margins, these criminal types of corruption may be indistinguishable from

political types of corruption. But they are substantively different enough that reducing political

corruption requires different policies than reducing criminal corruption. It appears that the New

Deal was successful at eliminating political corruption in the administration of welfare. Fraud,

however, will always be with us and its reduction requires eternal vigilance5

       The administrative structure of a government program limits the methods available to

combat corruption. In general, corruption depends on administrative discretion. Officials can be

corrupt only if they have some leeway to make decisions. The creation of rules and procedures

                                                                                                       3
is one way to limit corruption. For example, Roosevelt could only play politics with the

allocation of relief funds between the states if the executive branch possessed the power to

allocate funds at their discretion. If funds are allocated by a formula or a rule, for example,

equal per capita grants or matching grants, the federal administrator does not possess the option

of being corrupt along this dimension. Similarly, if a local case worker has the discretion to set

the monthly relief benefit for each case he or she has much more opportunity to be corrupt than

if relief benefits per case are fixed.

        While discretion and rules are, to a certain extent, substitutes as governing devices, it is

rarely possible to construct an administrative mechanism without some discretion. In the hectic

days of 1933 it was extremely difficult to come up with sensible rules. As a result, the key

aspect of administrative structures was who had administrative discretion. Was it lodged with

the national government, the President, or with the state and local governments? Our central

hypothesis maintains that political corruption at the state and local level in the administration of

federal relief funds was reduced when administrative discretion lay with the executive branch of

the national government. Criminal corruption was reduced by the promulgation of rules and

vigorous prosecution of offenders. The tests of this proposition developed in the empirical

section depend, of course, on identifying political or criminal corruption, and then distinguishing

whether corruption was addressed by creating rules or changing the location of administrative

discretion.




II. A Brief History
        The history of the New Deal relief programs falls into two eras: from May 1933 to the

                                                                                                       4
summer of 1935, and after the summer of 1935. The periods are distinguished by the amount of

administrative discretion exercised by the national government and the discretion remaining in

the hands of state and local officials. Table 1 provides a list of the major New Deal relief

programs. The first columns of the table give the beginning and ending dates for each program

(several Social Security Programs are still in force). The last column classifies programs by their

administrative character, that is, how discretion was allocated within the program. In “national”

programs the national government exerted a preponderance of administrative influence. In

“federal” programs state and local governments shared administrative discretion with the

national government and in many programs possessed the preponderance of influence. Table 2

lists the average monthly number of cases receiving relief for the nation as a whole and for each

of the major relief programs.

       In the spring of 1933 the Federal Emergency Relief Act created the Federal Emergency

Relief Administration, known as FERA, the largest and most important relief program up to

1935. Roosevelt chose Harry Hopkins as the FERA Administrator. The original act

appropriated $500 million to be allocated among the states, half on a matching basis and half at

the discretion of the administrator. Once funds were granted, however, FERA funds legally

became the property of the states. Hopkins attempted to raise the standards of relief

administration, but his ability to do so was limited by the relative independence of state relief

administrations. Hopkins could, and did, threaten to withhold federal grants for relief to states

with corrupt or inefficient relief administrations. Withholding funds, however, was a blunt

policy tool that worked to the direct disadvantage of the unemployed in the state, in contradiction

to FERA’s mandate.

       In 1935, Roosevelt submitted an “economic security act” to Congress. As passed, the act

provided a permanent, nationally administered program of old age insurance, which we call

social security today. It also provided for a national payroll tax for unemployment insurance

                                                                                                    5
programs run by the individual states; 90 percent of the payroll taxes paid in each state were held

in trust for that state. Finally, the act provided relief for three categories of persons: old age

assistance, aid to the blind, and aid to dependent children. The categorical programs were

financed from general revenues and allocated among the state by strict matching grants. Federal

grants to states were determined solely by state expenditures. As a result, it was the states, and

not the federal government, who controlled spending on the categorical programs.

       The second element of the 1935 reforms was the creation of an “emergency” relief

program, funded by a series of ongoing emergency relief appropriation acts. Under the act of

1935, Roosevelt created the Works Progress Administration (WPA), and a number of smaller

relief programs: the National Youth Administration (NYA), the Rural Electrification

Administration (REA), the Farm Security Administration (FSA), and others. The WPA, also

headed by Hopkins, was structured so that Roosevelt could make discretionary allocations

between the states and, importantly, WPA officials retained the right to approve individual

projects within states. Over time, Congress required a larger degree of state and local

participation. This moved the WPA closer to a matching program, but matching was never

complete. The WPA also financed a number of nationally administered programs in the arts,

theater, literature, and history that did not have state or local sponsors. After the summer of

1935, the WPA was the largest single relief program.

       Our hypothesis is that Roosevelt found it in his interest to reduce corruption and political

manipulation, particularly at the state and local level, while Congress and state and local

governments continued to press for a relief structure that allowed them to use relief to their own

political advantage. The key element, therefore, was the allocation of administrative discretion.

If the President possessed administrative and fiscal discretion, he and Hopkins could reduce

corruption. Likewise, if state and local relief administrators possessed administrative and fiscal

discretion, they could pursue their own political ends. Accordingly, our empirical approach

                                                                                                     6
considers the development of administrative policy. We examine the specific role that

administrative discretion played in the difference between Senate and House versions of bills,

differences that correspond directly to the interests of state and local governments. We also

compare the allocation of funds between the states under FERA and the WPA. Hopkins

possessed a much wider range of policy instruments to control the distribution of federal funds

within states under the WPA, and we expect and find that the allocation of WPA spending

differed significantly from the FERA allocations. When Roosevelt and Hopkins gained more

discretion over the distribution of funds within the states, they increased the attention to

promoting relief, recovery, and reform and to reducing fraud and other forms of illegal

corruption.



III. Early Relief: 1933 to 1935
       Early twentieth century American social welfare policy had its roots in the English Poor

Law. Relief was administered locally through a complex network of public and private agencies,

ranging from the poorhouse to the Community Chest, who assessed need and distributed
benefits. The intellectual high ground in the emerging field of social work was dominated by

private, rather than public, organizations. The centuries old debate over using relief to care for

the truly needy as opposed to a dole for the idle, shiftless, and worthless produced a philosophy

of social welfare focused on the individual case. Social workers identified the deserving poor

and relief was tailored to suit the needs of the needy and to discourage the dissolute.

Independent private social agencies could make these distinctions without bias. The preference

for private rather than public relief was further strengthened by the general low regard for the

capacity of local governments, run by local machine politicians, and staffed by untrained

politicos as rewards for political service.6 Public relief agencies were tainted by the possibility
of the using relief for political purposes. Patronage and political influence – political corruption

                                                                                                      7
– rather than the interests of the poor, were believed to motivate public relief.7
       The sharp division between the proponents of private and public relief is clear evidence

of the deep rooted concern over competence and corruption in the administration of public

relief.8 It is very difficult to credibly measure the extent of corruption in the administration of

relief before, during, or after the New Deal. It is, however, a matter of historical record that a

significant share relief was administered by private social welfare agencies before 1933, and that

private administration was preferred to public administration largely on grounds of competence

and political corruption. These fears did not miraculously disappear in 1933. As we discuss,

private social workers continued to argue that public relief was potentially corrupt well into the

mid-1930s. By the 1950s, when social welfare advocates continued to complain about the

inadequacy of relief in the state administered categorical programs, charges of political

corruption were not to be found.9 This is clear historical evidence of a reduction in the

prevalence of political corruption in the administration of relief over the course of the New Deal.

       Because of the dominance of the private relief administration in the 1920s, it came as a

surprise when the newly formed Committee on Social Statistics reported in 1929 that, in 15 large

cities, 71.6 percent of all relief funds, whether disbursed by public or private agencies, came

from local governments.10 Relief, it turned out, was often publicly financed even where it was
privately administered. As the depression deepened, both public and private sources of funds

were called upon. The growing burden of relieving the unemployed was well beyond the ability

of private agencies and relief spending by local, and eventually state, governments rose

steadily.11 Public relief officials, who had taken a backseat to professional private social workers

for decades, began exerting a larger influence in planning for a larger relief effort. But the

leadership of the social work movement had their roots in private social agencies, and these

leaders assumed important positions in the national government after 1933. They brought with

them the idea that local public relief administration was inefficient and subservient to politics.

                                                                                                      8
       Those ideas posed problems for Roosevelt and Hopkins when they began operations

under FERA. The dominate philosophy of private social work in the 1920s was to determine

what was best for each relief recipient on a case by case basis, allowing the local relief agency

the maximum degree of flexibility and discretion in spending money. The prospect of

distributing $500 million in federal government funds through the existing system of local public

relief agencies presented a nightmare of accountability for Hopkins. Giving control of the funds

to state and local public relief agencies seemed guaranteed to exacerbate the use of relief for

political and corrupt purposes. Giving control of the funds to private agencies seemed

guaranteed to insure that millions of decisions about who would receive how much relief would

be made by social workers in the best interest of the needy, with no possibility of consistently

explaining why one person received relief and another did not.

       Roosevelt and Hopkins were in a hurry, however, and their initial decisions about FERA

reflected the need to start quickly. In the summer of 1933 they had to figure out how to get

hundreds of millions of dollars in relief to millions of families throughout the country. FERA

required Hopkins to distribute the money to the states, even though most states had no formal

structure for administering relief. The understanding was that most of the money would be

distributed by local relief agencies. Hopkins and FERA were given some discretion in passing

out money between the states (in the initial $500 million appropriation, half the money allocated

by matching state and local contributions and the other half as allocated at the discretion of the

administrator on the basis of need). By November 1933 the rule-based matching features of the

allocation were dispensed with and Hopkins was given full discretion to pass out the funds to the

states while taking into account need and state and local contributions to the effort. Hopkins

could use this discretionary fiscal power to influence the standards of relief administration within

individual states. The original appropriation seriously underestimated the nation’s relief needs.

FERA spent roughly $4,000 million between the summer of 1933 and the summer of 1935,

                                                                                                     9
under a series of emergency Congressional appropriations.

       Hopkins made three key administrative decisions in 1933: (1) All relief funds would be

spent by public agencies; (2) Relief benefits would be set on a case by case basis using a need

based standard;12 (3) FERA would enforce the highest standards of relief administration
possible, would use the threat of withholding funds to enforce and persuade state and local relief

administrations to meet those standards, and would vigorously prosecute state and local relief

officials who used relief for their own political purposes.

       With the establishment of these rules, Hopkins began to implement procedures to insure

the efficient administration of relief. FERA initiated a program requiring each state to file

monthly financial and administrative reports, detailing case loads, benefit payments, and

administrative costs in each county. Hopkins continually pressed states to increase the amount

of funding they provided for relief, to raise the standards of relief administration, and to reduce

corruption and the political use of relief. But Hopkins was continually frustrated in these efforts.

FERA monthly grants were legally the property of the state it was granted to. Hopkins could

only threaten to withhold funds from a state, severely constraining his ability to affect the

administration of relief within a state. Eventually, FERA established a division of investigation

that looked into over a thousand complaints (ranging from the trivial to the felonious). Yet, even

here Hopkins became frustrated because FERA’s decentralized strcuture meant that the states

were responsible for the investigations and the attention to rooting out fraud and corruption

varied significantly across states.

       FERA’s goal was getting the maximum amount of relief to the largest number of people,

quickly, and with a minimum of administrative costs.13 The state and local share of relief

expenditures varied from a high of 62 percent in Rhode Island to a low of 5.4 percent in

Alabama. There was constant friction between FERA and state governments over the

administration and financing of relief. Hopkins threatened to withhold FERA grants to several

                                                                                                  10
states that refused to increase state contributions. The disputes were significant in 12 states. He

made good on his threat to withhold funds in Colorado and Missouri. Dissatisfaction with the

way relief was administered led Hopkins to take over, or “federalize” the administration of relief

in six states.14 In North Dakota, Governor Langer was indicted and convicted for extorting
kickbacks from federal government employees, although he wiggled out of serving jail time. In

Ohio, Governor Davey had a feud with Hopkins over the administration of relief. When

Roosevelt finally authorized the federalization of relief in Ohio his letter began “My Dear Mr.

Hopkins: I have examined the evidence concerning corrupt political influence with relief in the

State of Ohio. Such interference cannot be tolerated for a moment. I wish you to pursue these

investigations diligently and let the chips fall where they may. This administration will not

permit the relief population of Ohio to become the innocent victims of either corruption or

political chicanery”.15

       Roosevelt reaped enormous political gains from the relief programs: he was seen as the

source of relief for millions of American families. At the same time, garnering the credit for

relief obligated Roosevelt to bear the political costs of corruption when it was exposed.16

Roosevelt might be willing risk appearing corrupt by using relief funds for political purposes if

he received the benefits. Roosevelt, however, received no direct benefits from corruption by
others in the system. Thus, Roosevelt’s interest in a system that would not be corrupted at the

state and local level were at odds with the interests of individual Democratic senators,

congressmen, governors, mayors, and state legislators who benefited much less from relief if that

they could not use it for their own political purposes.

       The decision to make FERA a joint effort of national, state, and local governments was

mandated by the national emergency in 1933. There was no other way to spend several billion

dollars on relief on short notice without using the existing relief bureaucracy. The decisions

made by Harry Hopkins about how relief would be administered inevitably involved setting the

                                                                                                  11
interests of the federal government at odds with state and local governments and, critically,

involved conflicts between the president and Congress over how the relief program should be

structured. Out of the resolution of these conflicts emerged the modern welfare state.



IV. Relief after 1935
        Planning for a more permanent relief system began in 1933. From FERA’s beginning its

loose administrative structure embroiled Hopkins in arguments with governors and state relief

systems across the country about how much financial support state governments would provide,

how relief benefits were to be determined, what constituted adequate relief, whether relief was to

be given in cash or in kind, and over state and local efforts to bend the administration of relief to

serve political ends. Characteristically, Republicans accused Hopkins of playing politics with

relief while Democrats accused Hopkins of appointing Republicans to important relief posts.

There was no happy medium for Hopkins. His only certain solution to corruption was to create a

national relief agency, staffed by civil servants answerable only to Hopkins; that solution was

not acceptable to Congress or state and local governments. The compromise reached in 1935

enabled Hopkins and the federal government to put some bounds on the agency problem they

faced in allocating federal relief at the local level.17
        The second stage of New Deal relief administration was marked by the passage of the

Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 (ERAA) and the Social Security Act of 1935

(SSA). The two bills embodied the compromise between the President and the Congress. Both

bills were introduced in January, the ERAA passed in March and the SSA in August. Two

distinctions were critical: between employable and unemployable persons and between the

emergency and the permanent relief programs. The ERAA appropriated $4.8 billion for the

relief of the unemployed, to be spent at the discretion of the President, through agencies

unnamed in the bill but to be created under its authority (these ultimately included the WPA,

                                                                                                   12
REA, FSA, and the NYA). This was emergency legislation: a one-time, temporary appropriation

of funds for the relief of employable persons (people who would have been employed had it not

been for the depression).18 The emergency appropriation was intended to tide the country over
until the “permanent” relief structure could be put in place.

       The Social Security Act created the permanent program. Congress placed old age

insurance under the administration of the national Social Security Board. Administration of the

categorical relief programs was lodged with state governments and financed by matching

national grants. Unemployment Insurance was funded by a nationally administered payroll tax.

UI programs were administered by state governments, which could draw on their individual state

funds. Because states had a right to draw on their UI funds and the rules in categorical programs

called for federal matching of qualified state expenditures, the national government had virtually

no control over spending in this part of the welfare system.19 Although the Social Security

Board was responsible for approving the initial design of state programs, actual administration of

the programs was left up to the states. Significantly, the Board was explicitly prohibited from

interfering with personnel policies of the state administration or withholding matching funds

because of personnel policies. Control over patronage in unemployment insurance and

categorical relief programs was firmly located at the state and local level. The Board did have
some ability to enforce standards of relief administration, a power that became important later.

During the FERA administration, Hopkins had used the threat of withholding funds and

federalizing relief to pressure state relief administrations. Those tools were taken away from the

national administration in the Social Security Act.

       The elements of the compromise were clear. Roosevelt was given a free hand in the

administration of emergency relief for the remainder of the depression. The emergency

programs created under the ERAA, of which the WPA was the most important, provided the

lion’s share of relief for the rest of the 1930s. How Roosevelt used his authority was up to him,

                                                                                                   13
subject to Congress’s power to approve further appropriations. Congressional Democrats lost

the immediate advantage of controlling relief. But their position as the majority party was

strengthened by the prospect of Roosevelt’s reelection, and they could reasonably expect to share

in some of the benefits of administering relief through the normal political process. Roosevelt

and Hopkins could not afford to alienate powerful congressional interests. And in the permanent

program almost all of the discretionary powers over relief administration had been reserved for

the states. There the national government’s hands were tied, fiscally and administratively.

       Private social welfare professionals were incensed at what it perceived to be a betrayal of

their basic principles. Control over the permanent relief program was given back to the states.

National support and administration of relief was abandoned. Responsibility for general relief,

relief for those who did not fit into a category of relief supported under the Social Security

program, was returned to local governments. Only the needy who were unemployed, aged,

blind, or dependent children came under the protection of the federal system. They feared that

the compromise of 1935 cast relief back into the realm of politics: “One of the greatest

difficulties in the way of sound organization [after 1935] was political interference with

legislation and standards of personnel... The fact remains that much of the confusion and many

of the backward steps taken in state and local administration were due to political pressures”

(Brown 1940, p. 321).



V. Congress and the Politics of Relief: Geography and Jurisdiction
       Political institutions that endure must provide political actors with incentives to maintain

the system. Prior to 1933, local governments dominated the provision of public relief and the

financing of private relief. Accepted wisdom was that local public relief was more corruptible

than private relief: relief was more likely to go to the politically connected needy, or at least to

those in need willing to pledge their vote; that relief expenditures were likely to line the pockets

                                                                                                   14
of patrons; that funds were likely to go to wards or counties where votes mattered; and that

administrative jobs went not to those with professional training but those enjoying political

patronage. If the New Deal relief programs challenged these local prerogatives, why did

politicians elected from state and local constituencies support the New Deal reforms? Or, as

many have argued, did elected politicians support New Deal relief programs because they

believed that they perpetuated, rather than reformed, the local political abuses of relief?

       In this section, we examine the passage of New Deal legislation to determine whether

Congress played politics with relief. Did the House and Senate design the rules and

administrative authority in the relief bills in ways that enhanced their own gains from the relief

programs? First, differences between House and Senate versions of the same bill are examined

to see if the two branches of Congress designed the rules for allocating funds between large and

small states in a predictable way. Large states are better represented in the House and small

states in the Senate. These differences provide a simple and clean test of whether politics

mattered in the political economy of New Deal spending. Second, differences between House

and Senate versions of the same bill are scrutinized to see if the House was more likely to create

administrative discretion and authority at the local level and if the Senate was more likely to

create administrative discretion and authority at the state level. Since using relief for political

ends required administrative discretion, these results give us an indirect indication of what

politicians hoped to accomplish by structuring the relief programs in particular ways. The ten

important pieces of relief legislation during the New Deal are listed in Table 3.

       Congress influenced the geographical allocation of relief spending in two ways. First,

within a given program legislation could specify that funds be spent in a particular way or

according to a given formula. For example, in the Federal Emergency Relief Act, HR 4606 72nd

Congress, the Senate bill appropriated $500 million to be divided between a $300 million

matching fund ($3 state to $1 national matching rate) and a $200 million discretionary fund to be

                                                                                                      15
allocated by the Relief Administrator. The House bill allocated $250 million to each fund. The

Act was ultimately passed with the House allocation. We can compare how the $50 million

would have been allocated under the House and Senate versions, using the actual allocation of

funds in the discretionary and matching funds to guide the counterfactual. Alternatively,

Congress could have distributed funds between programs with different patterns of allocation. In

the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, HR 9830 73rd Congress, the Senate proposed

a transfer of $100 million in FERA funds to the Public Works Administration (PWA); the House

version did not transfer the funds. Since FERA and the PWA expenditures across states were

different, we can compare the House and Senate allocations by examining how the $100 million

would have been spent under the two proposals.

       The difference between the House and Senate allocation of funds to state i is:

(1) DFi = House allocationi - Senate allocationi.
The proposition that the House will allocate more funds to large states better represented in the

House than in the Senate can be tested using the regression:

(2) DFi = a + b · Voting Sharei,

where the independent variable is the voting share of state i in the House.

       The House and Senate differed over the allocation of funds in seven of the ten pieces of
New Deal relief legislation. Estimates of equation (2) for those seven bills are shown in Table 4.

The dollar differences ranged between $50 million to $200 million, significant amounts of

money but fairly small portions of the overall appropriations. In five of those cases the

differences between the House and Senate versions were positively and statistically significantly

related to a state’s voting share in the House. In the other two cases the coefficients were

statistically insignificant, one positive and the other negative. Geographical interests in most

cases were an important determinant of differences between the House and Senate.

       A curiosity of the regression results lends additional support to the geographic story. We

                                                                                                   16
can solve for the voting share in the House that results in no difference between the House and

Senate versions (that is, x = -a/b from equation 2). The last column in Table 4 lists the implied

"critical size” for each regression estimate. In six of the seven cases, states with 15 votes in the

House received more money from the House bill than the Senate bill. Only nine states had 14 or

more votes in the House, but the total vote of those states was 217, one vote shy of a majority of

the 435 House votes. The nine states that, on average, benefited more from the House version

than the Senate version were the minimum number of states required to pass legislation in the

House.

         The House and Senate allocations differ in systematic and understandable ways.

Unemployment, and therefore relief spending at the state level, was concentrated in the large

industrial states of the northeast and upper Midwest. These states were much better represented

in the House, and the House pursued programs that allocated relative large amounts of money to

large states. An important way of doing that was through matching grants, since the more

wealthy, industrial, and hard hit states spent more of their own state and local funds on relief and

therefore qualified for larger matching grants. The Senate, on the other hand, tended to prefer

(relative to the House) programs and methods of allocation that favored the geographically large,

sparsely populated states of the west and Midwest. They preferred allocation formulae, like

population or land size, that funneled more money into the west. They also showed a strong

preference for large public works projects, like the type conducted by Harold Ickes and the PWA

located primarily in western states with an abundance of public land, over the small, often urban

work relief projects conducted by Harry Hopkins and the WPA.20
         Jurisdictional differences between the House and Senate were more marked and more

important than geographic differences. Jurisdictional matters determined which level of

government possessed elements of administrative discretion. Geographical differences usually

arose over substantial amounts of money but were minor in relation to the whole relief package,

                                                                                                   17
and they never proved to be a significant impediment to the passage of legislation. Jurisdictional

disputes, however, were fought over central issues of administrative control and, on at least one

occasion, were capable of bringing the whole legislative process to a halt.21 There were four
dimensions of administrative discretion: decisions about money, patronage, project selection,

and recipient selection. In general, we expect the House to locate administrative control over

these functions at the local level and the Senate to locate control at the state level. Table 5 lists

the ten relief bills, whether there was a difference in one of these four areas, and whether the

difference was as expected (Y if it was; N if it was not). An example from each category:

       1) Money: The very first relief bill, HR 12445 72nd Congress, authorized the

Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) to make loans to the states for relief purposes. The

Senate version of the bill restricted RFC loans to the states. Local governments could not apply.

The House version of the bill allowed cities to apply directly to the RFC for loans, rather than

going through the state government. In this case the House version was adopted.

       2) Patronage: In the ERAA of 1935, the House proposed that any county relief agency

was required to hire its administrative employees from the residents of that county, which would

have given local relief authorities and congressmen strong control over patronage. The Senate

version stipulated that administrative employees within a state had to live within the state, but

employees from one county could be hired in another county. Neither restrictive residency

requirement survived in the final bill.

       3) Project Selection: Under the WPA, a class of projects called "federal projects" were

financed and administered directly by the WPA with no state or local sponsorship. The most

prominent of these were the art and theater projects. In the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act

of 1939, both versions of the bill eliminated all federal theater projects, and the House version of

the bill required that any new federal projects have a local sponsor. The Senate bill had no

provision for local sponsorship. The local sponsorship provision stayed in the final bill.

                                                                                                    18
       4) Recipient Selection: There was never a hard and fast legislative decision on who

should select the recipients for the WPA. In practice local relief agencies "referred" potential

recipients to the WPA, and it was usually impossible to receive a WPA relief job without the

referral.22 Local relief agencies were not paid, at least not directly, for this task and so
effectively remained independent of the WPA. Hopkins and the WPA several times requested

funds from Congress to pay local relief agencies for providing referral services, and a provision

for payment was included in several Senate bills. In every case the provision was eliminated

from the bill by the House. Hopkins was unable to exert even indirect control on local recipient

selection by providing money for the referral service, money that could have been withheld or

reduced.

       These examples are indicative of House and Senate concerns in relief legislation. As

Table 5 shows, differences in the kind of administrative arrangements preferred by the House

and Senate were frequent, persistent, and systematic. In 17 of the 18 cases where the House and

Senate differed over administrative procedures, the differences are as predicted.23 Both Senators

and Congressmen were interested in locating administrative control of the relief program at the

level of government where they exercised the most control.



VI. Roosevelt’s Interests: Comparing the Intra-State Allocation of FERA and WPA Funds
       Dividing administrative control over relief between national, state, and local governments

was the key element in the compromise of 1935. Congress located administrative control over

the permanent categorical relief programs, unemployment insurance, and general relief at the

state level. The national government was given control of the emergency relief programs and the

permanent social insurance program. Roosevelt and Hopkins were given a blank check for $4.8

billion in the ERAA of 1935. The magnitude of the change in New Deal relief administration

cannot be underestimated. Although control of the permanent welfare program remained largely

                                                                                                   19
with the states, the permanent program took time to implement. For the remainder of the 1930s

and the depression, the national government would be the largest provider of relief in the country

and the ERAA of 1935 gave Roosevelt and Hopkins wide latitude and discretion in how they

administered that relief.

       The WPA succeeded FERA as the primary national program for the relief of the

unemployed. Like FERA, the WPA under Hopkins provided work relief to over 2 million cases

each month. Under the FERA structure, Hopkins had not possessed the discretion to allocate

funds within states. When a state strayed from the administration’s goals, the public was likely to

blame the Roosevelt administration as much or more than they blamed the state and local

politicians. To guide the state back to the proper path, Hopkins could try friendly persuasion or

go to the extreme of withdrawing funds or federalizing relief. But he had no intermediate

punishments. This was not a problem under the centralized structure of the WPA. WPA

administrative employees worked directly for the federal government and the WPA

administrators controlled the intra-state allocations of WPA funds.24
       The next section examines the WPA rules and procedures adopted by Hopkins to control

illegal corruption in the distribution of relief. This section examines how centralization limited

political corruption in the distribution of funds. Roosevelt’s critics argued that greater federal
control under the WPA allowed Roosevelt and Hopkins to better manipulate relief allocations for

political purposes. If we are correct that Hopkins and Roosevelt sought to limit political

manipulation by state and local officials within the states, we should see that the distribution of

relief within states more closely matched the stated goals of relief, recovery, and reform under

the WPA than under FERA and that political considerations had less influence on intra-state

allocations under the WPA than under FERA. Information on the allocation of WPA and FERA

spending from over 3000 counties is used to examine the differences in the intra-state

distribution of WPA and FERA funds. In order to compare allocation policies directly, the

                                                                                                     20
values for every variable (dependent and independent) for each county are normalized by

subtracting the state mean for that variable and then by dividing the difference by the standard

deviation within the same state. As a result every variable has a mean of zero and a standard

deviation of one within each state. This facilitates comparison of the coefficients determining

spending for FERA, the WPA, and the difference between the two programs.25 We include key
variables that influence the distribution of relief grants, as discussed in the literature on the

allocation of New Deal funds.

        One group of variables measures economic conditions across counties that reflect the

New Deal’s stated goals of relieving financial distress, promoting recovery, and redistributing

income. Relief spending should have been positively related to a measure of unemployment

(measured in the 1930 census), negatively related to economic growth from 1929 to 1933

(measured as the change in log retail sales per capita between 1929 and 1933), negatively related

to a measure of the share of high income people (the percent of the population paying income

taxes in 1929), and negatively related to a measure of average consumption in 1929 (retail sales

per capita in 1929). Unemployment relief programs were targeted at urban areas, so the

coefficient on percent urban should be positive.

        The second group of variables reflects political factors. The Roosevelt administration

may have used the allocation of funds to promote their prospects for re-election by rewarding

long-term loyal Democrats (measured by the mean percent voting Democrat in presidential

elections from 1896 through 1928), by trying to attract voters who were relatively fickle in their

support of the Democrats (measured by the standard deviation of the percent voting Democrat

from 1896 through 1928), by rewarding voters who swung to Roosevelt in 1932 (the percent

voting for Roosevelt in 1932 minus the mean percent voting Democrat from 1896 through 1928),

or by spending more in areas with higher turnout (the number of presidential votes in 1932

relative to the population in 1930).26

                                                                                                    21
       The first two specifications in Table 6 show the results for the WPA and FERA

separately. With regard to the economic variables, both programs provided more funds per

capita in urban areas, provided more funds in counties with higher unemployment, and provided

fewer funds to higher income counties as measured by retail sales per capita. FERA provided

more funds, while the WPA provided fewer funds, to counties with higher tax returns per capita.

On the political side, both FERA and WPA gave less money to counties that traditionally voted

Democratic and more money to counties that swung to Roosevelt in 1932 and that had higher

voter turnout. FERA gave more funds to counties with higher variance in their party voting,

while the WPA gave less to these counties.

       Our specific interest, however, is in the differences between the responses of the FERA

and the WPA to key variables; therefore, we focus on the third specification in Table 6 where the

dependent variable is per capita WPA spending minus per capita FERA spending. The results of

the comparison are consistent with our view that when Hopkins gained more control of the intra-

state allocations he reduced state and local political manipulation by focusing spending more on

relief, recovery, and reform.

       The WPA distributed relatively more funds within states to areas with greater

unemployment, lower economic activity, and a higher urban share of the population. Because of

the way the variables were scaled, a one-unit change in a variable represents a change of one

standard deviation in each variable. A one standard deviation increase in the unemployment rate

produced an increase in WPA funds that was 0.055 standard deviations larger than the response

by FERA. A similar increase in retail sales per capita in 1929, our measure of economic activity,

was associated with a reduction in WPA spending that was .08 standard deviations greater than

for FERA spending. A one standard deviation increase in percent urban led to a response by the

WPA that was .09 standard deviations larger. All three differences are statistically significant.

The differential response in WPA and FERA spending in urban areas is particularly telling.

                                                                                                    22
Representation in state legislatures was skewed in favor of rural areas. The national government

was already distributing large amounts of aid to farmers through agricultural programs. Hopkins

wanted FERA and the WPA to focus on relief of unemployed workers, not low income farmers.

Thus, when Hopkins gained control under the WPA he managed to shift funds back to urban

areas. There is one exception in our findings. The FERA was more responsive to the depths of

the crash between 1929 and 1933, as measured by the growth (or reduction) in retail sales per

capita in those years.

       The results in Table 6 for the political variables suggest that Hopkins and Roosevelt

resisted the temptation to take advantage of greater discretion by more vigorously pursuing

political goals when they gained more control under the WPA. The effect of long-term swing

voters and voter turnout on intra-state allocations were statistically significantly lower by .06 and

.03 for the WPA than for FERA, respectively. The response to the Roosevelt swing voters was

also lower under the WPA, but not in a statistically significant way.

       The major bone of contention in the political economy of New Deal spending debate is

whether economic or political factors influenced the allocation of federal spending. These

results clearly show that when control over the intra-state allocation of relief funds shifted from

state and local politicians to Hopkins that the political influence on intra-state allocations was

reduced and intra-state allocations were more responsive to economic conditions.


VII.   Rules and Procedures

       The switch from the FERA to the WPA offered Hopkins more than greater discretion

over how relief funds were allocated within states. It also gave him more central authority over

the monitoring of relief administration. The WPA continued FERA’s efforts to collect financial

information from state and local agencies in a timely manner. Because WPA funds were federal

funds, the WPA was better able to audit the finances on individual projects whether the projects


                                                                                                     23
were carried out by state or local governments or by the WPA itself. Administrative discretion

was reduced in several areas. The WPA introduced a “security wage” policy which set the

wages of WPA employees according to a formula that took into account the employees’ skill, the

size of the locality in which the work was performed, and the prevailing wage for work in the

area. Hours of work and standards of construction on WPA projects were more closely

controlled.

       The move from the FERA to the WPA allowed Hopkins to reorganize and strengthen the

investigations of complaints concerning improper administration of relief and corruption. Under
FERA such investigations were carried out by small staffs at the federal or state level. The

administration of relief “was a new problem and a new field of investigative work” and the

approaches taken were as “variable as the number of states themselves” (WPA Division of

Investigation 1943, p. 1). FERA established a Division of Special Inquiry in October 1934, that

operated out of the Washington, D.C. office. Investigative efforts often were uncoordinated and

were hampered at times by the transfer of legal ownership of relief funds to the state on reception

of the grant. States, as a result, were the primary investigators when charges were raised.

       Roosevelt’s Executive Order creating the WPA established a “division of progress

investigation,” designed “to coordinate the pertinent work of existing investigating agencies of

the government so as to insure the honest execution of the relief programs” (WPA 1943, p. 4).

The Division had its own director and field organization directly responsible to the

Administrator. The functions of the Division, “covered the investigation of all complaints

alleging fraud or loss to the government or violations of Federal statutes as they applied to the

expenditure of relief funds. More specifically these functions included the handling of

complaints that funds were being diverted to private rather than public benefit; that false

statements had been made in obtaining allocations or benefits from relief money; that pay rolls

for either personal services or the rental of equipment by WPA were being padded; complaints of


                                                                                                    24
extortion or kickbacks, of theft or embezzlement, or bribery or the collection of illegal fees; that

false compensation claims had been filed by WPA employees or that fraud existed in

competitive bidding on government contracts; that vendors to the government were not

delivering in line with their contracts; that forgery had been committed in work assignments,

time reports, or other official documents, and other less common types of fraud in the handling

of federal funds” (WPA 1943, p. 5). The Division later investigated violations of the Hatch Act,

prohibiting “pernicious political activity” and provisions passed by Congress in 1939 preventing

aliens from receiving WPA employment.
       A staff of 50 was based in Washington, supplemented by field offices in 15 cities,

originally, and later in the regional offices. The number of field agents peaked in number at 73,

supplemented by “resident agents” throughout the country.27 There were plenty of complaints.

The records of the investigative division take up 415 cubic feet plus numerous rolls of microfilm

in the National Archives. In 1937 alone, the Division conducted 3,280 investigations.

       The Division evaluated complaints, investigated them if necessary, and then, if a problem

was found, turned cases over to the Attorney General’s office for prosecution. The Division

investigated and reported on 17,352 cases. In 8,811 the charges were substantiated. A total of

2,215 were referred to the Attorney General for criminal prosecution. Of the remaining 6,596

substantiated cases, 4,496 persons were dismissed, demoted, suspended, reprimanded or

debarred. When a subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations of the House investigated

the WPA in 1940 they could not uncover a single serious irregularity that had not previously

been investigated by the Division.

       The switch from the FERA to the WPA gave Hopkins a great deal more authority over

the activities of state and local WPA projects. It is clear that he took this opportunity to establish

better monitoring of the programs. He and Roosevelt were concerned that charges of corruption

left to fester and later be uncovered by Congressional investigations would significantly damage


                                                                                                   25
the success of the program and ultimately the administration. Therefore, they established a more

centralized investigative division that routinely investigated complaints and pressed for the

prosecution of political and criminal corruption.



VIII. Concluding Remarks
       The modern American welfare state was created during the New Deal. Prior to 1933, the

burden of caring for the needy and unemployed fell on local governments. By late 1935, a

system of nationally funded and administered old age insurance was in place; federally funded

and state administered programs providing old age assistance, aid to dependent children, aid to

the blind, and unemployment insurance were in place; and a substantial emergency relief

structure with both national and state components was working to see the nation through the last

years of the depression. Before 1932, the administration of public relief was widely regarded as

politically corrupt, a concern so prevalent that a significant portion of the nation’s relief systems

were administered by private social welfare agencies. Although political opponents of the New

Deal often complained about the use of relief for political purposes, by 1940, charges of
corruption had diminished considerably. Corruption within the relief programs was reduced.

How this contributed to the overall level of corruption in the political system within the New

Deal is not clear. The importance of political machines is often claimed to have declined over

the course of the New Deal, partly because the provision of national relief undercut the provision

of local relief by the machines. But as we have documented, part of the relief system remained

in the administrative hands of the local governments, albeit with more supervision from the

Social Security Board.28

       The transformation of public relief in the United States from corrupt to bureaucratic

occurred because of the political interests of President Roosevelt and his administration. Local

officials, state politicians, and members of Congress were in a position to use relief in the time

                                                                                                     26
tested and corrupt ways: getting politically connected people on relief, letting contracts for

materials and supplies to political allies, and using administrative jobs to reward loyal followers.

Roosevelt, on the other hand, had little use for this type of political machination. The gratitude

of millions of relief recipients and the general public impression that the administration was

moving decisively to relieve the worst victims of the depression garnered votes for Roosevelt.

That support would have evaporated if relief had been administered in a visibly corrupt manner.

       The Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the first New Deal relief program, was

created in the spring of 1933 to rapidly distribute millions of dollars to families in immediate

need of financial assistance. It was impossible for Roosevelt and Hopkins to solve the agency

problem they faced. The crisis forced them to distribute relief money through the established

local public relief administrations; it was the only existing structure capable of administering

relief to over 4 million families each month. Inevitably, some of the $4 billion distributed to

states between 1933 and 1935 was used to further the political ends of state and local politicians.

FERA’s loose administrative structure did not give Roosevelt and Hopkins the administrative

tools to limit local politicians from capturing some of the rents for themselves. As we have seen,

Congress was complicit in the political maneuvering. The Senate persistently sought to allocate

more money to small states well represented in the Senate, while the House worked to allocate

more money to large states better represented in the House. The Senate tried to locate

administrative control of relief at the state level, and the House tried to locate control at the local

level. Both were generally hostile to locating administrative control at the national level.

       The deal struck in 1935 with the passage of the Emergency Relief Appropriations Act

and the Social Security Act gave the Roosevelt administration authority over the distribution of

emergency relief. Congress insured, however, that states retained control over important

elements of the permanent relief program: unemployment insurance, aid to the blind, old age

assistance, and aid to dependent children, but were subject to federal oversight. Although we

                                                                                                     27
stress the difference in the interests of Congress and the executive branch, this should not

obscure the importance that all Democrats placed on re-electing Roosevelt. Giving Roosevelt

control over the emergency relief program allowed him to claim credit for providing relief and

employment to millions of families every month. Voters responded by supporting Roosevelt.

When Roosevelt and Hopkins obtained more control over the intra-state allocation of WPA relief

funds, they targeted the allocation of funds within states more at the high-minded goals of relief,

recovery, and reform and resisted increasing the role of presidential politics.

       The other side of the bargain gave states more control over the administration of

categorical relief and unemployment insurance, as well as complete fiscal autonomy. But state

independence came with a catch. The Social Security Board could not force states to spend more

or less on relief, nor could it decide who would staff administrative positions, but it could and

did require that relief be administered in a fair and impartial manner. The development of

welfare entitlements and the evolution of higher standards of welfare administration in the states

under the watchful eye of the Social Security Board are a subject beyond our current story.

       Our explanation for why the New Deal relief policies sought to reduce corruption does

not imply that politics played any less of a role in the 1930s than politics played before the Great

Depression. It was in Roosevelt’s political interest to reduce corruption from the administration

of relief at the state and local level. It was political interest, and not only enlightened social

policy, that contributed to the reduction in corruption.

the months June through December of that year. The UI listing in 1940 is the average monthly
case load for the months January through June of 1940. The CWA listing in 1934 includes a
peak of 4.311 million cases in January 1934 down to 1.1 million cases in April after the program

Notes and Sources: (t-statistics in parentheses). The values for each variable have been
normalized by subtracting the state mean and dividing by the state standard deviation. WPA and
FERA spending information is from the U.S. Office of Government Reports (1940). It was
converted to per capita spending by dividing by the population in 1930. Retail sales information
from 1933 is from U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce
(1936). The 1929 retail sales information, percent urban in 1930, population in 1930 and 1940,
and the ratio of unemployed to gainfully employed in 1930 is from Historical, Demographic,
Economic, and Social Data: The United States, 1790-1970, ICPSR tape number 0003, as
                                                                                              34
corrected by Michael Haines. The population figures used to create our per capita estimates for
1929 and 1933 retail spending were calculated using linear interpolations of the 1930 and 1940
populations. The tax return information comes from U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of
Foreign and Domestic Commerce (1932). The mean Democratic share of the presidential vote
from 1896-1928, the percent voting for Roosevelt in 1932 minus the mean Democratic share
from 1896 to 1928, the standard deviation of the Democratic share of the presidential vote from
1896 to 1932, and the percent of adults voting in 1932 were all calculated using information
from ICPSR’s United States Historical Election Returns, 1824-1968 (ICPSR tape number 0001).
 The data set consists of 3,061 counties and county/city combinations in the United States. The

1
 The literature begins with Arrington (1969 and 1970), Reading (1973), and Wright (1974), and
continues in Wallis (1984, 1987, and 1991). Anderson and Tollison (1991) criticized Wright and
Wallis for not including Congressional information, which led to the response by Wallis (1998)
and the exchange between Fleck (2001) and Wallis (2001). Couch and Shugart (1998 and 2000)
examined New Deal spending as well. Investigation of the determinants of county allocations
and a summary of the entire literature can be found in Fishback, Kantor, and Wallis (2003).

  A restriction on the “extension or improvement of streets and utilities in relatively
underdeveloped areas… was the direct result of cases developed by the Division [of
Investigation], some of which were prosecuted in Federal courts, showing that, at times and
through subterfuge, real estate firms or developing companies, for example, sought to divert
relief funds to their own benefit in constructing streets and private utilities in undeveloped areas
to the enhancement of the value of the real estate owned by them” (Works Progress
Administration Division of Investigation 1943, p. 7).
3
  “This type of case involved the submission of false time claims to the government in the rental
of equipment; the short delivery of materials to WPA projects by venders, at times in collusion
with WPA supervisory employees; or the furnishing of equipment or material below the
specifications of the contract which resulted in loss to the Government. Cases of this character
frequently involved considerable amounts of money… In this connection, it should be
remembered that the Works Projects Administration operated a program consisting of projects
which ranged from the building of two miles of farm-to-market road in Texas, to the
construction of LaGuardia Airport at New York City” (Works Progress Administration Division
on Investigation 1943, p. 23).

  “Due to the fact that the program employed large numbers of people, frequently in rather small
units, an operation involving the preparation of a vast number of payrolls, irregularities in
connection with these payrolls were the most common type of complaint. These irregularities in
general consisted of normal and routine “padding” operations in which persons were paid for
time when they were absent from their WPA duties of were dually employed” (Works Progress
Administration Division of Investigation 1943, p. 21).
5
 The evidence for the New Deal’s success at eliminating political corruption is the virtual
absence of complaints, for example, that party orientation of a recipient has any impact on the
probability of getting a social security check or and AFDC payment. Evidence that political
corruption was important before the New Deal is presented in the historical section.
6
 On the general low opinion in which local government was held by public administration
experts and political scientists in the early years of the twentieth century see Brock (1988, pp.
50-83. “When Americans used the word ‘politician’ in a derogatory sense (as they often did),

                                                                                                    39
they had most in mind the local official in city wards, townships, or counties seeking patronage
and spoils, favoring friends, juggling contracts, and acknowledging some obligation to their
party but none to the community. Civic reformers, students of public administration, and almost
every issue of the American Political Science Review produced abundant evidence of local
incompetence.” (p. 51).
7
  “There was ample evidence in the reports of the studies already mentioned that this system
[pre-New Deal local relief] encouraged petty graft as well as the use of relief for political power.
 Merchants sometimes failed to report the death of customers who were on the relief lists and
continued to collect for their private tills the pittances of the dead from the relief funds of the
town or county. Legal restrictions on pauper voting were usually not enforced in the states
where they existed. Hence men and women on relief built up a solid vote for officials from
whom they got relief.” See Brown (1940, p. 16).
8
  “Most relief workers on either the private or public side were chiefly bent on destructive
criticism and critical comment regarding the opposition” (Brown 1940, p. 45). “The community
of interests in public welfare shared by both the voluntary social agency and the political
authority have not always prevented the private agency from viewing the government as an
inimical and antagonistic body opposed to the constituents of the private agency, instead of
being their political creature and the medium of their democratic expression of their ideals and
purposes” (quote of Joseph Logan by Brown 1940, p. 53). Brown’s first chapter is a discussion
of the national, state, and local responsibility for relief and the conflict between private and
public relief advocates.
9
  Brock (1988), Brown (1940), and Katz (1986, pp. 36-57) talk extensively about the problem of
politics, corruption, and relief prior to the 1930s. Historical studies of the post-New Deal
programs spend almost no time discussing corruption. Harsh critics of the welfare system, such
as Piven and Cloward (1993) and Katz (1986) argue that relief has become an instrument of
social control, but conceded that relief had become more professionally administered. There is
little discussion of corruption in the distribution of relief funds after the New Deal.
10
  See Brown (1940, p. 55). “The amazement with which this information was received and the
significance attached to it are shown by the extent to which the figures are cited in the literature
of the period. They appear like a refrain, in conference papers and reports, magazine articles,
statements of policy and recommendations for programs put out by national and local agencies,
both public and private. They are quoted with satisfaction and triumph by proponents of public
welfare and with some consternation and trepidation by private agency executives.” p. 56.

  New York was the first state to establish an unemployment relief agency, the Temporary
Emergency Relief Administration (TERA) in May 1931. Roosevelt was Governor and Harry
Hopkins was appointed the first TERA administrator. By May of 1933, 22 states had provided
some money for unemployment relief, but not all states had a functioning state relief

                                                                                                   40
administration.

   Local relief agencies investigated each case, determined the amount of resources available to
each family or individual in need, and then determined the benefits to be paid each month as the
difference between the families’ available resources and the relief “standard” for families of a
given size. This reflected the philosophy of private social work that each case should be treated
individually. This opened the door to wrangling about the determination of benefits. On the
other hand, it was popular with the social workers who staffed local relief agencies and it gave
the entire relief structure an inherent fiscal flexibility. Since benefits were determined case by
case on the basis of need, it was relatively easy, when budgets got tight, to reduce all benefits
slightly. Had benefits been flat and fixed, adjustments to budget fluctuations would have had to
come in the number of cases rather than the generosity of benefits, which was something
everyone wanted to avoid. Budget flexibility turned out to be important, the initial FERA
appropriation was intended to last two years, but exhausted by the fall of 1933. FERA received
new appropriations roughly every six months. The flow of national, state, and local funds to
local relief agencies was never steady.
13
  During the winter of 1933/1934, Roosevelt established the Civil Works Administration, which
was a temporary program designed to provide jobs for 4 million unemployed. The CWA was a
“national” program, in the sense that the federal government issued checks to individual
recipients, and CWA administrators nominally worked for the federal government. In effect, the
CWA was largely administered by FERA personnel. Most were state and local employees
temporarily transferred to the federal government’s payroll during the winter.
14
   The six states were Oklahoma, North Dakota, Massachusetts, Ohio, Georgia, and Louisiana.
Federal officials federalized relief in Oklahoma on 2/23/34 when the governor announced that he
would not apply for relief unless he had control over the distribution; in North Dakota on 3/1/34
as the result of charges that employees of the state relief administration were being assessed for
political contributions; for work relief in Massachusetts on 3/7/34 because the state had a statute
that all grants from the state had to be distributed on a population basis not on a need basis; in
Ohio on 3/16/35 in a dispute over whether Ohio had supplied a fair share of relief funds; and in
Louisiana (4/8/35) and Georgia (4/19/35) due to long-running disputes between the governors
and federal administrators over the use of the funds. Hopkins withheld funds from Colorado in
December 1933 and from Missouri in April 1935 until the state legislatures produced funds to
help pay for relief. Threats to withhold funds went out to Alabama and Kentucky in 1933 and to
Illinois in 1934. See E.A. Williams (1939, 170-8, 203-5).

   As quoted in Brown (1940), p. 210.

  The “political economy of New Deal spending” literature provides a thorough, but somewhat
inconclusive, picture of the overall use of federal allocation of grants between the states for
political purposes. See the citations in footnote 1. There is evidence that Hopkins was in direct
contact with relief administrations in large cities, including important and influential Democratic


                                                                                                 41
machine politicians. See Dorsett (1977).
17
  The compromise between Congress and Roosevelt in 1935 is studied in detail in Wallis
(1991).
18
     There were also Emergency Relief Appropriation Acts in 1936, 1937, 1938, and 1939.
19
  The Social Security Board could exercise fiscal influence in times of crisis. For example,
when states exhausted their unemployment insurance trust funds, the Board could impose
administrative changes on states in return for providing funds.
20
  The importance of land area in the literature on the political economy of New Deal spending
reflects the geographic differences between the east and west. See Wallis (1998) and the ensuing
exchange between Fleck (2001) and Wallis (2001).
21
   The case where a jurisdictional dispute prevented any legislation from passing was,
interestingly, a relief bill proposed in the last Hoover Congress. The jurisdiction at issue was
national versus state. In January of 1932 a bill sponsored by Senators LaFollette and Costigan,
72nd Congress S. 3045, proposed the creation of a Federal Emergency Relief Board that would
be given $375 million to allocate between the states for relief purposes and an equal amount for
highway construction. Forty percent of the $375 million would be divided between the states on
the basis of population, the remainder to be allocated at the discretion of the relief board. The
bill failed to pass the Senate, but not because of lack of support for relief. A substitute bill was
proposed by Senators Black, Walsh, and Bulkley, which differed in only two ways. The
substitute bill provided loans rather than grants and allocated all of the $375 million on the basis
of population, thereby eliminating the need for a federal board of any kind. The substitute bill
failed by a vote of 48 to 31, the original bill failed the next day, after extensive debate, by a vote
of 48 to 35. Only 15 Senators voted for both bills -- in all 81 Senators had expressed voting
support for some kind of relief program. The bill failed to pass because of differences over how
the program should be administered, specifically whether the states should answer to a national
relief board or be completely free to administer relief on their own. Since only a handful of
states had any existing relief program, the struggle in the Senate was over administrative
arrangements that might be created, not interests that already existed.
22
  It was possible to get a non-relief WPA job without a referral. These jobs were either
supervisory or administrative. See Howard (1943, pp. 356-365) for a discussion of referral
policy.
23
  The one anomaly is a special case. In the original FERAct the Senate inserted a provision
enabling the federal government to take over the administration of relief in a state. This was
called "federalizing" relief and it clearly weakened state independence, which we would not
expect the Senate to do. Later, in 1934, Senator McAdoo from California asked Hopkins to


                                                                                                    42
federalize relief in California, because he was in a political battle with the faction of the party
controlling the relief administration. It appears that the anomaly in Table 5 was the result of the
anticipated political gains that would come to Senators from "federalization." Those gains, it
turns out, never materialized.
24
  There is one caveat. WPA grants were not distributed in the absence of state and local activity.
 States and local jurisdictions lobbied for and spent resources to obtain funds from both FERA
and the WPA. Some of the difference in the distribution within states under the WPA and the
FERA may reflect differences in state and local behavior, as well as differences in Hopkins’s
administrative policy.
25
  We have also explored using the ratio of the county observation to the state mean and had the
same general results. We have also run the analysis by demeaning the variable but not
normalizing. Demeaning the variables does not completely eliminate the scale differences
between the WPA and the FERA. The WPA spent more money so that the variance in spending
was likely to be higher. In such a situation the WPA and FERA could have responded to the
same differences in unemployment by raising spending by 5 percent in that county, but because
the WPA spent more on average, the 5 percent will generate a larger coefficient for the WPA
than for the FERA.
26
  See Wright (1974); Fleck (1994, 1999, and 2001); Wallis (1998 and 2001); and Fishback,
Kantor and Wallis (2003) for empirical analysis of relief spending using these variables.
27
  Agents were often young, 85 percent had professional or college training as lawyers,
accountants, and engineers. A number had been investigators for the FBI or in other settings.
28
  Dorsett concludes his study of the New Deal and the machines with this way: “The second
wrong assumption is that the federal government, by assuming responsibility for welfare
programs, thereby destroyed the machine’s useful role as a service institution. Actually, the
distribution function was not preempted by the federal government: under the New Deal many
welfare programs were financed in Washington, but they were directed at the local level.” (p.
113).
