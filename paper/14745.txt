Socioeconomic Differences in the Health of Black Union Army Soldiers

JEL No. N31,N41

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper investigates patterns of socioeconomic difference in the wartime morbidity and mortality
of black Union Army soldiers. Among the factors that contributed to a lower probability of contracting
and dying from diseases were (1) lighter skin color, (2) a non-field occupation, (3) residence on a large
plantation, and (4) residence in a rural area prior to enlistment. Patterns of disease-specific mortality
and timing of death suggest that the differences in the development of immunity against diseases and
in nutritional status prior to enlistment were responsible for the observed socioeconomic differences
in wartime health. For example, the advantages of light-skinned soldiers over dark-skinned and of
enlisted men formerly engaged in non-field occupations over field hands resulted from differences
in nutritional status. The lower wartime mortality of ex-slaves from large plantations can be explained
by their better-developed immunity as well as superior nutritional status. The results of this paper suggest
that there were substantial disparities in the health of the slave population on the eve of the Civil War.

1. Introduction
         The major purpose of this article is to explore the socioeconomic differences in the
health and mortality of ex-slave Union Army soldiers. More specifically, it investigates how
the probabilities of suffering from illnesses and dying from diseases were related to the
socioeconomic backgrounds of black servicemen prior to the war. Special attention is given
to the relationship between prior exposure to disease and the later health of ex-slaves. As
will be discussed below, this study is related to some broader issues pertaining to the
patterns of health disparities and the role of disease environment in shaping the lives of the
slave population in the antebellum South.2
         In studies of U.S. mortality differentials prior to the twentieth century, blacks have
often been compared as a single group to whites or the population at large. The racial
differences in mortality and health are now fairly well established. Available data have
suggested that the mortality of blacks was considerably higher than that of whites in the
mid-nineteenth century. The life expectancies at birth circa 1850 for whites and blacks were
39.5 years and 23 years; the numbers of deaths per 1000 infants were 216 and 340,
respectively (Haines 2000, 158).
         More detailed studies of the slave population based on plantation records have
suggested that the racial differences in the measures of health were primarily due to the
early-life malnutrition of slaves. The age profile of height shows that the size of slaves
below age five was exceedingly small because of nutritional deficiencies (Steckel 1986).
The excess death rates of children below age five accounted for nearly all of the racial
differences in mortality; the mortality of slaves after age 10 was similar to that of whites.
The stunted final height of slaves can also be explained by early malnutrition. Slaves were
shorter because of the nutritional deficiencies of early childhood but heavier in terms of

  The disparity in measures of health among slaves remains one of the less explored aspects of U.S.
slavery, mainly due to the lack of vital data prior to the twentieth century. An official Death
Registration Area consisting of ten states and the District of Columbia was established in 1900, and
data collection from all states was not complete until 1933. Even in the early twentieth century, the
black population was underrepresented in the Death Registration Areas. The currently available
mortality statistics for the nineteenth century are based mostly on less systematic sources (Haines
2000, 145–151).

weight per inch of height. This indicates that late adolescent and adult slaves were probably
better nourished than whites (Fogel 1989, chapter 5, Fogel, Galantine, and Manning 1992,
#47).
        Although blacks in the mid nineteenth century—and especially slaves in the
antebellum South—were perhaps a more homogeneous population than whites in terms of
socioeconomic status, it appears that there was considerable variation among slaves in
terms of economic well-being and ecological environment according to their occupation,
skin color, and plantation size. Existing evidence suggests that mortality rates on rice
plantations exceeded those on cotton plantations. Disparate environmental conditions (such
as the effect of population aggregation on the rate of spread of diseases) and the intensity of
work according to the type of crop may have played a major role (Fogel 1989, 127).
        Occupational differences in mortality among slaves have also been found. Male
artisans were less than half as likely to die during a given year as male field hands at the
same age. The excess mortality among field hands was perhaps produced by the greater
intensity of work and inadequate sanitary conditions for those who worked with animal
manure during the planting season. This “sanitary condition hypothesis” is supported by the
fact that dysentery and tetanus, which are promoted by poor sanitation and hygiene, were
two of the leading causes of death (Fogel 1989, 128). Margo and Steckel (1992) found that
light-skinned ex-slaves were taller than dark-skinned persons. They also found height
disadvantages associated with living on large plantations and residing in urban areas.
        This paper is distinct from existing studies on socioeconomic differences in the
health of the U.S. slave population in several respects. This is the first attempt to examine
how and why the wartime diseases and deaths of the Union Army troops differed by
personal characteristics and prior place of residence. An advantage of looking into the
wartime experiences is that detailed descriptions of disease diagnoses and the cause and
date of death while in service are contained in the Union Army medical records. These rich
sources make it possible to examine the patterns of diseases, cause-specific mortality, and
timing of deaths as well as general mortality, which have not been done by previous studies.
        Secondly, the special conditions of an army camp during the war provide a unique



                                              3
chance to determine the relationship between socioeconomic background and health. The
Civil War brought together a large number of ex-slaves with heterogeneous personal
characteristics and ecological backgrounds into an extremely unhealthy environment that
caused unusually high rates of disease contraction and consequent mortality. Upon being
mustered into the service, ex-slaves were confined to relatively homogeneous living
conditions in terms of quality of diet, housing, and disease environment. Owing to these
features of army life, it is possible to more clearly identify the effects of socioeconomic and
ecological factors on the degree of susceptibility or resistance to disease.


2. Military Service Records of Black Union Army Soldiers
        Shortly after the outbreak of the American Civil War, leaders of black communities
and prominent white abolitionists in the North demanded that black people be allowed to
join the Union Army, expecting that fighting in the war would pave a way toward liberation
for slaves and greater rights for free black people.3 As the Northern soldiers advanced to
Southern states, many slaves escaped to the territories occupied by the Union Army,
providing the Union with a potential pool of military manpower. In the early stages of the
war, however, Union policy makers were highly reluctant to recruit black men in spite of
potential military advantages on the grounds that the capability of black men to fight in
battles was doubtful, and because enlisting black men into the Union Army could support
the claims of black people to the full citizenship that most Northerners refused to concede.
        Some high-ranking officers, who felt very strongly about the need to organize
black units among fugitive slaves and freemen, moved ahead to recruit, organize, and train
black regiments. In doing so of their own volition, these generals faced official censure and
possible dismissal from the service in disgrace and well as disapproval from military peers.4
Only during 1863 were black men enlisted into Union ranks on a large scale. Repeated

Troops in the Union Army.

  The early black regiments that were organized by such pioneers include the South Carolina
Regiment (organized by Major General David Hunter), the Kansas Regiment (organized by General
James Henry Land), and the Louisiana Native Guard Regiments (organized by Major-General
Benjamin Butler and Brigadier-General John Phelps).


                                               4
defeats of Union Army regiments and growing difficulties in recruiting white volunteers
were major forces responsible for the turnaround of the Union recruitment policy. After the
Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, Northern states started to recruit and
organize “colored regiments.” The Bureau for Colored Troops was established on May 22,
1863, finally creating a coordinated policy for recruitment, organization, administration,
and services for all black regiments, which included white officers. During the Civil War,
179,000 black men enlisted in the Union Army, of whom 146,000 were from slave states,
including the border states (Delaware, Maryland, Missouri, and Kentucky).
         The present study is based on a sample of 5677 black Union Army soldiers in 51
infantry companies who were linked to their military service records.5 The service records
contain very detailed descriptions of the diseases or wounds that recruits suffered during
military service. As soon as a recruit was too ill to report for duty, his condition was noted
in morning reports. If his condition required medical attention, it was recorded in the
regimental surgeon’s report; if he was hospitalized, the diagnosis of the disease was
described in the case history together with the ultimate outcome, such as return to service,
discharge for disabilities, or death (U.S. Surgeon General’s Office 1870, vol. 1).
Information on disease and on date and cause of death in service was gathered from these
sources. Military service records also provide information on demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics of recruits, such as age, occupation at enlistment, place of
birth, and height, among other variables, as well as information about military careers,
including rank, military duty, company, regiment, change in military status, dates of
enlistment and discharge, and so on.

        I selected ex-slaves from this sample based on the states of birth and enlistment.
For many black recruits, the place of enlistment may not have been the place of
residence prior to service. Because of the changes in the principles of recruitment of
blacks in the Union Army, many moved to other states to join the Union Army before
recruitment was permitted in their home state. For instance, many blacks in Kentucky
had fled to enlist in Northern and Tennessee regiments (Berlin, Reidy, and Rowland
1998). Likewise, a large number of blacks in slave states, for whom enlistment was a
road to freedom, moved to Northern states where they could join the Union Army. To
make sure that only former slaves are included, I limited the sample to the 4706 men
who were born and enlisted in slave states.
        Previous studies based on samples of white Union Army recruits suggest that
the degree of exposure to disease prior to enlistment was an important determinant of
the probabilities of contracting disease and death while in service (Lee 1997, 2003). To
consider the effect of county-specific ecological environments, I further selected a
sample of 2264 black soldiers for whom either the county of birth or the county of
enlistment are known.
        Table 1 compares the medical experiences while in service and selected
personal characteristics of the black recruits who belonged to these three samples. The
entire sample and the sample of ex-slaves are matched fairly well in wartime mortality
from disease, number of cases per person, and case-fatality rate of wartime diseases.
The two samples are also similar in other personal characteristics and military
experiences except for the occupational composition. The percentages of white-
collar/skilled and other non-farm occupations are somewhat higher for the full sample
than for the sample of ex-slaves. The samples of all ex-slaves and those with
information on county (cols. 2 and 3) are also generally similar in wartime medical
experiences and other personal characteristics, although the percentages of non-farm
occupations are lower for the latter. Also, men who enlisted prior to the establishment
of the Bureau for Colored Troops in May 1863 are underrepresented in the sample of
ex-slaves with information on county. This might indicate that military service records
were less complete for those who joined the army before systematic recruitment of
blacks started.
        The analyses given below rely on a sample of ex-slaves who joined the Union


                                              7
Army and a subsample of these men for whom the information on the county of
residence prior to enlistment is available. Even if we cannot preclude the possibility of
sample selection bias, Table 1 suggests that the magnitude of the bias should not be
large. Thus, the results of this study are likely to represent the experiences of the Union
Army Colored Troops.
        A remaining question is whether the sample of soldiers represents the entire
slave population at military service age. Because no random sample of slaves circa
1860 is currently available, it is difficult to offer a decisive answer to this question.
However, the following pieces of circumstantial evidence suggest that the sample used
in this paper may not be too different from the entire male slave population at military
service ages during the Civil War. First, previous studies have indicated that while war-
related biases were present, the relationships among civilian occupation and personal
characteristics of ex-slaves in the Union Army were similar to those present in the
civilian slave population (Margo 1992). Second, white Union Army soldiers were
similar to the entire white male population in the North in terms of wealth and other
personal characteristics (Fogel 1993). Third, about 35 percent of the Northern white
males of military service age served in the armed forces during the war; the proportion
of military-age black males who served in the Union Army was even higher. Finally, in
examining the physical fitness of volunteers, it appears that lower standards were
applied to ex-slaves than to whites (Berlin, Reidy, and Rowland 1982, chapter 15). For
these reasons, the colored troops may represent the entire male slave population at
military age, at least as much as white Union Army soldiers’ experiences convey those
for all Northern white males.


3. Socioeconomic Background, Disease, and Mortality
        Wartime casualty by disease was much higher for black recruits than for white
soldiers. Eighteen percent of black servicemen in the sample examined in this study
were killed by disease whereas 8 percent of white men in the entire Union Army died
from illness while in service. The wartime casualty rates of the sample are well
matched to the entire black regiments of 179,000 men, of which 33,000 soldiers (18.4
percent) were killed by disease while in service. Disease was by far the predominant
cause of wartime mortality for black men, accounting for ten out of every eleven


                                             8
deaths. The ratio of the number of deaths from disease to wound-caused deaths was
much higher for blacks than white soldiers. The seven most common diseases in army
camps were typhoid, smallpox, measles, diarrhea (including dysentery), pneumonia,
malaria, and tuberculosis. These diseases were responsible for about two thirds of all
deaths caused by illness and half of all disease cases. Of these diseases, diarrhea was
the single greatest killer, accounting for 20 percent of all deaths caused by disease,
followed by pneumonia (14 percent) and typhoid (13 percent).
        The unusually high rate of mortality from disease among black soldiers raised
considerable concerns among commanding officers of black regiments and medical
staffs of the Union Army. Some attributed the high wartime death rate of blacks to the
fact that many black recruits came ill prepared for soldiering in the first place.
According to this claim, slavery left black men weak and susceptible to disease, and
the Union recruitment placed many men under arms who would otherwise have been
disqualified. Others blamed the poor living conditions that black recruits confronted in
the army camps, including deficiency of qualified medical personnel, stationing at
particularly unhealthy posts, disproportionately greater fatigue duty, unbalanced diets,
and indifferent treatment from white commanders (Berlin, Reidy, and Rowland 1982,
chapter 15).
        In the balance of this paper, I focus on how the wartime mortality of black
soldiers differed by socioeconomic characteristics, leaving aside the question of why
blacks were much more likely to be killed by disease than whites. I first calculated the
wartime mortality from disease in general, the mean number of cases per person, and
the case fatality rates of all diseases for black recruits according to their age, skin color,
height, occupation, average farm size of county, population density of county, and
region of residence. The mean number of cases of disease per person-year reflects how
susceptible recruits of a particular characteristic were to disease, while the case fatality
rates indicate how robust they were in resisting the diseases they contracted. The
disease-caused mortality in general is determined by these two indexes.6

6
  In addition, the probabilities of contracting and dying from diseases for a particular
demographic group were determined by their average length of service. Unfortunately, the
average length of service can be calculated for less than 30 percent of the sample because the
information on dates of enlistment or discharge is missing for many soldiers. It is implicitly
assumed in Table 2 that the length of military service is the same for each cell composed of


                                               9
         Previous studies have suggested that slaves were treated differently according
to their skin color. Planters in Trinidad, for instance, had a strong bias in favor of
assigning light-skinned creoles to elite occupations. Light-skinned males were more
than twice as likely to be artisans or hold another non-field job as dark-skinned males.
A light-skinned woman was over six times as likely to be chosen as a domestic as a
dark-skinned woman. Studies of the New Orleans slave records also show the effect of
color on selection for elite jobs, although the effect was much weaker in the United
States than in Trinidad (Fogel 1989, 48-50). Although the evidence regarding the effect
of skin color has been centered on occupational assignment, light-skinned slaves could
also have been treated favorably in other ways if planters had a preference for lighter
skin color.7 Skin colors were classified into three categories, (1) dark, (2) brown, and
(3) light.
         It is widely accepted that adult height is an index of cumulative net nutritional
status over the growing ages and a powerful predictor of health at older age (Fogel
1994, Waaler 1984). Because it is inappropriate to compare the height of a recruit at a
growing age with the height of one who had already gained his final stature, it is
desirable to use an age-standardized measure of height. Accordingly, five dummy
variables on height (Height 1 to Height 5) have been constructed, each of which
represents a quintile of the height distribution for a particular age. The height
distribution by age was obtained from the entire black Union Army sample of 5677. To
all recruits 23 and older, a single height distribution was applied, assuming that height
after age 23 remained unchanged.
         Occupation is one of the most widely used indicators of socioeconomic status
in the nineteenth century United States. The occupations of ex-slaves were classified to
the following three categories based on the typical job hierarchy of slaves: (1) elite
occupations such as managers and craftsmen, (2) other non-field occupations and
domestics, and (3) field hands. In the antebellum South, it was a common practice that

particular socioeconomic characteristics.
7
  It appears that slave holders of the British Caribbean and planters in Charleston, New
Orleans, and some other cities had a relatively strong preference for light-skinned slaves to
work in the house. If the American South as a whole is examined, however, it is less clear what
role skin color played in determining a master’s attitude towards slaves. According to
Genovese (1976), whites did not show any great partiality to mulattoes, except when they were
blood relatives.


                                              10
more productive and loyal slaves were promoted to elite occupations. Occupational
promotions were used as a reward for hard work and an incentive to elicit greater effort
from field workers. In determining a slave’s occupation, planters tried to match the
slave’s human capital and a job’s requirements as closely as possible (Fogel 1989,
Chapter 2).
        Domestic servants and slaves assigned to elite occupations should have
enjoyed better diets and housing compared to the majority engaged in field work.
Eugene Genovese described the privileges given to drivers as follows: “The privileges
accruing to drivers varied a great deal but usually included some extra food and
clothing, as well as allotments of tobacco and whiskey. Sometimes they lived in more
comfortable quarters than the others. The most valued could expect cash bonuses of
five or ten dollars at Christmas time…. [T]hey escaped the most boring, brutal, and
demoralizing features of the gang-labor system (Genovese 1976, 370).” Similarly,
“house servants fared much better than field hands: they had more and better food and
clothing, more comfortable quarters, and more personal consideration from the whites
(Genovese 1976, 331).” In addition, the black recruits who had held elite occupations
presumably had superior health compared with field hands owing to the selective
nature of occupational assignment and the privileges associated with their
occupations.8
        The prior exposure to disease was an important determinant of wartime
disease and mortality for white Union Army soldiers (Lee 1997, 2003). Farmers and
rural residents, who were healthier on average prior to enlistment owing to a greater
extent of isolation from other people, were more likely to succumb to illness and to be
killed by disease than non-farmers and urban dwellers, respectively. The different
degree of immunity to pathogens is probably the most important link between the
extent of prior exposure to disease and later health. That is, despite the negative
consequences for net nutritional status, survivors of unhealthy environments developed
better immunity to some of the infectious diseases that were rampant in army life.

  Slave artisans and drivers (overseers of gang-system) were indeed taller than field hands
(Fogel 1989).

         To consider the effect of the disease environment of the community, two
different measures of population aggregation were employed: the plantation size and
the population density. These variables were constructed by dividing the sample into
five categories of equal size according to the average number of slaves per slave holder
and the population density of the county where the recruits had lived prior to
enlistment. Recruits from larger plantations and men from more densely populated
counties should have had more contact with disease than, respectively, enlistees from
smaller plantations and those from more isolated areas. In addition to the extent of
exposure to disease, plantation size may capture the quality and quantity of food
offered to slaves. The differences between former slaves from Union slave states and
from Southern Confederate states were also considered. This regional division is


                                                 12
expected to capture the health effects of the differences in climate and ecological
environment between the two regions.
        The results of the computations are reported in Table 2. Black soldiers with
lighter skin colors (either brown or light) were much less likely to die from disease
than those with darker skin colors. The lower disease-caused death rates for brown-
skinned men are entirely attributable to the lower probability of contracting disease
compared to dark-skinned men. On the other hand, the advantages of light-skinned
solders over men with darker skin colors are explained by both their lower rates of
contraction and case fatality. The effect of height does not stand out clearly.
        The men who were formerly engaged in elite occupations were much less
likely to die from disease than field hands because their chances of surviving diseases
in case of contraction were higher. The mortality from disease for other non-farm
occupations was as low as the death rate for elite occupations, but their advantages
over field hands resulted exclusively from their lower probability of contracting
diseases.
        Ex-slaves from larger plantations appear to have been much less likely to be
killed by disease while in service than men from smaller plantations. In particular, men
who had resided in the counties belonging to the top quintile in terms of the average
plantation size were half as likely to die from disease as those from the counties in the
bottom quintile. The advantages of having resided in a large plantation prior to
enlistment were due to both the lower probability of contracting diseases and the lower
conditional probability of dying from diseases contracted.
        No clear relationship was observed between population density and degree of
susceptibility to disease, measured by the number of cases per person. On the other
hand, recruits from more densely populated counties (counties that belonged to the top
40 percent of the distribution of the county population density) were more robust in
resisting diseases that they contracted, as indicated by the relatively low case fatality
rate.
        Lastly, the wartime disease mortality was lower for black men from the border
states than those from Confederate states, but not by much. The higher rate of
contraction for men enlisted into the border state regiments was more than offset by
their lower case fatality rate. The measures of wartime health computed separately for


                                             13
four different age categories (ages 17–19, 20–24, 25–29, and 30 or older), not reported
in this paper, suggest that the patterns of mortality differentials for all ages described
above are generally true for each of the four age groups.
         Logistic regressions were performed to examine the effect of each of the
socioeconomic characteristics, controlling for all other factors at the same time. Three
different models were employed. The first and second regressions estimated the effect
of each independent variable on the probabilities of contracting a disease and dying
from a disease (respectively) while in service, based on the entire sample of black
soldiers with information on county of residence. In the third regression, the sample
was limited to the recruits who experienced at least one illness while in service.9 The
second regression examines the determinants of the degree of susceptibility to disease,
whereas the third is concerned with fatality in case of contraction. The result of the
first regression on mortality shows the combined consequence of the differences in
susceptibility and lethality.
         In addition to the variables on age, skin color, height, occupation, plantation
size, population density, and region of residence (definitions are explained above),
variables pertaining to the year of enlistment and military positions are added. The
timing of enlistment could have influenced wartime disease and the mortality of black
recruits. There were two fundamental changes in the War Department’s approach to the
recruitment of blacks that should have altered the treatment of black men in the army.
Prior to the spring of 1863, as noted above, black soldiers were recruited on an ad hoc
basis by individual Union commanders as Union political leaders hesitated to allow the
enlistment of black men. In May 1863, the War Department finally started full-scale
enlistment, establishing the Bureau of Colored Troops to regulate and supervise the
enlistment of black soldiers and the selection of officers to command black regiments.

  A soldier who had been killed in action would no longer be able to contract a disease. Also,
an early discharge from service would diminish the length of time at risk for having an illness.
These competing risks could not be properly treated by the logistic models employed in this
study. This problem is at least partially addressed by the hazard analysis offered in the next
section. Exclusion of the soldiers who died from wounds did not change the results much,
perhaps because their number was too small and deaths from wounds were relatively random
events.

         Even after black men were officially mustered in the army, they were
discriminated against in various ways. Black recruits were not permitted to become
commissioned officers, and were paid much less than white soldiers of the same rank.
Furthermore, they were much more likely to be assigned to heavy manual duties while
white solders were sent to fight in the battlegrounds. In June 1864, Congress passed an
act equalizing the pay of black and white soldiers. At the same time, excessive fatigue
duty for black troops was banned, too. To consider the effects of these major changes
in the rules regarding the treatment of black men, the dates of enlistment were
classified into three periods: (1) May 1863 and earlier, (2) June 1863 to June 1864, and
(3) after June 1864.
         Previous studies of white Union Army recruits have suggested that military
rank and duty had very strong effects on the chances of dying while in service (Lee
1999, 2003). Lee (1999) has also shown that military positions were selectively
assigned to the newly enlisted according to their socioeconomic backgrounds.
Descriptive evidence confirms that the assignments of military positions in black
regiments were also selective. Artisans, house servants, and other privileged bondsmen
provided the bulk of the noncommissioned officers. Also, black soldiers who had been
free led demands for commissioned office and monopolized those ranks after Union
policy changed (Berlin, Reidy, and Rowland 1998, 35–36). To control for this potential
indirect effect of socioeconomic characteristics on the probability of dying through the
assignments of military positions, dummy variables on duty (which equals 1 if non-
infantrymen and 0 otherwise) and rank (equals 1 if higher than private and 0 otherwise)
were included.
         The regression results are presented in Table 3.10 The estimated parameters for
the variables on skin color, occupation, plantation size, and population density
generally confirm the patterns of mortality differentials described above.11 Brown-

10
   OLS and probit regressions were also performed using the same set of variables. The results
are very similar those of logistic regressions.
11
   The predictive potential of each logistic model was examined in the following way; the
regression concerning the probability of contracting a disease is presented here as an example.
An event observation (a person who suffered from disease) was counted as a correctly
predicted case if its predicted probability was equal to or higher than the sample mean of the
dependent variable (0.518 in this case). Similarly, a non-event observation was regarded as a
correctly predicted case if its predicted probability was lower than the sample mean. Where


                                              16
skinned men were significantly less likely to contract and die from diseases than dark-
skinned soldiers. But the favorable effect of light skin is no longer visible once other
personal characteristics are held constant. Former white-collar and skilled workers
were less likely to contract and to be killed by diseases than field hands, although the
effect of elite occupations on the probability of contracting diseases misses statistical
significance by a relatively small margin. Having resided in the top-quintile counties in
the distribution of the plantation size strongly diminished the probabilities of
contracting and dying from diseases and the conditional probability of being killed by
diseases. Recruits from counties that belonged to the top category of population
density were much less likely to succumb to and die from disease in the event of
contraction.
        Age had a U-shaped relationship with the probability of suffering a disease
while in service. The estimated parameters for age and age squared suggest that the
probability of contraction first decreased with age, reached the minimum around age
34, and increased with age thereafter. Since few men aged 34 and older entered the
army, the effect of age on the probability of contracting diseases was practically
negative. The effect of age on the conditional probability of dying from disease in case
of contraction was not statistically significant.
        It is surprising to find that the association between height and the probability
of contracting disease was positive, not negative. The shortest 20 percent were
significantly less likely to be killed by disease while in service. If height was included
in the regressions as a continuous variable, it showed a strong positive relationship
with the probabilities of contracting disease and dying from disease. Height was not
systematically related to the conditional probability of dying from disease in case of
contraction. One possible explanation for this unexpected outcome is that army recruits
received the same ration regardless of their stature. If this was the case, a taller solder
could have been relatively undernourished compared to a shorter man because a

this method was applied, about 60 percent of the event and non-event observations were
correctly predicted by the model employed in this study. The relatively rare event nature of
some regressions does not seem to significantly affect the predictive power. In the case of the
regression for the probability of dying from immunity diseases, reported in Table 4, the
dependent mean was only 0.042, the lowest of all regressions. However, the proportions of the
event and non-event observations that were correctly predicted by the model were, respectively,
73.3 percent and 53.5 percent.

greater amount of energy was required to maintain a bigger body.
        In contrast to the patterns of mortality differentials reported in Table 3, men
who enlisted in the border states were no different from enlistees from Confederate
states. The significantly lower conditional probability of dying from disease among the
soldiers from the border states is completely offset by their much higher risks of
contracting diseases. Men who enlisted later were much less likely to be killed by
disease than earlier enlistees. The relationship between the year of enlistment and the
wartime mortality from disease is largely explained by the different average length of
military service according to the timing of enlistment. The average number of disease
cases per person-year (a measure of the probability of contracting a disease after being
standardized for the length of service) was actually higher for the late enlistees.
Furthermore, the case fatality rate was no different between men who enlisted in
different years. This result implies either or both of the following: first, the smaller pay
or excessively heavy duty of black recruits did not seriously impair their health; and
second, the act of June 1864 to equalize the pay of black and white soldiers and to
prohibit the excess fatigue duty for blacks was not effectively enforced.
        As in the case of whites, serving on non-infantry duty significantly diminished
the probabilities of suffering and dying from disease. On the other hand, non-
commissioned officers had no advantages over privates in black regiments whereas
white men at higher ranks enjoyed much lower rates of death and contraction of
disease than privates. Unlike white non-commissioned officers who were paid more
than privates, black servicemen received the same pay regardless of their rank. This
difference in pay scheme could be in part responsible for the racial difference in the
relationship between of military rank and wartime mortality.


4. Nutrition, Immunity, and Wartime Mortality
        Previous studies of the experiences of white Union Army soldiers have
suggested two important mechanisms by which socioeconomic background prior to
enlistment affected wartime health (Lee 1997, 2003, Smith 2003). First, a recruit from
a healthier environment had been less exposed to disease and thus had poorer
immunity against disease than a man from an unhealthy place. There is a great deal of
evidence demonstrating the fragility of an isolated population once they come in


                                             18
contact with different disease pool (McNeill 1976, Curtin 1989, Pritchett and Tunali
1995, Fetter and Kessler 1996, Sköld 1997). It provides a plausible explanation for
why farmers and rural residents were more likely to contract diseases and be killed by
them than were non-farmers and city dwellers, respectively. Despite the negative
consequences for net nutritional status, survivors of unhealthy environments developed
better immunity to some of the infectious diseases that were rampant in army life.
Second, a person who had been better nourished had advantages over a man with
poorer nutritional status in terms of avoiding or resisting some nutritionally-sensitive
diseases. This is a possible reason for the negative relationship between household
wealth and the probability of contracting some types of diseases among white Union
Army recruits (Lee 1997, 2003).
         The    two     potential   pathways    by   which   pre-service   socioeconomic
characteristics affected wartime mortality could be mixed in the regression results
reported above. Given that black soldiers who had been engaged in elite occupations
were presumably better nourished than field hands and that some of them probably
resided in town, their lower rates of disease contraction and mortality compared to
field hands may have resulted from both greater immunity to diseases and superior
nutritional status. Servicemen from more densely populated counties should have had
more chances to develop immunity against diseases than men from more isolated areas.
However, this advantage of urban dwellers could have been offset by their poorer
initial nutritional status.
         The relative importance of each of the two links between socioeconomic
background and wartime health can be examined by looking at cause-specific
morbidity and mortality. According to epidemiological studies, the strength of
immunity to disease from prior contraction differs from one disease to another. For
some diseases, such as measles, smallpox, and typhoid, an attack would confer
immunity and thus reduce the probability of contracting or dying from those diseases
in the future (such diseases will be called immunity diseases below). For other diseases,
such as malaria, diarrhea, dysentery, and pneumonia, a prior contraction has little
influence on susceptibility or resistance to a later contraction (this type will be called




                                               19
non-immunity diseases).12 Most diseases are sensitive to nutritional status to some
extent, but there are some diseases for which the effect of nutritional status is
particularly strong, including diarrhea, tuberculosis, most respiratory infections,
pertussis, cholera, leprosy, and herpes (Journal of Interdisciplinary History 1983, 506).
For non-immunity diseases, the effect of prior nutritional status should be stronger than
the effect of immunity. Logistic regressions were performed to examine the effects of
socioeconomic backgrounds and military experiences on the probabilities of
contracting and dying from these two types of diseases, employing the same set of
variables included in the regressions for all types of diseases. Tables 4 and 5 present
the results.
         The advantages of light-skinned men in resisting diseases while in service,
though marginally insignificant at a conventional significance level, were stronger for
non-immunity diseases than for immunity diseases. Since occupational differences
between skin colors are taken into account, this indicates that light-skinned slaves were
perhaps better nourished and healthier than dark-skinned slaves even within the
category of similar occupation. On the other hand, brown-skinned men were less likely
to contract both types of diseases. It is uncertain what granted them this stronger
immunity against diseases.
         Having non-field occupations prior to enlistment significantly diminished the
risk of contracting non-immunity diseases while in service. The estimated parameters
suggest that, compared to field hands, the probability of suffering this type of disease
was 39 percent lower for skilled workers and 23 percent lower for men who had other
non-field occupations, although the effect of holding elite occupations misses statistical
significance by a small margin. In sharp contrast, variables on occupation had no
significant effect on immunity diseases. This suggests that the advantages of men
working in elite or non-field occupations over field hands perhaps resulted from their
superior nutritional status or general health conditions at the time of enlistment rather
than the influence of differential immunity status. This pattern is clearly different from
white recruits for whom the lower wartime mortality of non-farmers compared to

         Black soldiers from counties in which the average plantation size was large
were significantly less likely to die from both types of diseases, but the mechanism by
which plantation size affected wartime mortality differed by the type of disease. In
case of immunity diseases, the advantages of living on large plantations largely came
from their lower rate of disease contraction. On the other hand, the major reason for



                                                    22
these recruits’ lower mortality from non-immunity diseases was the lower probability
of dying from non-immunity diseases in case of contraction. Living with a large
number of slaves in the same plantation should have provided more chances to contact
diseases and thus develop immunity against them. This result also suggests that slaves
on large plantations were probably better nourished on average than slaves on smaller
holdings. Alternatively, a larger fraction of slaves on smaller plantations were
inadequately nourished to the point that their later health would be impaired by poor
nutritional status. The latter explanation is more consistent with the finding of
Crawford (1992) that the vast majority of slaves on the large plantations ate just an
adequate diet, while those on smaller holdings were more likely to experience either
inadequate or significantly better-than-adequate diets.
        Residing in urban counties prior to enlistment strongly lowered the
probabilities of contracting and dying from immunity diseases. Recruits from a county
that belonged to the top quintile of the population density were 62 percent less likely to
suffer immunity diseases and 75 percent less likely to be killed by those illnesses. If
non-immunity diseases are considered, on the other hand, the relationship between the
county population density and wartime mortality is much less straightforward. Indeed,
recruits from the top-quintile counties in terms of population density were more likely
to succumb to non-immunity diseases.
        The effect of age on wartime morbidity and mortality differs by the type of
disease. For immunity diseases, the probability of contracting a disease and the
probability of dying from a disease decreased with age through the early thirties. Since
most recruits were younger than thirty at the time of enlistment, the relationship
between age and wartime mortality is practically negative. Perhaps aged persons had
developed stronger immunity to diseases because they had been more exposed to
diseases than younger men before they entered the army. For non-immunity diseases,
age had no significant effect on the odds of contracting diseases and the conditional
probability of dying from the disease contracted.
        The regression results for all types of diseases (presented in Table 3) show that
the recruits who enlisted in the border states were more likely to contract diseases but
less likely to die from diseases they contracted than those who joined the Union Army
in the Confederate states. The regression results for non-immunity diseases (Table 5)


                                            23
are similar to the result for all diseases. In contrast, if only immunity diseases are
concerned, enlistees from the border states were significantly less likely to die from
diseases largely due to their lower case fatality rates.
         The time pattern of wartime mortality provides another clue by which the
influences of prior immunity and nutritional status can be examined. It is documented
in the medical histories of the Civil War that the earlier seasoning period in the army
was most critical for the survival of recruits. During this period, enlistees with limited
immunity were exposed to a pool of various infectious diseases in the army (Steiner
1968). If the differences in wartime mortality between men from the countryside and
urban areas were mainly caused by differences in immunity status, most of the
differences should have occurred in the early stages of military service when the
recruits were not seasoned to the severe disease environment of the army camps. The
time pattern of wartime death also offers a hint as to how long the advantages of
having superior nutritional status or generally good health at the time of enlistment, as
indicated by the recruits’ occupation, persisted with the duration of military service.
         Table 6 reports the calculated hazard rate of dying from a particular type of
disease for each 180-day interval from the time of enlistment. The hazard rate for the
181–360 day period, for example, shows what proportion of the recruits remaining
alive in service at the beginning of 181st day died from any illness or some specific
type of disease within the following 180 days. If a soldier died from any cause or was
discharged alive between enlistment and 180th day, he is removed from the population
at risk when the hazard rate of the next time interval (360th to 540th day) is calculated.13
The result for the dwellers in rural and urban areas is graphically presented in Figure 1.
         The time patterns of wartime mortality are generally consistent with the
immunity hypothesis. Hazard rates of dying from disease were higher during the first
six months than in subsequent periods, confirming the remarks on the seasoning period
given in medical histories of the Civil War. In particular, the mortality for the enlistees

13
   To calculate the population at risk at the beginning of each time interval, the number of
recruits who were discharged from service should be computed. Unfortunately, the exact
timing of discharge can only be determined for about 26 percent of the sample because of
missing information on the date of discharge. I estimated the number of the discharged for each
time interval based on the assumption that, for each type of man (e.g. field hands, non-farm
workers, urban residents, and rural residents), the time patterns of discharge for the entire
sample and for the recruits for whom the date of the discharge is known are the same.


                                              24
from rural areas was extremely high within the first six months and then declined
dramatically in subsequent periods. In contrast, the mortality of urban residents was
relatively low at the early stage of service and exhibits no clear time pattern. As a
consequence, a disproportionately large fraction of the differences between rural and
urban residents was made in the first six months in the army.

Notes: The hazard rates for rural and urban residents and small and large farms are calculated based on
the sample of ex-slaves for who the information on county of residence is given. The number of recruits
who died from a particular type of disease within each 180-day interval was divided by the number of
recruits who remained in service at the beginning of the time interval and then was multiplied by 1,000.
If a recruit died from any other cause while in service or discharged alive, he was removed from the pool
of population at risk. Since the discharge dates are reported for only a fraction of the recruits, the
number of persons who discharged alive within each interval is estimated based on the experiences of
those who have that information. For the classification of disease see text.

        For recruits who probably lacked immunity against diseases (field hands, rural
residents, and men from small farms),       the mortality from immunity diseases was
particularly high during the first six months and dropped sharply thereafter, which is
consistent with the prediction of the immunity hypothesis. In contrast, the hazard rate
of dying from immunity diseases among men who presumably had better immunity
status (non-field occupations, urban residents, and ex-slaves from large plantations) do
not exhibit a clear time pattern.
        However, if non-immunity diseases are examined, the disease-caused
mortality among rural residents was much higher in the first six months than in the
following periods. Also, the differences in mortality from non-immunity diseases
between urban and rural residents and between men from small and large plantations
were particularly high in the first half year. This result suggests that immunity may not
be the only explanation for the particularly high mortality from disease among the
army recruits. Another possible explanation is that, as recruits continued to be exposed
to disease in the army camp, they gained knowledge that helped them avoid
contraction. People who had lived in unhealthy circumstances, such as urban areas,
were more aware of ways to avoid contracting disease than those with little experience
with disease. According to a qualitative record about white Union Army soldiers, for
example, Germans ate fewer sweets, cooked their food more carefully, and more
actively pursued cleanliness (Hess 1981, 66–67). A number of contemporary accounts
suggest that rural residents and farmers were particularly unhygienic and ignorant of
child health (Preston and Haines 1991, 38–39). Alternatively, it could be explained by
population selections caused by differential mortality; that is, first, individuals who
survived an unhealthy environment were on average more robust (which explains why
men from urban areas experienced lower mortality than those from rural areas), and,
second, less-healthy recruits tended to die early, leaving only healthier men in the later
stages of military service (which explains why even the hazard of death caused by non-
immunity diseases declined with the duration of service).
        It is not entirely clear why non-farmers were less likely to be killed by disease
than field hands while in service. The skilled and other non-field workers were perhaps
better nourished because of their more elite occupations. It may have been the case that
non-farmers’ overall health, rather than nutritional status, was better than that of field


                                            27
hands. The effect of differential nutritional status prior to enlistment, if any, should
have been stronger in the earlier period in military service. Initially better-nourished
recruits would eventually lose their advantage as they continued to face a poorer diet
and the fight against disease in the army. Therefore, if different nutrition is the major
story, the difference in mortality from non-immunity diseases between non-farmers and
field hands should have been greater in the earlier period in service.
        The results in Table 6 only weakly support this “nutrition hypothesis.” The
mortality differential was the widest in the first six months and diminished over time.
But the advantages of non-farmers persisted throughout their military service,
suggesting that different nutritional status may not have been the only factor. The
results also suggest that the advantages of non-farmers over field hands could be in
part attributable to their stronger immunity. Mortality from immunity diseases within
the first six months was nearly twice as high for field hands as for men engaged in
non-field jobs. The regression results presented in Table 4 (showing no significant
effect of occupation on the probability of dying from immunity diseases) fail to capture
it because the mortality from immunity diseases in later periods was higher for non-
field slaves than it was for field hands.
        In general, the patterns of wartime mortality differentials of black Union Army
soldiers are not much different from the features of socioeconomic differences in the
disease mortality of white recruits suggested in previous studies. Among white soldiers
as well, former farmers and men from rural areas were more vulnerable to disease in
army camps than non-farmers and city-dwellers, respectively (Lee 1997, 2003). A
notable difference is that height is positively related to the probability of contracting
diseases for black enlistees, whereas white recruits’ health while in service was not
significantly affected by height. Given that the climate, disease environment, and
extent of urbanization were considerably different between the North and the South,
and that the occupational hierarchy and living conditions differed between the free
white and slave populations, these similarities in the socioeconomic disparities in
wartime health and mortality are remarkable. The evidence given here further confirms
the importance of nutritional and immunity status as major determinants of the health
of the nineteenth-century population at large.

5. Conclusions and Implications
        This paper has investigated the patterns of socioeconomic differences in
wartime morbidity and mortality of black Union Army soldiers. Lighter-skinned men
were less likely to contract and die from diseases. Former slaves engaged in non-field
occupations were less likely to contract and to be killed by diseases than were field
hands. Ex-slaves from large plantations were at much lower risk of contracting and
dying from diseases. Residing in urban areas prior to enlistment strongly diminished
the chances of suffering and dying from diseases. The relationship between age and the
probability of contracting diseases was practically negative.
        The study has found that the association between height and the probability of
contracting disease was positive, not negative. A possible explanation for this
unexpected outcome is that army recruits received the same amount of food regardless
of their stature and therefore a taller solder was relatively undernourished compared to
a shorter man. As in the case of white recruits, serving on non-infantry duty
significantly diminished the probabilities of suffering and dying from disease. On the
other hand, non-commissioned officers had no advantages over privates in black
regiments, whereas white men at higher ranks enjoyed much lower rates of death and
contraction of disease than privates.
        Patterns of disease-specific mortality and timing of death suggest that the
differences in the development of immunity against diseases and nutritional status prior
to enlistment were responsible for the observed mortality differentials. The advantages
of light-skinned soldiers over dark-skinned men and of men who held non-field
occupations over field hands perhaps resulted from their superior nutritional status
prior to enlistment. The effect of plantation size on wartime mortality appears to reflect
the advantages of men from large plantations in terms of both better-developed
immunity and superior nutritional status. Residing in urban counties should have
provided more chances to contact diseases and develop immunity against them.
        The results of this paper suggest that there were substantial disparities in the
health of the slave population on the eve of the Civil War. The standard of living and
the quality of environment probably differed by skin color, occupation, plantation size,
and population aggregation. Light-skinned slaves and those assigned to elite or other
non-field occupations appear to have enjoyed better diets, lower work burdens, and


                                            29
healthier environments compared to dark-skinned slaves and field hands, respectively.
Slaves on a large-scale plantation were perhaps more exposed to diseases because of
higher chances of contact with other infected people. On the other hand, it appears that
the standards of living were higher for slaves in larger plantations than those on
smaller farms. Slaves living on a plantation located in a more densely populated area
were perhaps less healthy than those residing on an isolated farm.
        This study also indicates that the more favorable climate for the development
of infectious diseases was perhaps a major factor that shaped the lives of the people in
the antebellum U.S. South. Living on large plantations was probably less desirable for
slaves because of higher chances of contracting diseases in spite of more generous
provisions of food on those farms. For masters, greater concerns about poor health and
higher morality of slaves could have offset some of the potential economic advantages
of operating large-scale plantations. Geographic moves, both before and after the
Emancipation, should have adversely affected the health of the black migrants by
making them encounter different disease environments they had not been seasoned to.
