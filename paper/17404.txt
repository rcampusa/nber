                                            ABSTRACT

Data availability is arguably the greatest impediment to advancing the science of science and innovation
policy and practice (SciSIPP). This paper describes the contents, methodology and use of the public
online COMETS (Connecting Outcome Measures in Entrepreneurship Technology and Science) database
spanning all sciences, technologies, and high-tech industries; its parent COMETSandSTARS database
which adds more data at organization and individual scientist-inventor-entrepreneur level restricted
by vendor licenses to onsite use at NBER and/or UCLA; and their prototype Nanobank covering only
nano-scale sciences and technologies. Some or all of these databases include or will include: US patents
(granted and applications); NIH, NSF, SBIR, STTR Grants; Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge;
ISI Highly Cited; US doctoral dissertations; IPEDS/HEGIS universities; all firms and other organizations
which ever publish in ISI listed journals beginning in 1981, are assigned US patents (from 1975), or
are listed on a covered grant; additional nanotechnology firms based on web search. Ticker/CUSIP
codes enable linking public firms to the major databases covering them. A major matching/disambiguation
effort assigns unique identifiers for an organization or individual so that their appearances are linked
within and across the constituent legacy databases. Extensive geographic coding enables analysis at
country, region, state, county, or city levels. The databases provide very flexible sources of data for
serious research on many issues in the study of organizations in innovation systems in the development
and spread of knowledge, and the economics of science. Enabling the study of these topics, among
others, COMETS contributes substantially to the science of science and technology.

1       Introduction

        For two decades Zucker and Darby, their team and co-authors, as well as other authors and
teams working along related lines have been developing a methodology, technology, and the
underlying databases required to trace the creation and transmission of new scientifically and/or
commercially valuable knowledge, processes, and technologies at the level of country or region; firm
(university, government laboratory, or other organization); or individual scientist or engineer
(hereafter “scientist” is used to encompass engineers). Data availability is arguably the greatest
impediment to advancing the science of science and technology (Zucker and Darby 2011). Since
2003, the Zucker and Darby team has been engaged in a major effort to create increasingly large-
scale and comprehensive databases for use of the S&T research community, with intention to enable
much wider use of detailed micro-data capable of distinguishing among important competing
hypotheses.
        This work has evolved into 4 distinct but related databases: Nanobank; COMETS;
COMETSbeta; and COMETSandSTARS as summarized in Figure 1. Nanobank contains only
records which we have identified as related to nano-scale science and technology (detailed below).

Early, beta-test releases of Nanobank provided an important source of data for some of the other
articles in this issue. Nanobank also served as a prototype and test-bed for the Science and
Technology Agents of Revolution (STARS) project which extended coverage to all areas of science
and engineering and all high-tech industries as well as extending both the period of coverage (from
an end date in Nanobank of 2004 to an end date of 2010 except for article data, due to licensing
restrictions which limit it to 2004) and the heritage databases included (e.g., adding NIH, NSF, SBIR.
and STTR grants). Although the coverage extended far beyond the top scientists, the STARS name
linked in to Zucker and Darby’s pioneering work on the role of star scientists in high-tech firm
formation and success, focused primarily on biotechnology and nanotechnology (Zucker and Darby
1996, 2009; Zucker, Darby and Brewer 1998; Zucker, Darby and Armstrong 1998; Darby and Zucker
2005, 2007).1 This difference and potential confusion with the recent Federal STARmetrics
program, led us to name the new public database COMETS (Connecting Outcome Measures in
Entrepreneurship Technology and Science). COMETS is hosted by the Ewing Marion Kauffman
Foundation at www1.kauffman.org/comets. This paper discusses the major elements included and
challenges overcome in construction of each database in turn, beginning with Nanobank.

2       Nanobank

        The Nanobank database is available at www.nanobank.org for free use for research purposes.
You will be asked to send a brief statement of your planned use to zucker@ucla.edu. Covering nano-
scale science and engineering as well as its commercialization, Nanobank serves as an enabling or
platform technology for social science, business, and policy research on the science origins of
nanotechnology and its commercialization. Of special relevance is a system of unique ID numbers
for firms, universities and other organizations used as they appear within and across such
components as journal articles, US patents, and NSF and NIH grants. Nanobank will be archived by
the Zucker-Darby team at the Center for International Science, Technology and Cultural Policy
(CISTCP) in the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs and at the National Bureau of Economic
Research. It will be extended and updated as an integrated component of the COMETS database
described in Section 3 below.2 A similar system of unique ID numbers for frequently publishing
and/or patenting individuals will be completed as part of the STAR/COMETS database project and
included in COMETSandSTARS in the future. Table 1 provides an overview of the data currently
available in Nanobank. Perusing the list of parsed fields gives an idea of the rich variables included
and which can be constructed using Nanobank.

  Liebeskind, Oliver, Zucker and Brewer (1996), Zucker and Darby (1997), and Zucker, Darby and Armstrong
(2002) all offer evidence that while star-scientist employees and collaborators have the biggest impacts, other
scientists also make important contribution whether as employees of the firm or networked to them.

  The COMETS database covers all science and technology fields and all high-technology areas. Nanotechnology
flags are included for those documents identified as such using the Nanobank methodologies described below. This
identification is extended as permitted by funding. Nanobank per se cannot be extended due to licensing restrictions,
limiting the article data to through 2004.

        Three principal technical challenges were overcome in constructing these databases: (a)
defining nano-scale science and engineering and its commercial applications; (b) matching
appearances of the same organization within and across the component databases; and (c) locating

geographically addresses listed on the documents. The nature of these challenges and how we solved
them are the subjects of Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 below, respectively.
2.1.     Defining Nanotechnology Operationally
         Nanobank is a digital library containing a collection of documents related to various topics in
the nanotechnology field. These documents include scientific journal articles, patents, and
government grants. This database contains bibliographic information, including titles, abstracts,
publication years, and author names. Information on associated organizations is also provided. This
includes unique IDs for each distinct organization and geocoding information for their locations as
discussed in Sections I.B and I.C, respectively.
2.1.1 Data Sources and Content
         The journal articles portion of Nanobank contains 580,711 articles from peer reviewed
journals. The sources of this data are the Science Citation Index, Arts & Humanities Citation Index,
and Social Sciences Citation Index of the Institute for Scientific Information Inc. (ISI). These sources
contain a total of over 25,000,000 articles from over 8,700 peer reviewed scientific journals.
Nanobank contains the subset of articles that are determined as described below to be relevant to
nanotechnology. The article data includes unique ID numbers for each article, article titles, abstracts,
journal volume number, journal issue number, publication year, author names, and the names and
addresses of organizations affiliated with the authors.3
         The patent data in Nanobank includes 240,437 patents filed with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO). The source of this data is a number of flat text files which are made
available by the USPTO. The files used for Nanobank contain data on over 4,000,000 patents with
grant years ranging from 1976 to 2005. Nanobank contains the subset of patents that are determined
as described below to be relevant to nanotechnology. The patent data includes USPTO patent ID
numbers, patent titles, abstracts, U.S. and international patent classifications, application dates, grant
dates, and the names and addresses of inventors and assignees.
         The government grants data includes 52,830 grants, with 29,541 coming from the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) and 23,289 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for 1972-2006.
This data includes the ID numbers assigned by the grant agency, titles, abstracts, PI names, co-PI
names, grant amounts, and receiving organization names and addresses.
2.1.2 Document Selection
         As is normal with an emerging field with contested boundaries, there is no clear definition of
nanotechnology in any of the legacy databases integrated in Nanobank. The documents selected for
Nanobank represent our best efforts to include – to the extent possible given automated search – all
documents which might be viewed by a significant number of experts as relevant to nano-scale
science and engineering and its commercial applications. We made the conscious decision to err on

  What information can be made public through Nanobank is limited by the terms of our license from ISI (now
merged into Thomson Reuters and deployed on the Web of Knowledge) and other vendors of component proprietary
databases. Our article data is limited to 2004. We cannot include the ISI ID code for an article or counts or links of
citations to it, but we do format the journal citation to exactly match those used by ISI so that those with access to
ISI data can link readily to that database.

the side of inclusion, and some users will choose to select subsets more attuned to their particular
operational definitions.
         Three methods are used to determine which documents are nanotechnology-relevant. The
first “keywords” or Boolean method is based on the existence of one or more specified words or
phrases found in the available text portions of the documents. Titles, abstracts, and keywords were
available for articles and grants. The full text was available for patents. The keywords method
searches for text patterns which match words or phrases related to nanotechnology. A drawback to
this method is that it is less effective for very early or very recent documents. This is the case
because early documents were written before the search terms were in common use, and recent
documents have terms that are too new to be included in the search terms. Our keywords were any
term that was prefixed with “nano” and (A) the 140 most commonly occurring noun phrases in the
Virtual Journal of Nanoscale Science & Technology (VJN), (B) 297 “glossary” terms primarily
derived from recommended search lists received from collaborators and advisory board members
who are specialists in the field and supplemented by a web search of nanotechnology glossaries, (C)
with the exception of pure measurement terms. The 140 most commonly occurring noun phrases in
VJN articles up through 2003 was found by using a tool called the Apple Pie Phraser (APP) which is
a tool that analyzes the grammatical structure of a sentence and identifies the noun phrase(s) in the
sentence. Table 2 lists the keywords (other than “nano*”) used in constructing Nanobank in the form
of regular expression text patterns, so a single entry could represent a number of possible terms. The
terms in Part C of the table are the pure measurement terms which were excluded from triggering
selection of a record as nanotechnology relevant.
         The second “probabilistic” document selection method is a relative frequency method which
selects some of the same and some additional documents to complement the Boolean method and fill
in for some of its shortcomings is due to Jonathan Furner and Hongyan Ma, as implemented by Jason
Fong in selection of cut points in the probability distribution for nano-identification. This
probabilistic method analyzes the document text and ranks the documents in order of relevance to a
set of query terms. However, unlike the keywords method, this set of query terms is not preselected.
The query terms used for the probabilistic method adapt to the contents of the document set. This
allows the inclusion of terms that have not been previously identified as nanotechnology- relevant.
         Since the search terms are not preselected for the probabilistic method, a process is needed
for automatically generating a set of nanotechnology- relevant terms. The Xapian search engine
library is used for performing the ranking calculations needed for the term selection process. First, an
initial set of query terms is derived from the text of the articles in the Virtual Journal of Nanoscale
Science & Technology (VJN). This initial set is created by assuming that all of the documents in VJN
are relevant, and then selecting the terms that Xapian determines to be the highest ranked for the
purpose of characterizing the VJN documents – i.e., those that are relatively common in VJN articles
relative to their frequency in the universe of all articles. This set of search terms is used to select an
initial set of relevant documents from the full data set. Additional highly ranked terms are then
chosen from this initial set of relevant documents. These additional terms are added to the search
terms and an expanded set of relevant documents are selected from the full data set. This expanded
set of relevant documents is used for Nanobank.

        The third method used for document selection adds documents that are identified as nano-
relevant by an outside “authoritative” source. For journal articles, the Virtual Journal of Nanoscale
Science & Technology is considered to be an authoritative source. Any article found in VJN is also
included in the Nanobank dataset. The US Patent Classification 977 is used as an authoritative source
for the patent data. This is the classification for nanotechnology assigned by the USPTO. For NIH
grants, additional grants were selected when the program name of the grant included “nano.” For
NSF grants, additional grants were selected when the descriptive tag of the grant included “nano.”

         The documents in Nanobank were selected on the basis of meeting one or more of the three
criteria. Table 3 tabulates the number of documents according to type of document and which of the

                                                                     12
criteria were met for a given document. Clearly the probabilistic method added the most documents
with considerably fewer being selected by the keywords method and only a relatively small number
identified in any of the authoritative document selections.
         Nanobank comprises the union of all documents selected by any one or more of these three
methods. The data contain codes permitting users to distinguish between documents that would have
been included in the database using either of the first two methods versus those which are included
because they are in the specified authoritative sets.

2.2      Matching Organizations within and across Legacy Databases
         Each organization found in the Nanobank data is assigned an alphanumeric code. These
organization codes are composed of two parts. The first part is a two-character code that identifies
the organization’s type. Organization types include firms, universities, national labs, research
institutes, U.S. government organizations, hospitals, and academies of sciences. The second part of
an organization code is a numeric code that uniquely identifies an organization within each type.
         The organization codes aid in the grouping of observations of the same organization by
standardizing the various forms of an organization name. For example, the name “IBM” can also
appear as “IBM Corp.” or “IBM Corporation.” The word “University” in an organization name can
also appear in an abbreviated form as “Univ”, or it can appear in another language, for example, as
“Universidad.” Common misspellings in organization names are also handled by using organization
codes as the grouping unit. We made no systematic attempts to capture and trace name changes or to
code subparts of organizations which do not incorporate the parent’s name in their own.
         Combining organization code and address fields can be used to obtain data for organizations
at the establishment level – that is, activity of an organization occurring at a particular location.
However, such constructed establishment data should be used carefully, since the underlying legacy
databases do not use that concept.
         Probably the most difficult cases are for US patents, where there is no definitive indication of
where or in what organization the inventive activity occurred. Inventors are required by law to be
identified by residence address. Organizations appear only if the patent is assigned to them by the
inventors by the time the patent is issued (“assignee at issue”). These assignee organizations are
most likely to be an employer of one or more of the inventors, but in some cases independent
inventors sell the rights to their invention at arm’s length to an organization prior to issue of the
patent, or indeed inventors’ employers can similarly sell their rights to another organization before
issuance of the patent. A familiar example of the latter would be the case of a university faculty
inventor whose university has given a firm funding the research a right of first refusal to any
resulting intellectual property rights. In any case for multi-location organizations, the address of the
assignee is often the corporate headquarters and not the location of the inventive activity. Therefore,
we recommend using inventor addresses to locate the inventive activity geographically. When the
individual ID numbers are available for frequent authors and inventors, it may be possible to infer the
extent of error introduced by using empirically the assignee at issue as the employer of the inventors.

2.3      Geocoding of Addresses in Nanobank
         A significant amount of geocoding work was performed on the Nanobank dataset to make the
geographic information easier to use. The geocoding work had a number of goals, including:
standardization between the various naming conventions used in different sources, standardization of
non-uniformly recorded data, and correction of common misspellings. For observations with
locations in the United States, the geocoding also provides additional grouping units not available in
the original source data. For example, city and state information are commonly found in the source
data, but our geocoding work adds additional information such as county locations and US Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA) functional economic areas. Of particular interest is the latitude and
longitude associated with each address, permitting easy computation of distances between locations
if that variable is of interest.
         U.S. observations are those that are located within the 50 U.S. states, the District of
Columbia, and 7 U.S. associated areas. Cities, states, and counties are given numeric codes from the
“Populated Places” data obtained from the FIPS 55 database. City names are standardized and
matched to names in the FIPS database on a state-by-state basis. In the journal articles data, 99.98%
of the U.S. observations are assigned a definite city code and state code.
         The BEA economic areas are composed of 179 functional economic areas in the U.S.
assigned by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. These areas consist of one or more economic nodes –
metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas that serve as regional centers of economic activity and
the surrounding counties that are economically related to the nodes. The BEA areas used for
Nanobank were defined on November 17, 2004. Each county in the U.S. is assigned to a unique BEA
area, with multiple counties contained within each BEA area.

2.4     Using Nanobank
        An old English saying holds that “The proof of the pudding is in the eating,” and so the value
of Nanobank (and COMETS) can only be judged by the research that it enables. A number of papers
in this special issue of Annales make a down payment on that program, and a substantially larger
number of research projects by users of Nanobank (and now COMETS) are underway. Here we
present some simple uses of Nanobank by way of illustration and suggestion of its capabilities in
providing data for more extensive research projects.
        It is extremely difficult if not impossible to measure firm entry in any given country, much
less comparably across countries. Darby and Zucker (2005) demonstrated that first appearance as
author’s address on a nano-article or assignee on a nano-patent served as a useful measure of entry
for nanotechnology companies. Zucker and Darby (2014) confirmed this for across the range of
sciences and high-technology industries and specifically found no important difference in the results
for firm entry whether this proxy or a directory-and-web-based enumeration of nano-firm entry was
used. In a series of articles reviewed in Zucker and Darby (2009, 2014) the senior authors and their
coauthors have shown that the very top “star” scientists are key determinants of where and when
firms with related high-technologies enter and which firms are most successful.
        Figures 2 and 3 show how the data in Nanobank can be used to measure firm entry across
regions (B.E.A. functional economic areas) in the United States and across countries in the world
where the cumulative number of firm entries over 1981-2004 (the bulk since 1990) are indicated by

                                                 14

these maps. The high correlation between the number of stars (indicated by the size of the stars) and
then number of entries is even more striking in the animated maps noted at the bottom of each figure.
Zucker and Darby (2009, 2014) report rigorous multivariate statistical tests which confirm the
impression from the maps.

3       Constructing the COMETS Database

        Construction of the COMETS data base under the STAR and COMETS project 2007-2015
builds on the methodology and groundwork of Nanobank. However, the goals have expanded
considerably to cover all sciences and high-technologies and ultimately to span the national
innovation system from government funding and policies through scientific advance and industrial
formation and transformation. Further, policy change at a key vendor due to a change in ownership
between the starts of the Nanobank and STAR and COMETS projects limits availability of articles
data except in aggregated analysis data sets to a limited number of on-site users at NBER and UCLA.
Nonetheless, with this exception for post-2005 articles data, COMETS data can be used in lieu of
Nanobank data as we include information indicating which patents and grants – and other records as
they are added – are identified as being relevant to nano-scale science and engineering, and the
particular methods used to make the identifications (keywords, probabilistic, authoritative).
        The Kauffman Foundation encouraged early use of the data through a COMETS Travel
Grants Program that supported the presentation of COMETS data based empirical research at
conferences through direct grants to users. Numerous papers using COMETS, Nanobank, or both
have since been presented, and many published, spreading the word in the most way about the value
of these databases.
        The conceptual structure of COMETS is illustrated in Figure 4. The ovals represent the major
actors in the national innovation system and the connecting hypothesized represent flows of
resources, knowledge, and/or innovation among them. Identified data sources for which we have
acquired rights to use data are indicated in the ovals for which they are most relevant. Type-face
codes for the data sources indicate whether the data are available in COMETS 2.0 (the latest version
as this article goes to press), are planned for future releases (after beta-testing in COMETSbeta and
COMETSandSTARS), or due to contractual restrictions imposed by vendors will be available only to
on-site COMETSandSTARS users at NBER and/or UCLA.5 For each added legacy data set,
considerable time and effort is required for parsing legacy data sets into usable fields; cleaning the
data for both vendors’ and our own processing errors; matching organizations and scientists with
those currently in the database and creating new IDs for new cases of each; and managing the beta
test and responding to users comments and corrections. As a result, how far the Zucker-Darby team

all the nano-firm entry and nano-stars in the world.

  Figure 4 is updated in press to the latest version in order to provide readers the most up-to-date status. Changes
from COMETS and for future upgrades are documented as they are made at the COMETS, COMETSbeta, and
COMETSandSTARS websites and on-site codebooks and other records.

empty ovals – is dependent on the availability of follow-on funding.

some detail. Section 3.2 documents the flags used to indicate five (six counting nanotechnology)

associated with an individual whenever they appear in any of the constituent legacy databases is laid

3.1     COMETS 1.0
        COMETS version 1.0 – the initial release at the Kauffman Foundation website – integrates
the US patents data with NIH and NSF grants data. Comments from the 100-plus beta-testers indicate
that even those just interested, say, in using the patent data find the parsed and matched data much
preferable to using data available from the US Patent and Trademark Office. The COMETS 1.0
database includes 3,911,920 US patents with grant dates from 1976 to 2010. The government grants
data includes 418,054 NIH grants and 345,574 NSF grants from 1972 to 2010. A description of the
contents of the COMETS 1.0 database is included in Table 4. As with the corresponding tables for
Nanobank, a careful perusal of Table 4 will reward the reader with an understanding of the large
number of variables included and even larger number which can be constructed using the information
in COMETS.

3.2      Science and Technology Areas in COMETS
         In our work on biotechnology, it was possible to track a relatively narrowly defined body of
knowledge from its origins (largely in universities), to development of inventions represented by
patents, to commercial applications in firms and ultimately into goods and service in the market
place. Nanobank aims to define a similarly relative narrow but even more broadly interdisciplinary
set of articles, patents, and firms with the affiliation and/or location of individual participants
identified so far as possible. It is natural to want to compare activities in nanotechnology (or
biotechnology) with those in other science and technology (S&T) areas, but in attempting to do so we
learned that it was generally more difficult to find narrowly defined areas of science (categorizing
articles and doctoral programs) that correspond to narrowly defined areas of technology (categorizing
by patent classes) that correspond to narrowly defined areas of industry (categorizing by
governmental or financial market definitions of industry).
         In Darby and Zucker (1999) and Zucker and Darby (1999) we developed and detailed a
concordance across five science and engineering areas, technological areas, and industrial
applications for analyses that spanned scientific articles, patents, and university doctoral-programs
data from the National Research Council (1995): Biology, Chemistry & Medicine; Computing &
Information Technology; Semiconductors, Integrated Circuits & Superconductors; Other Sciences;
and Other Engineering. We were unable to find finer breakdowns that did not require data in greater
detail than existed in one or more of these sources. Our experience since has been that this
concordance is generally useful for a number of analytical purposes and we make it available in
COMETS for others who might be inclined to use it in their work. In our own use of these areas, we
create a sixth S&T area of nanotechnology by subtracting the records flagged as nano-S&T related
from the S&T areas in which they would otherwise appear. Detailed concordances are posted at
http://www.nanobank.org/downloads.php.


                                                 19
         By way of example, in research described in Zucker and Darby (2014) we applied these
categories, with articles and firms based upon the Nanobank technologies subtracted to form a sixth
specific Nanoscale Science & Technology area. That analysis showed that firms in all six areas were
more likely to be founded in countries or U.S. regions when and where top “star” scientists and
engineers for the given S&T area were resident. In this case both surprising similarities and
interesting variations in patterns of firm birth and star migration were observed. We hope that they
will prove equally useful for other purposes beyond their origin.

         The concordance as posted is organized in three tables for articles, patents, and NRC (1995)
doctoral programs. Each of these tables contains a list of document categorizations and the
corresponding Zucker-Darby category codes and descriptions. The categorizations for articles are the
journal categories assigned by the ISI Web of Knowledge. The patent categorizations are the
International Patent Classifications assigned by the World Intellectual Property Organization. The
categorizations for NRC doctoral programs are the NRC standard doctoral programs. Corresponding
tables for industries are being prepared and will be posted in the near future. Please contact us if you
want to be notified as soon as they are available and the number of such requests will guide the
priorities for our available time for building new data series.

3.3     Person Matching
        The greatest challenge in building both Nanobank and COMETS has proven to be person
matching or disambiguating tens of millions of observations of individuals’ names down to millions
of unique individuals acting variously as inventors, principal investigators, authors, entrepreneurs,
chief scientists, and other guises. There are in fact a number of active scientists with exactly identical
names – some family names are common and certain combinations of family and given names are
more appealing to parents than others. The substantive problems are: (a) In all the legacy databases
(patents, research articles, grants, the various financial databases) there is no attempt to assign a
unique identifier used each time a certain individual appears.6 (b) A given individual’s names may
appear differently depending on the conventions applied by the particular person or institution
inputting the data (e.g., a patent attorney or journal editor) or to changing circumstances or habits of
the individual (e.g., marriage, dropping a middle name with increased fame). (c) The research article

6
 There is an internal effort to use unique identifiers at the federal granting agencies, but that effort is not reflected as
of this date in the available databases.


                                                                   25
data until very recent years gave only family name and initials for given names and associated the
addresses listed on the article only in the case of the corresponding author.7 (d) The other-than-name
information known for each individual observation varies even within legacy databases and more so
across legacy databases – e.g. work addresses in grants, articles, and financial data versus residence
addresses (usually with missing street address) in patents. (e) Scalability of matching methods
becomes an issue as the number of calculations and probability comparisons rises exponentially with
the number of unique observations and hence possible matches. (f) Using information about an
individual gleaned from other legacy databases can improve the quality of the matches in a given
legacy database, but this implies an inherent iteration which multiplies the scalability issues. (g) Data
quality is hard to assess and reservation of known individuals for quality checking means the
probability calculations in the match are less accurate than if the reserved data had been used in
estimation.
        The methodology we use for person matching can be outlined as follows.
    1. First we either locate or build a learning set of thousands of individuals for whom we have or
        can obtain essentially complete data across the main legacy databases.
    2. We then simplify the problem by considering only cases for which the family name and first
        initial are the same as possible matches. This means that we will never match misspelled
        family names or errors in first initials, but it makes the problem computationally tractable.8
    3. Next for each legacy database we collect all possible matches to the individuals in the
        learning set and use the listed names in each observation plus such collateral information as
        address match, other individuals on the same record, keywords, S&T field for record, journal
        match, to calculate probability estimators based on the learning set for each legacy database
        and for across database pairs.
    4. The match begins within each legacy database by imposing some definite matches with
        probability 1 (e.g., for authors or inventors self-citing prior articles or patents and for
        continuing groups [half or more the same] of co-authors or co-inventors).
    5. Next probabilities are computed for every possible remaining pairwise match for each last
        name first initial combination. Those pairs with probabilities above a selected threshold are
        declared matched, starting with the pair with the highest probability and then going on to the
        highest among the remaining unpaired records until no remaining pairs meet the threshold.
    6. Using all the information in each group (initially pairs) the probability that other groups or
        unmatched records is a match is computed and those with a probability above a second
        (lower) threshold are declared matched. This process is iterated until there are no remaining

7
  The addresses (almost always a work address) given in the journal are all listed, but only one of these is associated
with a particular author designated as the corresponding author. We know the address(es) associated with an author
only if that author is the corresponding author, a sole author, or one of several authors on an article with only one
listed address in a year in which the journal lists multiple addresses on other articles. Note that even for a
corresponding author, we only know one address of possibly several addresses even if she lists dual affiliations
unless she is the sole author.

8 Person matching is done off-line on the CISTCP cluster running 32 Sun processors in parallel as required by
vendors’ licensing terms. Nonetheless, a full run with a single set of probability parameters takes weeks, not days.


                                                          26
       matches meeting the second higher grouping threshold. The second threshold used for
       matching between groups of observations is lower than the first threshold used for matching
       between single observations because there is usually more information available when
       considering groups of observations. The first threshold is higher to avoid creating false
       matches when less information is available and there are more instances of missing
       information. If a true match is missed due to this higher threshold, there will still be
       additional opportunities to create a match in the second pass for group matching.
    7. Next all information in each group (including groups of size 1) created within each legacy
       database is used to compute probabilities of matching with every group in other legacy
       databases. The higher grouping threshold is again applied to create cross-database matches.
       This process iterates until no further matches meet the threshold.
    8. Unique ID numbers are assigned to each of the groups (including the groups of size one
       which are treated as single appearances by a unique individual).

        In mid-August 2011 we were very close to having a full match to test against known matches
for Type I and II errors in articles and patents. We learned from that test that matching across data
sets with very different information can greatly enrich knowledge about individual scientists, but we
see that active work/analysis with these data are necessary for improvement of the match and
removal of systematic errors, such as systematic changes in original data cleaning, as in ISI where
compound last names (e.g., Burne-Jones) are initially separated into two words separated by a space
(Burne Jones) and later run together with no hyphen (BurneJones). Hence, we are now working to
further improve matching procedures, beginning with patent data. Person IDs for those databases
which permit it will initially be available in COMETSandSTARS only. We will test the match
quality there while monitoring the experiences of the Fleming group with full public release of
person level identifiers in patents (Li et al. 2014 in press). We expect then to add individual IDs for
persons wherever they appear as inventors and authors in the patent data, NSF and NIH grant data,
and a prototype open-source articles database, first in COMETSbeta, and then into the COMETS and
Nanobank sites.

4      Conclusions

       COMETS can be seen as a work in progress, and it clearly is. The Zucker-Darby team has an
ambitious agenda to complete processing, testing, and adding to the COMETS files important legacy
databases which will deepen the community’s ability to develop tested knowledge on the processes
of knowledge formation and use in discovery, innovation, technological progress, and economic
growth. After the first three months, more than 130 beta-test users are using the data so far provided
in COMETS 1.0. Science policy, economic growth and the nation will all profit from their efforts. If
funding is available to complete the COMETS build-out, among our next steps are re-engineering of
data on public firms primarily drawn directly from edgar.gov and other government public sources,
and a re-engineering of public science sources, including Google, to develop new data on links
between academic scientists and firms which can be posted on the public website. We will include an
updated and extended Nanobank database including public article data within COMETS, allowing

                                                  27
research on this important new S&T area up through 2012 instead of the current cut-off at 2005. The
authors hope that further extensions and enhancements will be undertaken by a permanent
institutional home charged with maintaining and developing Connecting Outcome Measures in
Entrepreneurship, Technology and Science. We believe that the best way to ensure continued
national investment in the scientific seed corn of scientific, economic, and social policy is by
documenting carefully for the public and their representatives the impressive payoffs earned on their
investments.
         In conclusion, the Nanobank and COMETS databases provide very flexible sources of micro
