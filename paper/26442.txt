                                         ABSTRACT

Nascent research suggests intergenerational health mobility may be relatively high and non-
genetic factors may make room for policy intervention. This project broadens this direction by
considering heterogeneous intergenerational health mobility in spatial and contextual patterns.
With 14,797 parent-child pairs from a school-based representative panel survey of adolescents
(Add Health), this study finds large spatial variation in intergenerational health mobility in the
United States. On average relative mobility in this sample is approximately 0.17 and expected
health rank for children of parents at the 25th percentile of parent health is 47. These metrics
however mask substantial spatial heterogeneity. In cases of low health mobility, rank-rank slopes
can approach 0.5 or expected child health rank may only be the 34th percentile. Descriptive
school- and contextual-level correlates of this spatial variation indicate localities with higher
proportions of non-Hispanic blacks, school PTAs, or a school health education requirement may
experience greater health mobility.

Introduction
A growing literature on intergenerational relationships seeks to understand whether and why (or
why not) the United States is truly a “land of opportunity”. Examining the interconnectedness of
generations is important not only to understand present disparities in key socioeconomic
outcomes, but also in planning for future generations and identifying potential interventions. This
study undertakes the examination of intergenerational health mobility, a branch of the
intergenerational persistence literature which often examines the intergenerational persistence of
socioeconomic status as defined by income or earnings. Although health is often neglected in
research on intergenerational mobility, there is a small but growing body of literature to
explicitly examine intergenerational health mobility.

Health throughout the life course is pivotal to many experiences in life including education, labor
market participation, and aging. Poor health in childhood is associated with lower educational
attainment (Case, Fertig, & Paxson 2005; Haas & Fosse 2008), which in turn is associated with
lower likelihood of successful aging and higher mortality (McLaughlin 2017; Meara, Richards,
& Cutler 2008). Self-rated general health status itself may be a predictor of mortality (DeSalvo,
Bloser, Reynolds, He, & Muntner 2006; Idler & Angel 1990). Experiencing poor health during
prime working ages can also have lasting effects. Healthy men on average are found to work
more, earn more, and have higher net worth (Hokayem & Ziliak 2014). In the event that ill health
prevents an individual from actively or fully engaging in the labor market, such work limitations
are associated with significant drops in earnings as well as post tax-transfer income up to a
decade after onset of a work-limiting health condition (Meyer & Mok 2018).

Understanding the intergenerational persistence of health is warranted for a variety of reasons.
First, it is important to determine whether, and how much, of an individual’s health trajectory is
potentially modifiable. That is to say that if health is perfectly transmitted across generations,
then there could be little room for policy to moderate outcomes and such efforts may be a waste.
However, under the more likely assumption that there are some environmental components to
health, then an intergenerational approach can help illuminate expected future outcomes for
subsequent generations. Third, the approach could identify possible spillovers of interventions
that may simultaneously benefit multiple generations. Finally, as research continues to develop,
optimal timing of interventions to maximize spillovers and improve health may be feasible with

                                                  2
a solid understanding of the intergenerational transmission of health. Ultimately, such
improvements in general health if successful could theoretically lead to reduced public health
burden in terms of lower medical expenses. If better health translates into improved work
capacity (and correspondingly less work-limiting health conditions), social costs for programs
such as Social Security Disability Insurance, which constitutes a major and growing public
expenditure (Autor & Duggan 2006), may be alleviated.

Results from this study suggest there is a non-negligible intergenerational persistence in health
that is present for both biological and adoptee parent-child pairs. While these nationally
representative estimates are informative to gauge overall health persistence, the metrics mask
significant heterogeneity in the United States, and characteristics of geographic localities are
used to explore correlations with health mobility. Areas that are suburban or rural tend to
experience less relative mobility, while localities with higher income inequality may have higher
health mobility on average. Granular school-based characteristics such as whether a school has a
Parent-Teacher Association or a Health Education requirement are found to be positively
associated with intergenerational health mobility.

The remainder of this paper is organized into four additional sections. The second section
presents the relevant literature to form the basis of the current analysis. The third section
discusses the methods and data, and the fourth section presents the main results of the analysis.
The final section discusses results and implications.



Background
Previous research in intergenerational mobility typically examines the persistence of
socioeconomic status as measured by income, earnings, or educational attainment. This literature
has uncovered that contrary to the notion of the “American Dream”, where anyone can achieve
economic success if he/she is willing to work for it, the United States tends to experience
relatively lower levels of intergenerational economic mobility relative to peer income nations
(Corak 2013; Solon 2002). In addition to these low national estimates, scholarship has shown
broad-based underlying heterogeneity in terms of race/ethnicity (Chetty, Hendren, Jones, &




                                                  3
Porter 2018; Hertz 2005; Mazumder 2014) and geography (Chetty, Hendren, Kline, & Saez
2014).

A much smaller literature explores intergenerational persistence of health. An early example
examined the intergenerational correlation of birthweight in California, finding low birthweight
mothers are more likely to have low birthweight children, and the intergenerational persistence
of birthweight was around 0.2 (Currie & Moretti 2007). Using outcomes a little later in the life
course, Thompson (2014) examines the intergenerational transmission of asthma, hay fever,
chronic headaches (migraines), and diabetes, finding a range of estimates from 0.006 for diabetes
to 0.276 for hay fever (Thompson 2014). The intergenerational elasticity of body mass index has
been estimated between 0.3-0.4 (Classen 2010; Classen & Thompson 2016). An example
examining the intergenerational persistence of mental health in Britain also found a correlation
of 0.16 (Johnston, Schurer, & Shields 2013). What emerges from this literature is a relatively
consistent estimate of intergenerational health persistence in the 0.2 – 0.3 range.

A recent paper that is most similar to the present analysis uses the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (PSID) to examine intergenerational health mobility in self-reported health status,
corroborating previous estimates of intergenerational health persistence (Halliday et al. 2018).
Notably the authors also are the first to apply the concept of “absolute mobility” from Chetty et
al. (2014) to the health context. This is distinguished from “relative mobility” – the slope
coefficient of a standard OLS regression (intergenerational elasticity, or when adjusted by
respective standard deviations of the variable in each generation, intergenerational correlation).
This paper is also the first to apply the rank-based approach from Chetty et al. (2014), which has
been found to also exhibit improved properties regarding the standard assumption of linearity for
estimation in the health context (Wong, Mazumder, & Halliday 2019).

While Halliday et al. (2018) make important contributions to examining the intergenerational
persistence of general health status, the dataset limits the ability to explore spatial variation in
mobility. The PSID affords many advantages including regular observations of individuals over
time, a genealogical design, up to 50 years of data on multiple generations, and in recent years,
the inclusion of rich data on health conditions. However, the sample size can be relatively small,
does not capture a large Hispanic population, and it does not afford the opportunity to examine
spatial variation in intergenerational health mobility, which is likely to exist in the United States

                                                   4
given documented heterogeneity in intergenerational economic mobility (Chetty et al. 2014).
Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), the present
paper complements and extends previous work in two important ways. First, the sample size is
more than 80% larger, allowing corroboration of important estimates including race/ethnicity
stratifications in addition to specifically examining Hispanics separately. The larger sample also
yields a sizable subsample of adoptees which will assist in determining the potential role for non-
genetic factors, or public policy to moderate intergenerational transmission, complementing
previous work regarding the genetic role for intergenerational health persistence (Classen &
Thompson 2016; Thompson 2014). Second, a school-based sample design in addition to the
larger sample allows for examining spatial variation of mobility estimates.

This study addresses four key research questions. First, it estimates intergenerational health
mobility using a large nationally representative sample. Following previous literature, it also
estimates the expected rank in a national health distribution for a child conditional on his/her
parent(s) health status. Third, by stratifying key mobility metrics for biological and adoptee
parent-child pairs, this study considers whether the environment (or non-genetic factors) play a
role in observed intergenerational health mobility. Finally, the heterogeneity of mobility metrics
by race/ethnicity, parent and child characteristics, and geography is explored.




Methods and Data
Intergenerational health mobility is estimated following traditional specifications in the literature
of intergenerational economic mobility (Mazumder 2005; Solon 1992, 2004), with recent
applications to intergenerational health mobility (Akbulut-Yuksel & Kugler 2016; Classen 2010;
Currie & Moretti 2007; Halliday et al. 2018; Johnston et al. 2013). Specifically, parent’s self-
reported health status (𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑝 ) is regressed on child’s self-reported health status (𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐 ) using
Ordinary Least Squares controlling for age in quadratic form in both generations (𝐶𝐶𝑧𝑧 ) as in
equation (1).

 (1)                              𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑝 + � 𝛽𝛽𝑧𝑧 𝐶𝐶𝑧𝑧 + 𝜀𝜀




                                                       5
Two metrics of intergenerational mobility are measured from equation (1). The first is referred to
as "relative” mobility in some literature (Chetty et al. 2014; Halliday et al. 2018), and is
measured by 𝛽𝛽1. The second establishes the expected outcome for children conditional on a
parent’s health status – what Chetty et al. (2014) conceptualize as “absolute” mobility – is
measured as in equation (2).

 (2)                             𝐸𝐸�𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐 |𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑝 = 𝑥𝑥� = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1 (𝑥𝑥)



Self-rated health status is typically measured on a five-point Likert scale with one representing
poor health and five representing excellent health. As the marginal distribution of the Likert
scale for self-rated health is likely non-constant, this study adopts a latent variable approach such
that self-rated health responses represent an underlying, but unobserved, health status. The
HALex index maps self-rated health status to unobserved latent health conceptualizing perfect
health with a score of one and death with a score of zero (Erickson 1998; Erickson, Wilson, &
Shannon 1995), and has been applied previously in the literature to address concerns surrounding
the marginal distribution of health from the Likert scale (Halliday et al. 2018; Johnson &
Schoeni 2011). Following these examples, this analysis assigns the midpoint of established
HALex interval values of 15, 50, 77.5, 90, and 97.5 to self-rated health statuses of poor, fair,
good, very good, and excellent in both generations.

Measuring the intergenerational transmission of health using an OLS specification requires an
assumption of linearity. Research in intergenerational economic mobility suggests using logged
observed income or earnings may present some non-linearities that are typically resolved using a
rank-based approach (Chetty et al. 2014). Analogously, a recent working paper suggests that
estimates of intergenerational health mobility, the Intergenerational Health Association (IHA)
from Halliday et al. (2018), which use simply the HALex adjusted levels for self-rated health
status in both generations may produce estimates that are biased downward by 10 – 20 percent.
However, ranking health statuses in each generation and then applying these rank-based
measures to equation (1) does not appear to yield any meaningful bias to estimates when
adopting the assumption of linearity for OLS (Wong et al. 2019).




                                                    6
The preferred results in this analysis therefore adopt a rank-based measure of self-rated health
from the HALex adjusted scale, although both formulations are estimated. Most estimates that
follow will incorporate four main metrics: (1) the IHA slope, 𝛽𝛽1 coefficient from equation 1
using HALex level self-rated health in both generations, (2) a Rank slope, 𝛽𝛽1 coefficient from
equation 1 using rank-based self-rated health in both generations, (3) the expected health rank of
a child conditional on his/her parent having health rank at the 25th and (4) 75th percentile of
parent health from equation 2. The first two are measures of relative mobility, where more (less)
mobility is characterized by a lower (higher) metric. The latter two estimates are used following
literature selecting these percentiles (Chetty et al. 2014; Halliday et al. 2018) to gauge absolute
mobility with the understanding that if mobility were perfect the expected health rank for all
children regardless of parents’ health rank would be the median.

Data comes from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health),
a school-based nationally representative panel survey of adolescents from grades 7-12. This
study incorporates child reports of self-rated health status from four waves of data (1994-1995,
1996, 2001-2002, and 2008-2009) and parents’ self-reported health from the first wave from a
total of 131 schools. The school-based design is critical for this analysis, as it allows for
examining spatial variation in estimates, which has not previously been explored in the
intergenerational health mobility literature. The final full sample consists of 14,797 parent-child
pairs.

Various stratifications of equation 1 help understand the heterogeneity of intergenerational health
mobility that exists in the United States. In particular, this analysis examines such heterogeneity
based on a variety of factors found to be influential in the literature on intergenerational
economic mobility such as race/ethnicity (Chetty et al. 2018; Hertz 2005; Mazumder 2014), and
geography (Chetty et al. 2014). Additionally, we incorporate stratified specifications to examine
other factors associated with possible disadvantage including health insurance (as in Halliday et
al. 2018), parent marital status, and parent education. These results are weighted to reflect more
nationally-representative metrics. Spatial variation in particular is examined further using
Census-tract specific characteristics to examine whether there are certain characteristics
(demographic, socioeconomic, and/or school-specific programs) which may correlate with
observed intergenerational health mobility measured at the school level.


                                                  7
Results
For our nationally representative sample of the United States, relative intergenerational health
mobility as measured by a rank-rank slope is estimated at 0.174 (95% confidence interval: 0.141
– 0.206). Children whose parents are in relatively poorer health (at the 25th percentile of parent
health) are anticipated to reach near the 47th percentile of health on average, while children
whose parents are in relatively better health (the 75th percentile of parent health rank) are
expected to achieve near the 56th percentile of health as adults. Estimates using the PSID suggest
the rank-rank slope coefficient to be 0.261 and expected child health rank for those whose
parents are at the 25th (75th) percentile of parent health is 44.3 (57.4) (Halliday et al. 2018).
Within these nationally representative estimates however is significant heterogeneity by
race/ethnicity, parent and child characteristics, and geography. Results also point to non-genetic
factors exerting some influence on intergenerational health mobility as adoptive parent-child
pairs also experience non-zero relative mobility.

Heterogeneity in intergenerational health mobility is present by race/ethnicity (Figure 1 and
Table A1 in the Appendix). Specifically, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic parent-child pairs
may experience greater relative mobility, meaning these subpopulations observe lower slope
estimates both in terms of level health and health rank, relative to non-Hispanic whites. Figure 1
however suggests only Hispanic parent-child pairs have statistically more relative mobility.
Children born to parents in relatively poorer health (at the 25th percentile of parent health) are
generally not expected to reach median health as adults, and point estimates are generally
consistent across race-ethnicity categories. Hispanic children though may have the best chances
of achieving median health as adults, but differences do not appear statistically different.
Meanwhile children born to parents in relatively good health (the 75th percentile of parent health
rank) exhibit a bit more heterogeneity in terms of expected child rank. Estimates suggest non-
Hispanic black children and Hispanic children may experience more mean reversion, landing
nearer the 50th percentile of health rank relative to their non-Hispanic white counterparts.
Coefficient results are somewhat in contrast to results from Halliday et al. (2018), who find black
parent-child pairs experience a coefficient of relative mobility approximately half that of their
white counterparts as well as observing a ten percentile gap in expected health rank for children
whose parents are at the 25th percentile of parent health rank.

       Notes: IHA slope is the Intergenerational Health Association slope (𝛽𝛽1 coefficient from equation 1) using
       HALex level self-rated health in both generations. Rank slope is the 𝛽𝛽1 coefficient using health ranks in
       both generations. E(rank|p25) is the expected health rank for a child conditional on his/her parent observed
       at the 25th percentile of parent health, and E(rank|p75) is the expected health rank for children whose
       parent(s) are observed at the 75th percentile of parent health. Estimates are weighted, and use the full Add
       Health sample. Red dots represent point estimates and vertical lines are the corresponding 95% confidence
       intervals.

Certain characteristics of parent-child pairs can be identified as disadvantageous in Table 1. For
example, children who ever were without health insurance as young adults (in wave four)
generally observe lower expected health ranks relative to those who always had health insurance,
although disadvantage appears concentrated in non-Hispanic white populations and to a limited
degree among non-Hispanic blacks at lower parent health ranks (gaps are not statistically
significant, but in the hypothesized direction). Halliday et al. (2018) also estimate lower expected
child health rank for children exposed to disadvantageous environments with respect to health
insurance. Children whose parent(s) were unmarried or whose mothers had less than a High
School education similarly tend to observe lower expected health relative to children of married
parents and mothers with more than a High School credential. The gap observed between
“advantaged” and “disadvantaged” parent-child pairs though is not constant throughout the
parent health distribution, or by race/ethnicity. Generally speaking, the gap in each of these
                                                        9
characteristics increases as parent health increases, which reflects a typically flatter slope for
“disadvantaged” parent-child pairs (signaling higher relative mobility) or that such
characteristics may matter more when the parent is in better health. However, while non-
Hispanic white parent-child pairs observe an increasing gap over parent health rank with respect
to parent marital status, the gradient appears much stronger for Hispanics, and inverted for non-
Hispanic blacks.

One particular advantage to Add Health is the ability to observe a sufficient number of adoptive
parent-child pairs relative to biological parent-child pairs to better understand the potential role
genetics may play in the intergenerational transmission of health. For this exercise, the main
focus is on the 𝛽𝛽1 coefficients from equation 1, or relative mobility, to get at the
intergenerational transmission. Results from this analysis suggest that while intergenerational
transmission is certainly stronger for biological parent-child pairs, reflecting both genetic and
environment factors, intergenerational transmission due to the environment is non-negligible
with a statistically significant IHA slope estimate of 0.060 and rank slope estimate of 0.117,
representing a 39% and 32% reduction in slope estimates from the biological parent-child pair
sample respectively. 1

National-based estimates for intergenerational health mobility also mask underlying
heterogeneity in geography. Figure 2 (and Table A2 in the Appendix) demonstrate the stark
differences in all four mobility metrics when measured at the school level. Regardless of the
metric considered, some schools experience high mobility while some experience low mobility.
In some cases of particularly low mobility, rank slope estimates can approach 0.5 while other
places experience rank slopes near zero. Similarly, in some locations, children born to parents in
relatively poor health (at the 25th percentile of parent health) can expect only a nine-percentile
improvement over his/her parents’ health rank while in other locations children born to parents
experiencing such health may achieve greater than median health as adults. Meanwhile children
born to parents in good health (at the 75th percentile) may be expected to maintain a similar
health status as adults for some schools while they could also be expected to experience health
that is below the median as adults in other locations.

 This exercise does not make use of the Add Health weights or complex survey design. Adopted children were part
of a genetic oversample in Add Health and applying weights dramatically reduces sample size in this subpopulation.
Biological parent-child pair subsamples however remain robust to estimation with or without weights.

       Notes: IHA slope is the Intergenerational Health Association slope (𝛽𝛽1 coefficient from equation 1) using
       HALex level self-rated health in both generations. Rank slope is the 𝛽𝛽1 coefficient using health ranks in
       both generations. E(rank|p25) is the expected health rank for a child conditional on his/her parent observed
       at the 25th percentile of parent health, and E(rank|p75) is the expected health rank for children whose
       parent(s) are observed at the 75th percentile of parent health. Estimates are not weighted, but use only
       children identified in the core sample to produce school-specific results. Red lines represent the full
       (national) estimates, while black dots/line represent various school-specific estimates. Vertical lines are the
       corresponding 95% confidence intervals for individual school estimate.

Following Chetty et al. (2014), we also explore contextual correlates of our school-based
mobility estimates. These place-specific correlates of intergenerational health mobility appear in
Table 2. Rural and suburban areas tend to experience less intergenerational health mobility in
terms of relative rank slope and absolute mobility, although this is only statistically significant at
the 10% level. Point estimates however also suggest rural areas on average could have lower
absolute mobility as well. Suburban children may also experience less mobility, but the
magnitudes tend to be lower with the exception of the IHA slope. Race and ethnicity
characteristics of the area also seem to matter for health mobility. Areas with higher minority
populations tend to experience higher relative mobility (consistent with results from race-
ethnicity stratified estimation), but these estimates also identify a statistically lower expected

rank for children born to parents in good health (the 75th percentile) in areas with higher minority
populations. A larger portion of single parents in the area is associated with increased relative
health mobility (IHA and rank slopes are lower), while there does not appear to be a correlation
with absolute upward mobility. The area’s socioeconomic characteristics may also matter;
however, average socioeconomic status of the area (as measured by median income) does not
have a robust relationship with any of these mobility metrics. Point estimates suggest there may
be lower health mobility across all metrics in areas with higher median income, but estimates are
not statistically significant. Income inequality on the other hand (as measured by the standard
deviation in income for the area) may make a difference, where areas with high income
inequality tend to experience greater health mobility; however, only the IHA slope is statistically
significant 2. Finally, there are specific school characteristics that are associated with health
mobility. Schools with a Parent-Teacher Association have lower rank slopes (higher relative
mobility), while schools with a health education requirement may observe relatively higher
health rank (nearly a five percentile bump) for their students whose parents are at the 25th
percentile of parent health.

Discussion
A nationally representative school-based sample of adolescents in the United States is used to
estimate intergenerational health mobility in relative and absolute terms. Relative mobility using
health ranks in both generations is found to be 0.174 (95% confidence interval: 0.141 – 0.206),
under the assumption of linearity in the measure (Halliday et al. 2018; Wong et al. 2019).
Absolute mobility for children whose parents are at the 25th (75th) percentile of parent health is
estimated to be 47.2 (55.9), meaning children are expected to reach approximately the 47th and
56th percentiles respectively conditional on parent health rank. These nationally representative
estimates however mask significant heterogeneity in the United States. Specifically, this study
uncovers heterogeneous health mobility based on parent and child characteristics, geography,
and school characteristics. Results also broadly suggest that policies may influence
intergenerational health mobility. Not only are school characteristics such as having a PTA or
health education requirement found to matter for health mobility, but intergenerational
transmission of health (from slope coefficients) is non-zero for adoptive parent-child pairs,
suggesting non-genetic factors are at play in the intergenerational transmission of health.

Results from this study are generally in line with expectations based on previous research. For
example, the few studies that have estimated intergenerational health mobility have found 𝛽𝛽1
coefficients from equation 1 to be 0.2 – 0.3 for self-rated health status using the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics (Halliday et al. 2018; Wong et al. 2019), 0.163 for mental health using the
1970 British Birth Cohort Study (Johnston et al. 2013), 0.17 – 0.2 for birth weight in California
(Currie & Moretti 2007), and 0.284 – 0.42 for Body Mass Index using the National Longitudinal

                                                       14
Survey of Youth and National Health Interview Survey (Classen 2010; Classen & Thompson
2016).

The analysis in this paper is most similar to that of Halliday et al. (2018) who also use self-
reported health status as a health measure, yet results are attenuated from their estimates. There
are biases that arise as limitations to this study that relate to this attenuation, specifically a
lifecycle bias and attenuation bias that are well documented in intergenerational economic
mobility literature (Haider & Solon 2006; Halliday et al. 2018; Solon 1992). Add Health only
observes parent health once, which should predictably increase noise in the parent health
estimate due to health shocks that cannot be averaged over time. From figure 4(a) – 4(d) in
Halliday et al. (2018), it is clear that had parent health been only observed once, estimates for the
rank slope would have been lower in that study. Add Health also has the limitation of observing
children earlier in the life course relative to a longer panel dataset such as the PSID. Again from
figure 4(g) – 4(h) in Halliday et al. (2018) observing health at later ages, particularly for sons,
may increase the relative mobility metric (rank slope). Therefore, it is expected that the estimates
of relative mobility in this analysis are attenuated; however, this downward bias should not affect
spatial or contextual patterns so long as the bias is similarly present across groups and schools.

Non-Hispanic black parent-child pairs are typically found to experience disadvantages in
intergenerational economic mobility (Chetty et al. 2018; Hertz 2005; Mazumder 2014). Early
research in intergenerational health mobility, where health is defined by birth weight, finds
mixed evidence with respect to relative mobility by race. A dichotomous indicator of low birth
weight finds greater intergenerational transmission of health for blacks relative to whites, while a
log transformation of continuous birth weight suggests less intergenerational persistence for
blacks relative to whites (Currie & Moretti 2007). Halliday et al. (2018) finds black parent-child
pairs may experience higher relative mobility (rank slope coefficient is 0.13 relative to white
rank slope coefficient of 0.243), but experience an approximately ten percentile gap in expected
absolute health mobility among children whose parents are at the 25th percentile of parent health
(see Table 3). That analysis also finds much more downward health mobility for black children
whose parents are at the 75th percentile of parent health, a gap of approximately 15 percentiles.
Meanwhile, the present analysis only partially corroborates these findings. We find similar
estimates of relative mobility for non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks as was found in


                                                   15
Halliday et al. (2018). However, in contrast to that analysis, we find little gap in expected
absolute mobility for these groups as shown in Table 3. It is unclear what the source of this
discrepancy is – whether it could be due to inclusion of relatively few Hispanic parent-child pairs
in the Halliday et al. (2018) analysis, if health discrepancies have not manifested by the
relatively early age at which Add Health participants are observed, cohort differences, or if there
may be some other reason.

Results from this analysis suggest the environment, and not exclusively genetic factors, play a
role in determining the intergenerational transmission of health. Specifically, in this analysis
relative mobility (the slope coefficient) decreases by approximately 32% in the adoptee sample
relative to the biological parent-child pair sample. Thompson (2014) finds intergenerational
elasticity to decrease by approximately 20-30% for health conditions including asthma, chronic
headaches and hay fever and concludes that most of the intergenerational health transmission
must be at least in part due to the environment. A more recent study on the intergenerational
transmission of Body Mass Index (BMI) however found an adoptee sample with an estimated
elasticity of 0.008, which was not statistically significant, relative to a biological sample with
elasticity of 0.202. The authors conclude that, at least in the transmission of BMI, genetics
appear to play a relatively large role (Classen & Thompson 2016). Considering the estimates
presented in this paper are concerned with overall health as measured by self-reported health
status, it is unsurprising to find slope coefficients attenuated by 32% in the adoptee sample,
between estimates from Thompson (2014) and Classen & Thompson (2016). Collectively the
evidence suggests that while genetic factors certainly play a non-negligible role in the
persistence of health across generations, there is a rather sizable portion of intergenerational
health mobility which appears to be due to environment factors, which is potentially modifiable.


                                                      16
Consistent with evidence suggesting the environment may play a role, this analysis also finds
parent and child characteristics may matter in a future generation’s health. Children without
health insurance, whose parents are unmarried, or whose mother has less than a High School
education are found to experience lower expected health rank relative to their more advantaged
peers. While such stratifications are clearly non-causal, it lends further support to the notion that
health is not predetermined, and that policies and the environment can play a modifying role.

Results from school-stratified analyses show there is significant heterogeneity by geography.
Some schools have rank slopes that are near zero (suggesting little persistence of health from one
generation to the next), while others have rank slopes approaching 0.5, which suggests parent
health has a high association with health in the subsequent generation. Similarly, while some
places observe children at or above the median of health rank when their parents are observed at
the 25th percentile of parent health, other places observe children only achieving the 34th
percentile of health rank. Areas identified with high relative health mobility in general also
experience high absolute health mobility, although the correlation of these metrics is far from
perfect. 3 These results uncovering high geographic heterogeneity of intergenerational health
mobility support research finding high geographic variation in intergenerational economic
mobility (Chetty et al. 2014). Halliday et al. (2018) also find health mobility to be lowest in the
South, although limitations from PSID prevent a more granular analysis.

A main contribution of this paper is the ability to examine place-based correlates of mobility
metrics similar to important work by Chetty et al. (2014) in intergenerational economic mobility.
This analysis finds that rural or suburban areas may have lower mobility, while areas with higher
portions of minority populations can experience higher relative mobility, but lower absolute
mobility among parents in good health. Average socioeconomic status (in this case measured by
median income) does not appear to matter much as a correlate of health mobility; however,
inequality in income may matter more. This result is consistent with Chetty et al. (2014) results
for intergenerational economic mobility. However, while Chetty et al. (2014) find high levels of
income dispersion in an area are associated with lower mobility metrics, the analysis here with
respect to health mobility suggests the opposite: high inequality may be associated with higher

 The correlation across all sample schools of rank slope mobility and expected absolute upward mobility (at the 25th
percentile of parent health) is near 40%.

mobility. One possible rationale for the opposing results may be that exposure to environments
with higher socioeconomic status may be related with lower pollution, better schools, and/or
better medical facilities. Places with school PTAs and health education requirements may also
boost health mobility.

The results of this study rely heavily on self-rated health status as a valid measure of a latent
measure of individual health status. To alleviate some concerns with the marginal distribution of
a five-point Likert scale, the HALex (Erickson 1998; Erickson et al. 1995; Halliday et al. 2018;
Johnson & Schoeni 2011) is incorporated to better represent marginal differences between self-
rated health categories. However, there may be some residual concerns with the measure’s
performance. Using the advantages afforded by the PSID, Halliday et al. (2018) created an
alternative health index which includes 21 indicators of physical and mental health to test the
validity of the more simplistic, but widely available, measure of self-rated health. Using their
alternative health index, they found results to be consistent with estimates using self-reported
health status (Halliday et al. 2018). Additional limitations to the study are the fact that parent
health is observed only once, and child health is observed relatively early in the lifecycle. As
discussed previously, these factors are expected to attenuate the main national estimates, perhaps
even by 20%. However, findings of significant heterogeneity of intergenerational mobility by
parent and child characteristics and geography are likely not to be significantly altered under the
assumption that such biases operate semi-consistently across space and contexts.

The results of this study suggest that intergenerational health mobility may be relatively high in
the United States, but that significant variation exists. Rural and suburban areas tend to
experience less mobility, while areas with high income inequality tend to observe higher
mobility. Children with health insurance, from homes with married parents, or a mother with
more than a High School credential tend to have higher expected health relative to their more
disadvantaged peers. Schools with a PTA or a health education requirement may also experience
more health mobility.

    Notes: Table A1 corresponds to Figure 1 above. IHA slope is the Intergenerational Health Association
    slope (𝛽𝛽1 coefficient from equation 1) using HALex level self-rated health in both generations. Rank slope
    is the 𝛽𝛽1 coefficient using health ranks in both generations. E(rank|p25) is the expected health rank for a
    child conditional on his/her parent observed at the 25th percentile of parent health, and E(rank|p75) is the
    expected health rank for children whose parent(s) are observed at the 75th percentile of parent health.
    Estimates are weighted, and use the full Add Health sample. Lower and Upper Limits refer to the 95%
    confidence intervals.
