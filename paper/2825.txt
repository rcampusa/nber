                        MONEY STOCK TARGETING, BASE DRIFT AND
            PRICE-LEVEL PREDICTABILITY:  LESSONS FROM THE U.K. EXPERIENCE


                                      ABSTRACT




     It is controversial    whether money stock targeting without base

drift (i.e. following a trend—stationarygrowth path) makes the price

level more predictable in the presence of permanent shocks to money

demand.     Developing a procedure that does not run into the Lucas

critique,    and applying this procedure to the case of the U.K., the paper

finds that the variance of the trend inflation    rate in the U.K. would

have been reduced by more than one half if the Bank of England had not

allowed base drift.

I.     Introduction

       During the 1970's, a number of countries attempted to control

inflation and promote price stability      by targeting monetary aggregates.

In setting monetary    targets, a general practice has been to calculate

next period's target level on the basis of the actual rather than the

(previously-announced)   target level for the current period.      According to

this practice    (hereafter referred to as base drift), when the money stock

diverges    from its target growth path, the divergence does not tend to be

reversed later and thus results in a permanent change in the money stock.

In other words, the money      stock series would contain a unit root under

base drift.

       One popular criticism   of the base drift policy is that it would

introduce   greater uncertainty about the long—run behavior of the money

stock, and thus monetary targeting with base drift would not succeed in

achieving long-run price stability.'       Indeed, if the arguments   of and

shocks to the money demand function are trend stationary (so that the

real   money stock is trend stationary), the price level series has a unit

root if and only if the money stock series has a unit root.        In this


case, the price level is clearly less predictable over long periods under

base drift.

       An interesting issue in this context   is why   a targeting policy whose

major goal is long—run price stability would allow base drift under these

circumstances.    Goodfriend   (1987) has suggested the explanation that base

drift is induced by a tension arising between the price level smoothing
and   interest rate        smoothing objectives    of a central bank.        Although base

drift    makes   the price level less predictable over long periods (by

introducing      a   unit root into the price level series),         it   is allowed
because     it   also    helps reduce the   variability of interest rates.
        An alternative       view   has been suggested   by Walsh   (1986,    1987),    who

has pointed out that if the demand for money is subject to permanent

shifts, the price level would not be trend stationary                even without base

drift.      Indeed, base drift would offset the effect of permanent shocks to

money demand on the price level, and as Walsh              (1986) has shown an optimal

policy would involve some (between zero and full) base drift.                    It is thus

possible that full base drift, as compared to no base drift, would make

the price level more predictable over long periods.                 The goal of price

stability     alone would suffice in this case to explain why central banks

follow the base drift policy.

        The two views on the effect of base drift on the stochastic

behavior of the price level can only be resolved by an examination of the

empirical     evidence.       Such evidence is difficult to obtain because


satisfactory         structural models of price dynamics are lacking, and

therefore,       the econometric estimation of price behavior often relies on

reduced—form         equat.ions. For reasons discussed in the well—known               Lucas


(1976) critique,          reduced—form equations estimated     for a regime of base

drift cannot be used to predict the behavior of the price level under a

counter—factual          regime of no base drift.

        To avoid this problem, the present paper focuses on the influence of

base drift on the behavior of the permanent component of the price level

(the trend price level).             It can be shown that the forecast variance of

the trend price level would dominate the forecast variance of the actual

price level over long time horizons and hence provide useful information

about long—term     uncertainty about the price level.            It is possible,


moreover,     to estimate the hypothetical      behavior of the trend price level

under no base drift       (on the basis   of data available    from a base drift

regime) using a procedure      developed    in this paper.     The procedure

exploits the widely accepted proposition that money is neutral in the

long run.     Empirical   implementation    of our procedure      requires estimation

of the long—run components      of both the price level and money stock.             We

estimate these components      using an approach that has its roots in the

Beveridge and Nelson (1981) method for decomposing univariate series into

permanent and transitory components.2

     Our empirical work focuses on the monetary experience of the United

Kingdom since 1976.       The Bank of England has allowed full base drift in

setting targets for sterling M3, and has implemented its target policy by

using interest rate control.       Although other countries         have also pursued

monetary targeting with base drift, the United Kingdom's              experience    with

this policy represents one of the longest periods of targeting without a

change in the control procedure.          In addition,   the United Kingdom has

been less successful      than most other countries                the U.S., Canada
                                                         [e.g.,

and Germany]    in hitting its targets and has experienced           greater

variability    in its price level than most other countries.            Thus the U.K.

experience with monetary targeting provides a good case study of the

influence   of base drift on price stability.

     Section II of the paper uses a model with flexible              prices and

rational expectations      to provide a simple example of conditions under

which base drift may either increase or decrease the forecast variance of

the price level.     Section III paves the way for our empirical           analysis by
                                            4



introducing a framework      in which each variable is decomposed into

permanent and transitory     components.        Using this framework,   we then

explain our procedure     for estimating     the behavior of the trend price

level in the absence of base drift, making use of the data available from

a targeting   regime in its presence.        Applying this procedure to the case

of the United Kingdom in section IV, we examine whether the trend price

level in the United Kingdom would have been less predictable             if the Bank

of England had not allowed any base drift.           Our results show that the

policy of no base drift would have reduced the forecast variance of the

trend price level by slightly more than one half.            Interestingly,     this

substantial   reduction   in the variance occurs even though the demand for £

M3 in the   United Kingdom has exhibited permanent shifts.           Thus our

evidence is consistent     with the view that base drift increases price

level uncertainty.




II.   Base Drift and Price—Level Variability:          A Simple Model

      To explore the influence     of base drift on     the behavior of the price

level, we begin with a simple stochastic model that assumes flexible

prices and rational expectations.          As is the case in the United Kingdom,

we assume that   the. central   bank uses an interest rate control procedure

to achieve its money      stock targets.     We also assume that information on

the money stock and the price level becomesavilable              (to both the

central bank and the public) after a one-period           lag.   Our set—up is a

modified version of the (1981) model that McCallum used to analyze the

implications of an interest rate policy rule for price level determinacy.

The key differences between our model and McCallum's are that we allow

for the possibility of base drift and include a permanent            shock in the
                                                                5




         demand function.                    In McCallum's          rrodel, the central       bank pursues the
ironey

objective         of interest-rate                smoothing.         Goodfriend    (1981) has suggested

that this objective               induces central banks to incorporate base drift in

setting their targets.                       To keep our theoretical example simple, however,

we assume that the central bank is concerned only with keeping the money

stock on target (our more general empirical model in section                                      III,


however, does allow for other goals such as interest—rate                                      smoothing).

         Our model is described                      by the following equations:

        Equations      (1) and (2) represent the money market.           The demand for

money is assumed to depend on a permanent shock                   as well as a temporary

shock            For simplicity, we assume that the permanent shock is a random
           et.
walk while the temporary shock             is serially uncorrelated.       Equations     (3)

and (4) summarize the goods market.              The variable         in these equations

is the real rate of interest, and like                    is assumed to follow a random

walk.      Following McCallum (1981), we assume that an               island' model

underlies the determination           of         p        in such a model would

represent an average of            local' real rates (that utilize global

information on the nominal interest rate but only local information                      n
prices), we use Etipt+i            rather than             to express the expected value
                                                 Etpt+i
of the next period's price level in (3).                 Note that shocks to the real

interest rate                may be correlated with those to the demand for money
                      (dr)
                      but we cannot be sure about the signs of these correlations
(aand/or         e)
without further specification           of the underlying model.          Finally, (5) and

(6) provide a simple characterization                of money-stock   targeting with

interest rate control.            In these equations,             the target level
                                                      prepresents
of          To simplify the discussion, we assume that the target rate of
     mt.

money growth equals zero.           The setting of the target stock in          (5)   allows

for full base drift when e = 0 and no base drift when a                    1.   As our

concern here is to highlight the difference between two widely—discussed

policy alternatives          of zero or full base drift, we do not attempt to

derive an optimal policy rule.             Assuming that the central bank pursues no

other goal, the interest           rate is set in (6) such that the expected stock

of money equals the target stock.             Note that given the one—period

information lag,
                        m    can diverge from         because of unanticipated changes

in money demand and the price level.

Comparing the behavior of prices in (10) and (11), it is clear that while

the policy of full base drift, as compared to no drift, eliminates the

covariances between a and d, and e and d.                             According to (12) and (13),

the one—period             forecast variances are the same (and equal to                    o)   with or

without base drift.                  However, for longer forecast intervals, the two

regimes imply different variances.                       For k > 2, it follows from (12) and


(13) that

Thus, when k > 2             the difference between the                full—drift    and no—drift

k—period forecast variances increases with variances of shocks e and d

but decreases with that of shock a.                          This difference is also influenced

by the covariances between shocks a and d, and e and                             d, but the direction


of the influence would depend on whether these covariances                                 are positive

or negative.

        As the above simple analysis illustrates, which targeting regime

would lead to a lower variability of the price level is essentially an

empirical question.             In the next    section, we develop a procedure                that can

be used to estimate forecast variances of the trend price level for the

two regimes, using data generated under the base—drift regime.

consider reduced—form equations for these variables of a very general

form that would be consistent with a broad class of models of assets and

goods markets and of monetary policy rules.                       We only require that the

underlying structure obey certain minimal restrictions on the behavior of
the permanent       components         of these variables.         To incorporate these

restrictions    into the analysis,            each variable is decomposed                into a trend

or a permanent component and a cyclical or                    a   transitory         component as

follows:

        We assume that money         is neutral   in the long run in the sense that

the distribution          of permanent components of real variables is independent

of the behavior of the money stock.                In this context,            permanent

                                                     the long run                                     the
components could be viewed as representing values in
                                                                                                or'



"natural" equilibrium.             The concept of the long—run equilibrium, however,

is often not well defined and its meaning differs from

another.       For example, deviations of variables from their long—run values

are explained           in terms of price stickiness       by one approach, and

information         lags by another.       The length of time required to reach the

long—run equilibrium           could thus depend on what type of short—run friction

is assumed.

        To avoid identifying the long run with a specific period of time, it

'is   appealing to        use the concept of the permanent          component        suggested by

               and Nelson (1981).          According    to this concept

        is that the shocks to permanent components                         are white       noise

equal to zero.                 In such special cases, the corresponding            permanent

component(s)           would simply follow a deterministic              trend line over time.

        Having defined our measure of permanent components, we next discuss

two relations             that link the permanent components            of the two    real


variables           in our model, the real            stock of money and the real rate of

interest.            First, we assume a "long—run              demand for money of the form:




                                                                                                (18)




where at is a random variable that represents shifts in the long-run

demand.         Second, we express the permanent component                    of the nominal

interest rate as




        t       t      +
                           E(pt,         —                                                     (19)


where           is the permanent component               of the real   interest rate (i.e., the

natural     rate of interest).                In conformity with (17), we use    as the
                                                                              Et

model in the previous section) we used                             instead.    Note that since

constant.           Although our analysis in this section makes use of only the

long—run        demand for money it is interesting to note that (15) and (18)

imply the following               'short—run         money demand:

as representing permanent shocks and                      e     temporary

demand in (20).

        Now our assumption         that money is neutral in the long run can be

restated as that               does not affect the distributions                       of both            and
                                                                                                 at
An important implication of this assumption that we exploit below is that

the behavior of both                         will be the same under regimes of full and
                                 rand ct
no base drift.          Note that we need not assume superneutrality                             as the

deterministic         trend rates of money growth and inflation                                 and             are


assumed below to be the same in both regimes.5                                The behavior of               would

differ between the two regimes, however, as this series would be a trend

stationary        process under no base drift                 but non—stationary              under base

drift.

        To examine the behavior of                   under different regimes, let the

money stock target be set as follows:

why the money stock would deviate from the target path.                            The deviations

follows a targeting           policy with full base drift.              We could use the data

        To estimate the permanent component of the money stock and the price

level under base drift, we use a measure that is based on a rnultivariate

version of the Beveridge—Nelson                         (1981) methodology.       To explain this

measure, we first note that since                                is covariance   stationary, it will

have the following Wold representation:

       It   is important    to emphasize that while the long—run neutrality of

                                         about how structural        disturbances     affect

       In the above discussed            Beveridge—Nelson       decomposition,     innovations


in both the permanent and transitory components                     are the same.        Other


models of the decomposition              of a variable into permanent and transitory

                                                   to be different and
components allow innovations in the two components

introduce a priori restrictions on correlations                      between the two

innovations.         As Cochrane     (1988) has demonstrated (in terms of a

univariate process), however, the innovation variance of the permanent

               is   the same regardless of what decomposition               is used.       Thus,

            our estimates    of these variances would not change if another model

of   the permanent—transitory            decomposition were chosen.

the two regimes can be calculated using estimates of 0 and of the

covariance matrix of              derived from the base drift regime.              To obtain

these estimates, our strategy is to identify and estimate an appropriate

VAR system for the United Kingdom.                 The VAR system is then used to obtain

estimates      of 0 and the covariance matrix of c.

 IV.   Empirical    Results for the United Kingdom

       Before presenting evidence on the effect of base drift in the United

Kingdom, we briefly describe the targeting policy followed by the Bank of

England.       The Bank began announcing monetary growth targets for dates

from July 1976.       The decision to adopt explicit monetary        targets was

apparently      taken in recognition of the need for monetary control to limit

inflation and sterling depreciation.              The Bank chose to target the broad

aggregate sterling M3        (M3        rather than the narrower Ml aggregate

followed by the U.S. and Canada for several reasons.              First, econometric

studies undertaken      in the early 1970's indicated that the demand for £M3

was more stable than that for Ml.            Second, £M3 corresponds   more closely

to items on the asset side of the consolidated Banking sector balance

sheet which the Bank believes it can directly             influence through its

policy   [
             see Goodhart   (1983)] .    Since   1982, the Bank has also started

declaring targets for other monetary aggregates.              But as the experience

with these other targets        is not very long, this paper      focuses on the

Bank's targeting     of £M3.

       Each year since 1976, the Bank has announced           a target range for the

rate of growth of £M3.         The target range normally applies to a 12—month

period and the rate of growth is calculated using the actual (rather than

the previously—announced)        stock of £M3 in a specific month of the year as

the base.l      This procedure thus allows a base drift to occur every year.

Figure 1 shows the behavior of both the actual and the target levels of

£M3.   The target levels are calculated using the mid—points            of the

announced target ranges for the rates of £M3 growth.             As the figure shows

actual £M3 rose significantly           above the target path during 1980-82.

Given the base drift policy, however, the target levels were adjusted
                                                    17




upwards in this period.              This adjustment made it possible for £M3 to stay

close to the target path from the middle of 1982 to the beginning of

1985.     In Figure 1 we also show the hypothetical target path that would

have obtained if the Bank allowed no base drift and used a rate of money

growth equal to the average of announced rates.                        It is clear    from the

figure    that without        base   drift the target        levels   would have been much

lower since 1980 and would have induced                  a   very   different   monetary   policy
than actually followed.
        To hit     its   monetary    targets,     the Bank uses an interest rate control

procedure.         For several years after the Competition and Credit Control

Act of 1971, the Bank followed a procedure similar to that of the Federal

Reserve before 1979 and the Bank of Canada before 1982, that is, interest

rates were set to make the demand for £M3 equal to what the Bank wished

to supply.         Disillusioned with the margin of error surrounding the money

demand function          in 1972—73, the Bank switched to a policy focused

directly on the asset counterparts                 to £M3.    According    to an accounting

identity based on consolidating                 the balance sheets of the Bank of

England's        banking department        and the commercial         banks, the Bank links

changes in £M3 to asset counterparts                 including as principal          components:

changes in bank lending to the private sector; the Public Sector

Borrowing Requirement           (PSBR) less private lending to the government i.e.

the sale of government securities                 (gilts) to the public.        Based on this

identity and information about the PSBR and forecasts                      of bank lending,

market interest rates (such as the rate on 3-month Treasury bills) are

set to sell the required amounts of gilts necessary                      to hit the £M3

target.8

        We next discuss the data used to estimate an empirical model for the

United Kingdom based on the methodology of section III.                   We considered

both monthly and quarterly       data.   The variable r was measured by the

3—month Treasury bill rate expressed as a fraction,                and m by the

logarithm of £M3.9        Two different price indexes, logarithms             of the

Consumer Price Index (known as the retail price index in the U.K.) and

the GDP deflator    (available only on a quarterly             basis), were used to

measure p on a monthly and quarterly basis.10                A month (as compared to         a



quarter)    appears to be a more appropriate unit of time for the purpose of

representing the Bank of England's policy of interest—rate                  control.

However, since the quarterly data includes a more satisfactory                     price

index, this paper focuses on estimates based on quarterly                  data.    The

results derived from the monthly model are not reported but are similar.

        To facilitate the selection of an appropriate form of the                  VR

system, Table 1 tests       the three series, m, p and r, for stationarity                 and

cointegration    for the period 1977:2 to 1985:4.''              Panel A of this table


presents two types of tests of the unit—root                hypothesis   for a univariate

series:     one based on Dickey and Fuller (1979) and the other on Stock and

Watson (forthcoming).       According to both tests, the results do not reject

the hypothesis that the series in levels of            rn,    p and r all contain a unit

root.     The indication    of a unit root in the      ni    series, moreover,      is fully

consistent    with our interpretation that the Bank's targeting                procedure

involves full base drift.        In the case of first—differenced             series, the

unit—root    hypothesis    is rejected at the conventional          levels for     t,r



according to both tests and for t.m according to the Stock—Watson test.

The case for rejecting the hypothesis           for   p is less     strong.     The


Stock—Watson    statistic    rejects the hypothesis that a unit root is present
                                                19




in   p    only at the 17% level.          The Dickey—Fuller    statistic also does        riot


reject the hypothesis        at the conventional levels but the standard error

of p     (the   coefficient of the lagged dependent          variable) for    p is large
and the power of the test is not high in this case.12                    Thus we do not

consider this evidence to provide strong indication                of non—stationarity

in Ap.

         Panel B of Table   1       provides Stock-Watson    tests of common trends in

m, p and r.        As the results show, the hypothesis that these series have

three distinct unit roots is clearly not rejected against the alterna-

tives of one or two unit roots.              The absence of common trends in       rn,    p and

r is consistent with the view that the demand for money                   is subject     to

permanent       shocks (the shift variable            contains a unit root).'3         In view
                                                 at
of the above evidence,          we assume that m, p and r are first—difference

stationary and are not cointegrated with each other.                  We thus estimate a

VAR system where each of the three variables                is entered    in the first

difference form.

       Before describing our results further, we note that as emphasized

recently by Cochrane        (1988), tests of unit roots have a low power in the

sense that it is difficult             to distinguish a stationary       series from a

stationary series plus          a   small random walk.      It is thus instructive to

examine how big the random walk component is in the series.                   Cochrane

(1988) suggests that the variance of the shock to the random walk

component       relative to the variance of the first difference             of the series

provides a good measure of the size of the random walk component.                        He

uses the variance of the long difference of the series (i.e., the

difference between values over long periods) to estimate the variance of

the shock to the random walk component.               The targeting      regime in the UK
                                         20




is not long enough    to provide a satisfactory estimate of this statistic.


However, as discussed below we do estimate the variance
                                                        of         A(t) from
the VAR model and this variance is large in relation to the variance of

                                                                   the random
p(m).       Thus, at least on the basis of the VAR estimates,

walk components do not appear to be small in these series.

     The VAR model    is estimated   over the period 1976:2 to 1985:4 and

includes four lags for each variable (the first observation         for the


dependent    variable is thus 1977:2).    The estimation   period was not long

enough to explore additional    lags.    We did consider models with two or

three lags but these were rejected against the alternative          of   a   model

with four lags.     We also introduced a time trend in (each equation of)

the system but as this variable was found to be insignificant,               it was


dropped from the model.

     The Thatcher administration which began in 1979 introduced a number

of programs including the Medium Term Financial Strategy, in which an-

nounced money growth targets were to be reduced over        a   sequence of years.

This strategy was intended to give financial markets some indication of

the government's objectives.     One issue is whether the monetary policy


regime actually changed after Thatcher took
                                            office.         Ag4in, we did not

have sufficient    degrees of freedom to examine whether VAR coefficients

were significantly different before and after Thatcher.           As a crude

attempt to explore the influence of Thatcher,      however, we did try a dummy

variable    (equal to one after 1979:2, zero otherwise)     in each equation but

this variable also turned out to be insignificant.

     As the trend price level is a random walk, the one—period               forecast


variance of      is the same as the variance of tp.11      This variance is

estimated from the VAR system as follows:       letting \hsp(O) and Vp(1)

VAR systetn.

        One general problem associated with the use of a VAR model                   is that

impulse response functions generated from VAR residuals do not
                                                               generally
provide meaningful                 information about the effect of structural

disturbances.                  For our present purpose, however, it is easy to show that

the variance           ofp         remains unchanged regardless of whether it is

estimated in terms of VAR residuals or structural disturbances.                      For

instance, let the structural model be



               =   ,       +
                               B(Ly1     +
                                                                                          (29)


where     is a vector of constants, 8(L) is                 a   matrix of polynomials in the

lag operator L, and                   is a vector of structural     disturbances.

Premultiplying             both sides of (29) with     A1,      we obtain the following VAR

form (that we estimate in this section):




                       +
           =
                           F(Ly1 +                                                     (30)
                                                   22



wheree        =   A       F(L) =    A1B(L)   and        =   A.     Given that (30) can be

inverted to obtain the moving average                   process (25), (29) will imply    a



moving average representation           in terms of the structural disturbances as

follows:



                                                                                         (31)
                  +
                      C(L)At.

Using    (31) it is straightforward          to show that the variance of        p    in terms


of structural disturbances              is exactly          the same as that in terms of VAR

residuals             It can similarly be shown that any Choleski

orthogonalization         of shocks to the VAR system would not make any

difference to the variance            ofp.
                                                                   are
        In Table 2 we show certain results from the VAR model that

needed to estimate the variance of             p.           Panel A of this table shows the


correlation/covariance         matrix of the residuals in the three equations.

Panel B displays the accumulated responses                     (over 10, 20, 30 and 40

quarters) of both         m   and   p to a unit shock to each          of the three

                                                                       much beyond
equations.        The accumulated      responses do not tend to change

20 quarters.          We use the sums of responses over 40 quarters to

                                                    that correspond      to the elements of
 approximate the long—run multipliers

      and

        Using the above estimates,           rows 1 and 2 of Table 3 show the

                                                             drift [i.e.,
 variances of the trend inflation rate with and without base

                            calculated according to (27) and (28).             As can be seen
 Va(0)      and   '(1)]
 from the ratio of the two variances in row 3 of this table, the variance

 of         under no base drift is less than one—half of that under base drift.

 Our estimates thus imply that a targeting policy without base drift would

have brought about a large reduction in the                 variability of      the trend

inflation         rate.    To illustrate this result, we construct the series

            and             according to (24) and (26), using estimates of                    and

         available from the VAR model.         These series are exhibited          in   Figure
£
    2t
2.       As the figure clearly demonstrates,the            variability of the trend

inflation         rate would have been much smaller under         a    policy of no base

drift.

          As our empirical work       is concerned     with estimating the effect of

base drift only on the behavior of the permanent component of the price

level, it is interesting to examine how big the permanent                      or the random

walk component is in this series.              As discussed above, Cochrane (1988)

has suggested that one way to answer this question                    is   to compare the

variance of            with that of    p.    The variance of    A      estimated   for the

period 1977:2 to 1988:4 is shown in row 4 of Table 3.                      Comparing this

variance with our estimate of the variance of Ap under base drift, row 5

shows that the latter is about seven times as large as the former.'5                          The

size of the permanent component thus seems to be very prominent in the

case of the UK price level.'6




V.       Conclusions
                                                       —
          Ifthe    real   stock of   nney   includes   a   random walk component, the

price level would not be trend stationary even if targeting                     policy allows

no base drift.            In this case, it is not clear whether the presence of

base drift would make the price level more or less predictable.                         Our

theoretical        analysis suggests that the answer to this question depends on

the relative strength of different             types of shocks.        According to our

analysis      in section II the price level would be more predictable with
                                              24



than without base drift if permanent           shocks to money demand dominate.

The model yields the opposite      result, however,           if shocks to the real rate

of   interest (and/or temporary   shocks      to   money demand) domi nate.

        To   obtain empirical evidence   on    this issue, the paper        develops a

procedure      for estimating the effect of base drift on the forecast

variance of the trend price level or equivalently                the variance of the

trend inflation      rate (which is an indicator of the predictability               of the


actual price level over long periods).             We find that the practice of base

drift    in the   U.K. was responsible for lower predictabilityof the trend

price level.       The case in favor of base drift made by Walsh             (1986) relies

on the argument that money demand is subject to permanent                  shifts.   For

the U.K., the eri'or term in money demand is indeed non—stationary                   but

                                           shifts in the U.K.'s money demand we
despite this evidence of permanent

estimate that a policy of allowing no base drift would have decreased the

                                                                    one
forecast variance of the trend price level in the U.K. by more than

half.

        This paper does not explore the issue of why the Bank of England

permitted      base drift to reduce the predictabilityof the price level over

long periods.       The reason may well lie in Goodfriend's (1987) explanation

that base drift      is induced by the objective            of smoothing   interest rates.

Such a goal may have been followed by the Bank to ensure orderly

financial      markets, to aid the government        in meeting     its fiscal objectives

and to stabilize      the exchange rate.

        The empirical analysis in this paper is based on a general model

that restricts the underlying structure              essentially    in requiring that

money be neutral in the long—run
                                 -—           that    is,    the behavior of permanent


components      of real variables be the same under different monetary
                                        25




regimes.    Although   this paper focuses on the influence of base drift, the

empirical   methodology   can clearly be used to examine the effect of other

types of changes in monetary regimes on the long—run predictability     of

the price level.

     the IS function depends on the real interest rate and output is

     constant.     Such an equation    is also implied     by Barro's (1981, Chapter

     market are a stochastic function of a locally perceived real rate of

     interest.

      for 1979 and February for subsequent years.                   The announced target

      ranges were as follows:

      interest rate (originally the Bank Rate, subsequently the Minimum

      Lending Rate and recently the clearing rate for bills [see Walters

      (1986), p. 115]).

      The series on€M3         is seasonally        adjusted by the Bank.      Quarterly data

      represent       averages of monthly data.

      series on the GDP deflator is seasonally adjusted.

      below, the first observation for the data is 1976:2 which represents

      roughly the starting date for announced targets in the U.K.

      since the standard error of p is high in the case of                    am   as well, the

      one—period    forecast variance in this case.

      Mote that according to (15), the ratio of the variance                     to that

              will lie between zero and one if       the covariance between
      afApt
                  is zero.   This ratio can exceed one if, as in the case of
      andu2t
      our model, the covariance     between         and          is negative,   and two

      times the absolute value of the covariance           is greater   than the

      variance
                  ofAu2t.

      component    in £M3.   Using the estimate of the variance

      from our VAR model, we find that this variance is 1.2 times the

      sample variance of     m.

         p = 1.    According to the distribution tabulated by Fuller (1976),
         the critical value (corresponding to approximately the same
         degrees of freedom as in our test) for -r (p ) is —3.24 at the 10%,
         and —3.60 at the 5% level. q(1,O) is the Stock—Watson Statistic
          (forthcoming) that tests the null hypothesis of one unit root
         against the alternative of no unit root; q(3,2) and q(3,1) are the
         Stock—Watson Statistics testing for 3 unit roots against the
         alternatives of 2 and 1 unit roots. All of these statistics use
         linear detrending and four lags.
