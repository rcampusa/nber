               International Debt Service and Economic Growth:
                            Some Simple Analytics


                                   ABSTRACT


     Any arrangement that is to serve as a long-term framework for

international debt management must permit a politically acceptable rate of

economic growth in the debtor countries while gradually improving the

financial positions of the creditor banks.    In addition, a realistic debt

management strategy must maintain enough new lending to the debtor countries

to provide an incentive for continued compliance with debt service

responsibilities.

     This paper establishes the conditions under which these three goals are

compatible. The analysis indicates that Argentina, Brazil and Mexico are now

all capable of achieving significant rates of economic growth without debt

write-downs or interest rate reductions. They do require additional amounts

of credit but the resulting increases in the absolute size of their debts is

compatible with declining ratios of debt to their own exports and to the total

earnings of the creditor banks. Stated differently, limiting the ratio of

debt service payments to GNP to country-specific standards, whether by

long—term agreements or by annual negotiations, can achieve economic growth

while improving the financial conditions of the creditor banks.

     The management of the international debt problem has now reached a new

phase. The first two years of crisis management that began in August 1982

were followed by two years of country-by-country debt rescheduling. Although

this process has worked better than many expected four years ago, substantial

uncertainty about the future evolution of the debt problem remains.

     It is now clear that the process of bringing the debtor countries back to

the condition in which they have voluntary access to bank borrowing and

private capital markets will be at best slow and difficult. The critical

problem is to move to that goal in a way that avoids either unilateral debt

repudiation by borrowers or unilateral credit interruption by lenders.

     Any such major break from the existing cooperative approach to debt

management could have very serious adverse effects on both the developing and

industrialized nations. The interruption of credit to the developing

countries would mean a sharp decline in trade finance and an economic

downturn. Unilateral debt repudiation could put serious strains on the

banking systems of the industrial creditor countries, particularly the United



*professor of Economics, Harvard University, and President, the National
Bureau of Economic Research. I am grateful for discussion of the
international debt problem with Jeffrey Frankel, Paul Krugman and Jeffrey
Sachs. This paper is part of the NBER Project on International Debt.

States. The political consequences of a collapse of cooperation and the

imposition of punitive sanctions could be as important as the economic ones.

     Maintaining that cooperation can be facilitated by agreement, either

explicit or implicit, on a long-term strategy that recognizes and controls the

burdens on both borrowers and creditors. More specifically, any arrangement

that is to serve as a long-term framework for international debt management

must permit a politically acceptable rate of economic growth in the debtor

countries while gradually improving the financial position of the creditor

banks. In addition, a realistic debt management strategy must maintain enough

new lending to the debtor countries to provide an incentive for continued

compliance with debt service responsibilities.

     The purpose of the present paper is to examine whether the strategy of

limiting annual debt service payments to a fixed fraction of the debtor

country's gross national product (either by long-term agreement or by annual

negotiation) is in principle compatible with these three goals of long-term

debt management. After discussing the analytic links among these goals, the

paper presents some calculations for Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.

     The emphasis in the current analysis is on the long-term compatibility of

the three goals rather than on the current cyclical situation. In an early

and influential study, dine (1983) showed that the likely cyclical upturn in

economic activity in the major industrial countries in 1983-84 would raise the

exports of the LOC debtor countries by enough to reduce their debt to export

ratios at the same time that the debtors were raising their own levels of

domestic output. The cyclical experience since then has generally borne out

Cline's optimistic projections (dine, 1985).
                                      -3—


     It important however to look beyond the short-term cyclical analysis to

see whether conservatively estimated performance of the debtor countries is

consistent with the three goals over the longer term. For example, Cline's

analysis was based on the cyclical relation that an extra one percent of GNP

growth in the OECD countries would raise debtor country exports by

approximately three percent and significantly increase the real prices of

those exports. While this type of relation can hold in a cyclical expansion,

it obviously cannot be sustained in the long term. Similarly, although in the

short run each additional one percent rise in the debtor country's GNP

requires its imports to rise by approximately three percent, the long-term

import elasticity with respect to GNP is approximately one (dine, 1983). The

present paper focuses therefore on the issue of long-term compatibility and is

thus a complement to Cline's short term analysis.

     Before turning to the formal analysis, it is useful to comment further on

the three goals that must be balanced in any feasible plan.


1.   Three Goals of Debt Management

     The burden faced by the debtor countries is not just freeing the domestic

resources to service their international debt obligations but, more

importantly, doing so in a way that converts those resources into foreign

exchange. Although the major debtor countries should eventually be able to

achieve this by expanding their exports, experience has shown that increasing

exports is difficult and suggests the conservative assumption that the

long-term growth of exports will simply maintain the current ratios of exports

to GNP. To the extent that the debtor countries grow more rapidly than the
                                       -4-



 industrial economies, even this "conservative" assumption implies that the

 ratio of imports from the debtor countries to the GNP's of the industrial

countries will rise over time. With a fixed ratio of exports to GNP, changes

 in debt service requirements imply corresponding changes in imports.

     A lower level of imports not only directly reduces domestic consumption

but also decreases the feasible level of real GNP. These adverse effects of

an increase in debt service are not only a potential hardship for the people

of the debtor countries but also limit the politically feasible amount of debt

service in democratic regimes.

     The political problem of maintaining debt service is substantially

exacerbated when a debtor country is no longer receiving any net additional

credit from its bank creditors. In that situation, the debtor country must

achieve a trade surplus large enough to meet all of the accruing nominal

interest obligations. Despite the obvious legal legitimacy of requiring

timely interest payments, this may put an impossible burden on the political

leaders of a country that sees itself called upon to service its debt with no

additional help from the creditors. In the most extreme case, the debtor

country may repudiate its debt obligation unless it receives a net inflow of

resources from the creditor countries, i.e., unless the amount that it is

receiving in the form of commercial loans and other transfers is enough both

to meet its interest obligations and also to finance additional net imports of

goods.

     For the banks, the problem is that the existing high ratios of

international debt to net bank capital and to bank earnings and the

uncertainty about the future ability of the debtor countries to service their
                                       —5-



debts has caused a deterioration of the credit-rating of the major banks

themselves.1 The resulting increase in the cost of funds to the banks (i.e.,

the interest rates that the banks have to pay on their large certificates of

deposit) encourages disintermediation: the most creditworthy domestic nonbank

firms can borrow more cheaply by issuing their own commercial paper than by

borrowing from the banks at the most favorable rates that the banks can afford

to offer. The deteriorating credit quality of the banks' domestic loans

exacerbates the banks' own credit standing and increases the risk of a

cumulative process that could lead to runs on major banks.

     The banks can reduce this risk by increasing their capital base through

equity issues and by increasing the share of earnings that are retained. But

new equity capital is itself expensive2 and the process of distintermediation

may continue unless the banks and their creditors can look forward to a

declining relative size of the international debt and improved prospects of

future debt service.

     In short, the debtor countries are seeking smaller annual debt service

payments in order to permit faster growth and a more favorable annual net

resource flow while the banks want larger annual debt service payments in

order to reduce their relative exposure and convince their creditors that

their loans to the debtor countries can be serviced. Reconciling these

conflicting aims is the essence of the problem of international debt

management. A long—term plan that balances these conflicting aims in a way

that is acceptable to both the borrowers and their creditors would bring

increased opportunities for economic growth in the debtor countries and

greater stability to the financial markets of the industrial countries.
                                     -6-


     A formal version of the plan analyzed in the present paper would limit

each country's future annual debt service payments to an agreed fraction of

that country's gross national product with any excess debt service obligation

added to the principal of the loan.3 Such a GNP-capping arrangement would in

effect formalize the existing ad hoc procedure of rescheduling principal

payments and providing new credit to offset part of the interest obligations.

Whether done by a long-term agreement or by annual negotiations, such a limit

on debt service could, under conditions that are likely to prevail in a large

number of the debtor countries, reconcile the conflicting aims and satisfy the

three key goals of permitting strong GNP growth in the debtor country,

providing sufficient net new lending to debtor countries from creditor banks,

and increasing bank creditworthiness by establishing downward trends for the

ratios of LOC debt to bank assets and earnings and to the exports and GNPs of

the debtor countries.

     Under the conditions specified below, these three aims can be satisfied

without additional net lending from the IMF and World Bank and without the

injection of funds from the governments of the industrialized countries. Nor

is it generally necessary to write off debt, shift to a policy of below-market

interest rates, or do other things that would put U.S. banks in violation of

U.S. regulatory procedures.4 Although the conditions of the debtor countries

and the banks could obviously be ameliorated by increased official lending, by

the repatriation of flight capital, and by increased direct foreign

investment, none of these is in general necessary for combining economic

growth with improved bank conditions. There are, however, circumstances that

could prevail in some countries that would make it impossible to reconcile
                                       —7—



 these three goals without the infusion of official funds or other types of

additional foreign exchange; the analysis indicates the nature of these

conditions.

     Fixing annual debt service costs as a percentage of the debtor country's

GNP has very different incentive effects from the proposals to limit debt

service to a percentage of the country's export earnings.5 Because the

exports of a typical debtor country are only a small fraction of that

country's GNP, a debt service requirement that would be only a small

percentage of the debtor country's GNP would be a large enough percentage of

exports to be a significant disincentive to increased exporting. In Brazil,

for example, debt service payments of 3 percent of GNP would be equal to about

20 percent of exports. While a 3 percent "tax" on increases in GNP would

certainly not discourage the Brazilian government from pursuing higher GNP

levels, a 20 percent "tax" on exports might well be a disincentive to

exporting.

     There are, of course, many important issues in resolving the overall

problems of the debtor countries that will not be dealt with in this paper.

What, for example, is the appropriate role of conditionality in lending and

how is it best administered in the context of a long-term rescheduling plan

like GNP-capping?6 Who will buy the exports of the debtor nations? What

changes in the domestic policies of the debtor nations would encourage exports

and reduce the amount of foreign exchange required at each rate of economic

growth?7 What combination of policies would be most likely to raise the

welfare of the debtor countries?8 Only by ignoring these important general

issues can the paper focus on the basic analytic problem of identifying the
                                               -8-


conditions under which the three key goals of cooperative debt management can

be reconciled.



2.    The Economic Growth Requirement


      Experience shows that the level of GNP in developing countries is limited

by the volume of imports.9 A lower level of imports limits the availability

of needed equipment, parts and raw materials that are not available in the

country and therefore reduces the economy's ability to produce from its

domestically available inputs. Moreover, governments that wish to reduce

imports of consumer goods are often forced to rely on contractionary

macroeconomic policies that reduce overall demand in general.

      Over time a government can in principle reduce its reliance on imports by

the pursuit of policies that stimulate import substitution. However, such

policies generally introduce inefficiences of their own that reduce output and

even the rate of economic growth.1° Moreover, the Latin American debtor

countries generally have relatively low import-GNP ratios already because of a

past pursuit of import substitution policies.11 A conservative assumption is

that these import-GNP ratios cannot be reduced without depressing income and

that future imports must grow at the same rate as GNP.

      More formally, the relation between the level of real GNP (X) and imports

can be approximated as a linear function of the flow of imported materials

      and the net stock of existing imported equipment (SIE)


          X =           +          +
(1)             a0(t)       aiIm       a2SIE
                                                                      —9-



where a0(t) is a function of time that reflects the levels of domestic inputs

and of technology.12 From this it follows that the rate of growth of real GNP

satisfies

            •
            X       (t)
                     0                    mm   I
                                                                 IE
(2)
                     <


But the increase in the stock of imported equipment                                 equals the flow of

equipment imports minus the depreciation of the existing equipment stock:

(3)         SIE =          — ÔSIE.


Substituting (3) into (2) and using (1) to elminate SIE implies:


            •
            X =
                             Im           im             I
                                                             m
                                                                            I
                                                                                E
(4)                   + a11— • -j                  +
                                                       a16-j + a2—
                             m


where    is a constant if a0 grows at a constant rate. The assumption that

material imports grow at the same rate as GNP implies that (4) can be

rewritten as:



                    0+a16-j+a2-j
(5)
                                  I
                      1 -
                                      m


The rate of growth of real GNP depends on the ratios of material imports to

GNP and equipment imports to GNP. To simplify the analysis that follows, I

drop the distinction between the two types of imports and write


                =
(6)                 44).
      The value of imports is linked to the need for additional borrowing by

the current account balance equation:
                                            -10-



(7)           I   +   iD    = E       + 6


imports plus interest on the outstanding international debt (the product of
the interest rate i and the value of the debt (D)) must be financed by the

combination of exports (E) and the increase in the value of the debt (0).

Note that the annual debt service payment (S) is the difference between the

interest obligation (iD) and the net additional credit (Ô) extended to the

debtor nation:


(8)          S = iD         -    6


       If   the politically required rate of GNP growth in the debtor country is

g*, equation (6) implies that a minimum acceptable level of imports, 1*, is

defined implicitly by

                            1*
(9)          g* =


Combining this with the current account balance condition (equation (7)) and

the debt service identity (equation (8)) implies that the growth requirement

that /X > g* is equivalent to

(10)         S        E -       1*.

Thus debt service must be less than the difference between the debtor

country's exports and the level of imports required to achieve the required

rate of growth. Since the ability to service debt while maintaining a desired

rate of economic growth could be enhanced by increasing exports and by

reducing import dependence, the assumption that the ratio of exports to GNP

and the ratio of required imports to GNP both remain constant is a

conservative one. With this assumption, the debt service limit of equation

(10) can usefully be rewritten
                                          —11—


            S     E      1*
(11)


or simply

(12)        S <   s*X.

       Brazil, for example, has recently announced that it is aiming for a 7

percent rate of real GNP growth and that this is consistent with debt service

payments equal to 2.5 percent of GNP. In the current notation, g* = 0.07 and

s' =   0.025.

       The important question that requires analysis is whether the limit on

debt service implied by the politically mandated rate of economic growth is

consistent with the commercial banks' need for declining ratios of LDC debt to

the banks' capital and earnings and to the GNPs and exports of the debtor

countries. Before turning to that analysis, it is useful to consider the

second aim of the debtor countries: to maintain a flow of additional

resources from the creditor countries to the debtors.



3.     The Resource Transfer Constraint


       The resource transfer constraint is more difficult to specify than the

politically required minimial rate of economic growth. Economic growth and

the associated change in the population's standard of living is directly

experienced by the public and can therefore impose a strong constraint on the

actions of an elected government. In contrast, the notion of an additional

and independent constraint on the net transfer of resources from the creditors

is a bargaining issue that the policy officials impose on themselves.

       The mildest form of such a resource transfer constraint is the
                                               —12--



requirement that the creditors not only reschedule any principal payments that

come due but also extend additional credit so that the annual debt service

payments are less than the accrued interest. The implication of this, that

the stock of debt is growing (Ô >        0),   will generally not be an effective

constraint because it is already implied by the limit on annual debt service

that is necessary to achieve the required rate of economic growth.

       More specifically, equations (8) and (10) imply that

(13)        Ô >   1*   +   iD   — E.


The growth of the debt must be at least as large as the current account

deficit at the level of imports required to achieve the politically mandated

level of economic growth. Unless the level of exports of the debtor country

are sufficient to finance both the interest on the existing debt and the

growth-determined level of imports, the growth requirement will imply a

growing level of debt.

       In Brazil, for example, the external debt is currently about 43 percent

of GNP (0 =   0.43X),      the interest rate is approximately 10 percent (i =   0.1)
and the acceptable debt service level is E - 1* = 0.025X.          Together these

imply that D equals 0.018X. The debt must currently grow at a rate that

equals 1.8 percent of GNP. The mild resource transfer constraint that Ô > 0

does not currently imply an additional requirement.13

       It follows directly from the definition of the debt service (S = iD - Ô)

that a resource transfer requirement that the debt be allowed to grow is

equivalent to the constraint that the ratio of debt service to GNP be less

than the product of the interest rate and the debt-GNP ratio. For Brazil,
                                          —13-


this is 0.043 and therefore greater than the maximum debt service ratio of

0.025 implied by the growth requirement.

       An alternative and more stringent definition of the resource transfer

constriant would be a requirement that the real value of the debt increase.

Since the debt is denominated in dollars, this is equivalent to the

requirement that


(14)



where it is the rate of inflation in the United States.14 Whether or not this

is a binding constraint depends on whether the increase of the debt implied by

the growth requirement (shown in equation (13)) is greater than the product of

the U.S. inflation rate and the existing debt, i.e., on whether


(15)        1* + ID —   E > irD.



In the case of Brazil, 1* + iD -   E   = 0.015X.   Since 0 = 0.043X, inequality

(15) fails if it exceeds 0.042. Although inequality (15) is satisfied at the

1986 inflation rate, it might not be if the inflation rate increases in the

future unless the nominal interest rate also rises.

       If inequality (15) is not satisfied, the maximum debt service payment is

determined by the real resource transfer requirement (inequality (14)) rather

than the economic growth constraint (inequality (11)). Combining (14) with

the debt service identity (equation (8)) implies:

(16)         < (i—ir).


The ratio of debt service to GNP must be less than the product of the real

interest rate and the debt-GNP ratio. For Brazil, with 0/X currently 0.43, an
                                       —14-


interest rate of 10 percent and a U.S. inflation rate of 4 percent imply that

the debt service payments must be less than 2.6 percent of GNP.

     The most extreme resource transfer constraint would be the requirement

that the additional lending be sufficient to finance all of the accruing

interest: Ô   > iD.   This implies that the net transfer of resources is from

the creditors to the debtors or, equivalently, S <   0.   This would clearly be

binding in the case of Brazil. More generally, this constraint would be

binding unless the debtor country's exports were not even sufficient to

finance the imports needed for the required rate of growth (E <    1*).
     In short, depending on the way that the required net resource transfer is

defined, the binding constraint on debt service as a share of GNP may be

either the resource transfer requirement or the need to finance the imports

associated with the required rate of economic growth. The key issue is

whether this limit on debt service is compatible with the commercial banks'

need for the debt to decline relative to bank assets and earnings and relative

to debtor country GNP and exports. That is the subject of the next section.



4.   The Bank Exposure Ratios


     The most commonly cited measure of the commercial banks' LDC debt

exposure is the ratio of that debt to the banks' own net capital. The

emphasis on this measure is implicitly based on the assumption that the

financial market's perception of the commercial banks' creditworthiness

depends on the ability of the banks to withstand a default on the principal of

those loans. Such an assumption is likely to be wrong for two reasons.
                                      —15—


     First, the basic aim of the debt management strategy is not the ultimate

repayment of the oustanding principal but rather an evolution to a situation

in which the debtor countries can increase their debt on a voluntary market

basis. Second, as the experience of the past four years shows, the outright

repudiation of principal is a far less likely risk than arrearages on interest

payments and unilaterally imposed limits on annual debt service payments. The

basic risk that the commercial banks face is not the possibility that

principal will not be repaid (since such repayment is not expected) but that

the anticipated interest income stream will not be forthcoming. These

considerations suggest that the relevant measure of the riskiness of the

commercial banks' LDC debt exposure is the ratio of annual interest

obligations to the banks' overall earnings flow.

     The appropriate focus on the annual interest payments rather than on the

principal of the loan also implies that the perceived soundness of the

commercial banks' position depends on the prospects that the debtor countries

will be able to make those interest payments rather than on their ability to

repay ultimately the principal of the loans. The perceived creditworthiness

of the commercial banks therefore depends on the likely trend in the interest

burden of the debtor countries in relation to their overall GNP and exports.

     We can summarize these aims of the commercial banks by asking whether the

limits on debt service implied by the LDC debtors' growth requirement and

resource transfer requirement are consistent with (1) a declining trend in the

ratio of the LDC debt annual interest costs to the earnings of the commercial

banks (iD/A where A is the current annual earnings of the commercial banks)

and (2) a declining trend in the ratio of LDC annual interest costs to the GNP

and exports of the debtor countries (iD/X).

 4.1 Interest Accruals Relative to Bank Earnings

       Consider first the trend in the ratio of the LDC annual interest accruals

 to bank earnings. Although the interest rate on the LDC debt can fluctuate,

 it cannot experience a significant trend over time.    It is sufficient

 therefore for the current analysis to consider the trend in the ratio of the

 LDC debt to commercial bank earnings. Similarly, although there may be annual

fluctuations in bank earnings, the trend rate of growth of those earnings

should equal the rate of growth of nominal GNP in the United States. The

first compatibility question is therefore whether the rate of growth of the

debt implied by the debtors' growth requirement and resource transfer

requirement is less than the growth rate of U.S. nominal GNP.

       If the U.S. nominal GNP growth rate is represented by g + it where g is

the real growth rate in the U.S. and it is again the U.S. rate of inflation,

the growth of the LDC debt is less than the growth of U.S. nominal GNP if

OlD < g + it.   Since the minimum growth requirement implies (according to

equation (13)) that 0 > 1* + iD — E, the two are compatible -if and only if

(17)        (g+Tr)D > iD + 1*      E.



or, equivalently,


(18)       (i—ir—g)D < E —   1*.

The U.S. real interest rate will in general exceed the real U.S. rate of

growth while the debtor country exports will generally exceed the required

imports. Both sides of the inequality are then positive and the compatibility

cannot be established without reference to the actual numerical values for
                                            —17—


particular countries. It is clear from (18), however', that the likelihood of

compatibility is increased by a high value of exports relative to required

imports and by a low initial value of debt.

     Since the U.S. real growth rate has averaged approximately 3 percent in

each of the past three decades, it is reasonable to take g =            0.03.    An

interest rate of i =    0.10   and an associated inflation ra.te of it =        0.04   imply

that the interest rate exceeds the nominal growth rate by 0.03. Since this

difference is relatively high in comparison to most years since 1950, a return

to previous real interest levels would increase the likelihood of satisfying

the compatibility condition of (18).

     As noted above, in Brazil D/X is currently about 0.43 while

(E-I)/X =   0.025.   Combining these figures with I -    it   -
                                                                  g = 0.03 shows that the

compatibility condition of (18) is currently easily satisfied for Brazil.

There is no inconsistency between the increase in debt needed to sustain the

required rate of economic growth and the limit on the rise 'in debt needed to

shrink the ratio of debt to the earnings of the commercial banks. Moreover,

the condition could be expected to hold even more easily in the future if the

real interest rate and the ratio of debt to GNP decline while exports relative

to necessary imports increase.

     Consider next the compatibility of a declining ratio of debt to bank

earnings and the real resource transfer requirements discussed in Section 3

above. A potential conflict arises only when the real resource transfer

constraint implies a greater increase in debt than is implied by the required

rate of economic growth. Thus the requirement for some additional net lending

(6 > 0) is likely to be dominated by the increase in debt needed to support

the required rate of economic growth. But taken by itself the requirement
                                       -18-


that 0 > 0 is obviously compatible with the condition that the debt grow more

slowly than U.S. nominal GNP since the two together are satisfied as long as

U.S. nominal GNP is increasing.

     Consider therefore the more stringent requirement that the real value of

the debt increase: 6/D > it.   This is compatible with the requirement that

debt grow more slowly than U.S. nominal GNP (DID < g + it) as long as the real

growth rate in the U.S. is positive. Again there is no conflict between the

desire for a declining ratio of debt to bank earnings and the resource

transfer constraint.

     In contrast, the extreme resource transfer constraint that would require

the creditors to finance all of each year's annual interest liability would

generally be incompatible with a declining ratio of debt to bank earnings. If

the debtors are precluded in this way from making any resource transfer to the

creditors during an extended period of time,15 the debt must grow at a rate

that is a least equal to the rate of interest (6/0 > i). Since the interest

rate generally exceeds the nominal growth rate, this constraint is

incompatible with a declining ratio of debt to bank earnings. It is possible

but unlikely that this would be reversed by a future decline in real U.S.

short-term interest rates in general and in the risk-induced spread between

the rates on domestic loans and loans to debtor countries. But unless that

happened, a constraint of "no resource transfer" from debtors to creditors

would have to be rejected as incompatible with the requirement of maintaining

bank creditworthiness or would have to be accommodated by reducing the rate at

which interest accrues to something less than the nominal OMP growth rate.16
                                        -19--



4.2 Interest Accruals Relative to Debtor Nation GNP

       The perceived financial soundness of the creditor banks reflects not only

their ability to withstand delays and defaults on anticipated annual interest

payments but also the ability of the debtor nations to continue to make those

annual interest payments. This is only possible for each country if future

annual interest accruals do not grow more rapidly than the debtor country's

ability to meet those obligations. Since the debtor country must finance its

international interest obligations by a trade surplus, the growth of interest

must be less than the growth of net exports. As already noted, the assumption

that future net exports will grow at the same rate as GNP is a conservative

one since exports of the troubled debtor countries are now typically a quite

small share of their GNP that can be raised by shifting from the past policy

of import substitution and domestic protection to a policy that explicitly

seeks increased trade.17

       Defining the ability to finance future interest accruals in this way

implies that the banks' goal is a declining ratio of the debtor country's debt

to its GNP. Since the debt is denominated in dollars, the relevant ratio -is

the real value of the debt (D/p where p is the level of U.S. prices) relative

to the real value of the debtor country's GNP (X). This real debt to GNP

ratio (D/pX) will decline if

                    .
            D       X
(19)        <ir+.
where it   is the U.S. inflation rate and /X is the rate of real GNP growth in
the debtor country. This -is compatible with the growth of debt needed to

finance imports (equation (13) of section 1) if and only if
                                        -20-



(20)           + it D > iD + 1* - E.



       This condition is analogous to the condition for a declining ratio of

debt to bank earnings given in (17). They differ only because condition (20)

incorporates the real GNP growth of the debtor nation where (17) incorporates

the real GNP growth rate of the United States. Since the long-term GNP growth

rates of the debtor countries have been and are likely to remain higher than

the U.S. aggregate GNP growth rate, a declining ratio of debt to bank earnings

is likely to imply a declining ratio of debt to debtor GNP.18

       The compatibility of the resource transfer requirement with a declining

debt to GNP ratio is also analogous to its compatibility to a declining ratio

of debt to bank earnings. Thus a declining ratio of debt to debtor GNP is

compatible with an increasing real value of the debt (DID > it) as long as the

real long—term growth rate of the debtor country1s GNP is positive. Indeed,

even the "no resource transfer" constraint that the growth of the debt must

finance all accruing interest (Ô > ID) is compatible with a declining ratio of

debt to debtor GNP if the real growth rate of the debtor country exceeds the

U.S. real interest rate, a condition that generally does not hold now but that

might hold in the future if U.S. real interest rates decline.



5.     The Situation in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico


       This paper has examined the conditions under which sustained economic

growth in the LDC debtor nations can be compatible with enough debt service to

increase the creditworthiness of the creditor banks. A potential conflict
                                      —21—


arises because economic growth in the debtor countries requires a level of

imports that can in general only be financed by additional overseas borrowing.

That conflict can in principle be resolved by restricting the annual debt

service payments of the debtor nation to an agreed fraction of its GNP with

any additional accrued liability added to the unpaid principal.

     The analysis in the present paper has shown how the ratio of debt-service

to GNP might be set in a way that is compatible with providing enough credit

to finance the required level of economic growth while also reassuring

financial markets by gradually reducing the ratio of the LDC debt to

commercial bank earnings and to the debt service capacity of the debtor

nations. Even an additional political constraint imposed by the debtor

nations on the magnitude of the continuing resource transfer from the

creditors need not be incompatible with gradually shrinking the relative size

of the debt.

     Compatibility is, however, an empirical issue that must be examined on a

country by country basis. The example in the previous three sections showed

that the current conditions in Brazil are such that the banks' need for

declining ratios of debt to earnings and debt to debtor country GNP are

compatible with providing enough credit for Brazil's real GNP to expand at

7 percent and for Brazil's debt to the rest of the world to go on increasing

in real terms.

     Table 1 shows that data required to make similar calculations for

Argentina and Mexico. For comparison, the data for Brazil are also presented.

Column 1 shows the 1984 ratio of international debt to GNP. The analysis

simplifies by combining debt to governments and international agencies with
                                      —22--



commercial debt and by not distinguishing debt denominated in other creditor

country currencies from dollar-denominated debt. Columns 2 and 3 show the

1984 ratios of export earnings to GNP and imports to GNP. These ratios are

all derived from data given in the statistical appendix to the 1986 Annual

Report of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The

fourth column indicates a "required" rate of real economic growth recently

asserted by each debtor country; the sources of these required rates of

return, their relation to recent experience, and their implications for the

investment-GNP ratio are discussed below.


5.1 Brazil

     A comparison of the 1986 Brazilian debt—GNP ratio of 0.43 referred to in

earlier sections with the data for Brazil in Table 1 show that Brazil's debt

to GNP rat-jo has fallen significantly in the past two years (from 0.53 to

0.43). This reflects a combination of factors: economic growth in Brazil, the

magnitude of Brazil's current account surpluses, the changes in the exchange

rate between the dollar and the currencies in which some of Brazil's debt is

denominated, etc.

     Brazil's recently announced growth target of 7 percent represents a

substantial increase over the 4.4 percent annual average experienced between

1973 and 1984 although it is not as high as the 9.8 percent experienced in the

period from 1965 through 1973. The Brazilians estimate that this growth

requires limiting debt service to 2.5 percent of GNP.19 If exports continue at

14 percent of GNP, this debt service level implies a rise in imports from the

8 percent of GNP -in 1984 to 11.5 percent of GNP. Since the real volume of

based on plans announced in 1986.

Brazil's imports in 1984 was 30 percent below the level of a decade earlier,

such an increase in imports -is        not      surprising.

     The calculations in earlier sections of this paper showed that Brazil's

desire to limit debt service to 2.5 percent of GNP is not inconsistent with

the goals of reducing the ratio of Brazil's external debt to bank earnings and

to Brazilian GNP. More specifically, that analysis indicated that the

combination of a debt service of 2.5 percent of GNP and a debt to GNP ratio of

0.43 implies that the debt will grow at 4.2 percent.2° This dominates the

resource tranfer requirement that the real value of the debt must increase,

i.e., that the nominal value of the debt must grow at 4 percent. It is also

clearly compatible with the requirement that the nominal value of the debt

grow more slowly than bank earnings (taken as the nominal rate of growth of

the U.S. economy) and therefore with the requirement that Brazil's ratio of

debt to GNP continue to decline (i.e., that the debt grow more slowly than the

sum of the U.S. inflation rate and the real rate of growth in Brazil).

     It is interesting to ask how high an import—GNP ratio Brazil could have

and still have a rate of debt growth that is consistent with improving the

banks' financial ratios. The key requirement for this is that the rate of

growth of Brazil's debt be less than the long-term rate of growth of U.S. bank

earnings or, equivalently, the rate of nominal GNP growth in the United

States. Taking that growth rate to be 7 percent means that the Brazil's

imports must be consistent with             <   0.07 D. Using the current account
constraint (that Ô = -ID -    E   +   I)   and substituting the relevant ratios for

Brazil (0=0.43 X, i =   0.1   and E = .14 X) implies that the maximum value of I/X

would be 12.8 percent. Stated somewhat differently, the minimum level of debt
                                       -24-


service that would be compatible with improving the bankst financial ratios

would be 1.2 percent of GNP.


5.2 Argentina

The Argentine government announced a GNP growth target of 6 percent in

July 1986,21 but did not indicate an import level or debt service limit that it

believed to be consistent with that rate of growth. Argentina's imports in

1984 were 6 percent of its GNP, a volume that was 10 percent below the level

of a decade earlier. In assessing this, it is noteworthy that Argentina's

real GNP was essentially unchanged over this period, having declined by an

estimated 4 percent.

     Consider then the implications of raising the import-GNP ratio from 0.06

to 0.075 while keeping the export ratio unchanged at 10 percent of GNP. With

a debt to GNP ratio of 0.60 and an interest rate of 10 percent, the current

account constraint implies that 6   = 0.035 X. A comparison of this growth

of the debt with the debt-GNP ratio of 0.60 implies that the annual rate of

growth of the debt wouldbe 5.8 percent, substantially higher than the level

needed to achieve an increase in the real value of the debt and yet below the

7 percent rate of increase needed to improve the banks' financial ratios. In

short, even a substantial one—fourth increase in Argentina's ratio of imports

to GNP (and the associated halving of its trade surplus) would be consistent

with the banks' needs for declining ratios of Argentina's debt to bank

earnings and to Argentina's GNP.

     The maximum level of imports consiStent with keeping Argentina's debt

rate growth to less than 7 percent is 8.2 percent of GNP, substantially below
                                      —25—


Brazil's 12.8 percent because of Argentina's lower export-GNP ratio and

greater debt service requirements. It is Argentina's higher ratio of debt to

GNP that accounts for the higher minimum ratio of debt service to GNP in

Argentina (1.8 percent) than in Brazil (1.2 percent).


5.3 Mexico

     The sharp fall in the price of oil in early 1986 caused a substantial

deterioration in Mexico's level of economic activity and in its ability to

service its international debt. After growing at a rate of five percent from

1973 through 1985, output fell sharply in the first half of 1986. In its 1986

negotiations with the IMF and creditor banks, Mexico insisted on obtaining

enough credit to achieve a 3 percent real growth in 1987.22

     The fall in Mexico's oil exports made it impossible to continue the

combination of debt service and imports at their previous levels. Imports had

grown 37 percent in real terms in the previous decade and were 7 percent of

GNP in 1984. With 1984 merchandise exports twice the level of imports, the

trade surplus contributed 7 percent of GNP to debt service.

     With oil representing about two-thirds of Mexico's exports, a 50 percent

fall in the price of oil would cut those export earnings by approximately

one—third, from 14 percent of GNP to 9.3 percent of GNP. The trade surplus

would fall from 7 percent of GNP to 2.3 percent of GNP. Are these ratios

consistent with improving the banks financial ratios for Mexico?

     The combination of a trade surplus of 2.3 percent of GNP, a debt-GNP

ratio of 0.57 and a 10 percent interest rate imply that the debt would grow at

a 6.0 percent annual rate, far in excess of the amount required to maintain a
                                      -26—


growing real value of Mexico's debt but less than the critical 7 percent rate

of increase needed to shrink the level of Mexico's debt relative to commercial

bank earnings and to Mexico's own GNP and exports.23



6.   Concluding Comment


     This paper has focused on the fundamental question of whether the

increases in foreign debt required to sustain economic growth in the debtor

nations are compatible with the declining ratios of debt to bank earnings and

of debt to the GNPs of the debtor countries that are needed to strengthen the

credit standing of the commercial banks. This question is central to

developing a cooperative management of the international debt problem that

avoids both unilateral debt repudiation by borrowers and unilateral credit

interruption by creditors. The analysis has shown that these goals of growth

and debt service are in principle compatible and that, with existing interest

rates and debt ratios, that compatibility does in fact prevail for Brazil,

Argentina and Mexico.

     There are of course many things that are not discussed in this paper and

that could be done to ameliorate the outlook for the international debt

situation. A variety of changes in domestic policies in the debtor countries

could increase economic growth, expand exports and reduce the need for

additional borrowing. The special roles of the IMF and the World Bank are

also not considered; their lending is simply assumed to expand at the same

rate as the lending of the commercial banks.

     Implicit in the analysis of the present paper is the notion that a
                                      —27—


 tradeoff exists between the rate of economic growth of the debtor country and

 the rate at which the banks' financial ratios improve. This is clearly true

 in the short run since an increased rate of economic growth requires increased

 imports and therefore a more rapid rise in debt. Over the longer-run,

however, this tradeoff is more complex since faster economic growth in the

debtor country reduces the future ratio of debt to GNP and may enhance its

capacity to export. The nature of the long-run tradeoff and the choice among

compatible combinations of debtor country economic growth and the improvement

of the banks' financial ratios deserves further attention.

     The present analysis has also ignored the problem of uncertainty about

future interest rates and international prices. One effect of limiting debt

service to a percentage of GNP is that it automatically and fully adjusts the

amount of credit extended for changes in the rate of interest. Since world

interest rates are outside the control of the debtor countries, there is no

adverse incentive on debtors created by this adjustment. There is, however, a

new source of volatility in the net incomes of the banks that must borrow to

obtain their funds and then cannot recover these additional funds from the

debtor countries. More generally, the ratio of required debt service payments

to GNP could be adjusted for changes in the prices of the imports and exports

of the debtor countries or for changes in the level of activity in the

industrial countries that alter the exports of those debtor countries. Full

adjustment could protect the rates of economic growth in the debtor countries

but at the cost of exposing the banks' financial ratios to unexpected

fluctuations. The appropriate adjustment of the annual debt—service ratios to

these fluctuations in the world economic environment is a subject that
                                      -28-


deserves future analysis.

     There is finally the strategic question of whether a long—term agreement

with automatic but limited capitalization of a portion of interest costs is a

better way to obtain sound economic performance in the debtor countries than

an ongoing process of frequent negotiations in which new credit is provided on

an ad hoc basis. Such negotiations might be guided by the notion of limiting

debt service to a fraction of GNP with special adjustments for changing

conditions. Any attempt to answer this question lies beyond the scope of this

paper. But the analysis developed here of whether growth in debtor countries

is compatible with the improving financial ratios of the lender banks is

equally relevant to formal plans to limit annual debt service and to the

more informal system of frequent negotiations.

Matione (1984), Feldstein (1984), Dornbusch (1985), and Sachs (1985).

8.   Dornbusch (1985) emphasizes the important distinctions between the

cashflow consequences of alternative policies and the impact of those policies

on the welfare of the debtor countries.

9.   The "two gap" model of development (Chenery and Strout, 1966) implies

that GNP can be limited by either the volume of imports or the size of the

domestic capital stock. More generally, a higher level of imports can

contribute to the rate of economic growth even when it is not a binding

constraint; see e.g., Levin and Robert (1983) and Bergsten et al. (1985).

10. On the deficiencies of import substitution policies, see Krueger (1983)

and Sachs (1985).

11. The 1984 import-GNP ratios were only 0.081 in Brazil, 0.066 in Mexico and

0.060 in Argentina (Internatonal Bank for Reconstruction and Development,

1986).

12. The analysis could easily be extended to include the link between GNP and

the flow of imported consumer goods without changing the basic result derived

below.

13. This need not remain true; if D/X declines over time, the resource

transfer constraint may become binding and dominate the limit on the debt

service implied by the economic growth requirement.

14. Some of the debt is in fact denominated in the currencies of other

creditor countries. To the extent that that is true, the relevant constraint

is defined by a weighted average of the creditor country inflation rates.

15. The debtors must of course plan to start paying interest at some point.

A permanent agreement not to require any debt service is equivalent to

forgiving the debt.

16. Senator Bill Bradley proposed in June 1986 that the banks reduce the rate

at which interest accrues by 3 percentage points. This would have the effect

of reducing the rate of interest below the rate of U.S. nominal GNP growth.

If the 3 percent reduction were permanent, it would be equivalent to forgiving

about 30 percent of the outstanding debt.

17. Exports now constitute only 14 percent of GNP in Brazil, 10 percent in

Argentina and 14 percent in Mexico. In contrast, export oriented economies

like Korea have developed export markets for 37 percent of their GNP.

18. An important difference is that the goal of a declining debt to bank

earnings ratio refers to the combined debt of all of the debtor nations while

the goal of a declining debt to GNP ratio refers to each country separately.

It remains true however that faster economic growth in the debtor country than

in the United States implies that import finance needs are compatible with a

declining ratio of debt to debtor country GNP whenever import finance needs

are compatible with a declining ratio of debt to bank earnings.

19. Dawnay (1986) reports the Brazilian government's announcement of these

figures in July 1986.

20. A debt service of 2.5 percent of GNP implies that E -       I   = .025 X and

therefore, given the current account constraint of equation (7), that iD — 6

=   O.025X.   With D/X =   0.43 and an interest rate of 10 percent, 6 = 0.018X.
The rate of growth of the debt is thus the ratio 6 = 0.018X to 0 = 0.43X

or 0.042.
