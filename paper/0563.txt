       Alternative Tests of Rational Expectations Models:
                  The Case of the Term Structure


                              ABSTRACT



     A linearized version of the rational expectations models of the term

structure is put forth in terms of a complete vector of equally spaced

observations along the yield curve. A data series on intermediate maturity

yields which meets the specifications of the model is presented. The

model is tested against a specific and easily interpreted alternative.

Earlier studies of rational expectations models, which used "volatility

tests" or "likelihood ratio tests," are discussed.

 I. Introduction

      The aims of this paper are:

      1. To display a linearized version of rational expectations models of the

 term structure of interest rates in terms of a complete vector of equally spaced

observations along the yield curve. The linearized version is essentially the

 same as that which I derived (Shiller [l979J) for, two observations along the

yield curve: the one—period rate and the perpetuity rate. The more general

vector representation enables a more complete specification of hypotheses.

     2. To present a data set on U.S. government bond yields which accurately

fits the description of the data assumed in the model.

     3. To present an alternative hypothesis in terms of the vector of observations

along the yield curve that represents an easily interpreted alternative to the

model, and to present a posterior odds ratio between the hypotheses.

     4. To comment on a recent study by Sargent [1979] which appears to confirm

the expectations model, in contrast to my conclusion (Shiller [1979j) that long—

term Interest rates appear to be too "volatile" to accord with the model. The

data and sample period used here are closer to that of Sargent and represents

some improvement over Sargent's.    It will be shown that Sargent's procedure

did not test all of the restrictions imposed by the model. Not only did he first

difference the data, but also he omitted restrictions on the stochastic properties of

the differenced daca.   tie threw away the very restrictions used to establish the

volatility restrictions which I used.

 II.    Data   Set                             '

                                                   .,

        The   data set used   here   (Table In below) consists of nine semi—annual
 series of yields on l½2 live year Treasu notes (series designation
 BA and EO), each    series representing yields of bonds with a given time
 to maturity,    from 6 months in multiples of 6 monthá up to 4.5 years. Yields

 are computed ftom midpoints of        bid—asked price spreads for the end of
 March and September as provided on the Rodney White Center Government
 Bonds Tape maintained by the Wharton School. 'i" This       data is ideal in that:
 bonds were issued each April 1 and October 1 from 1951 to 1978,         on the same
'day that the 1½2    coupons were paid on outstanding notes. The notes are not'
callable, may not be redeemed at par in payment qf estate taxes, and the

appregiation in price from original issue discount was, throughout the sample

period, taxed as income.

       The sample was confined to the interval 1955—TI to 1973—I because over this

interval there were always fairly large quantities (ranging from 33 million

dollars to over a billion doliais') of bonds in each of the nine maturity

categories outstanding. We might wish for a series based on uniformly

large quantities, hut no such series which shares the other advantages of this,

series appears to be available in the'United States. liata on bonds with he

full maturity of five years were not used',.because of possible anomalies in

the pricing of new issue bonds (Shiller and Hodigliini
                                                              119791).

       The data series represent a clear improvement oVer the series used by


       'The tape prepared by John Bildersee and described In Blidersee [1975]
has as its primary source Sajomon Brothers quote sheets. The prices are usually
identical to the corresponding figures quoted in the first issue in April and
October of the Commercial and Financial Chronicle, differing sometimes by a few
32nds,of a point. After 1969, when quantities in Come maturities fell below
$100 million, the discrepancies between the two soutces are bigger and more
common, reflecting perhaps the relative 'thinness of the market when smaller
quantities of the bonds.were outstan4ing.'

Sargent which he took from Salomon Brothers' book, An Analytical Record of Yields

and Yield Spreads. The Salomon Brothers data are "yield curve" data based upon

judgmental interpolation of yields on heterogeneous bonds. Sargent used quarterly

data on five year and three month rates from 1953—Il to l971—IV.



III. The Sip Expectations Model of the Term Structure

       The   simple     expectations models of the term structure as we shall define

it   can   be written:



                            (•)   = 1               K      (1)                 *i

        is the one—period rate, and             .   is   the     constant   liquidity premium. —
                                                                                                        2/



R'         (ly)/(l1)              k          is the "ex-post rational i period rate". In the
empirIcal work data will be demeaned                so   that . will        drop out. We thus
disregard    it in what follows. EtR is the mathematical expectation of

conditonai on all information available at time t. The information includes

all current and past interest rates at time t and perhaps other information. The

weight lug   scheme in (1)        is truncated exponential scaled so that the sum of the

coefficients      is one. It was        shown In Shiller [1979 1             that   (1) is a        useful
approximation, based on a linearization argument, to a number of variants                                    of
the expec tat ions model of           the   term structure, where Y =           I / ( I+C)       and C is    the

coupon rate per per i 0(1        on   the bond. in       the I iini t ing case of      a discount bond
as C approaches zero, (1) reduces to a simpJ e average o expected one—period
rates.      In prac t ice, however, a] 1 but the shortest bonds carry coupons.
       The one—period holding return on an i—period bond is                                  =

superscripts          from exponents.

               —               is    the capital gain and C is its coupon. In our data, price,

  coupon and other yields are expressed as fractions of one, rather than in

  percent as is customary. One must multiply C or H by 200 to arrive at the

  annual percent, and P by 100 to arrive at price as quoted. The holding period

  yield can also he written in terms of the yields                                          and R1), since
  price   is       a        function of yield. As described in Shiller [19791,                       if    this
  expression is then linearized around                             (i—i) =   R (i) =

 approximation to               1I: i) =              (J(i)   R1/(1_1.)                where         (i)/(1i)
 Expression             (1) is then the solution to the rational expectations model found

 by setting EH =                               for   all i and t, which implies that R(1) Y.ERI'
 + (l_Y.)RU). To derive (1),                          one proceeds by recursive substitution, first

 replacing                          in this expression yielding an expression in ER22 and
                    (i—2)
 Then one replaces Rt+2   and so on, until one arrives at (1). No terminal

 condition assumptions need he made in arriving at this solution.

 model (1) can also be described as the solution to the rational expectations

 model, obtained by setting the linearized forward rate equal to the expected

 spot rate: F1U =
                                           E(R')         for all i and t, by the same recursive substitution.

quite accur:! to.               The correlation between                   and Fl over our sample period
ranges   from .999767 for i=9 to .999992 for i=2. The correlation between
            and                 exceeds .99999 for al I. Thus the d 1st inction that is
often   made between models equating                  expected        one—period holding yields                  and
models setting forward rates equal to expected spot rates is not important in

practice.

       We   will define a column vector of interest rates with maturities ranging

from 1 to n, R =                               ...    R1' .           In our data, a = 9. The

imposes     on the stochastic           properties of        the Rt vector can then be written as;

 These are straightforward linear restrictions on the autocovariance function

 of Rt. If the generalized likelihood ratio principle is used to devise a

 test of these restrictions given data on the vector R. then with certain

 nonnality and homoscedasticity assumptions the test will amount to a series

 of ordinary least squares regressions of H(1)             —           onto current and lagged
    I =    2,.. .n   and F—tests on their coefficients or their multivariate analogues.

 The reason for such regressions is intuitive. F{1)                        is by our model an "mo—

 vation" which cannot be forecasted based on information at time t.                    Since        —

 R1      is known at time t,    the   residuals are serially uncorrelated,

      In Shiller [l979b] it was shown that the restrictions on the                   autocovariance
 function between the perpetuity yield          R()and R (1)          imply bounds on the

 variance of Ht() —       (1) for given variance of         (1)
                         Rt                                       .   The inequality restrictions
                                                           Rt
 suggested a test of market efficiency which is recommended by its simplicity

and intuitive plausibility. The bound appears to be exceeded, i.e., long—term

 interest rates appear to be too "volatile" to accord with the model. To derive

from (2) an analogous bound on the variance of i)_
                                                                      R'   for given variance of
R' and for small i, we use the fact that H'— RW=

By arguments parallel to those presented in Shilier [l979aJ ,                 it   is easily

established that var(II1)_ R) is maximized if                         is an (i—i.) order moving

point average process R1 =
                                   • Yc.         where r is white noise. As was

established in that paper, if var(H1)_ r) is to be maximized, the elements

in the    summation which comprise it must be perfectly positively correlated.
                                            (1) )
Moreover, if we assume stationarity then var(R                    = .var(E(R+.)
                                                                            (1)        —          (1)

             titus, to maximize var (ii R) one sets up the Lagrangean:

                           L=   (yJ+l0)2 +           A(var(R) -
                                                                       j=Oj             (3)



Differentiating      with respect to o.,   j   =0    ...    and setting to zero one establishes
                                             .-7—




the form of the moving average process. Evaluating the summations one finds

the upper bound to var(H1)_ R1). It follows that:


                                     o(Il) <        a.o(R)                    (4)



where a =        ((l_y2i)/(l_y2)y    and   denotes standard deviation. This inequality

reduces to inequality I—i in Shiller [l979h] as i approaches infinity while

for low i, a.         /T. This inequality is violated by sample standard deviations

for I > 4 but is not violated by j < 3 (Table I).* The violations of the inequality

are most strong for the highest i in our data but still less dramatic than the

violation observed with really long—term interest rate data as reported in

Shil.Ier [19791.      The violation of the inequality for 4.5 year bonds is less

dramatic than that reported by Singleton [1980] for 5 year bonds. He also

used a six—month short rate and a similar sample but with monthly data: 1959—i

to 1971—Vl .       Perhaps his more dramatic results stem from his decision to
subtract linear trends from the data, and in effect assume the trends were

known by the market in advance. Any such assumption has the effect of reducing

the uncertainty about future interest rates and thus reducing the permissible

volatility of long rates according to the expectations model. Ultimately the

inequality tests must hinge on our priors as to the reasonableness of such

assumptions. Although these results suggest that the interest rates R1),

i > 4 are too volatile to accord with the model, we shall not attempt here (as

did LeRoy and Porter [1.980] and Singleton j1980]) to derive a formal test

o the model based on variance statistics but will develop regression tests

as a regression of ((l_y)/(i_11))                                      onto                   By the law of iterated

that the innovation is bivariate normal with a general variance matrix:

  were not generated by this model. This form might be justified on the basis

  of analytical convenience. By representing the model in first difference form,

  Sargent effectively assumed that the variance of I (I) is infinite, and hence

  the inequality (4) is assumed satisfied.

        Sargent did not test all of the restrictions imposed by the model even if

 we assume that               is   unstationary and     must     he d if{erenccd to impose stationarity.

This point was also established in a different way by Melino [1981]. The

restriction that             is uncorrelated with contemporaneous level variables

is the basis for the volatility tests reported in Shiller [1979] and is

the basis for the regression tests below as well.

chosenearlier by Sutch [9681, Shifler 19721 and Modigliani and Shil icr) was as
compi icatcd as it was if one considers that with data only on  and RU
one cannot form the innovation in                     in terms of observed variables. With

data in this paper and the expectations model                      —         is    the innovation

observe this innovation. One can effectively observe •01i(1113)_ R)

 of    (1.)    that H—                 is unforecastable. This fact is related to the fact
 that       changes in long rates show low serial correlation. Secondly, it                          is well
 known that short rates have generally varied over a wider range than have

 long rates. In periods of tight credit short rates tend to be substantially

 higher than long rates. If short rates are stationary stochastic processes,

 then a high           spread     between short and long rates will tend to indicate, since

 a high       spread     tends to indicate a high short rate, that short rates will

 decline as the expectations model suggests. With our data there is indeed a

 negative correlation between R1 —                      R9    and             Thirdly, the yield curve

 is generally a fairly smooth curve, which is consistent with smooth forecasts

 o. the short rate. The smoothness of the yield curve coupled with the positive

 serial correlation of short rates implies, for example, that FI                                    is

positively correlated with                            Fotirthly,    in recent years the entire yield

curve has shifted up. Both longrates and short rates are higher in the l970s

 than they were in the l950s which suggests a positive correlation between holding

yields and short rates or forward rates and spot rates.

        None of the above facts, however, establish that the shape of the yield

curve is a useful indicator of the path of future longer—term interest rates

as predicted by our model.                    The first two facts noted above would remain true
if we shifted the longest rate series                              and 1(n—l) in time relative to the

shortest rate           series          SC)   as   to threw them out     of alignment. The variable
H(u)    —              will   remain   approximately serially unrorrelated since                     is


approximately            serialJy uncorrelated and has a much              larger variance than

(w   I th our    d;i   La o(ll)    = . 0335 whi Ic             =     .0081). A hi gli   spread   between

R1      and    may still tend to indicate that R' will fall since a high spread
still tends to correspond to a high        Our third fact would remain true if
we interpOlated our misaligned long—term rate and one—period rate by any

smooth        yield curve each period, and                         woul,d stil I correlate highLy         with

          Only our fourth fact has               anything to         do at all with the alignment between

long—term and one—period rate series. However, this fact is clearly consistent

with the expectations model only as a characterization of very long—term or

low frequency movements in interest rates.

        All of the above basic facts are consistent with an alternative hypothesis

that denies that the shape of the yield curve carries information about the

future path of interest rates. Before defining it, recall what the null

hypothesis         says about the implications of the shape of the yield curve. If
the yield curve (computed with demeaned                        data so that its average shape is flat)

is   upward sloping between             1 and    i,    i.e.,    if   (R1)_    R) > 0,              then     the expected
linearized one—period holding return EF1(') must he less than the yield to
maturity. Since the one period holding return equals                                 the yield to maturity if
 (i—i)            (i)
R+i    =      Rt        ,   an upward sloping yield curve must then require that the yield

on the                                             (i)
         i—period bond increasing on average when Rt+l                  (1)
                                                       is greater than Rt
                                                                                 .




Specifically, since E(H_ R' = 0, and since R— R is known at time
t, it follows from the              definition        of II'     and the   expectations operator that

a regression of R11 —                       on

longer    term bonds in           Shiller [1979        1) asserts      that   interest rates tend to move
in the direction opposite to that indicated by the shape of the yield curve,
i.e., that the coefficient in either of the above regressions is less than or
equal    to    zero.         The diagrams in figures 1 and 2 s described in the accompanying
captions          illustrate what is meant by the null as contrasted to this alternative.

 The    long       rate        always lies between             and            by the definition of
 the linearized forward rate. The null hypotheses asserts that the distribution

 of R11 lies centered on the forward rate, so that R1) tends to be between

 R1 and                       The alternative hypothesis asserts that the distribution

 of R11 is centered on the same side of R1) as the short rate, i.e., R1)

 does not tend to lie between Rand                               The histograms shown give a

visual impression of the truth of the expectations hypothesis. These diagrams

are not ideal in that small values of the spread between long and short rates

produce outliers in the histogram, and so observations for which the spread was

small were eliminated (about 1/3 of the observations). The figures suggest

why regression tests of the null hypothesis are likely to have little power.

The movements in actual interest rates are very large relative to the movements

predicted,   according to the expectations model, by the shape of the yield curve.
The   figures probably exaggerate the weakness of the test since they do not

single out the occasional observation when the yield spread was large and
therefore          forecasted large movements in interest rates. The figures show

that the validity of the expectations hypothesis may be sensitive to the choice

of central tendency measure used torepresent public expectations.

      This alternative hypothesis represents an alternative so dramatically at
variance          with the expectations model of           the term structure that it could not

be    reconciled with         the model by such other considerations as tax effects or

other    coupon effects (as discussed in Shil.ler and                 Modigliani   []979J).   k-"

Shiller and Modigliani [19791 abstracts from many of these problems. This model
implies that when long rates are high relative to short rates, long rates are
still expected to rise, hut to rise somewhat less than in the simple expectations
mode] due Lu the tax preference shown capital gains.

    then the Neyman—Pearson lemma tells us that the best test is an ordinary
    regresslon t—test of a simple null, versus simple alternative. One regresses

 that the       coefficient   of the spread is 1.00. The alternative hypothesis described

 above      states that the    coefficient is less than or equal to zero, which we collapse

 now to a simple alternative that the coefficient equals zero. Had we chosen

 instead to give the alternative hypothesis a one—sided prior distribution below

 zero      for the coefficient, along lines suggested by Zeilner and Slow             11979],

 then      the effect in our sample would be to increase the posterior odds, so that

 they would favor the null more strongly. One could increase the posterior odds

 ratio arbitrarily by giving more weight in the alternative prior to very

negative values of 3.

          The   regression   tests in   Table   II show some mild support for the expectations

hypothesis hut        the   support is very weak.           The posterior odds ratio, based on
a    prior odds ratio of one, diffuse priors on the intercept and log uniform
priors     on the standard error of the regression ranges from 1.19 to 2.01.
          The results for the 8 different maturities shown in Table Ii are not
independent.        in fact, if we add to the null hypothesis that the forecasts
of           are based on a univariate ARIMA assumption, then the residuals should

            The posterior odds ratio is computed as t((l—/s)/t((—l)/s)                where
t() gives the ordinate of t—distributton with N—K =                   33degrees of freedom,

be perfectly correlated. If we wished to compute posterior odds ratios that

all coefficients are 1 versus the alternative that all are zero we would need

to consider the correlation of residuals across equations.

    A natural assumption to make is the uninformative prior on the (i—l)x(i—l)

covariance matrix of residuals ,               of the form f(l)ElI½ which results
from a Wishar prior on 1 as the degrees of freedom in the prior go to zero.

Zeilner [1971] shows the marginal posterior for our model which, however, does

not reduce to a generalized multivariate student t distribution.



Conclusion and_Summary

        We have seen how the complicated nonlinear restrictions implied by

expectations models on the cross autocovariance functions of interest rates

shownby Sutch Ll968j, Shiller [1972], Modigliani and Shiller [19731 and

Sargent      [1979] are the result of omitted variables in their analysis. With             the
complete     vector of interest rates used here, the restrictions are of the simple

linear variety which can be tested by simple regression tests rather than the

asymptotic          likelihood ratio test of the nonlinear constraints used by

Sargent [1979]. Precisely which regressions to run depends on the alternative

hypothesis     of   interest. An alternative hypothesis was          proposed which represents
the notion that the shape of the yield curve does not give the right signals
as to the likely future path of interest rates. Although the data favored this
alternative hypothesis with the long term (over 20 year) bonds in                 Shilier

L1979   j,   the   data on short to intermediate term bonds used here, Table 11,
favor the expectations       hypothies   is.    The   results thus suggest that   there may he

an element    of truth    to the expectations hypothesis for short or intermediate

term interest rates but posterior odds ratios show that the evidence is very

weak. Before general conclusions are reached about short to intermediate term

interest rates and the rational expectations model, these procedures ought to be

applied to other data sets as well. In view of these results, it is perhaps

not surprising that Sargent's tests, which used similar data and sample period,

accepted the model. His procedure is, however, slightly different from that
used here and was not directed at testing against the alternative hypo-

thesis considered here.
