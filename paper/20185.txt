                                              ABSTRACT

This paper estimates the long-term effects of the global recession of 2008-2009 on output in 23 countries.
I measure these effects by comparing current estimates of potential output from the OECD and IMF
to the path that potential was following in 2007, according to estimates at the time. The losses in potential
output range from almost nothing in Australia and Switzerland to more than 30% in Greece, Hungary,
and Ireland; the average loss, weighted by economy size, is 8.4%. Most countries have experienced
strong hysteresis effects: shortfalls of actual output from pre-recession trends have reduced potential
output almost one-for-one. In the hardest-hit economies, the current growth rate of potential is depressed,
implying that the level of lost potential is growing over time.

I. INTRODUCTION

     According to textbooks in macroeconomics, a fall in aggregate demand causes a recession in

which output drops below potential output--the normal level of production given the economy’s

resources and technology. This effect is temporary, however. A recession is followed by a recovery

period in which output returns to potential, and potential itself is not affected significantly by the

recession.

     This textbook theory is called into question by Cerra and Saxena (2008), Reinhart and Rogoff

(2009), and IMF (2009). These studies examine deep recessions around the world and find highly

persistent effects on output. Haltmaier (2012) and Reifschneider et al (2013) argue that these effects

occur because a recession reduces an economy’s potential output. Potential output falls because a

recession reduces capital accumulation, leaves scars on workers who lose their jobs, and disrupts

the economic activities that produce technological progress. Some economists use the term

“hysteresis” for these long-term effects of recessions (Blanchard and Summers, 1986).

     Experience since the global financial crisis and Great Recession of 2008-2009 has strengthened

the evidence for long-term effects of recessions. Reinhart and Rogoff (2014) point out that output

in many countries is still highly depressed in 2014, with authorities such as the IMF forecasting little

recovery in the next five years. As Summers (2014) puts it: “This financial crisis has confirmed the

doctrine of hysteresis more strongly than anyone might have supposed.”

     This paper uses OECD estimates of potential output in 23 countries to quantify the long-term

damage from the Great Recession. For each country, I take the path that potential output was

following before the financial crisis, according to OECD estimates from December 2007, and


                                                   1
extrapolate this path through 2015. I compare this pre-crisis trend to estimates of potential output

in the most recent vintage of OECD data (May 2014), and interpret the differences as effects of the

recession. To check robustness, I do a similar exercise using IMF estimates of potential output from

October 2007 and from April 2014.

     I find that the loss in potential output from the Great Recession varies greatly across countries,

but is large in most cases. Based on current forecasts for 2015, the loss ranges from almost nothing

in Switzerland and Australia to over 30% of potential output in Greece, Hungary, and Ireland. The

average loss for the 23 countries, weighted by the sizes of their economies, is 8.4%.

     The analysis also yields two related results. First, in most countries the loss of potential output

is almost as large as the shortfall of actual output from its pre-crisis trend. This finding implies that

hysteresis effects have been very strong during the Great Recession.

     Second, in the countries hit hardest by the recession, the growth rate of potential output is

significantly lower today than it was before 2008. This growth slowdown means that the level of

potential output is likely to fall even farther below its pre-crisis trend in the years to come.



II. METHODOLOGY

     I examine 23 OECD countries that meet two criteria: (1) the population exceeds one million

and (2) the OECD published estimates of the country’s potential output in its Economic Outlooks

for both December 2007 and May 2014. The 23 countries include 20 that have belonged to the

OECD since the 1960s or 70s, plus three that joined in the 1990s: the Czech Republic, Hungary, and




                                                   2
Poland.1

     Beffy et al. (2006) describe the OECD’s method for estimating potential output, which is based

on a production function. OECD economists estimate the long-run trends in labor input, the capital

stock, and total factor productivity. The trend in labor input is determined by trends in the labor

force, unemployment, and hours of work. The various trends are plugged into the production

function to determine the path of potential output.

     I take annual series for output, Y, and potential output, Y*, from the OECD Economic Outlook

for May 2014. These series include forecasts of Y and Y* through 2015. To assess the damage from

the Great Recession, I also need estimates of the levels that potential output would have attained if

not for the recession. To produce these estimates, which I denote by Y**, I examine the paths for

potential output that countries were following as of 2007.

     Specifically, the Economic Outlook for December 2007 includes series for potential output

through 2009. I take these pre-crisis data as estimates of Y**, and extend the series beyond 2009

with log-linear extrapolation. Letting y** denote the log of Y**, I compute the average annual

change in y** from 2000 to 2009, and assume the change in y** is constant at that level from 2009

to 2015.2

     Figure 1 illustrates this procedure for the United States. The Figure shows the logs of Y, Y*,




       1
         I exclude one country that meets the two criteria, Norway. The OECD series for Norway’s
potential output is volatile, making it difficult to project the pre-crisis path of potential into the
future. This problem may reflect the large share of oil in Norway’s output.
       2
         The base years for the output series differ across countries, and they differ between the
December 2007 and May 2014 Outlooks. For each country, I make the two vintages of data
consistent by multiplying the December 2007 series for output and potential output by a ratio,
(output in 2000 in the May 2014 data)/(output in 2000 in the December 2007 data).

                                                  3
and Y**, with logs again denoted by lower-case y’s. In the December 2007 data, the change in y**

is almost constant from 2000 to 2009, which implies that the path of y** in the Figure is close to a

straight line. In extrapolating the data, I essentially extend the straight line beyond 2009.

     In 2013, the difference between y** and y* in the United States was 0.048, and the difference

between y* and y was 0.036. The difference between the levels of Y** and Y*--the loss of potential

output relative to its pre-crisis path--was 4.7% of Y**. The difference between Y* and Y--the

current gap between potential and actual output--was 3.4% of Y**. According to current OECD

forecasts, the loss of potential output will grow to 5.3% in 2015 while the output gap will fall to

1.9%. (I compute exact percentage losses because, for some countries considered below, the losses

are large enough to make approximation by log differences inaccurate.)

     As a robustness check, I also estimate losses in potential output with data from the IMF’s

World Economic Outlook, using data from April 2014 on actual and potential output and data from

October 2007 on the pre-crisis path of potential. The series in the 2007 WEO end in 2008, so I

extrapolate y** over 2009-2015 based on its path over 2000-2008. The WEO data are available for

17 of the 23 countries in the OECD sample. For the United States, the loss of potential output is

7.7% in 2015, somewhat higher than the estimate based on OECD data.

     For the United States, several other studies estimate the loss of potential output since the onset

of the financial crisis. Fernald (2012) estimates a loss of potential of 5% in 2011; Reifschneider et

al. estimate 6% in the first quarter of 2013; and CBO (2014) predicts a loss of 7.3% in 2017. My

estimates of lost potential in the U.S. are about the same magnitude as previous estimates.3


       3
         The CBO says it has reduced its forecast of potential output in 2017 based on reassessments
of long-run trends in employment and productivity, and that most of this revision is not a result of
the Great Recession. Ball et al. (2014) dispute the CBO’s interpretation of its forecast revision.

                                                  4
III. RESULTS

     Here I estimate the loss of potential output in each of the 23 countries in my sample. I also

compute the average loss across countries weighted by the sizes of their economies, as measured by

Y** in 2015.4

     For each country, Figure 2 shows the paths of y, y*, and y**. In most cases, as in the United

States, the path of y** is close to a straight line. Table I gives summary statistics, focusing on losses

in 2013 and forecasted losses in 2015. Several points emerge from the results.

Lost Potential

     The damage from the Great Recession varies greatly across countries. For 2015, the losses of

potential output range from approximately zero in Switzerland and less than 2% in Australia to more

than 30% in Greece, Hungary, and Ireland. The U.S. loss of 5.3% is lower than most. Figure 3

captures this cross-country variation in a bar graph.

     For the entire sample, the weighted average of the loss in potential output is 7.2% in 2013 and

rises to 8.4% in 2015. Measured in 2015 U.S. dollars, the 8.4% loss for the 23 countries adds up to

$4.3 trillion.

     The IMF data produce estimated losses that are similar to those from the OECD data. Figure

4 illustrates this point by comparing the 2015 losses of potential based on the two sources, for the

17 countries covered by both. A number of countries fall just above the 45 degree line, indicating

slightly larger losses in the IMF data.




        4
         Each country’s weight is proportional to the product of (2015 nominal GDP in dollars) and
(Y**/Y). Nominal GDP in dollars is taken from the April 2014 WEO, because the OECD does not
report this variable.

                                                   5
Actual vs. Potential Output

     In most countries, the deviations of potential output from its pre-crisis path are smaller than

the deviations of actual output from the same path, but only by modest amounts. We can see this

in Figure 2: for most countries, the line for y* is not far above the line for y. Figure 5 makes this

point by plotting each country’s percentage deviation of Y* from Y** against its deviation of Y

from Y**, both in 2015. In this graph, many countries are close to the 45 degree line.

     According to these results, hysteresis has been remarkably strong during the Great Recession.

In many countries, as the recession has pushed actual output below its pre-crisis trend, the effect on

potential output has been almost one-for-one.

     Averaging across the 23 countries, actual output, Y, is 9.74% below Y** in 2013. This

deviation from the pre-crisis trend is the sum of a 7.18% loss of potential output and a 2.56% gap

between the current levels of potential and actual output (both measured as percentages of Y**). In

2015, the deviation of Y from Y** is 9.87%, split into a 8.38% loss of potential and a 1.49% gap

between potential and actual output.

Prospects for the Future

     In some countries, potential output has fallen significantly below its pre-crisis path, but the

current growth rate of potential is not far from its old normal. In the United States, for example, the

May 2014 OECD Outlook predicts that potential output will grow at an average rate of 2.23% over

2014-2015; this growth rate is only modestly lower than the 2.57% average reported for 2001-2009

in the December 2007 Outlook. This similarity means that the current paths of y* and y** are

roughly parallel, with a stable gap between the two variables.

     In other countries, however, the current growth rates of potential output are much lower than


                                                  6
past rates. In Ireland, the May 2014 Outlook predicts that potential will grow at an average rate of

only 0.9% over 2014-2015, compared to a 5.8% growth rate in the pre-crisis data for 2001-2009. In

Greece, the predicted growth rate is -0.2% for 2014-2015, compared to 4.0% in the pre-crisis data.

In these countries, if potential growth rates remain at current depressed levels, then the losses of

potential output relative to pre-crisis trends will grow rapidly over time.

     As these examples suggest, the countries with the largest current losses of potential output also

have bad prospects going forward. To make this point, Figure 6 plots each country’s percentage loss

of potential output in 2015 against its current growth depression: the growth rate of potential over

2001-2009 in the December 2007 data minus the growth rate over 2014-2015 in the May 2014 data.

The correlation in Figure 6 implies that--absent sharp accelerations in potential growth--the

countries damaged most by the Great Recession will do worse and worse over time relative to other

countries as well as to their own pre-crisis trajectories.

     Averaged across countries, the pre-crisis growth rate of potential over 2001-2009 is 2.4%, and

the predicted growth rate over 2014-15 is 1.7%. The difference between these two rates, 0.7%, is

the average growth depression. If potential output continues to grow at the rates predicted for 2014-

2015, the level of potential in the average country will fall below its pre-crisis path by an additional

0.7 percentage points per year.



IV. DISCUSSION

     The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 triggered national recessions of varying severity. The

hardest-hit economies include those in the periphery of the euro area, which experienced severe

banking and debt crises. At the other extreme, Australia was almost unscathed because of factors


                                                   7
including fiscal stimulus and strong exports to Asia (OECD, 2010).

     This paper finds that the recent recessions have had dire effects on economies’ productive

capacity, as measured by OECD and IMF estimates of potential output. In most countries, the fall

in potential relative to its pre-crisis trend has been almost as large as the fall in actual output.

Consequently, the countries with the deepest recessions have also experienced the greatest long-term

damage.

     If we aggregate the 23 countries in my sample, the loss of potential output relative to its pre-

crisis path is 8.4% in 2015. To appreciate the size of this loss, note that Germany accounts for 8.2%

of the aggregate economy. The total damage from the Great Recession is slightly larger than the loss

if Germany’s entire economy disappeared.

     Through what mechanisms do recessions reduce potential output? This question is addressed

for past financial crises by IMF (2009) and for the recent U.S. experience by Reifschneider et al,

Hall (2014), and Yang (2014). While the results vary, it appears that recessions sharply reduce

capital accumulation; have long-term effects on employment (largely through lower labor force

participation); and may slow the growth of total factor productivity. This last effect is poorly

understood; one possible factor is a decrease in the formation of businesses with new technologies

(Reifschneider et al.; Fort et al., 2013). A better understanding of hysteresis mechanisms is a high

priority for research.

     Another pressing question is whether hysteresis effects are reversible. Some researchers

suggest that these effects are asymmetric; for example, Reifschneider et al. assume that a recession

causes a persistent fall in labor force participation and rise in unemployment, but strong output

growth does not have the opposite effects. If this view is correct, then macroeconomic policymakers


                                                 8
cannot repair the long-term damage from the Great Recession.

     On the other hand, if policymakers can somehow create a strong economic expansion,

hysteresis might work in reverse. Procyclical investment could increase the capital stock; plentiful

job opportunities could increase workers’ attachment to the labor force; and so on. Perhaps a strong

expansion could push potential output back toward its pre-crisis path. Failing that, the expansion

might at least reverse declines in the growth rate of potential, so the damage from the Great

Recession does not continue to grow.
