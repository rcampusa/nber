We study crashes using data from 101 global stock markets from 1692 to 2015. Extremely large,
annual stock market declines are typically followed by positive returns. This is not true for
smaller declines. This pattern does not appear to be driven by institutional frictions, financial
crises, macroeconomic shocks, political conflicts, or survivorship issues.

1. Introduction

Although stock market crashes are few and far between, they seem to constantly concern investors.

Analyzing investor surveys over the period 1989 to 2016, Goetzmann, Kim and Shiller (2017) find

that the average individual investor, responding to a survey, estimated that a catastrophic stock

market crash had a 20% chance of happening within the next six months. Their findings suggest

a high level of fear about the consequences of a market crash. In this paper, we explore whether

such fears are justified.

        We use data from more than 100 global stock markets over three centuries to examine

market dynamics after major crashes. The large collection of markets and broad sweep of time

afforded by the data allow us to identify a larger number of related events than possible when

focusing on a specific market or more limited time period. We define a crash in various ways as

a rapid and unusually large decline in a national stock market index. We identify 1,032 events for

which a market declined by more than 50% over a 12-month period. Conditioning on these events,

and controlling for a range of other factors, we find that markets tend to rebound in the year

following the crash. We refer to this pattern of crash-and-rebound as a “negative bubble.”

Interestingly, the pattern only holds for large crashes – declines of lesser magnitude exhibit

persistence, not reversal.   This non-linearity presents a challenge to standard econometric

forecasting techniques and suggests that something more complex than mean-reversion is at work.

        We consider some proposed macroeconomic, institutional, and sample selection

explanations for this pattern. Macroeconomic explanations include changing volatility, inflation

risk and disaster risk as potential drivers of temporary asset price declines. Institutional

explanations include financial sector fragility and constraints on arbitrage. Selection bias theories

posit that ex-post data collection omits markets that failed to rebound. We find negative bubbles




                                                 1
are not well explained by macroeconomic or institutional factors. Selection bias also does not

seem to drive the results. Alternatively, there are behavioral theories that are consistent with the

findings. They include panics or other temporary shocks to sentiment, and bubbles – temporary,

irrational over-pricing leading to a crash. While promising, they are difficult to test.



2. Background

There is a long literature of forecasting long-horizon stock market returns, much of it modeling a

linear relationship between a set of macroeconomic state variables and future returns. Although

the limitations of this approach have been studied and discussed, the consensus is that some

combination of past returns, financial ratios and discount rate proxies have predictive power. This

large body of work seeks to identify some model or consistent rules that govern market behavior

under a complete range of conditions. Our approach in this paper is different in that we focus

narrowly on extreme events in order to document a comprehensive set of outcomes. We then

explore varying conditions that may have affected outcomes, and compare these to proposed

theories. Documenting historical outcomes may not provide a complete guide to predicting future

consequences of a stock market crash, but it is better than relying on personal experience, or

selective anecdotes about prior crashes. Thus, our modest goal is to report the frequency of market

crashes and the distribution of subsequent returns.

       Our second goal is to evaluate some of the theories proposed to explain the dynamics of

markets following crashes.      Muir (2017) documents a V-shape in asset prices specifically

associated with financial crises over 140 years of history and 14 markets. Notably this pattern is

not associated with more fundamental factors such as consumption shocks or other major

macroeconomic events. Rather, asset price dips may reflect distress caused by over-leveraged




                                                  2
financial institutions (cf. Brunnermeier & Sannikov, 2014). Financial constraints have been shown

to cause fire sales in asset prices, which are then followed by a rebound (cf. Brunnermeier &

Pederson, 2008; Geanakoplos, 2010; Gromb & Vayanos, 2009; and Richardson, Saffi and

Sigurdsson, 2017). Coval and Stafford (2007) document this pattern for stocks held by mutual

funds experiencing large outflows. In short, both asset supply and demand are affected by

institutional distress. On the supply side, banks and arbitrageurs may be forced to de-risk by selling

assets. On the demand side, distressed banks may restrict credit to arbitrageurs in periods when

assets are priced cheap.

           We test these hypotheses in two ways. First, we test whether crashes coincident with

financial crises are more or less likely to rebound.1 We find little evidence that financial crises

matter when we condition upon a major crash of a 50 percent decline or more. Second, we compare

market returns following globally uncorrelated crashes. Assuming that crashes that occur globally

are more likely to be associated with constraints on arbitrage, the financial constraint hypothesis

predicts rebounds are less likely following uncorrelated crashes – i.e. when the average return

across markets in that year is above the sample median. We find evidence for negative bubbles

even during these periods.

           Broadly speaking, macroeconomic explanations attribute asset price dynamics to changes

in expected returns and discount rates driven by fundamental variables. Proposed explanatory

variables are legion but commonly include valuation ratios, discount rate proxies, measures of

economic activity and realized or anticipated rare disasters. Berkman, Jacobsen and Lee (2011)

find a V-shaped pattern in stock returns around political conflicts: a decline in returns during a

crisis and an increase in returns after its resolution. Bialkowski and Ronn (2016) emphasize the

    We rely on the assumption that we have a comprehensive set of financial crises for the countries we study.


                                                            3
existential threat that these crises represented to investors, which might explain the severity of a

crash’s price decline relative to the ex-post level. Barro and Ursúa (2017) show that stock market

crashes, defined by peak to trough magnitude are associated with depressions.

       Our dataset lacks financial ratio information to assess changing expected returns for a large

part of the sample, but we use other variables in our analysis that have been shown to potentially

determine return expectations and discount rates. These include past market returns, volatility,

and fixed effects based upon time and country. For a subset of the sample where more information

is available, we also control for depression periods, changes in GDP, inflation shocks, financial

crises, aggregate debt, and dividend yields. While some of these are significant market predictors,

we find little evidence that they explain the pattern of negative bubbles.

       To test whether our results are due to backfill or survival bias, we use a sample of markets

not subject to these biases. Jorion and Goetzmann (1999) collect a sample of 39 markets using a

“follow-forward” methodology using market indexes maintained in real time by the League of

Nations, the United Nations and the IFC. This sample includes many markets that traded in the

early 20th century and subsequently disappeared until the post-Soviet era.         This sample is

augmented to include pre-revolutionary Russia and China and extended forward without additions

to create a sample that is unlikely to have survival bias and minimal backfill bias. These data give

substantially the same results. Even taking into account markets that crashed and failed, the

negative bubble pattern is significant.

       Finally, one behavioral explanation for the rebound pattern is that the crash was due to

temporary, severe negative sentiment about the stock market. Shiller (2000) notes that feedback

theories may apply to price declines in addition to runups – he refers to the former as a “negative

bubble.” Initial price declines may discourage some investors from investing, causing further




                                                 4
declines.   Temporary bouts of pessimism or exuberance could generally manifest as mean

reversion, but in the extreme might appear as a positive or negative market bubble. Following the

crash of 1987, Seyhun (1990) documents significantly larger buying activities by corporate

insiders than in years prior to the crash, and shows that stocks that were extensively purchased by

insiders were associated with higher returns in the following year. The results are consistent with

investor overreaction during the crash. Moskowitz, Ooi and Pedersen (2012) document positive

price predictability for a large number of asset classes based upon past year excess returns. The

effects are persistent for up to one-year, and reverse over longer horizons. Their findings are

consistent with initial under-reaction and delayed overreaction which in turn are predicted by

theories of sentiment. Evidence in Goetzmann, Kim and Shiller (2017) suggests that market

participants are consistently pessimistic vis-à-vis prospects for a major market crash. Crash fears

implied by equity risk premium models and implied by option prices likewise suggest a consistent

pessimism about an extreme event.

       Our results have implications for investment policy. Investors chase market performance.

A crash in asset prices may stimulate disinvestment from equity markets. Ang, Goyal and Ilmanen

(2014) document pro-cyclical equity allocation by U.S. pension funds; Jones (2016) extends this

analysis to other institutional investor classes. Both find that the 2008 crash and the bursting of

the Dot-com bubble resulted in reduced equity allocation.            Crashes may influence both

expectations and attitudes about future market returns. Goetzmann, Kim and Shiller (2017) find

that an increase in investor crash probabilities is associated with decreases in fund flows to equity

mutual funds. Consequently, it is valuable to demonstrate what history has to tell us about the

actual trajectory of markets following a crash.

3. Data

Our data come from three sources. For much of our analysis we use monthly capital appreciation

real returns for 101 of the world’s stock markets from Global Financial Data [GFD] from 1692 to

2015.2 Dividend yield data is also available, but only for a limited number of markets. GFD has

collected price information from a wide variety of sources documented on their website. The UK

series extends back the farthest; the earliest crash in the data is the 12-month period following the

bursting of the South Sea Bubble. Figure 1 shows the growth in the number of markets through

time.3 There were two growth spurts in the number of markets in the sample: from 1900 to 1934

the number grew from 6 to 32, which was a high-water mark until 1949. Steady growth followed

by the most recent period of market growth was in the period 1988 to 2003 when the count went

from 54 to 94.

          Figure 1 also suggest that survivorship bias might not be a great concern. There are

intervals over which the number of markets declined due to market closures or interruptions in

data reporting. Years in which the aggregate number dropped by more than one market include

1914, 1931, 1939 and 1945. These years are associated with severe geopolitical events. As an

additional check on the results, we construct annual real returns based on a set of stock markets

over the period 1919-1996 collected by Jorion and Goetzmann (1999) [JG], which by construction

is largely survival-bias-free. The benefit of using monthly data is that it provides a much richer

sample of crashes. For example, the crash of 1987 was the most extreme crash in US market

history, but the year 1987 was not itself unusual. However, the analysis of data derived from a

different source is a useful cross-check, and analysis at the annual horizon allows us to dispense

with corrections for overlapping observations.

       Annual macroeconomic data and information about financial crises for a subsample of the

markets in the GFD sample from 1870 to 2008 is obtained from a number of different sources.

Depression dates are obtained from Barro and Ursúa (2017). Real GDP data is obtained from Barro

and Ursúa (2008).4 Data on inflation, credit, and financial crisis dates are obtained from Jordà,

Schularick and Taylor (2017).5 Data on political conflicts are obtained from International Crisis

Behavior Project (Version 11).6 Table 1 displays the descriptions and summary statistics of

variables used in the analysis.



4. Conditional Distributions: Methodology and Results

In this section, we document the performance of country stock indexes following crashes. We

categorize crashes from mild to extreme: from negative returns over a twelve-month period to a

decline of -50 percent or more over a twelve-month period. We then measure market performance

in the 12-month, 24-month and 36-month periods following crashes, classifying these according

to whether returns were positive or negative and whether they are extreme. Classification in this

way allows us to document whether mild or extreme crashes are followed by further declines or a

rebound.

       We begin with an analysis of overlapping annual returns constructed from monthly data.

Table 2 shows the distinct pattern we document in this paper. Each row in the table classifies the

twelve-month return following a crash in the prior twelve months, with row 1 displaying the

summary statistics for the unconditional sample. The definition of a crash varies from a simple

negative return (row 2), to a decline of -50% or more (row 7). Counts of these events are given in

the second column. There were 1,032 crashes of at least -50% in the sample, and these represent

1.8 percent of the total observations. Consider first the columns for a positive vs. negative

subsequent returns conditional on a crash. These are labeled (0%,+∞) and [-100%, 0%). A year

after a negative market move, returns were more often negative. However, as the severity of the

prior year crash increases, the balance shifts dramatically. After a decline of -50% or more, the

probability of a positive year is approximately 60%. Notice also that after large crashes, the

distribution of returns spreads. This is likely due to the fact that more volatile markets are more

likely to experience a large crash in the first place. However, the probability of an extreme positive

event is higher compared to an extreme negative one. For example, the probability of a positive

25% return in the next year is approximately twice that of a negative 25% return. One limitation

of the results in Table 2 is that they do not control for a range of factors potentially relevant to

distribution of future returns.

         To address the need for controls, we specify dummy variable regressions for which the

dependent variable is an indicator for a given level of returns in the 12-month period following a

crash, or between months t+1 to t+12, and the explanatory variables are indicators for varying

degrees of severity of the crash between months t-11 to t.7 We include return volatility over months

t-11 to t, and change in return volatility between months t-11 to t and t-23 to t-12. Also included

are cumulative returns from months t-11 to t; cumulative returns from months t-23 to t-12; and

cumulative returns from months t-35 to t-24. To account for time-invariant country factors and

global macroeconomic events, country and date fixed effects are included where indicated, but not

reported. Finally, given that the return variables are overlapping within the panel, we use Driscoll

  While it is common to specify this as a logistic regressions Hellevik (2009) demonstrates that, in practice the linear
regression is robust and is preferred for questions of causal inference.

and Kraay standard errors (cf. Driscoll & Kraay, 1998), which accounts for potential serial

correlation and cross-sectional dependency in the residuals, for the test statistics.

       Specifically, we estimate the following econometric specification:

                        ,      ∈   J       ∑                  ,   ∈   ,          ∑        ,                    (1)

where the indicator variable           ,       ∈   J   is 1 when the return for the subsequent year is in bin

J (i.e., [-100%,-50%)), and zero otherwise. Indicator variables                   ,   ∈       ,   ) are 1 when the

prior return is lower than the threshold               but at least       .The ranges we use for the indicator

variables based upon the prior return are [-100%,-50%), [-50%,-40%), [-40%,-30%), [-30%,-

20%), [-20%,-10%), and [-10%,0%).              ,   denote control variables and FE represent both country

and date fixed effects. We report the main results with and without the control variables and fixed

effects to assess sensitivity to the specifications, given that the full model includes both the country

fixed effects and the lagged dependent variable.

       Table 3 reports the results of estimating equation (1). Panel A reports the results with no

control variables or fixed effects, while Panel B includes both. In Panel A, consistent with the

results in Table 2, row 1 shows that a negative return (Model (4)) is positively associated with a

prior negative 12-month return, and a positive return (Model (5)) is negatively associated with a

prior year decline. Focusing on the last two rows of Panel A, however, note that there is a strong

positive and significant association between crashes of large magnitude and subsequent returns of

large magnitude. This is the V-shape, rebound or “negative bubble” pattern noted in Table 2.

       In Panel B of Table 3, the addition of control variables and fixed effects appears to clarify

some of the results in Panel A. The rebound pattern remains strongly significant (evident in the

lower right corner of the panel). For smaller crashes, prior returns are negatively associated with

subsequent large positive returns and positively associated with all categories of negative



                                                          9
subsequent returns. For a major crash of at least -50%, the increased probability of a subsequent

rebound of at least +50% is 10.5% using the Panel B estimates (17.8% using the Panel A

estimates). While not reported, the fixed effects and control variables contribute significantly to

the explanatory power of the regressions in Table 3. Importantly, they account for differences in

market volatility, volatility shocks, mean reversion in long-horizon returns, global events and the

country-specific characteristics, such as persistent political institutions and trade relationships.

Qualitatively, the effects are not sensitive to the inclusion of the control variables and fixed

effects.8

         Panel B of Table 3 also shows that modest, prior year declines (0% to -10% and -10% to -

20%) are positively associated with large declines in the following year, and negatively associated

with large subsequent gains. This is consistent with Barro and Ursúa (2017) who focus on market

declines of -25% from peak to trough which may extend over time horizons of multiple years –

market declines may indeed forecast adverse future economic conditions and severe future drops.

         Table 4 reports the results of five model specifications with long-horizon returns as the

dependent variables and crash events. Panel A displays the results with only the prior year returns

dummies, while Panel B reports the results with the control variables and fixed effects from Table

3. For these tests, we estimate the following econometric specification:

                             ,           ∑               ,    ∈    ,         ∑          ,                          (2)

Specifically, we examine future market returns using five different specifications. Annualized

future market returns are reported at the annualized 12-month, 24-month and 36-month horizons

(models 1,2 and 3), as well as with successive 12-month intervals broken out (models 4 and 5).



8
  We also consider whether the inclusion of the United States and United Kingdom in the sample has any influence
on the results. In untabulated results, we find that the effects are not sensitive to dropping these countries from the
sample.


                                                             10
The prior year return indicator variables,       ,   ∈   ,     , are constructed in the same way as

equation (1).

       In Panels A and B, Model (1) shows that a negative return in the prior year of up to -10%

is associated with a -5.6% to -6.2% lower return than for periods when the market had a positive

return in the prior year. A negative return of -50% or more in the prior year is associated with a

14.0% to 18.4% higher return. Moreover, the effects of the large drop appear to reverse again in

the year after, as shown in Model (2). One interpretation of these returns dynamics is cyclical

behavior – for example, persistence at short horizons and reversal at longer horizons. However,

the inclusion of three prior years of returns should control for such a regularity. The crash events

may be concentrated in particular time periods or countries, generating cross-sectional and

temporal dependencies, thus potentially biasing the model estimates.           The standard error

corrections and the inclusion of the country and date fixed effects address those issues.




                                                11
       Thus far, the results consistently demonstrate two patterns. First, markets experiencing a

large crash of -50% or more have a high probability of a rebound, and the average return following

such a crash is nearly 14% higher than returns with a positive return in the prior year. Second,

market declines of up to -40% are more likely to be followed by another decline, and the magnitude

of this decline is approximately 6% to 9% in the following 12 months. In short, above and beyond

mean reversion patterns in stock returns, a small decline in a market leads to a much larger drop,

and a large drop precedes a large rebound.



5. Potential Explanations

5.1. Institutional explanations

       In this section, we evaluate hypotheses that may explain the results in the previous section.

Under specific assumptions, institutional explanations would predict differences in market

rebounds, depending on whether a crash is widespread across markets as opposed to a solitary

event. A crash that coincides with a world-wide decline in stock markets is more likely to be

associated with distress to financial institutions and arbitrageurs because collateral values broadly

decline. This would imply that the rebound should be greater when a crash coincides with an

average, global market decline.

       More generally, a crash coinciding with a global market decline is more likely to be

associated with exposure to a systematic, priced risk factor. Such a factor could be based on

institutional fragility. Under the assumption that all markets have at least some positive exposure

to a global market factor we would expect that a risk-premium based explanation for the

documented market dynamics would predict the effects to be stronger when we condition on the

factor realization or anticipation of an adverse realization. This is particularly relevant to the




                                                 12
Berkman et al. (2011) time-varying disaster risk hypothesis. They find that a global index of

disaster risk is a cross-sectional and time series predictor of global market returns. This implies

that conditioning on a global market decline should predict a larger rebound in the period following

a crash.

       To test this, we estimate equation (2) for two subsets: crashes that occurred when global

market returns are low versus high. Specifically, we calculate the average returns for all countries

in the months t-11 to t, and separate the sample depending on whether the average return of all

other countries is below (Low) or above (High) the sample median. The results are reported in

Table 5. Models (1) and (4) show the results for the 12 months following a crash when the average

global return is coded as Low and High, respectively. The coefficient on the -50% crash in Model

(1) is positive and significant at the 10% level, and is comparable to estimates in Table 4. The

results are similar for Model (4), or when average global returns are coded as High. It is also

positive and significant (at the 10% level) and larger in magnitude than the coefficient in Model

(1). However, the difference between them are not statistically significant. Thus, the results are

not consistent with the prediction implied by the institutional explanations.

       In short, conditioning on a widespread decline does not strengthen the rebound effect, and

so does not appear to explain the main results. One caveat is that our tests rely on strong

assumptions, chief of which is an integrated global capital market – an assumption which is

probably only true for some time periods and some countries. Moreover, the results do not support

theories that posit a common risk factor as a driver of the documented regularities, although it does

not rule them out.



5.2. Macroeconomic explanations




                                                 13
         As noted above, macroeconomic explanations attribute asset price dynamics to changes in

expected returns and discount rates driven by fundamental variables such as conditions affecting

profits, risk and risk premia. Our sample of 101 markets lacks comprehensive macroeconomic

data and valuation ratios. In order to consider macroeconomic variables and other factors, we

restrict our attention to a subset of markets for which we have these variables. We use a dummy

associated with depressions, the one-year changes in real GDP, the one-year changes in a consumer

price index, a dummy associated with financial crises, the one-year change in loans to non-

financial private sector-to-GDP ratio, and the dividend yield for 14 markets.9 We obtain the data

from Barro and Ursúa (2008), Barro and Ursúa (2017), and Jordà, Schularick and Taylor (2017),

and the sample years of the merged data is from 1870 to 2008. This subsample differs markedly

from the larger GFD database in focusing on major markets.

         Table 6 reports the results of models estimated on the sample subset for which the

macroeconomic variables are available. Models (1), (2), and (3) exclude the macroeconomic

variables while Models (4), (5) and (6) include them. Note that the influence of a prior year crash

is significantly different on this subsample of 14 markets, regardless of whether the additional

control variables are included. The negative association between a modest crash and subsequent

returns is somewhat smaller in absolute magnitude, suggesting that these effects are stronger in

smaller markets – despite our country fixed effect controls. The rebound effect for large crashes

is highly significant in this subsample, however. As before, the results reverse over the subsequent

year for the available sample.

         The effects are similar for the subsample without (Model (1)) and with (Model (4)) the

macroeconomic controls. The macroeconomic controls are significant determinants of market


9
  In untabulated results, we find that the effects are not sensitive to the inclusion of short-term and long-term interest
rates.

returns in the following year. Depressions, inflation, and financial crises are associated with lower

subsequent returns. Changes in the GDP are statistically insignificant in Model (4), though

become significant in Models (5) and (6), possibly due to collinearity with the depression dummy.

Changes in the loan-to-GDP ratio and the dividend yield is associated with higher subsequent

returns. If the market rebound pattern is explained by macroeconomic conditions, we expect the

coefficient on a large crash to be attenuated with the introduction on these additional factors. The

table shows that it is not.



5.3. Political conflicts

        Political conflicts may coincide with significant macroeconomic events and stock market

downturns. Notably, Berkman, Jacobsen and Lee (2011) document that market returns are

generally negative at the start and during political conflicts. In years in which political conflicts

end, market returns are generally positive, though not statistically significantly so. It is possible

that the stock market crashes used in our tests may be associated with political conflicts, and that

the reversal in the following year may be driven by the conclusion of these conflicts. This may

explain why the tests in Table 6 show stronger results, given that these countries are more likely

to have witnessed resolution in their conflicts, while the countries not included may have been less

likely, for a given sample period.

        To assess whether political conflicts are driving the results, data from the Internal Crisis

Behavior project [ICB] is used to construct dummies corresponding with the start, middle and end

of political conflicts for the sample countries. The database includes information on more than

400 international political conflicts. Given that the database only covers conflicts from 1918 to

2013, the sample is restricted to this time period.




                                                 15
       Table 7 shows the results. Models (1), (2) and (3) include the conflict dummies. Models

(4), (5), and (6) also include the macroeconomic variables from Table 6 for the subsample where

they are available. The results for the -50% crash events are quite similar to the other tables,

regardless of whether the macroeconomic variables are included. The coefficients on the middle-

of-the-conflict dummies are generally negative and statistically significant for some of the

specifications. This is consistent with the results in Berkman et al. (2011). However, the

coefficients on the start- and end-of-the-conflict dummies are generally positive, but statistically

significant only for the start-of-the-conflict dummies.



5.4. Survival bias

       As discussed above, evidence of a sharp rebound after a major crash in asset prices raises

the natural question of whether the data series is conditioned on survival. This may occur because

of backfill bias which conditions on current existence, “look-back” bias which conditions on

survival, or survival bias that conditions on existence of a succeeding period of observation. One

approach to the backfill problem is to identify markets known at the time to exist and to follow

them forward.

       The JG series that extend from 1920 to 1996 are not retrospectively constructed. They are

hand-collected from League of Nations, United Nations bulletins and International Financial

Corporation [IFC] publications. This process minimizes potential survival bias because it is

possible to “follow-forward” series that were identified as existing national stock markets at the

time. We augment the JG data with annual real returns over the period 1900 to 1919 using data

for total real returns from Dimson, Marsh and Staunton [DMS] (cf. Dimson, Marsh & Staunton,

2017). We extend the series from 1997 with DMS and annual real capital appreciation returns




                                                16
from MSCI series’ in dollar-denominated terms via the Morningstar Direct product. Finally we

add Saint-Petersburg Stock Exchange returns over the period 1900 to 1914 and Shanghai Stock

Exchange returns over the period 1900 to 1940.10

         The returns distribution for the data are similar to that described in Table 1 (untabulated).

Following years with negative returns -50% or more, the likelihood that the market return will be

positive is 71.64%, which is larger than similar calculations for the GFD sample. In comparison,

the likelihood that the market return will be positive is 58.65% following years with negative

returns.

         Table 8 reports the results of estimating our main set of regressions from Table 3 on the

smaller, annual dataset. Models (1) through (3) display the results with only the crash dummy

terms. Models (4) through (6) display the results including controls for past returns on the past

annual returns for years t, t-1 and t-2, as well as fixed effects on the country and year levels.11 They

also include the macroeconomic control variables from Table 6. As before, inclusion of the

macroeconomic control variables attenuates the sample significantly. The results are not sensitive

to including only the past returns variables and the fixed effects for which sample attenuation is

less pronounced.

         The results show that the reversal effect after a major crash of -50% or more is highly

significant, similar to the results in Table 4. The magnitudes are relatively larger, and are

significant for two years following the crash. When including the controls and fixed effects, the

results are stronger despite of the smaller sample size. These findings suggest that the results are

unlikely to be driven by potential survivorship biases.

  Returns volatility for a specific year cannot be calculated using the annual data, which is why only past returns and
the fixed effects are included as controls.

6. Conclusion

       In this paper, we document the performance of global stock markets after crashes of various

magnitudes. Of particular interest is whether a rebound after a large crash – a “negative bubble”

is likely. Using a large sample of 101 global stock market indexes extending over four centuries

and encompassing most of the world’s identified stock markets, we find several things. First,

crashes of great magnitude are rare. Despite their rarity, they are potentially interesting. A decline

in asset values by one-half is frightening to investors, disruptive to the financial system and may

indicate a major change in market expectations about future returns and risks. It may even

represent an existential risk to the market. Investors are rightly concerned with major crashes,

although they typically overestimate the probability of one (cf. Goetzmann, Kim & Shiller, 2017).

       We find an interesting – perhaps comforting – regularity. The probability of a large

positive return is higher following a decline in the market of at least -50%. Returns following a

severe crash are on average more than 10% higher than those following a market gain. We also

find some evidence in our broad sample that more modest crashes exhibit the opposite dynamic.

Declines on the order of -10% to -20% are more likely to be followed by another decline. This

pattern is not consistent in the data and is not present in a subsample of 41 major markets that does

not include many of the markets that appeared since the mid-1990’s.

       Explaining these dynamics is challenging. We perform a number of tests to differentiate

among some prevailing, persuasive theories. We find little support for explanations involving a

global factor premium. Estimation confined to crashes correlated to the global market return

attenuates rather than strengthens the rebound effect.        We likewise find little support for

macroeconomic explanations, although we are limited by sample and availability. The pattern of




                                                 18
negative bubbles may simply be an artifact of sample selection bias. A test on a relatively bias-

free subsample suggests it is not. Finally, our findings are also consistent with behavioral theories.

Investor pessimism or exuberance could generally manifest as mean reversion, but in the extreme

might appear as a positive or negative bubble (cf. Shiller, 2000). Our paper does not directly assess

this explanation, though is a promising avenue of future research.

Table 2: Conditional Returns Distributions Based Upon Past Extreme Returns

This table presents the percentage of observations where the cumulative, 1-year return from months t+1 to t+12 is
within ranges indicated in the first row. The rows indicate subsamples based upon whether the cumulative return from
months t-11 to t is up to threshold x, where x ∈ {0%, -10%, -20%, -30%, -40%, -50%}.

Table 3: Conditional Returns Distribution Regressions

This table presents estimates of Equation (1). The dependent variables are dummies based upon whether the cumulative, 1-year return from months t+1 to t+12 is
above or below the thresholds specified in the first row. I(t1 > Rt-11,t ≥ t2) is a dummy variable based upon whether the cumulative return from month t-11 to t is
below t1 but at least t2. Panel A (Panel B) reports the results without (with) the control variables and fixed effects terms. Control variables included where indicated,
but not reported, are returns volatility over months t-11 to t; change in returns volatility between months t-11 to t and t-23 to t-12; cumulative returns from months
t-11 to t; cumulative returns from t-23 to t-12; and cumulative returns from t-35 to t-24. Country and date fixed effects are included where indicated, but not
reported. Robust standard errors based upon Driscoll and Kraay (1998) estimators are used to calculate t-statistics (in parentheses). Statistical significance at the
10%, 5% and 1% levels are denoted by *, **, and ***, respectively.

Table 5: Global Market Conditions

This table presents estimates of Equation (2) on subsamples based upon global market conditions. The dependent
variables are cumulative return over the interval indicated in the first row. The tests are performed over the subsamples
where the average returns from month t-11 to t across all countries is either below (Low) or above (High) the sample
median. I(t1 > Rt-11,t ≥ t2) is a dummy variable based upon whether the cumulative return from month t-11 to t is below
t1 but at least t2. Panel A (Panel B) reports the results without (with) the control variables and fixed effects terms.
Control variables from Table 3 are included where indicated, but not reported. Country and date fixed effects are
included where indicated, but not reported. Robust standard errors based upon Driscoll and Kraay (1998) estimators
are used to calculate t-statistics (in parentheses). Statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels are denoted by
*, **, and ***, respectively.

Table 6: Macroeconomic Conditions

This table presents estimates of Equation (2) with the addition of macroeconomic control variables, using a subsample
of markets based upon the availability of the macroeconomic data. Macroeconomic control variables include a
depression dummy, the one-year change in real GDP, the one-year change in CPI, a financial crisis dummy, the one-
year change in loan-to-GDP ratio, and the dividend-to-price ratio. Control variables from Table 3 are included where
indicated, but not reported. Country and date fixed effects are included where indicated, but not reported. Robust
standard errors based upon Driscoll and Kraay (1998) estimators are used to calculate t-statistics (in parentheses).
Statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels are denoted by *, **, and ***, respectively.

Table 7: Political Conflicts

This table presents estimates of Equation (2) with the addition of political conflict indicators from the International
Crisis Behavior (ICB) Project, using a subsample of markets based upon the availability of the ICB data. Start of
Conflict, Middle of Conflict, and End of Conflict are dummies based upon whether month t is at the start, in the
middle, or at the end of the conflict, respectively. Macroeconomic control variables include a depression dummy, the
one-year change in real GDP, the one-year change in CPI, a financial crisis dummy, the one-year change in loan-to-
GDP ratio, and the dividend-to-price ratio. Control variables from Table 3 are included where indicated, but not
reported. Country and date fixed effects are included where indicated, but not reported. Robust standard errors based
upon Driscoll and Kraay (1998) estimators are used to calculate t-statistics (in parentheses). Statistical significance at
the 10%, 5% and 1% levels are denoted by *, **, and ***, respectively.

Table 8: Returns in Years Following Crash Events Using JG and DMS Sample

This table presents estimates of regression models using the JG and DMS sample. The dependent variables are annual
returns over the interval indicated in the first row. I(t1 > Rt-11,t ≥ t2) is a dummy variable based upon whether the
cumulative return from month t-11 to t is below t1 but at least t2. Panel A (Panel B) reports the results without (with)
the control variables and fixed effects terms. Fixed effects on the country and year levels are included where indicated,
but are not reported. The control variables include annual returns from year t, t-1 and t-2. Macroeconomic control
variables include a depression dummy, the one-year change in real GDP, the one-year change in CPI, a financial crisis
dummy, the one-year change in loan-to-GDP ratio, and the dividend-to-price ratio. Robust standard errors based upon
Driscoll and Kraay (1998) estimators are used to calculate t-statistics (in parentheses). Statistical significance at the
10%, 5% and 1% levels are denoted by *, **, and ***, respectively.
