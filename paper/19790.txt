                                                ABSTRACT

A growing theoretical literature argues that aggregate price flexibility and the inflation-output tradeoff
faced by central banks should rise with microeconomic price change dispersion. However, there is
little empirical work testing this prediction. I fill this gap by estimating time-varying forward looking
New-Keynesian Phillips Curves (NKPC). I reject a NKPC with constant inflation-output tradeoff in
favor of a slope that increases with microeconomic volatility. In contrast, there is no evidence that
the inflation-output tradeoff varies with aggregate volatility or the business cycle more generally. Furthermore,
I show that greater volatility does not affect price flexibility purely through increases in frequency.

1       Introduction

    A growing empirical literature documents that the dispersion of microeconomic
price changes as well as other firm level variables varies dramatically across time.
Does this variation in microeconomic price dispersion have implications for aggregate
price flexibility? A growing theoretical literature answers this question aﬃrmatively.
A wide variety of price-setting models imply that increases in microeconomic price
churning should be associated with increases in aggregate price flexibility. This in
turn typically implies that the trade-oﬀ between inflation and output facing central
banks worsens: in order to generate the same increase in real output, the central bank
must be willing to tolerate higher inflation.
    Despite this growing theoretical literature, there is little empirical work testing
this key implication. In this paper I provide evidence in support of the theoreti-
cal relationship between increases in microeconomic volatility and worsening of the
inflation-output tradeoﬀ. It is well-known that a wide variety of price-setting models
lead to New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) of the form:

                                      =  +  { +1 } 

    The slope  of this NKPC directly captures the relationship between real economic
activity and inflation. Greater  implies that a given increase in real activity should
be associated with a greater increase in inflation. In a classic paper, Gali and Gertler
(1999) provide an empirical methodology for directly estimating this slope.
    In this paper, I extend their analysis by exploring whether this slope varies across
time.1 In particular, I estimate a regime-specific NKPC with regimes defined in
various diﬀerent ways. I find that, as predicted by economic theory, I can reject
a constant  in favor of a slope that varies with volatility. However, I show that
this is not true for all types of volatility. In particular, I find a strong empirical
    1
     Stock and Watson (2010) present some evidence in favor of a non-linear relationship between
inflation and unemployment. While they do not estimate NKPC and do not look at the relationship
with volatility, their results are broadly consistent with mine. However I find that volatility is more
important for the slope of the NKPC than the business cycle.



                                                  2
relationship between  and various forms of idiosyncratic volatility, yet I find no
relationship between  and aggregate volatility. In addition, I find no significant
relationship between  and the business cycle. Thus, it appears that microeconomic
price-churning appears to be of particular significance for aggregate price flexibility.
    This is interesting because it is exactly what is predicted by various theoretical
papers. The first paper to theoretically link time-varying microeconomic price change
dispersion to time-varying aggregate price flexibility is Vavra (2013). He documents
a positive relationship between the interquartile range of price changes and the fre-
quency of adjustment, and argues that idiosyncratic volatility shocks can match this
relationship in an otherwise standard menu cost model. More importantly, he shows
that increases in idiosyncratic volatility lead to increases in aggregate price flexibil-
ity. This is partially driven by an increase in the frequency of adjustment, but is
mostly driven by a change in the particular firms that choose to adjust. Firms with
the largest price changes contribute disproportionately to aggregate inflation and
increases in idiosyncratic volatility increase the mass of such firms. Vavra (2013)
shows that this "extensive margin" eﬀect accounts for the bulk of the increase in
aggregate price flexibility that arises with increases in idiosyncratic volatility. In
contrast, increases in the volatility of aggregate shocks are not consistent with micro-
economic evidence and have little eﬀect on aggregate price flexibility. In addition, the
time-varying inflation-output trade-oﬀ in his model is driven by variation in volatility
rather than by the business cycle per se. After controlling for the level of idiosyn-
cratic volatility, his model delivers essentially no relationship between business cycles
and price flexibility.
    While Vavra (2013) is the first theoretical paper to link microeconomic price dis-
persion with macroeconomic price flexibility, a number of recent papers have reached
similar conclusions. In Baley and Blanco (2013), an information friction prevents
firms from fully knowing their nominal costs. When firms are very uncertain, they
adjust prices strongly in response to new information. In contrast, when firms are
more certain of their nominal costs, they are less likely to respond to (noisy) new
information. This mechanism generates a positive relationship between the response
of prices to shocks and uncertainty. During times of high uncertainty, aggregate price
flexibility rises and monetary shocks have smaller real eﬀects.
    Berger and Vavra (2013) document a positive relationship between reduced form
"pass-through" regressions and microeconomic price change dispersion. Based on this


                                           3
empirical result they argue that matching the behavior of adjusting prices requires
variable markup shocks. These shocks change how "responsive" firms are to changes
in their marginal cost.       They then show that when changes in variable markups
increase responsiveness, firms adjust more strongly to movements in both exchange
rates and idiosyncratic costs so that they can match the patterns in the data. In
addition, when this variable markup channel delivers greater responsiveness it does
so for all changes in nominal cost which means that aggregate price flexibility rises.
    Bachmann, Born, Elstner, and Grimme (2013) use German micro data to estimate
the response of individual price adjustment to actual measures of uncertainty for
individual firms. They find a modest positive relationship between the frequency of
price adjustment and this micro level uncertainty. They then build a Calvo model
that mechanically links microeconomic uncertainty to the frequency of adjustment
and find that it delivers a small but positive relationship between microeconomic
price dispersion and aggregate price flexibility. However, their model assumes that
uncertainty only aﬀects aggregate price flexibility through its aﬀect on the frequency
of adjustment. This is an assumption that can be tested directly by measuring the
relationship between uncertainty, frequency and the slope of the Phillips curve.
    In the data, to what extent do the aggregate eﬀects of volatility operate through
frequency rather than through alternative channels like size? Overall, the data
suggests that volatility has important eﬀects not captured by frequency. I show
this in two ways: 1) I estimate NKPC that that vary with frequency in addition to
varying with volatility. While there is a relationship between frequency and the slope
of the Phillips curve, the relationship with volatility is much stronger. 2) I impose
additional structure and assume that all changes in the slope of the Phillips curve
are driven by variation in frequency as in a Calvo model I then estimate how large
the variation in frequency must be to match the variation in the slope of the Phillips
curve. After estimating this implied variation in frequency I can then compare it to
actual variation in frequency computed from BLS micro data. Overall I find that
the implied variation in frequency estimated through this structural specification is
substantially larger than the actual variation in frequency in the data. This means
that in order to rationalize the degree of time-varying price flexibility in the data,
a Calvo model requires counterfactually large variation in frequency. That is, price
flexibility varies for reasons not captured by measured frequency. This is consistent
with menu cost models that imply a large role for the extensive margin and a more


                                          4
limited role for the intensive margin (which is proportional to frequency) in explaining
price flexibility.
    The remainder of the paper proveeds as follows: Section 2 introduces the theo-
retical motivation and describes the basic estimation strategy. Section 3 presents a
variety of results estimating the "reduced form" slope of the NKPC. Section 4 esti-
mates "structural" parameters under the additional assumption that the NKPC arises
from a standard Calvo specification and relates the results to alternative structural
models. Section 5 concludes.


2         Empirical Methodology
2.1         Theoretical Motivation
Before discussing time-varying New Keynesian Phillips Curves I briefly review the
existing literature deriving and estimating these inflation relationships. A wide
variety of theoretical price-setting models give rise to a NKPC. For example, in a
Calvo model each firm has some probability 1 −  of being able to adjust its price
while its price must remain fixed with probability . Under standard assumptions2
the aggregate price level (expressed as a percentage deviation around a zero inflation
steady-state) evolves as
                                  = −1 + (1 − ) ∗                         (1)

    where ∗ is the optimal reset price of an adjusting firm.3 If a firm’s marginal cost
is given by  and it discounts profits with discount factor  then its optimal reset
price is given by
                                         X∞
                                                      ©      ª
                           ∗
                           = (1 − )      ()  +                         (2)
                                               =0




        Combining (1) and (2) yields the NKPC:

                                        =  +  { +1 }                                 (3)
    2
        This discussion follows Gali and Gertler (1999). See Woodford (2003) for much more detail.
    3
        With no fundamental heterogeneity, all adjusting firms choose the same reset price.

                                             
    While this NKPC arises naturally in a Calvo environment, it also arises as a
reduced form for various alternative price-setting models. In this sense, it is quite
general and agnostic about the underlying mechanism that gives rise to firms’ price-
setting patterns. For example, Gertler and Leahy (2008) derive a Phillips curve with
this functional form in an Ss model.
    Vavra (2013) shows that in Ss models with time-varying volatility, a similar NKPC
can be derived but with time-varying . That is, theoretical models with time-varying
microeconomic dispersion predict a NKPC of the form:

                                   =   +  { +1 }                                  (4)

    These models predict that  rises with microeconomic volatility. As volatility
rises, there is an increase in aggregate price flexibility so that inflation responds more
to changes in marginal cost. The remainer of the paper tests whether the constant
inflation-output tradeoﬀ in (3) can be rejected in favor of a an inflation-output tradeoﬀ
that varies with volatility as in (4).


2.2       Estimating the NKPC
In a highly influencial paper, Gali and Gertler (1999) provide a methodology for
estimating (3). Under rational expectations, the error in the forecast of  +1 is
uncorrelated with information dated  and earlier, so equation (3) can be estimating
using GMM after instrumenting for  { +1 }.4 As in Gali et al. (2005), I use the
labor share of income in the nonfarm business sector to proxy for marginal cost, and I
instrument for  {+1 } using four lags of inflation and two lags of the labor income
share, the output gap and wage inflation.5
   4
     A number of papers have been written criticizing GMM in this context. See Gali, Gertler, and
Lopez-Salido (2005) for a rejoinder that argues that GMM is an appropriate econometric choice.
   5
     I measure inflation using the GDP deflator, wages using nominal compensation per hour in the
non-farm business sector and I measure the output gap as the deviation from a quadratic GDP
trend. In the benchmark results, I compute deviations in the labor share relative to quadratic
time-trend to account for the fact that there has been a trend decline in labor share over the last
twenty years. (See e.g. Karabarbounis and Neiman (2013) for a discussion of changing labor share
trends and Cespedes, Ochoa, and Soto (2005) for discussion of NKPC estimation in non-stationary
environments). Alternative measures, many of which are shown in Table 2, did not substantively


                                                6
   Models with time-varying volatility predict a NKPC of the form (4) so that im-
plementing GMM requires

                               {(  −   −  +1 )  } = 0

    where  is a vector of instruments dated  and earlier.6 If  is exogenous and
is known by agents when they are forecasting future inflation, this is not particularly
problematic. This assumption holds for example in the structural model of Vavra
(2013) since  moves one-for-one with exogenous and observable volatility. How-
ever, it is easy to think of environments that would violate this moment restriction.
However, this is not particularly problematic for my empirical strategy because I am
interested in testing specification (4) against the null hypothesis that  is constant as
in (3). Under the null hypothesis that  is constant across time, the moment con-
ditions in (4) reduce to the standard moment conditions in Gali and Gertler (1999).
Thus, under the null hypothesis GMM is valid. Rejecting this null hypothesis does
not require taking a stand on the validity of moment conditions in alternative envi-
ronments.
    Testing for a  that varies continuously is not feasible, so I proceed by estimating
equation (4) separately for times of high and low volatility. In my benchmark results I
pick the periods of high and low volatility by first ranking all periods by the interquar-
tile range of plant-level TFP from Bloom, Floetotto, Jaimovich, Saporta-Eksten, and
Terry (2012) although I will show extensive robustness checks with respect to alterna-
tive measures of volatility. I then call the one-third of periods with the highest value
for the interquartile range high volatility periods and the one-third of periods with
the lowest value for the interquartile range low volatility periods. The Bloom et al.
(2012) measure of cross-sectional volatility is based on census data from 1972-2009,
so my estimates cover these dates.
aﬀect the results.
    6
      As emphasized by e.g. Stock, Wright, and Yogo (2002), reliable estimation can be hampered
when  is a weak instrument. However, this weak instrument problem is more important when
estimating "hybrid" NKPC with backward looking terms than when estimating pure forward looking
Phillips curves. In hybrid specifications, in order to be a strong instrument,  must provide
substantial marginal predictive content for  +1 after controlling for     and −1 . In an
empirical model with a purely forward looking specification,  need only satisfy the condition that
it improve on a specification without backward looking components. In my applications, there is no
evidence for a weak instrument problem. For example, Stock and Yogo (2005) tests very strongly
reject weak instrument nulls.



                                                 7
    After splitting the sample into a high and low regime I estimate equation (3)
separately for each regime and test the hypothesis that  =  . Again, under
the null hypothesis that  is constant across time, estimating (3) in subsamples is
just as valid as estimating (3) over the entire sample and should deliver the same ,
while rejecting  =  is evidence against a constant inflation-output tradeoﬀ.


3         Results (Reduced Form)
Table 1 shows results for the regime-specific NKPC under various alternative assump-
tions. Specification (1) estimates the NKPC separately for the highest and lowest
one-third of months by the IQR of plant-level TFP shocks allowing both  and  to
vary between the two regimes. The main object of interest is  −  , and the
data strongly rejects the hypothesis of constant . The estimate of  is significantly
larger (both economically and statistically) during the higher volatility periods.
     While specification (1) is the least restrictive specification, a number of models
imply additional restrictions on the relationship between parameters in the two dif-
ferent regimes. For example, many models imply that  should be constant in the
two regimes. Specification (2) imposes this restriction and shows that it does not
change the conclusion, and neither does imposing that  = 1. Specifications (4)-(6)
show that estimates of  continue to be significantly greater during the high volatility
regime when using diﬀerent thresholds to identify high and low volatility.7 While
the point estimates for  are somewhat diﬀerent under the two diﬀerent threshold
definitions, this is not particularly surprising given the small sample sizes. In addi-
tion, these diﬀerences in point estimates when splitting the sample into fourths rather
than thirds are not statistically significant. The important point is that  − 
continues to be positive and statistically significant under both threshold definitions.
    In Section 4 I impose additional model structure on the NKPC and discuss impli-
cations of these diﬀerences for more fundamental parameters. However, it is worth
noting that when using the baseline results, I find estimates of  that are close to
conventional values of 0.99. The estimates of  are typically negative, which may
seem puzzling. However, the estimates are often insignificant, and in Section 4 I
show that the exact level of the estimate of  is somewhat sensitive to the exact
moment conditions used for estimation. In particular, estimating the more struc-
    7
        For brevity I only report these two thresholds but similar results hold for alternative definitions.


                                                       8
tured specification produces reasonable values for the frequency of adjustment as well
as moderately positive estimates of   Thus, across estimation specifications, the
average estimated slope of the NKPC is not particularly stable but that is not the
focus of my empirical investigation. In contrast, the estimated diﬀerence between
high and low regimes remains highly significant and robust across all specifications.

         This table reports GMM estimates of parameters of Eq. 4. All specifications split IQR TFP
         in thirds. "NFB Inflation" uses the non-farm business deflator instead of the GDP deflator.
         "No NFBSLS detrending" uses the level of the labor share as the driving variable instead of linear
         detrending. "Additional Instrument lags" includes 4 lags of all instruments instead of 2.
         "Additional instruments" includes commodity price inflation and long-short spreads as additional
         instruments. "Regime Specific Inflation" allows for regimes to diﬀer permanently in the level of
         inflation. A Newey-West covariance matrix with 12 lags was used to compute standard errors.




    Line (1) of Table 2 shows that the baseline result is not sensitive to the particular
measure of aggregate inflation. Using the non-farm business deflator instead of the
overall GDP deflator, if anything, delivers stronger results. As mentioned in Section
2, I remove very low frequency trends in the labor share since there has been a trend
decline in this variable in recent years, which makes the raw series problematic as a
measure of cyclical shocks to marginal cost.8 Line (2) shows that the results continue

      See Cespedes et al. (2005) for related discussion of non-stationary NKPC.

to hold using the raw series, although they are somewhat weaker.9 In Line (3) I show
results when using four lags instead of two lags for all instruments, and in line (4) I
include two lags of commodity price inflation and long-short interest rate spreads as
additional instruments, as in Gali and Gertler (1999). Finally, in line (5) I allow for
a regime-specific inflation trend.10 While this specification does not satisfy the basic
specification in equation (3), there is some concern that if equation (3) is misspecified
there may be diﬀerences in the average level of inflation across regimes. Not allowing
for such diﬀerences might spuriously drive diﬀerences in  across regimes. However,
allowing for level diﬀerences in inflation across regimes does not change the results.
    To this point, all results have proxied for microeconomic volatility using the in-
terquartile range of plant-level TFP shocks computed in Bloom et al. (2012). I use
this series as the benchmark because it is available for a relatively long period of time
and closely proxies idiosyncratic volatility since it measures cross-sectional diﬀerences.
Nevertheless, this series is not without problems. First, theoretical models predict
a positive relationship between the dispersion of microeconomic price changes and
aggregate price flexibility. Existing evidence suggests that there is a strong positive
relationship between microeconomic TFP dispersion and microeconomic price change
dispersion, but the relationship is not perfect. In addition, the Bloom et al. (2012)
measure uses manufacturing data from the census. This implies that this measure
focuses on a narrow subset of the economy. In addition, the nature of the data means
that the series can only be constructed annually. With these concerns in mind, Table
3 redoes the baseline analysis using alternative measures of volatility.
    In row (1), I directly compute a time-series for the interquartile range of price
changes in BLS micro data. While this might appear to be a more natural benchmark,
this series has several issues. Producer Price micro data is only available beginning in
1981, Consumer Price data in 1988 and Import Price data in 1993. Thus the overall
series is substantially shorter, and constructing the longest series requires merging
data from several sources. Nevertheless, the baseline results are unchanged: during
periods of time with a high interquartile range of price changes, the estimated slope
of the NKPC is significantly larger. In row (2), I again use data from Bloom et al.
(2012) but use the interquartile range of firm sales rather than the interquartile range
  9
     Overall the NKPC fits the data less well over the last 20 years when not accounting for the
trend in labor share.
  10
     That is, I estimate equation (3) with the addition of a regime-specific constant.

of TFP shocks. Finally, in row (3), I use the dispersion of NAICS industry growth
rates as the measure of volatility. That is, I compute the interquartile range of
various sectoral indices. This measure of dispersion captures only diﬀerences across
sectors and not diﬀerences across firms within sectors, but it generates similar results.

       This table reports GMM estimates of parameters of Eq. 4. All specifications split IQR

       is the rolling standard deviation of GDP growth in previous 8 quarters: 1960-2011. Stock market
       volatility taken from Bloom 2009, 1962-2008. Policy uncertainty taken from Bloom et al (2013):

    In the second half of Table 3 I show results that focus on aggregate volatility
instead of idiosyncratic volatility. In particular, I use three proxies for aggregate
volatility. The first measure of aggregate volatility is the standard deviation of
real GDP growth in an 8 quarter moving window. Second, I use the stock market
volatility measure in Bloom (2009).11 Finally, I use the measure of policy uncertainty
created by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2013). Rows 4-6 show that none of these
measures of aggregate volatility have significant eﬀects on estimates of the slope of the
NKPC. This is consistent with the theoretical model in Vavra (2013). In that model,
aggregate price flexibility is primarily determined by the cross-sectional dispersion of
firms’ desired price changes. Increases in idiosyncratic volatility spread out this
distribution and drive a positive relationship between microeconomic dispersion and
price flexibility. In contrast, increases in aggregate volatility have quantitatively
small eﬀects on the distribution of firms’ desired price changes and thus have little
eﬀect on aggregate price flexibility.
    While I have shown a strong relationship between idiosyncratic volatility and
the slope of the Phillips curve, perhaps idiosyncratic volatility is proxying for some
alternative channel. Using CPI micro data, Vavra (2013) shows that the dispersion
of price changes is countercyclical and is positively correlated with the frequency of
adjustment. In addition, Stock and Watson (2010) argue that unemployment is more
useful for forecasting inflation during recessions.12 Perhaps the positive relationship
between the slope of the Phillips curve and volatility that I document is actually
capturing something about the business cycle or about the frequency of adjustment.
Table 4 shows results when defining regimes based on measures of the business cycle
as well as for the frequency of adjustment. While the point estimates for the GDP
gap and GDP growth are negative (showing that  tends to rise in recessions), this
relationship is not significant. Thus, just as in the structural models, it appears
that it is indeed time-varying volatility that drives time-variation in the reduced form
Phillips curve rather than the business cycle, per se.
  11
     Since this is the volatility of the overall stock market, it should primarily reflect aggregate
volatility rather than idiosyncratic volatility.
  12
     Phrased in terms of Phillips curves, their results imply a steeper Phillips curve during recessions.

      This table reports GMM estimates of parameters of Eq. 4. All specifications split sample
      into thirds. "GDP gap" splits according to the value of the gdp gap, "GDP growth" splits by the
      growth rate of real GDP. "Frequency" splits the sample using the frequency of adjustment in
      BLS data, and "IQR TFP ex ZLB" redoes the benchmark calculation excluding 2008q2-present.
      A Newey-West covariance matrix with 12 lags was used to compute standard errors.



      There is a positive relationship between frequency and the slope of the Phillips
curve, but this eﬀect is substantially smaller than the eﬀect of volatility. Finally, the
fourth specification in Table 4 excludes the time period from 2008q2 to the present.
A number of models suggest that inflation at the ZLB should be diﬀerent than during
normal times. Since the financial crisis was also a time of extremely large volatility,
it is important to show that my results are not driven by this period, and indeed they
are not.
     Finally, theoretical models with time-varying volatility predict a forward looking
NKPC with time-varying slope as in equation (3), but a number of papers study-
ing average inflation dynamics have argued for the importance of backward looking
inflation terms. With this in mind, I now estimate

                       =   +     {+1 } +    −1                          (5)

   To my knowledge, no one has explored a theoretical model with time-varying
volatility and both forward and backward looking agents, so it is not obvious if such


                                                    14
a specification would be generated by simple theories. Nevertheless, Table 5 shows
that allowing for backward looking inflation terms does not change my basic results.
As in the benchmark results, specification (1) allows for diﬀerent eﬀects of inflation
expectations in the two-diﬀerent regimes and specification (2) restricts these forward
looking terms to be identical in both regimes, and in both cases  −   0

4      Results (Structural)

To now I have concentrated on estimating the reduced form NKPC

   However, by imposing additional model structure I can estimate more inter-
pretable parameters. For example, in the Calvo model:

                                                 (1 − ) (1 − )

                                                        15
    where 1 −  is the probability that a firm can adjust its price. In the Ss model of
Gertler and Leahy (2008), an identical functional form arises with the probability of a
firm receiving a Poisson shock, 1−, replacing the probability that a firm exogenously
gets to adjust its price 1 − . With these models in mind I now estimate

                                     (1 − ) (1 − )
                              =                      +  { +1 }                                   (6)

    again splitting the sample into diﬀerent regimes. Table 6 shows the results with
regimes defined using the interquartile range of TFP from Bloom et al. (2012), and
the interquartile range of price changes and frequency of adjustment calculating using
BLS micro data. For ease of interpretation I focus on the case with constant 
but allowing for variation in  did not change the results. The main object of
interest is (1 − )− , the increase in the quarterly frequency of adjustment when
moving from the low regime to the high regime. In all cases the increase in the
implied quarterly frequency of adjustment during the high volatility or frequency
regime is large and significant. The quarterly frequency of adjustment rises by 20-
30% (corresponding to a decline in the average duration of prices of several quarters).

    Thus, when viewed through the lens of a Calvo model, the movements in frequency

implied across time implied by the NKPC are very large. Is this time-variation
implied by the Calvo model a good description of reality? One can get a sense
of this by comparing the implied frequency needed to rationalize variation in the
NKPC to actual variation in frequency. (Note that this is only possible to compute
for the sample window corresponding to BLS data). Clearly when using the price
change IQR to define regimes, the variation in frequency in a Calvo model needed to
rationalize the time-variation in  is unrealistically large. When regimes are defined
using the observed frequency of adjustment, the implied variation in frequency is still
larger than actual variation in frequency although this diﬀerence is less extreme.
    What does this mean? It implies that the variation in aggregate price flexibility
across time cannot be explained solely by variation in the frequency of adjustment.
This is particularly true when sorting regimes by the interquartile range of price
changes. In order to generate the increase in price flexibility observed in the high
volatility regime in the data, a Calvo model would require a 30% increase in the
frequency of adjustment while the true increase is only 3%. This result is again
consistent with Ss models of price-setting. Since the Gertler and Leahy (2008)
model has an identical functional form to equation (6) with  replacing , all of the
estimates of  in Table 6 can be reinterpreted as estimates of . That is, increases
in the probability of receiving Poisson shocks during high volatility periods can lead
to increases in the slope of the Phillips curve without large increases in the frequency
of adjustment. This is also consistent with the quantitative results in Vavra (2013).
He argues that only around 20% of the time-varying price flexibility in his model is
driven by movements in the frequency of adjustment, with the remainder being driven
by variation in the mix of which firms choose to adjust.
    This implies that the empirical frequency of adjustment is not a good summary
statistic for aggregate price flexibility. This in turn implies that models that only
allow volatility to aﬀect aggregate price flexibility through its aﬀect on frequency are
likely to provide a lower bound on the actual importance of volatility in the data.
For example, Bachmann et al. (2013) use micro data to estimate the elasticity of firm-
level frequency with respect to firm-level uncertainty. After estimating this elasticity,
they calibrate a Calvo model with exogenous frequency to match this elasticity and
conclude that variation in price flexibility is modest. However, volatility in this model
can only aﬀect price flexibility through its eﬀect on frequency.

5    Conclusion
A growing theoretical literature argues that increases in microeconomic price change
dispersion should lead to increases in aggregate price flexibility and worsening of the
inflation-output tradeoﬀ. In this paper I estimate regime-specific NKPC to assess
this theoretical prediction. The results are highly supportive of this theoretical
channel. Overall, the time-series evidence shows that increases in marginal cost lead
to greater increases in inflation during periods of idiosyncratic volatility. This is
predicted by Ss or imperfect information models with volatility shocks while it is at
odds with older Keynesian models that predict that the slope of the Phillips curve
should be procyclical. It is also at odds with Calvo price-setting models which assume
a constant frequency of adjustment. Since the Calvo model is log-linear, increases in
volatility have no eﬀects on the inflation-output tradeoﬀ unless they aﬀect frequency.
    I also provide more structural results to assess the role of frequency variation
in explaining aggregate price flexibility. My results suggest that volatility has ef-
fects on aggregate price flexibility that are not captured purely by changes in fre-
quency. Together these results suggest that policy recommendations based on a
constant inflation-output tradeoﬀ are unlikely to be particularly informative. The
inflation-output tradeoﬀ tends to worsen during the times when central banks are
more likely to want to stimulate the economy.
