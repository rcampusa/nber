                                              ABSTRACT

Available data indicates a growing urban-rural income gap (the ratio of mean urban to rural incomes)
with a significant increase from around 1.8 in the late 1980's to over 3 today. These estimates do not
take into account the higher volatility of rural incomes in China. Current literature based on analyses
of rural income volatility in China decomposes poverty into chronic and transient components using
longitudinal survey data and assesses the fraction of the Foster, Greer and Thorbecke poverty gap
attributable to mean income over time being below the poverty line. Resulting estimates of 40-50 %
transient poverty point to the policy conclusion that poverty may be a less serious social problem than
it appears in annual data due to rural income volatility. Here we use a direct method instead to adjust
rural income for volatility using a certainty equivalent income measure and recompute summary statistics
for the distribution of volatility corrected incomes, including the urban-rural income gap on which
much of current poverty debate in China focuses. Since an uncertain income stream is worth less in
utility terms than a certain income stream we argue that heightened rural volatility increases the effective
urban-rural income gap and intensifies not weakens poverty concerns. Using Chinese longitudinal
rural survey data for which current decompositions can be replicated, we make adjustments for certainty
equivalence of rural household income streams which not only widen the urban-rural income gap in
China but also increases other distributional summary statistics. Depending upon values used for the
coefficient of relative risk aversion, the measured urban-rural income gap increases by 20-30% using
a certainty equivalent measure to adjust rural incomes for volatility. We also conduct similar analyses
using consumption data, for which slightly larger increases occur.

    1.    Introduction



    There has been substantial debate inside and outside China over growing relative

poverty (on inequality) as an accompaniment to China’s high growth. While absolute

poverty in terms of number of individuals in households below any given poverty line has

fallen in recent years, relative income measures have widened. Li and Yue (2004) using

Chinese survey data suggest that the urban-rural income gap (the ratio of mean urban to

rural incomes) may have increased from around 1.8 in the late 1980’s to around 3 today.

It is widely acknowledged that a variety of factors currently unaccounted for may further

widen this gap, such as differential availability of education and health care.

    The factor we focus on here is the substantially higher volatility of Chinese rural as

compared to urban incomes. Recent literature on transient and chronic poverty (Jalan and

Ravallion, 1998 (JR); Li, Wang and Yue, 2005) discusses rural income volatility in China

in terms of the relative size of these two components rather than making direct

adjustments to welfare measures, income or consumption, so as to recomputed

distributional summary statistics adjusted for volatility. 2 JR use Chinese longitudinal

data and estimate that 49% of poverty in their sample is transient, where transient poverty

is defined as the portion of the Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (FGT) squared poverty gap

which is removed by using mean income over the sample period to measure the gap. This

finding suggests that if poor households have access to capital markets which allows




2
 Both income and consumption have been used in the literature. Jalan and Ravallion (1998) use consumption, while Li,
Wang and Yue (2005) use both. In the conceptual discussion that follows we use a utility of income function, but a
utility of consumption function can also be used. Both income and consumption are used for calculating inequality and
poverty measures only Chinese data in sections 4 and 5.


                                                                                                                   3
them to income smooth across time, poverty should perhaps be regarded as a less serious

social problem in China (and perhaps elsewhere) than currently.

    If the alternative (and seemingly more realistic) assumption is made that poor

households in villages have either no access to capital markets, or access only at

prohibitively high borrowing rates, the issue instead is how to take rural income

volatility into account when constructing measures of income inequality. We use a utility

of income function which is of iso-elastic form (constant relative risk aversion CRRA),

and longitudinal data for rural households to construct measures of certainty equivalent

income (equivalent in expected utility terms) for rural incomes. Data only allow us to

adjust rural incomes in this way, but it is in the rural sector in China that volatility is most

pronounced. We then calculate summary distributional measures for these modified

measures for China including the urban-rural income gap, Gini coefficient, and Theil

measures. We compute measures for both certainty equivalent and observed income.

    Our results indicate that both the urban-rural income gap and other measures of

inequality in China need to be revised upwards, perhaps by 20 – 30 percent in the case of

the urban-rural income gap. The size of revisions depends on the value used for the

coefficient of relative risk aversion. Smaller but still significant modifications to other

measures, such as the Gini coefficient and the Theil measure also result. The main point

is that in our analysis, volatility of rural incomes reduces their certainty equivalent value

relative to observed incomes and significantly worsens rather than ameliorates relative

poverty in China. The issue is whether the contribution of volatility to income inequality

should be assessed using a relative income approach based on a poverty line or an




                                                                                                4
approach using distributional summary statistics applied to modified measures of income

for the whole population.



   2.   Recent chronic and transient poverty measures and an alternative certainty

        equivalent income approach to adjusting income for volatility.



   A major theme in recent poverty research on China has been to distinguish between

transient and chronic poverty. A central paper is by Jalan and Ravallion (1998) who

measure these two components of poverty in China using longitudinal rural household

survey data. Their chronic poverty measure reflects the component of poverty attributable

to mean consumption of households over time. The transient measure of poverty is the

difference between the total poverty measure and its chronic component. Significant

transient relative to chronic poverty suggests both that poverty may be less serious when

viewed as a long term problem, and that distributional concerns in policy implementation

should perhaps receive a lower weight.

   In distributional literature, both income and consumption are used as in distributional

measures. Conceptually, consumption is a better measure than income, since

consumption measures consumer enjoyment from consuming goods and services, while

income is less accurate due to saving and disaving. However, compiling data on

consumption involves imputation of services rendered over time from houses and other

durables, which is difficult to perform satisfactorily. The Practical difficulties in treating

durables have lead some researchers to argue that consumption has no clear advantages

over income in studying distributional issues. (Atkinson and Bourguignon, 2000, p. 39)




                                                                                                 5
In the empirical part of this paper below, we use both income and consumption to

calculate estimates of poverty and distributional measures, seeing how the results are

sensitive to the welfare measure used. In the rest of this section, however, we assume a

utility of income function provides the welfare measure in explaining methodology used,

but the same explanation is applicable when consumption is used.

    In JR consumption data is used. Mean consumption used to measure chronic poverty

is the time mean of household consumption per capita over the period at issue. 3 This

implicitly assumes that households can borrow and lend during the period at the same

interest rate. Using the squared poverty gap (SPG) index due to Foster et al. (1984), the

aggregate poverty measure over time and its two JR components for a total population are:

          T (T ) = A(T ) − C (T )                                                                          (3)

  In earlier work, Rodgers and Rodgers (1993) measure constant income over time as ‘permanent income’; the
maximum annual consumption level that an agent could achieve from his or her actual income stream over the same
period. (Rodgers and Rodgers, 1993, p. 31.) Permanent income is the time mean of individual income if interest rates
for borrowing and lending are the same. Rodgers and Rodgers also discuss the case where borrowing and lending rates
differ.

  We assume here that every household in the sample is present through all the observed years. Rodgers and Rodgers
(1993) discuss the case where some individuals may be observed only for part of the whole period under survey due to
birth, death, migration and other factors.

The term inside the large bracket on the right hand side of (4) is the difference between

the annual poverty index and the chronic poverty index in year t , and its value can be

either positive or negative. A positive value implies that some poverty experienced in

year t is not chronic, while a negative value indicates that chronic poverty is temporarily

absent in year t . Transient poverty over the time period of observation is simply a time

mean of the difference in each year from the mean. 5 This transient poverty measure, and

the relative size of transient to chronic poverty depends on the choice of poverty line z .

       While this approach to poverty measurement aims to provide an assessment of the

relative importance of chronic and transient poverty, it can be also interpreted as

providing a framework for investigating the effects of volatility or uncertainty on poverty.
6
    Heightened income variation over time, for instance, will tend to increase transient

poverty, and hence inter-temporal aggregate poverty, unless income is maintained above

the poverty line throughout the whole period of observation. However, direct adjustment


5
    The intuition behind this transient poverty measure is also clear from the term inside the large bracket on the right
hand side of equation (4),         g ( yit ) − g ( yi ) . For an individual with g ( yit ) > 0   and   g ( yi ) = 0 ,   the poverty that
the individual experienced in the year is wholly temporarily, and chronic poverty is zero.

                                                                                                                                       7
of income for volatility has been overlooked thus far in the poverty debate in China. If

rural incomes are considerably more volatile than urban incomes, as is true today in

China volatility should worsen the relative poverty picture, not ameliorate it as results

from existing chronic-transient decomposition implicitly suggest. Higher rural volatility

reflects weather and other features which urban residents do not face. This difference in

income volatility between urban and rural residents thus has implications for both the size

of urban-rural income gap and for other distributional summary statistics, such as the

Gini coefficient and the Theil measure if volatility corrected measures of income are used.

    We can adjust observed rural incomes to account for volatility using the certainty

equivalence of an income stream, since uncertainty of income reduces individual welfare

when expressed in terms of expected utility relative to a constant and certain income. We

                                                                  (                        )
take as given an individual utility of income function, U ( y) U ' ( y) > 0 , U '' ( y) < 0 , and

an income stream for a household over a period of observation, yi1 , yi 2 , ..., yiT . Given the

concavity of U ( y) ,

                   T
        U ( yi ) > ∑ witU ( yit )                                                           (5)
                  t =1


                                                                  1 T
where yi , mean income of household i , is defined as y i =        ∑ yit . wit , where
                                                                  T t =1

( ∑t =1 wit = 1 ) and the right hand side of (5) includes period weights, representing the
    T




probability that income yit occurs in year t . Thus, if there are two households, one

receiving a variable income stream yi1 , yi 2 , ..., yiT , and the other receiving an identical

amount of income equal to yi in each period, the expected utility over the observed




                                                                                                    8
period is lower for the household with time-varying income than for the household who

receives constant or certain income.

     Equation (5) thus allows us to construct a measure of certainty equivalent income,

denoted as y c , for any time varying income stream yi1 , yi 2 , ..., yiT . This can be obtained

by solving the equation:

                       T
          U ( yic ) = ∑ witU ( yit )                                                                                (6)
                       t =1



          The concavity of (5) implies that the certainty equivalent income, y ic , is smaller

than the average of the time-varying income stream yi . Adjusting rural income for

volatility in this way will intensify rather than ameliorate relative urban-rural poverty in

China in contrast to the direction that currently available decompositions of poverty into

chronic and transient components point.

     Per capita incomes of urban residents in China have been rising for the past two

decades and with no adjustment for volatility the urban-rural income gap was 3.2 in 2002,

one of the highest in the world. 7 8 Estimates of inequality using certainty equivalent

income to adjust for volatility of incomes allow us to re-assess relative inequality for a

population where incomes are certain for one part of the population but uncertain for

another.

  See Knight and Song (1999).

  The income definition underlying these estimates (and used by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS)) does
not capture subsidies to education and health care from various levels of government, security insurance, pensions and
other features. These subsidies mostly accrue to urban residents and an urban-rural income gap capturing these is also
likely to be higher. Besides disparity in the public services as well as income volatility between urban and rural, urban-
rural differences in the cost of living are a further factor that potentially affects the urban-rural income gap and overall
inequality in China. Unlike public services and income volatility, the gap in the cost of living between urban and rural
sector will bias the urban-rural gap downwards if it fails to taken into accounts, as the cost of living tends to be higher
in urban than in rural. Sicular et al. (2006) attempts to measure urban-rural income gap and overall inequality by
controlling for gap in the cost of living between urban and rural and finds a substantial decline in the estimated urban-
rural income ratio, from 3.39 to 2.38 in 2002.


                                                                                                                          9
          Certainty equivalent income measures also define an equivalence scale, denoted

as si , as the ratio of certainty equivalent income to the time mean of the uncertain

income stream. s i = y ic / y i has values which lie between 0 and 1, i.e. 0 < si ≤ 1 . si = 1

implies that household i receives constant income throughout the whole period of

observation; the more volatile income is the smaller si is. si also depends on y ic , which

in turn depends on the degree of curvature of the utility function; the more concave the

utility function, the smaller y ic , as well as si .

          In the calculations of certainty equivalent rural income for China we report below,

we use a utility function with constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) which allows the

proportional adjustment to income for certainty equivalence to be unit independent. 9

Using a constant absolute risk aversion utility function does not achieve this result. 10 We

specify preferences as:

                     y 1−γ
          u( y) =                                                                                                 (7)
                     1− γ

where y represents income. The Arrow-Pratt measure of constant relative risk aversion

for these preferences is given by:

                   u '' ( y ) y
          γ =−                                                                                                   (8)
                    u ' ( y)




9
  Priori literature alludes to but it does not explicitly set out the approach we detail here using a CRRA utility function.
Morduch (1995) briefly discusses but does not explicitly calculate certainly equivalence income measures for use in
distributional statistics, and suggests using a Taylor series expansion of u ( y ) . Newbery and Stiglitz (1981), in
discussing commodity price stabilization schemes, suggest calculating the amount the individual will pay to forgo
uncertainty, but they do not discuss the application of certainty equivalence calculations to distributional measures.
10
   Constant absolute risk aversion preferences, u ( y ) = −1 / σ * exp(−σy ) , or related variants are also less
commonly used utility functions.


                                                                                                                          10
si and γ are negatively related, i.e. a larger γ yields a more concave utility function,

leading to a lower value of si .

       Both the equivalence scale and the size of certainty equivalent income depend on the

values used for the coefficient of risk aversion, γ . There is a large body of literature on

estimates of risk aversion with widely dispersed results. Using U.S. labor supply data

recent work of Chetty (2006) gives estimates of γ around 1, while earlier studies using

data on insurance produce estimate of γ ranging from 2 to 10. 11 Literature on risk

aversion in developing economics suggests moderate risk aversion, with a coefficient of

risk aversion ranging from 1 to 2. Alderman and Paxson (1994) provides a detailed

survey of literature estimates of coefficients of risk aversion in developing countries. We

use a number of hypothesized values of γ between 0.9 and 10.0 appealing to literature

estimates of γ in Chetty (2003), and assess how sensitive si is to the degree of risk

aversion.

       We examine the impact of more volatile incomes in rural China on both the urban-

rural income gap and other inequality measures for China reporting ratios of urban to

rural incomes based on certainty equivalent incomes, as well as a number of inequality

indices. Of the inequality indices we report, the Atkinson index is of particular relevance

to our certainty equivalent income approach since it deals with the related issue of social

inequality aversion and uses a similar functional form. This index can be expressed as:

                 y ede
        I = 1−                                                                                                      (9)
                   y

                                                                                                                         11
where yede , is the equally distributed equivalent income, and defined as that income level

which, if equally distributed, would give the same level of social welfare as the existing

distribution. The interpretation of Atkinson index is the proportion of total income that

would be required to achieve the same level of social welfare if incomes were equally

distributed. A value of 0.12, for instance, means that we could reach the same level of

social welfare with only 88 (1.00-0.12) percent of the present income.12 Assuming that

each individual has a constant absolute risk aversion utility function (as in equation (7))

and that total social welfare is sum of individual utilities, the equally distributed

equivalent income can be derived as:

                              1
                  ⎡n       ⎤ 1−ε
        y ede   = ⎢∑ Yi1−ε ⎥                                                              (10)
                  ⎣ i =1   ⎦

       It should be noted that ε here has different meaning from γ in our definition of

certainty equivalent income above. In defining certainty equivalent income, γ captures

individual evaluation of income risk while in the Atkinson index ε represents the social

aversion to inequality. More importantly, ε represents the weight that society, or an

investigator, attaches to inequality in the income distribution. ε takes values of above 0

and a larger value of ε attaches more weight to lower incomes in the distribution and

indicates that society is more concerned over the situation of lower income individuals.

The choice of ε is a matter of subjective judgment and inevitably arbitrary, but 2 is

widely used and thought by others to be both reasonable and broadly acceptable.13 In

calculations later using the Atkinson index as a summary measure of the overall

distributions after adjustment for certainty equivalence, we use the same values of ε as

we use for γ in calculating certainty equivalent income. This allows us to compute total

measures of income inequality capturing both social aversion to inequality and volatility

of income, and assess each component.



     3.   Data used, potential biases, and corrections



     The data we use for the certainty equivalent income adjustments to rural incomes that

we make come from the third round of the Chinese household income surveys (CHIP for

short below). This was conducted in 2003 for the reference year 2002, and contains both

urban and rural sub-samples, as well as a migrant sample. 14 Each of the urban and rural

samples is nationally representative, and income per capita and Gini coefficients for both

urban and rural samples are close to estimates published by Chinese official sources and

are based on the same definition of income used by the National Bureau of Statistics

(NBS). Combining both urban and rural samples from this data yields estimates of overall

inequality that are also nationally representative. 15 The NBS sample survey data is

unfortunately not publicly available.

     Data provided by this survey is cross-section and at a household level. Complete

information was only collected for households for the single year of 2002: However, for

the questions on income, consumption and the number of household, households were

also asked in the rural questionnaire to record their income and consumption back to

1998. This yields longitudinal data for these variables from 1998 to 2002 for each

household in the rural sample which can be used to adjust rural income or consumption

14
  For details of survey design and other issues in the use of this survey data see Li, et. al (2005).
15
  This is achieved by weighting the urban and rural sample so that the distribution of sample individuals between urban
and rural segments equals the urban-rural distribution in the Chinese population.


                                                                                                                   13
for 2002 for certainty equivalence. This is the longitudinal panel data that we use to

adjust rural incomes to assess the extent to which income volatility in the rural sector

affects the measured urban-rural income gap.

   Income and consumption in all household surveys is measured with error. Here a

central issue with its reliability is that the measurement of household income and

consumption by respondents is based on recall. The accuracy of reported income may

thus be a more serious problem as the date for which the respondents are asked to

remember their income recedes from the date at which the survey takes place.

   Underestimation of income is most likely when collected by recall if there is loss of

memory as time passes. Such misestimation will also bias estimates of chronic and

transient poverty, because misestimation can lead to a lower time mean of household

income. Misestimation of income can also lead to mismeasurement of the variation of

household income over time, potentially leading to an upper bias in the estimated

certainty income equivalent scale si . Given a predetermined poverty standard, chronic

poverty may also be underestimated.

   Checking income levels and their dispersion for each year in our data relative to

estimates that are published by Chinese official sources for each of the corresponding

years serves as a partial source of verification of our data. NBS estimates of income and

its distribution are based on annual surveys and are free of memory error which attaches

to data generated by recall. The NBS sample, from which the CHIP sample is selected, is

large (around 60,000 households every year) and households are sampled using a two

stage stratified systematic random sampling scheme. The sampling bias of official

estimates of income and its dispersion is thus small.



                                                                                           14
     Table 1 compares income per capita estimates and Gini coefficients between the NBS

large sample and the CHIP small sample for the years 1998 through 2002. The average

income from the CHIP sample, which is based on recall by respondents, is

underestimated by 8.29 percent for 1998 and 4.71 percent for 1999 compared to estimates

of income per capita based on the NBS sample. For the other three years, per capita

incomes based on the CHIP sample are all higher than those from the NBS sample but are

close.

     The underestimation is larger for consumption per capita. All consumption per capita

estimates based on recall from the CHIP sample (for 1998 through 2001) are below those

of the NBS sample. Consumption per capita based on the CHIP sample is lower than in

the NBS sample by 15.55 percent in 1998 and 11.39 percent in 1999. Unlike income per

capita, the dispersion of income measured by Gini coefficients is similar between the two

samples. 16 Underestimation of income in 1998 and 1999 thus appears to be roughly

uniform across households surveyed. If the use of recall underestimates income per capita

similarly for all households, the Gini coefficient will be unchanged since the Gini

coefficient is independent of the unit measure of income used.

     Estimates of both transient poverty and certainty equivalent income and consumption

are thus biased unless underestimation of average income and consumption per capita

over time for recall bias is corrected for. We have made a correction for each of the years

from 1998 to 2002 in our data by scaling up (if estimates of per capita income based on

the CHIP sample are below those from the NBS sample) or down (if estimates of per

capita income based on a CHIP sample are above those from the NBS sample) so that


16
  This comparison is only possible for income, since there are no measures of dispersion of consumption per capita
available from official data.


                                                                                                                     15
mean incomes based on the CHIP sample equal those based on the NBS sample. This

scaling has no effect on estimates of Gini coefficients and other measures of inequality

which are independent of scale.



   4.   Transient poverty measures and certainty equivalent adjusted income

        distribution measures



   In the next section we report estimates of the urban-rural income gap, the Gini

coefficient and other summary measures of the income distribution for the whole of

China based on both observed and certainty equivalent rural incomes. We first, however,

report measures of total poverty and its transient and chronic components for our sample

data using the JR methodology. We replicate Jalan and Ravallion (1998) and Li, Wang

and Yue (2005) using our data set, and first confirm in our data the JR result that transient

poverty accounts for a large portion of total poverty in rural China. Our estimates of

decomposed poverty indices from this replication also support the reliability of data used

in our study. Since our decomposition estimates are broadly consistent with results from

earlier work, it suggests that our data on income and consumption generated by recall

may be reliable enough to use in an analysis of certainty equivalent incomes.

   Any comparison of estimates of poverty indices between earlier work and ours can

not be made precisely because our data differs from that used in previous work both in

terms of the sample of households used and the survey period. Data in Jalan and

Ravallion (1998) come from four provinces in Southern China: Guangdong, Guangxi,

Guizhou, and Yunnan and cover a six year period between 1985 and 1990. Their sample




                                                                                           16
covers 38,951 individuals. Data used in Li, Wang and Yue (2005), on the other hand,

come from a Poverty Monitoring Survey, which covers 592 nationally designated poor

counties and covers a period between 1997 and 2001. Their sample is more than 70,000

individuals. In contrast, data used here covers 8,808 households and 36,206 family

members drawn from 22 provinces, and covers a period between 1998 and 2002. Our

sample is more comparable to that used by Li, Wang and Yue (2005) than JR due to a

closer matching of the time period across the two studies and the use of the same poverty

lines and welfare measures (see discussion below).

    When calculating poverty indices, a measure defined over either income or

consumption can be used. In addition, the poverty line used in previous works on rural

China poverty also differs. The choice of measure and the associated poverty line also is

also an issue so as to facilitate as close a comparison as possible of decomposition results

with our sample with previous studies. Jalan and Ravallion (1998) uses consumption as

welfare measure and employs poverty lines compiled by Chen and Ravallion (1996),

which gave two separate poverty lines: a lower and a higher one for each of four

provinces.17 Except for a higher poverty line for Guangdong in 1990, all of the lower and

higher poverty lines lie between the Chinese official poverty standard and that used by

the World Bank of one dollar per day. Li, Wang and Yue (2005) use both income and

consumption as measures and employ two poverty standards, an official Chinese poverty

line and the World Bank poverty line of 625 Yuan and 874 Yuan at 2000 prices.

Following Li, Wang and Yue (2005), we use both income and consumption as measures

and employ two poverty standards used by Chinese official agencies and the World Bank.

17
   Chen and Ravallion (1996) calculate a poverty line for 1988 using provincial food bundles and extend this to other
years using provincial consumption price indexes. Jalan and Ravallion (1998) did not report which of their lower and
higher poverty lines for each province they use when estimating poverty indexes.


                                                                                                                    17
These poverty lines in 2002 prices (rather than 2000), are 628 Yuan and 878 Yuan

respectively. Both income and consumption per capita are translated into 2002 prices

using provincial consumption price indices. 18

     Table 2 reports total poverty indices and their chronic and transient components using

of our data for both income and consumption. As can be seen, total poverty based on

consumption for the two given poverty lines is higher than that based on income. This

reflects savings by households. Using consumption as their measure of welfare, Jalan and

Ravallion (1998) report 49.3 % percent of poverty as transient. This lies between our

estimates based on both the official poverty line and the poverty line used by the World

Bank. This is broadly consistent with estimates based on our sample data reported in

Table 2, even through our sample period is 10 years later than that of Jalan and Ravallion.

Poverty as reported in Li, Wang and Yue (2005) is larger than in Table 2 because their

study covers the poorest regions in rural China. Our shares of transient components of

total poverty are below theirs for each of four cases (two poverty lines and measures), but

our data is also likely to slightly underestimate fluctuations in income and consumption

over time due to the use of data based on recall.

     Earlier studies of transient poverty also present indices for each sub-group of the total

sample population divided by the number of household members and educational

attainment of the head of households.19 Jalan and Ravallion (1998) find that chronic

poverty increases with the size of the household, while the total poverty index is U-

shaped and lowest at a family size of 5 and 6. Li, Wang and Yue (2005) show similar


18
   Data on provincial consumption price indices comes from National Bureau of Statistics (China) (2003).
19
   Besides the numbers of households and education of the heads of households, Jalan and Ravallion (1998) also
stratify their sample by the mean yield of land and by wealth. Li, Wang and Yue (2005) also use a regional population
breakdown and the age of the head of the household.


                                                                                                                    18
results that lowest total poverty occurs for households with 3 family members. The upper

panel of Table 3 reports results from our data that are similar to those of Li, Wang and

Yue (2005).

   Both earlier studies showed that both transient and chronic poverty indices declined

with the educational level of the head of the household. The proportion of transient

poverty in total poverty by these characteristics is the same in our data as in Jalan and

Ravallion (1998), but there is a weaker trend evident with education levels compared to

Li, Wang and Yue (2005). These results imply that chronic poverty declines more

quickly than transient poverty as the heads of households acquire education. Our

estimates of the relationship between education level and poverty, shown in the lower

panel of Table 3, are close to those of Li, Wang and Yue (2005), except for the higher

education level.

   In summary, calculations from our data of the relative importance of transient and

chronic poverty are broadly consistent with those that of previous studies, and confirm

the earlier finding that transient poverty accounts for a large proportion of total poverty.

We view this approximate consistency as an indication that the panel data used in our

study, even though collected by recall, is appropriate to use in our analysis.



   5.   Certainty Equivalent Rural Incomes and the Urban-Rural Gap



   We now report our calculations of certainty equivalent income for the rural

population for 2002 using the CHIP data described above, and the impacts these certainty




                                                                                            19
equivalent incomes have on measures both the urban-rural gap and other distributional

summary statistics for the whole of China.

   Table 4 reports both summary statistics for the distribution of certainty equivalent

rural income and the impacts on the measured urban-rural income gap. We report results

for alternative values of γ (the coefficient of relative risk aversion) between 0.9 and 10.0.

These reflect the literature range reported by Chetty (2003). A γ value of 1.0 yields no

well defined utility function.

   We first report the mean of certainty equivalent incomes relative to the mean of

observed rural incomes for 2002. With a value of 0.9 the impact of income volatility is to

reduce certainty equivalent income by around 3%, but with a γ value of 10 certainty

equivalent incomes fall by much more. We also report the standard deviation and relative

minimum and maximum incomes (1.0 as a maximum indicates no volatility). The

impacts on measures of the rural income gap are reported as the far right hand side panel

in Table 4. The unadjusted urban-rural income gap based on observed income is 3.245.

Depending on the value of γ , the urban-rural income gap increases from 3.366 to 3.947.

The Chetty (2003) preferred estimate for γ is in the higher end of the range 0.9 to 10.0.

On this basis we interpret Table 4 as suggesting that a correction for certainty

equivalence of rural income in China can have the effect of increasing the urban-rural

income gap by around 20%.

   These results thus underscore the point that explicitly correcting rural income in

China for income volatility worsens rather than ameliorates relative poverty, as

uncertainty reduces the certainty equivalent value of incomes. Existing decompositions of

poverty indicate that transient poverty is a significant component of poverty, pointing to



                                                                                           20
poverty as a less serious problem. The results in Table 4 also suggest, in contrast, that the

effects of direct adjustment for volatility worsens measured inequality, and can be

significant.

     Table 5 report results for consumption for similar ranges of γ , using consumption

rather than income data and a utility of consumption function. The impact of adjusting for

certainty equivalence is more pronounced for consumption than for income, and also

produces larger adjustments to the urban-rural consumption gap. These differences reflect

a large number of households for whom there is greater volatility in consumption than in

income in the underlying survey data. The theme of results remains that volatility in the

rural sector significantly increases measured inequality.

     Tables 6 and 7 report comparisons of other inequality measures based on both

observed and certainty equivalent income (Table 6) and observed and certainty

equivalent consumption (Table 7). We report cases for certainty equivalent measures

using values of γ between 0.9 and 10.0 as before. Upper panels report the measures and

the lower panel reports the impacts in relative terms of using certainty equivalent income.

     Using certainty equivalent income increases all reported measures in Table 6 (the

income case). The Gini coefficient increases by around 7% using a γ value of 10.0. This

is a smaller increase than for the urban-rural income gap, but the Gini coefficient is

known to be a relatively insensitive poverty measure.

     Table 7 reports results for consumption. With the exception of CRRAvalues of

γ = 0.9 and γ = 1.1 , 20 all inequality indices used increase with the value of γ . This is


20
   This may reflect the feature that the use of certainty equivalent measures has an effect both across the urban-rural
sub-population which serve to increase inequality, but also within the rural population. The combined effect is
ambiguous. For these low values of in these cases, the within rural sub-population effects dominate.


                                                                                                                          21
similar to the case of income, but given values of γ estimates of inequality based on

consumption are greater than those based on income. This reflects two factors. First, there

is a more pronounced impact from adjusting for certainty equivalence for consumption

than for income. Second is larger inequality measures for consumption than for income

based on observed data. Larger consumption inequality is also observed for UK

households by Goodman and Webb (1995).

   Table 8 reports Atkinson indices for various combination of γ (risk aversion) and ε

(social inequality aversion). We calculate Atkinson measures both for observed income

unadjusted for certainty equivalence, and for certainty equivalent income. Given social

aversion to inequality of 2.0, the Atkinson index is 0.55 when observed income data used,

but depending on γ can rise to 0.78 when γ of 10.0. There is an approximate 20%

increase in the Atkinson index to volatility. For consumption the increase is smaller.

   In summary, volatility reflects time varying income (or consumption), and with

limited access to capital markets in rural areas for income (or consumption) smoothing,

volatility reduces the value of the income stream relative to its certainty equivalent.

Explicitly adjusting measure of household income and/or consumption for volatility using

a certainty equivalent approach can increase inequality measures for China such as the

urban-rural income gap by around 20%.



   6.   Concluding Remarks



   Volatility of income or consumption streams has received only limited attention in the

literature in terms of its impacts on relative poverty (inequality). Here we use longitudinal



                                                                                          22
rural data for China between 1998 and 2002 to adjust 2002 rural income for certainty

equivalence, and show that volatility in rural income worsens measures of relative

poverty in China. Depending on the value used for the coefficient of relative risk aversion

current estimates of the urban-rural income gap in China may need to be revised by

around 20%. We contrast these results to existing decompositions of poverty in China

into chronic and transient components, which point to a large transient portion, with the

implication that poverty viewed as a longer term problems is less serious in China than it

may appear in annual data.

   A weakness with our calculations is the lack of longitudinal data on urban as well as

rural income (and consumption) in China. Volatility in the urban sub-sample will lessen

the effect of the adjustments we make, but it is widely believed that rural incomes are

significantly more volatile than urban income. When such data becomes available a

similar methodology to that we set out here can also be deployed.
