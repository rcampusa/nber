This paper provides an explanation for situations in which the state variables describing the
economy do not change, but aggregate consumption experiences significant changes. We present
a theory of pseudo-wealth—individuals’ perceived wealth that is derived from heterogeneous
beliefs and expectations of gains in a bet. This wealth is divorced from real assets that may exist
in society. The creation of a market for bets will imply positive pseudo-wealth. Changes in the
differences of prior beliefs will lead to changes in expected wealth and hence to changes in
consumption, implying ex-post intertemporal individual and aggregate consumption
misallocations and instabilities. Thus, in the environment we describe, completing markets
increases macroeconomic volatility, raising unsettling welfare questions.

                                     I.   Introduction

This paper provides a new explanation for an important macro-economic
phenomenon: There are many occasions in which the (physical) state variables
describing the economy (the level of human and natural capital, the amount of
plant and equipment) do not exhibit large changes but the state of the economy,
including the levels of consumption of the society, changes dramatically.

This paper puts forward the hypothesis that at least some of this volatility arises
from fluctuations in what we call pseudo-wealth—wealth that individuals
perceive they have, but which is to some extent divorced from the physical assets
that exist in society. We show that there can be sudden changes in the aggregate
value of this pseudo-wealth, and that these fluctuations in turn can lead to high
levels of volatility in aggregate consumption and to ex-post intertemporal
consumption misallocations (in the sense of having paths of individual and
aggregate consumption that are not as smooth as the individuals and the society
wished ex-ante). We show, moreover, that the persistence of pseudo-wealth can
lead to increasing levels of debt.

There is a challenge, however, in creating a persuasive theory of pseudo-wealth.
If one assumes expectations are simply arbitrarily given, then a sudden change in
expectations (the probability distribution of future states of nature) can obviously
give rise to marked changes in the value of wealth. There is some evidence that
especially dramatic changes in perceptions occur during times of crisis (Hoffman,
Post, and Pennings, 2013; Kozlowski, Veldkamp, and Venkateswaran, 2015). The
recent US financial crisis is just one more example of this. Prior to the crisis,
many financial experts believed that the likelihood of a housing bubble was
negligible (or at least that its effects would be contained), and presumably they
persuaded many others that that was the case. Between 2007 and early 2009 there




                                           2
was a massive change in beliefs. By early 2009, it was hard for anyone to
maintain that there had not been a bubble. It is, of course, a challenge to reconcile
these beliefs and their evolution over time with any theory of rational
expectations.

The problem with this theory is that the task of explaining consumption volatility
is too easy. This is a legitimate critique of “animal spirits.” More refined theories
try to explain how distributions of beliefs change over time as a function of the
new information the economy receives.

In this paper, we explore an explanation that is more tethered and less arbitrary. It
is based on two key hypotheses:

       1. There can exist large differences in prior beliefs that are sustained over
          time. Differences in views can exist even when individuals have rational
          expectations, so long as they have access to different information that
          leads to different priors, and as long as the structure of the economy is
          such that differences in priors persist over time. 1 All that we require is that
          the assumptions which give rise to “common knowledge”—a state of
          affairs in which all individuals agree about the probabilities of different
          events— are not satisfied.

       2. Differences in views, with betting markets, give rise to the creation of
          pseudo-wealth, with the aggregate expected wealth of market participants
          exceeding true wealth –i.e., a level of wealth consistent with societal
          beliefs that are feasible. Each side “expects” to win. Betting markets also
          lead to more uncertainty. If the positive effect of pseudo-wealth creation
          on demand is larger than the negative effect of uncertainty (due to the

   1
     Differences in priors are a necessary condition for speculative trade. In models with heterogeneous information but
common priors, no-trade theorems apply (Milgrom and Stokey, 1982). Differences in priors could also arise as the
consequences of behavioral biases. For our analysis what matters is that the priors are different, independently of what
creates those differences.




                                                            3
        increase in precautionary savings) on demand, the result will be an
        increase in current levels of consumption. It is inevitable that (later)
        someone's expectations will be disappointed—indeed, in any betting
        market, someone is disappointed. The point here is that the disappearance
        of the bet will lead to destruction of pseudo-wealth. If the pseudo-wealth
        component was significant, then this moment will have macroeconomic
        significance.

We present a model of two agents who disagree in the probability that a sunspot
event occurs. 2 There is a market for short-term bets, and given the disagreement
of beliefs, in equilibrium both agents will trade a bet. They both believe they have
a relatively larger chance of winning, hence they both feel wealthier. However,
this cannot be true for the aggregate, as the bet is not creating any real wealth.
Once the sunspot occurs, it cannot occur again; hence the bet disappears, and even
though no real wealth is destroyed, the expected wealth of both agents
discontinuously decreases. 3     4



A financial innovation as the creation of a market for bets in a context of
heterogeneous beliefs will lead to increases in expected wealth that will tend to
increase consumption but also increases in volatility that will tend to increase
savings for precautionary motives. We restrict the analysis to the cases where the
wealth effects dominate over the precautionary savings effects. Our main result is
that the interaction of disagreement of beliefs with a market for bets will create


  2
     We focus on those events because we want to isolate the effects of pseudo-wealth
changes from those of other changes. In practice, many bets are about matters of economic
substance --such as weather there is a housing or oil price bubble.
   3
     The sunspot can be taken as a metaphor for an event that rarely occurs, like a structural
transformation, over which there is not a long history to have properly learned the true
probability distribution that governs it.
   4
     One can extend the model to situations where new betting opportunities may open up. The
central point is that spending will be related to the magnitude of betting opportunities (itself
related to the magnitude of differences in judgments).




                                                4
excessive ex-post aggregate consumption volatility, excessive either with respect
to a world of common beliefs or to a world with no market for bets. At the
moment in which the bet disappears, the agent betting in favor of the sunspot will
experience an increase in wealth, and the other agent will experience a decrease in
wealth. However, the “pseudo-wealth” component of expected wealth will vanish,
as the difference in views that was leading to a perception of higher wealth at the
individual level will no longer be relevant. At this moment, aggregate
consumption will decrease discontinuously.

Notably, the financial innovation that completes the market will create risk in an
economy that would be otherwise stable—but from the viewpoint of individual
beliefs, this will be Pareto efficient. But if the planner had prohibited the bet, the
society would have experienced a smoother path of consumption, and each
individual's consumption profile would have been smooth. If we allow the planner
to take a stance on beliefs, and the planner uses beliefs that are consistent, then
the betting equilibrium would be Pareto inferior.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section I.A frames our paper in the
existing literature. In section II, we present a simple framework that displays the
presence of positive pseudo-wealth and analyze the implications for spending and
savings of a financial innovation as the creation of a market for bets in an
environment featured by heterogeneous beliefs. Section III solves the model for
the certainty equivalence case. Our goal in that section is to illustrate the effects
of the dynamics of pseudo-wealth on the dynamics of consumption in a tractable
setting in which wealth effects dominate over precautionary savings effects.
Section IV summarizes the main results of the model in terms of consumption
volatility. Section V discusses the limitations of our assumptions and possible
extensions. We show that in richer economic structures, fluctuations in pseudo-
wealth can also have effects on actual wealth as well as distributional




                                           5
consequences. We also analyze a case in which heterogeneous beliefs can give
rise to negative pseudo-wealth. Section VI presents the conclusions.



                                           A. Related Literature

The issue of “excessive” consumption volatility has received much attention in
the macroeconomics literature. The term “excessive” indicates that the actual
consumption volatility cannot be explained by a benchmark model that would
imply a more stable path of consumption relative to output. Since Friedman, one
of the central hypotheses of modern macroeconomics is that agents smooth
consumption. The benchmark model typically invoked features a representative
agent model with rational expectations and transitory shocks to output. The
existing literature offers different types of deviations from that benchmark to
explain the higher levels of consumption volatility observed in times of high
output volatility.

Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) introduce trend shocks in a real business cycle
framework. The volatility of trend shocks is larger in emerging economies than in
advanced economies, which implies the higher consumption volatility observed in
the former set of economies. 5 But this approach does not really solve the
quandary noted above. Unlike our approach, this approach requires large changes
in the state variables (represented as permanent productivity shocks) to explain
large changes in consumption.

Another branch of related literature provides an explanation for changes in current
behavior as a response to today’s changes on expectations concerning the

5 This approach has been criticized by Garcia Cicco, Pancrazzi, and Uribe (2010). They perform an econometric
estimation (using long time-series) of the parameters that govern the productivity processes, and obtain a lower
variance and persistence of the permanent component of growth shocks, making the model incapable of explaining
the high volatility of consumption relative to output in those economies.




                                                        6
evolution of state variables in the future. For example, Beaudry and Portier (2004,
2006) and Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008) present a class of models where news
about future total factor productivity drive changes in individuals’ decisions that
could lead to a downturn in the present. Relatedly, Lorenzoni (2009) presents a
theory of “news shocks”, in which business cycles are driven by changes in the
expectations of the individuals about the present state of the economy—but
expectations are formed on the basis of noisy public sources of information
regarding long-run shifts in aggregate productivity. Although in this family of
models it is possible to have situations in which the state of the economy changes
with no changes in the current state variables, these frameworks—unlike our
framework—still rely on changes in the future state variables that are anticipated
in the present for explaining changes in the state of the economy observed also in
the present.

Angeletos and La’O (2013) provide an explanation that can account for shifts in
the expectations of economic activity with no changes in the fundamentals that
describe the economy. Their theory accommodates the notion of animal spirits in
a model of rational expectations with a unique equilibrium in an environment
featured by incomplete information and imperfect communication. What drives
fluctuations in the economy is an extrinsic shock 6 that they dub “sentiment
shock”, that can effectively alter beliefs in equilibrium. These shocks can be
interpreted either as shocks to beliefs of endogenous economic outcomes — an
interpretation corresponding to shocks to first-order beliefs — or as shocks to the
beliefs that each agent (or island) forms about the beliefs of other agents (or
islands) about her productivity — an interpretation corresponding to shocks to

      An extrinsic shock is a shock to residuals that does not affect any payoff.




                                                                 7
second-order beliefs. 7 A positive correlation in the degree of agents or islands’
optimism or pessimism about the terms of trade with the other islands that each of
them will face may emerge endogenously as agents learn from realized market
outcomes. The pseudo-wealth theory that we develop in this paper does not
require any shock to the expectations of endogenous market outcomes. The
increase in individual and aggregate consumption that occurs when the market for
bets is created is the pure consequence of the speculative trade, that is unrelated
with market outcomes different than the expectation of a gain associated with the
bet. In turn, the fall in aggregate consumption that occurs when pseudo-wealth is
destroyed is also unrelated to expectations of market outcomes, but it is the
consequence of the realization of a rare event that eliminates any difference in
prior beliefs. In our framework, agents fully agree on any possible market
outcome rather than the betting outcome probabilities at all moments. Besides, in
the theory of pseudo-wealth the evolution of second-order beliefs is uninteresting:
the premise is that before the realization of the rare event, agents “agree to
disagree”.

The literature on learning as the basis of formation of expectations introduces
deviations from the full information rational expectations hypothesis (cf. Evans
and Honkapohja, 2001). Models with learning can account for a larger volatility
of expected wealth due to the possibility of revisions of expectations.
Accordingly, these models lead to larger macroeconomic volatility and
endogenous business cycles (for example, Boz, Bora Durdu, and Daude (2011);
Heymann and Sanguinetti (1998), Pintus and Suda (2015), Guzman and Howitt,
2016). Both this paper and the learning literature are predicated on imperfect
knowledge. In both, changes in beliefs have real macroeconomic effects and can


  7
    Angeletos and La’O (2013)’s preferred interpretation is as shocks to first-order beliefs, a concept that is more
amenable for empirical analysis, as surveys generally only contain information on first-order beliefs.




                                                          8
lead to volatility. While in the learning literature, macroeconomic fluctuations are
related to changes in average beliefs that have macroeconomic consequences,
here, fluctuations can arise even if there are no changes in average beliefs: it is
changes in the dispersion of beliefs which drives changes in aggregate
consumption, and these changes can be triggered in a variety of ways.

There is a large literature that analyzes the consequences of heterogeneous beliefs.
Geanakoplos (2010) offers an approach for explaining excessive volatility of asset
prices based on the interaction between heterogeneous expectations, collateral
constraints, and leverage. Bad news in the economic environment can be
amplified through the interaction between leverage and collateral constraints,
leading to large changes in the “marginal buyer” 8 of an asset, and thus in asset
market prices. In this approach, not everyone's expected wealth is reduced after
the shock. (Only the expected wealth of the optimists who owned assets
decreases.) In our approach, both optimists and pessimists will suffer a decrease
in expected pseudo-wealth after the shock, as the betting market had previously
allowed them to exploit differences in beliefs in a way that all of them were
feeling too “optimistic” about their future wealth. Scheinkman and Xiong (2003)
show how speculative behavior—defined as the agent’s willingness to pay a price
for an asset above her valuation of it, due to the belief that he will be possible to
sell it at an even higher price in the future—in a context of short-sale constraints
and overconfidence—defined as the belief of an agent that her information is
more accurate than it is—creates asset prices bubbles. In our framework, agents
do not speculate on the behavior of others—they simply make betting and
consumption decisions that they believe are optimal, independent of the potential
behavior of others.



   8 The marginal buyer, who is the least optimist of the agents who buy the asset, is a more pessimistic agent after
a bad shock.




                                                           9
More generally, the paper is related to a sizable literature that investigates the
consequences of financial innovations and financial constraints in an environment
of heterogeneous beliefs, such as Fostel and Geanakoplos (2012), Simsek (2013a,
2013b), among others. The closest contribution to this paper is Iachan, Nenov,
and Simsek (2015) (INS henceforth). While INS focus on the effects of a financial
innovation (that could be equivalent to the creation of a market for bets in this
paper) on savings, we focus both on the moment of the innovation and especially
on the moment in which the innovation either disappears or is no longer relevant,
and analyze the effects that those moments have on consumption, betting, and
savings. Also, while INS focus on cases in which substitution effects dominate
over income effects, we focus on the opposite case. 9 Both papers could be seen as
complementary.

This paper is the first step of a research agenda outlined in Stiglitz (2015) and
Guzman and Stiglitz (2015a), and advanced in Guzman and Stiglitz (2015b) that
intends to offer a general framework for understanding situations in which large
changes in macroeconomic behavior are observed with no counterpart in the size
of changes of the state variables describing the economy.

In every period, each agent receives the same constant exogenous endowment of a
single consumption good, denoted by 𝑦 > 0.

There is a Poisson probability 𝜆 for the arrival of a one-time exogenous event, a
sunspot. There is disagreement on the value of 𝜆: agent A believes that the sunspot
is more likely to occur than agent B does, i.e., 𝜆𝐴 > 𝜆𝐵 .

Agents can borrow in the international credit market at the risk-free interest rate r.

We assume the instantaneous utility function 𝑢�𝑐𝑡𝑖 � is continuous and strictly
concave, 𝑢′ �𝑐𝑡𝑖 � > 0 and 𝑢′′ �𝑐𝑡𝑖 � < 0, where 𝑐𝑡𝑖 ≥ 0 is the level of consumption of
individual i in period t.

  The set of spaces in period 𝑡, 𝑍𝑡 , is dependent on the history of previous states.
Until a sunspot occurs, there are two possible states: 𝑍𝑡 = {𝑆, 𝑂} if 𝑧𝑗 = 𝑂 ∀𝑗 < 𝑡,
𝑧𝑡 is the state realization in period 𝑡, 𝑆 refers to the sunspot state and 𝑂 to the no
sunspot state. Once the sunspot occurs, it cannot occur again, and the state will be
𝑧𝑡 = 𝑂 forever, i.e. 𝑍𝑡 = {𝑂} if ∃𝑧𝑗 = 𝑆, for any 𝑗 < 𝑡. The sunspot can then be
interpreted as a shock to prior beliefs—a shock that vanishes any difference in
agents’ priors.

Figure 1 depicts the tree of possible states before the occurrence of the sunspot.

                               C. Bets and pseudo-wealth

We assume there is a market for short-term bets. Given the disagreement on            ,
agents will trade a bet in equilibrium.

The existence of the market for bets completes the market, in the sense that for all
agents and for all states there is an available asset such that the payoff in one state
is positive and in the other state is zero.

Bets have two effects on the agents’ decisions:

    1. Given the disagreement on the true value of 𝜆, bets will create pseudo-
        wealth. Because of the bet, each party believes that he is wealthier. Thus,
        the perceived aggregate wealth exceeds the total “true” wealth. The larger




                                              12
       the size of the bet and the larger the discrepancy of beliefs on the
       probability of occurrence of the sunspot, the larger will be the pseudo-
       wealth. This effect will tend to increase consumption.

   2. Bets will create uncertainty about expected wealth. In a general setup, this
       effect will tend to increase precautionary savings.

Therefore, every additional dollar of bet will be associated with a marginal benefit
that comes from the perceived increase in wealth, and a marginal cost that comes
from the increase in the variance of future expected wealth.

In every period the bet gets resolved. One side or the other wins the bet, and the
pseudo-wealth that was created gets destroyed. If that were the whole process,
pseudo-wealth would be ephemeral, with no real macroeconomic consequences.

If, however, differences in beliefs persist, individuals may once again engage in a
bet, and so new pseudo-wealth is created. This destruction of pseudo-wealth but
creation of new pseudo-wealth will occur until 𝑧𝑡 = 𝑆.

In the betting equilibrium, agent A will pay 𝑝𝑡 to agent B in period 𝑡. If 𝑧𝑡 = 𝑆,
agent B pays 1 to agent A, while if 𝑧𝑡 = 𝑂, agent B pays nothing. Formally, the
bet net returns 𝜓𝑡𝑖 are described as follows:


                                       1 − 𝑝𝑡 ,    𝑧𝑡 = 𝑆
                             𝜓𝑡𝐴 = �
                                        −𝑝𝑡 ,     𝑧𝑡 = 𝑂


                                  −(1 − 𝑝𝑡 ),     𝑧𝑡 = 𝑆
                           𝜓𝑡𝐵 = �
                                     𝑝𝑡 ,     𝑧𝑡 = 𝑂


  The pseudo-wealth of agents A and B in period 𝑡 is described by

                           𝑃𝑊𝑡𝐴 (𝑧𝑡 ) = (𝜆𝐴 − 𝑝𝑡 )𝑏𝑡 (𝑧𝑡 )

     where 𝑏𝑡 ≥ 0 is the equilibrium level of betting and 𝑃𝑊𝑡𝑖 is the level of pseudo-
     wealth of individual 𝑖 in period t. Correspondingly, the expected present

     The aggregate pseudo-wealth is strictly positive before the sunspot, and as noted,
     depends on the magnitude of the disparity in the agents’ beliefs and the size of the
     bet.



                                              D. Optimization

     Consumers are forward-looking. In period t, each agent chooses a sequence of
     consumption, borrowing, and bets in order to maximize the expected present
     discounted value of utility,

where 𝒛𝑡 denotes the history of states until period 𝑡 and 𝑑𝑡𝑖 ∈ ℝ denotes net
borrowing by agent 𝑖 in period 𝑡; and also subject to the transversality condition

                                         𝑑𝑗𝑖
                                  lim           = 0,                 𝑖 = 𝐴, 𝐵
                                  𝑗→∞ (1 + 𝑟) 𝑗


Every time the no sunspot state occurs, there will be a winner and a loser of the
bet but the tree of future states will be the same as one period before. That is, the
realizations of states act as wealth shocks, which implies a need to re-optimize in
each period.

We will also assume (for simplicity) that 𝛽(1 + 𝑟) = 1.



         E. Consumption responses to increases in risk and expected wealth

  The response of the individuals’ consumption and savings to the creation of the
market for bets will depend on the agents’ preferences. Suppose for the sake of
simplicity and only for the analysis of this section that there are only two periods,
𝑡 = 0,1, and in 𝑡 = 0 the creation of a market for bets that will be opened in the
morning of 𝑡 = 1 is announced. Suppose individuals’ beliefs are symmetric:
     1    1
𝜆𝐴 − 2 = 2 − 𝜆𝐵 . Agent A will maximize

𝑢(𝑐0𝐴 ) + 𝛽�𝜆𝐴 𝑢�𝑐1𝐴 (𝑆)� + (1 − 𝜆𝐴 )𝑢�𝑐1𝐴 (𝑂)��

subject to the budget constraints




                                                          15
                                    𝑐0𝐴 = 𝑦 + 𝑑0𝐴

                       𝑐1𝐴 (𝑆) = 𝑦 + (1 − 𝑝)𝑏 𝐴 − (1 + 𝑟)𝑑0𝐴

                          𝑐1𝐴 (𝑂) = 𝑦 − 𝑝𝑏 𝐴 − (1 + 𝑟)𝑑0𝐴

  Before the creation of the market for bets, 𝑐𝑡𝐴 (𝑧𝑡 ) = 𝑦 ∀𝑡, ∀𝑧𝑡 . But betting will
create a wealth effect and an increase in the variance of consumption in 𝑡 = 1,
that will turn affect consumption and savings decisions in 𝑡 = 0. Lemma 1 shows
that when utility is strictly increasing in consumption, the creation of the market
for bets will lead to positive betting in equilibrium, thus creating a positive wealth
effect.



  Lemma 1: Suppose 𝑢 is differentiable and 𝑢′ > 0, 𝜆𝐴 > 𝜆𝐵 . Then, 𝑏 𝑖 > 0 ∀𝑖
when the market for bets is created.

  Proof: From the first order conditions of the utility maximization problem,

  𝜆𝐴 (1 − 𝑝)𝑢′�𝑐1𝐴 (𝑠)� − (1 − 𝜆𝐴 )𝑝𝑢′�𝑐1𝐴 (𝑂)� ≤ 0, 𝑏0𝐴 ≥ 0, and

  �𝜆𝐴 (1 − 𝑝)𝑢′�𝑐1𝐴 (𝑠)� − (1 − 𝜆𝐴 )𝑝𝑢′�𝑐1𝐴 (𝑂)��𝑏0𝐴 = 0

  Suppose that 𝑏0𝐴 = 0. Then,

𝜆𝐴 (1 − 𝑝)𝑢′�𝑐1𝐴 (𝑠)� − (1 − 𝜆𝐴 )𝑝𝑢′�𝑐1𝐴 (𝑂)� = (𝜆𝐴 − 𝑝)𝑢′[𝑦 − (1 + 𝑟)𝑑0𝐴 ] > 0

a contradiction. Due to symmetry, the same holds for agent B. QED



  The creation of the market for bets will increase (decrease) savings in 𝑡 = 0 in
the open economy if in the absence of savings or borrowing the marginal utility of
consumption in the first period is smaller (greater) than the expected marginal




                                          16
utility of consumption in the second period. Formally, following the creation of
the market for bets savings will increase (decrease) if

               𝑢′(𝑦) < (>)𝜆𝐴 𝑢′(𝑦 + (1 − 𝑝)𝑏) + (1 − 𝜆𝐴 )𝑢′(𝑦 − 𝑝𝑏)

  The direction of the inequality will in general depend on the form of the utility
function and the level of risk aversion. For the quadratic utility function,
𝑢�𝑐𝑡𝑖 (𝑧𝑡 )� = 𝑐𝑡𝑖 (𝑧𝑡 ) − 𝛾𝑐𝑡𝑖 (𝑧𝑡 )2, savings will decrease when the market for bets is
created, as

               𝑢′(𝑦) = 1 − 2𝛾𝑦 > 1 − 2𝛾𝑦 − 2𝛾𝑏(𝜆𝐴 − 𝑝) = 𝐸𝑢′(𝑐1𝐴 )

  Thus, under quadratic preferences the creation of the market for bets will
increase consumption. This is a case in which there is no precautionary savings
effect, hence the only relevant effect at the time of the creation of the market for
bets is the wealth effect.

  But this is not a general result. For example, for utility functions that feature
precautionary savings or substitution effects, the response of savings to the
creation of the market for bets may be positive. The next proposition describes
sufficient conditions under which this is indeed the case.



  Proposition 1: Suppose 𝑢 is three times differentiable, 𝑢′ > 0, 𝑢′′ < 0, 𝑢′′′ >
                   1
0. Then, ∃λ∗ ∈ �2 , 1� such that savings will increase in 𝑡 = 0 when the market

for bets is created if 𝜆𝐴 < 𝜆∗ .

  Proof:      Let 𝑔(𝜆𝐴 ) = 𝜆𝐴 𝑢′(𝑦 + (1 − 𝑝)𝑏) + (1 − 𝜆𝐴 )𝑢′(𝑦 − 𝑝𝑏). As agents’
                                   1                                        1
beliefs are symmetric, take 𝑝 = 2. Due to the strict convexity of 𝑢′, 𝑔 �2� > 𝑢′ (𝑦)

for 𝑏 > 0. Also, as 𝑢′′ < 0 and due to lemma 1, 𝑔(1) = 𝑢′(𝑦 + (1 − 𝑝)𝑏) <




                                            17
                                                          1
𝑢′(𝑦). Then, due to the continuity of 𝑢′, ∃𝜆∗ ∈ �2 , 1� such that 𝑔(𝜆∗ ) = 𝑢′(𝑦).
                                                      1
Then, savings will increase in 𝑡 = 0 if 𝜆𝐴 ∈ �2 , 𝜆∗ �. QED



  Proposition 1 shows that given a precautionary savings motive, for a
sufficiently low dispersion of beliefs the wealth effect will be dominated by the
precautionary savings effect when the market for bets is created.

  Note that in the analysis above we described the force that counteracts with the
positive wealth effect as a precautionary savings effect. Under a utility function
that allows for a certainty-equivalent representation for every risky consumption
profile (as it is the case with Epstein-Zin preferences), it is then possible to isolate
the risk effects and focus on the certainty-equivalent payoffs of the bet. The
counteracting forces must then be described as a wealth effect and a substitution
effect, as in INS. But with more general preferences, we must then focus on the
actual consumption profile, and think of the counteracting forces as a wealth
effect and a precautionary savings effect.



                           III.     The certainty equivalence case

  We are interested in analyzing a case in which the pseudo-wealth effect induced
by the creation of the market for bets dominates over the substitution effect. For
simplicity, we will assume that preferences take the form of a quadratic utility
function.

  𝑢�𝑐𝑡𝑖 (𝑧𝑡 )� = 𝑐𝑡𝑖 (𝑧𝑡 ) − 𝛾𝑐𝑡𝑖 (𝑧𝑡 )2 , 𝑖 = 𝐴, 𝐵

  It is well known that the quadratic utility function cannot be globally correct,
since it implies that the marginal utility of consumption becomes negative for




                                                 18
𝑐𝑡 > 1/2𝛾. However, it will be useful for our analysis as long as we restrict the
value of 𝑦 sufficiently as to ensure that consumption lies in the area in which the
marginal utility of consumption is positive. 10



                  A. Expected wealth and the intertemporal budget constraint

The expected wealth of each agent in period t, 𝐸𝑡 𝑊 𝑖 , will be composed of three
parts: the expected value of the endowment the agent receives, the expected value
of pseudo-wealth, and the (negative of the) debt payments that must be paid in
period t. Then,
                                          𝑦                       𝑖 (𝒛
   (EW)              𝐸𝑡 𝑊 𝑖 (𝒛𝑡 ) = 1−𝛽 + 𝐸𝑡 𝑃𝑊 𝑖 (𝑧𝑡 ) − (1 + 𝑟)𝑑𝑡−1  𝑡−1 ) ∀𝑖, ∀𝑡




With a quadratic utility function, agent i faces the following intertemporal budget
constraint:

         𝑗 𝑖                  𝑦
   ∑∞
    𝑗=𝑡 𝛽 𝑐𝑗 �𝒛𝑗 � =
                                                            𝑖
                                  + 𝐸𝑡 𝑃𝑊 𝑖 (𝑧𝑡 ) − (1 + 𝑟)𝑑𝑡−1 (𝒛𝑡−1 )
                            1−𝛽




                               B. Individual consumption and borrowing

In this case of quadratic utility function, the consumption optimal rule is
                                                                  𝑖 (𝒛
                  𝑐𝑡𝑖 (𝒛𝑡 ) = 𝑦 + (1 − 𝛽)[𝐸𝑡 𝑃𝑊 𝑖 (𝑧𝑡 ) − (1 + 𝑟)𝑑𝑡−1  𝑡−1 )]




10 Note that the expected wealth is bounded from above, as 𝑑 ≥ −        𝑦
                                                                             , 𝑦 < ∞, and the level of debt must satisfy
                                                            𝑡          1−𝛽
the transversality condition. Then, as consumption will be a linear function of expected wealth, ∃ 𝑐̅ < ∞ such that
                                                               1
𝑐𝑡𝑖 < 𝑐̅, ∀𝑡 ∀𝑖, which implies that we could restrict γ to 𝛾 < , ensuring that that the marginal utility of consumption
                                                              2 𝑐̅
is always positive.




                                                           19
where the individuals’ debt dynamics before the sunspot occurs are described by
                                     𝑖
the following expressions (assuming 𝑑−1 = 0 ∀𝑖):
                                                  𝑡                          𝑡−1

                                                𝑗=0                          𝑗=0


and
                                                  𝑡                          𝑡−1

                   𝑑𝑡𝐵 (𝒛𝑡 )   = (1 − 𝛽) � 𝐸𝑗 𝑃𝑊                𝐵 (𝑂)
                                                                         − � 𝑝𝑗 𝑏𝑗 − 𝜓𝑡𝐵 (𝑧𝑡 )𝑏𝑡
                                                𝑗=0                          𝑗=0


  Note that at time 0, given that the outstanding debt is zero and expected pseudo-
wealth is positive for both agents, 𝑐0𝑖 > 𝑦 ∀𝑖.

  As shown in Hall (1979), if the change in marginal utility from one period to
the next is small, under a quadratic utility function each individual’s consumption
path will be approximately described by a random walk. 11 In every period, the bet
winner (loser) will experience a positive (negative) wealth shock, and individual
consumptions adjust accordingly.



                                  C. Aggregate consumption and borrowing

Aggregate consumption is governed by the following expression:

            (AC)                   𝑐𝑡 (𝒛𝑡 ) = 𝑦 + (1 − 𝛽)[𝐸𝑡 𝑃𝑊(𝑧𝑡 ) − (1 + 𝑟)𝑑𝑡−1 (𝒛𝑡−1 )]

Aggregate outstanding debt is given by

            (AD)                              𝑑𝑡−1 (𝒛𝑡−1 ) = (1 − 𝛽) ∑𝑡−1
                                                                      𝑗=0 𝐸𝑗 𝑃𝑊(𝑧𝑗 )




  11   This requires that the level of consumption in period 𝑡 is sufficiently far from the bliss point 1/2𝛾.




                                                                20
Aggregate debt will be increasing over time until the sunspot occur, and will
decrease since then in order to satisfy the transversality condition.



                  IV.    Pseudo-wealth and consumption volatility

Proposition 2 shows that the disappearance of betting opportunities leads to a
discontinuous decrease in aggregate consumption. Therefore, the process of
creation and destruction of pseudo-wealth will increase the ex-post consumption
volatility with respect to the world in which betting is prohibited.



  Proposition 2: At 𝑧𝑡 = 𝑆, there is a discontinuous decrease in aggregate
consumption.

  Proof: It comes from (PW), (EW), and (AC).



  At the moment the sunspot occurs there will be a discontinuous decrease in
aggregate expected wealth due to the disappearance of pseudo-wealth.



  Corollary 1: Aggregate consumption will be lower after the sunspot the longer
it takes for the sunspot to occur.



  The longer it takes for the sunspot to occur, the larger will be the level of
aggregate debt when it occurs (cf. equation (AD)), hence the lower will be
aggregate consumption in every period after the sunspot—the economy will need
to generate a larger current account surplus to repay the larger external debt,
hence given the constant endowment, consumption will have to fall by more.




                                          21
  Corollary 2: Aggregate consumption volatility is larger when there exists a
market for bets.



  With no market for bets, 𝑐𝑡 = 2𝑦 ∀𝑡, hence 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑐𝑡 ) = 0. With the market for
bets, 𝑐𝑡 (𝑧𝑡 ) > 2𝑦 as far as expected pseudo-wealth is larger than outstanding debt
(which happens with certainty in 𝑡 = 0) or 𝑐𝑡 (𝑧𝑡 ) < 2𝑦 in the opposite case.

  Our next question of interest is if the above results imply that prohibiting bets
would be optimal. Addressing this welfare question requires a criterion for
dealing with heterogeneous beliefs.



  Definition 1 (Stiglitz, 1982). We say that beliefs satisfy group rationality if
  1 𝐴       1
  2
    𝜆    + 2 𝜆𝐵 = 𝜆

  where λ is the true probability of occurrence of sunspot.



Proposition 3: Suppose the planner computes welfare using average beliefs and
suppose beliefs satisfy group rationality. Then, under a utilitarian social welfare
function, the creation of a market for bets leads to a decrease in the expected
present value of welfare.

                                                                   ∞ 𝛽𝑡 𝑐 (𝑧 ) =
Proof: The planner’s intertemporal budget constraint at time 0 is ∑𝑡=0   𝑡  𝑡
 2𝑦
1−𝛽
    .   The planner’s optimal solution is 𝑐𝑡𝐴 (𝑧𝑡 ) = 𝑐𝑡𝐵 (𝑧𝑡 ) = 𝑦, 𝑐𝑡𝑃 (𝑧𝑡 ) = 𝑐𝑡𝐴 (𝑧𝑡 ) +

𝑐𝑡𝐵 (𝑧𝑡 ) = 2𝑦 ∀𝑡 ∀𝑧𝑡 . The creation of the market for bets leads to 𝑐𝑡 (𝑧𝑡 ) > 2𝑦
before 𝑧𝑡 = 𝑆, and 𝑐𝑡 (𝑧𝑡 ) < 2𝑦 afterwards. Group rationality and strict concavity
of 𝑢(⋅) imply the proposition.




                                               22
Proposition 3 establishes that prohibiting the bet can increase welfare from the
viewpoint of beliefs that are consistent in the aggregate—as it would be the case
of the beliefs of the planner that considers the true probability to be 𝜆, given by
definition 1. But such a prohibition would not increase ex-ante expected utility for
agents A and B given their beliefs—indeed, both agents would be strictly worse-
off ex-ante with the bet prohibition given their beliefs.

This proposition is a particular case of the case of “reasonable beliefs” –i.e.,
beliefs that are a convex combination of agents’ beliefs (see Brunnermeier,
Simsek, and Xiong (2014)). In fact, if the planner uses any convex combination of
the agents’ beliefs to compute welfare, there will always be a transfer between
agents such that from the viewpoint of the planner’s beliefs, it is optimal to
prohibit the bet and implement such a transfer. If the planner’s beliefs are closer
to the beliefs of agent A (or B), then the prohibition of the bet will be
accompanied by a transfer from B to A (or A to B) such that both agents are
weakly better-off from the viewpoint of the planner’s belief, with at least one
agent being strictly better-off.




                                   V.      Extensions

  Our results raise important questions regarding the effects of markets that allow
for speculation in a context of heterogeneous beliefs. We have assumed a very
simple environment of an endowment economy with two agents with the same
preferences that feature no precautionary savings effects. In spite of the simplicity
of the environment, we showed that the cycles of pseudo-wealth lead to
discontinuous changes in the control variables even when there are no changes in




                                           23
the state variables of the economy. However, this environment does not permit to
analyze other macroeconomic consequences of those discontinuous changes or
the distributional consequences that fluctuations in pseudo-wealth could imply.

  For example, different discount factors for agents A and B would affect the
dynamics of aggregate consumption. In particular, if agent A had a smaller
(larger) discount factor than agent B, the no occurrence of the sunspot would have
a contractionary (expansionary) effect on aggregate consumption, as it would
change the distribution of expected wealth in favor (against) of the agent with a
larger (smaller) marginal propensity to consume.

  More generally, fluctuations in pseudo-wealth can give rise to a variety of
richer effects in more complex environments. They could have macroeconomic
effects that go beyond an intertemporal misallocation of resources. Besides,
pseudo-wealth could also be negative. The rest of the section provides a set of
simple examples that show how the range of applicability of the pseudo-wealth
theory could be extended.


Example 1: Output fluctuations in a one sector production economy

 The first example considers a one sector economy where an internationally
tradable good is produced using only labor, and there are constant returns to scale:

𝑦𝑇,𝑡 = 𝑙𝑡

where 𝑦𝑇,𝑡 denotes the production of the tradable good that is sold at at the
international price, that is constant and that we assume is equal to 1, and 𝑙𝑡 is the
amount of labor employed, all in period 𝑡.

 The agents’ preferences are now defined over consumption of the single good
and leisure, according to 𝑈𝑡𝑖 = 𝑢�𝑐𝑡𝑖 � − 𝑣(1 − 𝑙𝑡𝑖 ), with −𝑣′ > 0, −𝑣′′ < 0.




                                          24
Workers receive a wage 𝑤𝑡 per unit of labor in period 𝑡. We assume there is
perfect competition in the production sector. Thus, in equilibrium 𝑤𝑡 = 1.

  The consumers-workers budget constraints are now
                            𝑖 (𝒛
        𝑐𝑡𝑖 (𝑧𝑡 ) + (1 + 𝑟)𝑑𝑡−1           𝑖    𝑖          𝑖       𝑖
                                 𝑡−1 ) = 𝑙𝑡 + 𝑑𝑡 (𝑧𝑡 ) + 𝜓𝑡 (𝑧𝑡 )𝑏𝑡 (𝑧𝑡 ) ∀𝑡 𝑖 = 𝐴, 𝐵

  The optimal choice of consumption and labor of the consumers-workers must
satisfy the conditions

𝑣′(1 − 𝑙𝑡𝑖 )
               =1
  𝑢′(𝑐𝑡𝑖 )
                   𝑖
𝑢′�𝑐𝑡𝑖 � = 𝐸𝑡𝑖 𝑢′(𝑐𝑡+1 )

  and
                           𝑖
𝑣′�1 − 𝑙𝑡𝑖 � = 𝐸𝑡𝑖 𝑣′(1 − 𝑙𝑡+1 )
                                                     2
  Maintaining the assumption 𝑢�𝑐𝑡𝑖 � = 𝑐𝑡𝑖 − 𝛾𝑐𝑡𝑖 , the creation of the market for
bets will still lead to an increase in the individuals’ and aggregate consumption,
but will also decrease the labor supply at the fixed wage; hence it will decrease
the level of employment and output in equilibrium. Following the realization of
the state 𝑆, the bet’s winner will decrease the labor supply and the loser will
increase it. The absolute size of the negative wealth shock for the loser is larger
than the absolute size of the positive wealth shock for the winner (the total
negative wealth shock is the destruction of aggregate pseudo-wealth). Thus,
destruction of pseudo-wealth will affect both the individuals’ and aggregate labor
supply: the level of employment and output will increase.

  As in RBC models, the labor supply will respond negatively to positive wealth
shocks (and vice versa) and this in turn will affect employment and output in
equilibrium. Under different assumptions, the sign of the changes could be




                                             25
different. But the general point of this example is that in a context of
heterogeneous beliefs in a production economy the creation of the betting market
will increase the volatility of output—that would be zero if betting were not
allowed.


Example 2: Distributional effects in a two-sectors production economy

  The example of this section describes an economic structure in which pseudo-
wealth fluctuations lead to fluctuations in the real economy and also have
distributional effects.

  We now assume that the economy has two sectors, one that produces a tradable
good and the other produces a non-tradable good. Production in both sectors
requires labor, but production in the tradable sector also requires a factor of
production that is in fixed supply, that can be interpreted as land. There is a
continuum of workers of mass 1: Half of them believe the probability of
occurrence of the sunspot in each period is 𝜆𝐴 and the other half believes it is 𝜆𝐵
(we refer to them as type A and type B workers, respectively). We assume perfect
labor mobility across sectors.

  The production function of the non-tradable good features decreasing returns to
scale:
                                            𝛼
                                    𝑦𝑁,𝑡 = 𝑙𝑁,𝑡

where 𝑙𝑁,𝑡 denotes labor in the non-tradable sector and 𝛼 ∈ (0,1). A fraction
(1 − 𝛼) of the production of the non-tradable good is kept (and consumed, not
traded) by an agent that is not explicitly modeled, that can be thought of as a




                                         26
manager or owner of the firm that produces the non-tradable good. 12 The rest is
traded domestically at a price 𝑝𝑁,𝑡 .

  The production function for the tradable good takes the Leontieff form,

                                               𝑦𝑇,𝑡 = min {𝑙 𝑇,𝑡 , 𝑋}

where 𝑙 𝑇,𝑡 denotes labor in the tradable sector and 𝑋 is a factor in fixed supply
owned by a capitalist that we assume it is a foreign agent that does not spend in
the domestic economy. Then, taking the price of the tradable good as the
numeraire,

                                                       𝑋,          𝑖𝑓 𝑤𝑡 ≤ 1
                                              𝐿𝑡 = � 0,            𝑖𝑓 𝑤𝑡 > 1

  The capitalist’s profit function is

                                             (1 − 𝑤𝑡 )𝑋,               𝑖𝑓 𝑤𝑡 ≤ 1
                                       𝛱𝑡 = �
                                                              0,       𝑖𝑓 𝑤𝑡 > 1

If 𝑤𝑡 < 1 there will be rents in the tradable sector.
                                                                     𝑖
  Suppose consumers-workers’ preferences are described by 𝑈𝑡𝑖 = 𝑢𝑇 �𝑐𝑇,𝑡 �+
     𝑖
𝑢𝑁 �𝑐𝑁,𝑡 � + 𝑣(1 − 𝑙𝑡𝑖 ), with 𝑢𝑘 ′ > 0, 𝑢𝑘 ′′ < 0, 𝑘 = 𝑇, 𝑁. Given that all workers
are identical in all dimensions but on the beliefs about the probability of
occurrence of the sunspot, they will all resolve an identical problem at the
moment the market for bets is created. Each worker offers an amount of labor 𝑙𝑡𝑖
in period 𝑡 and is randomly assigned to one of the two production sectors of the
economy, and every worker of the same beliefs-type works the same amount of
time independently of the sector where she is placed.

  The positive wealth shock implied by the creation of the market for bets will
raise the relative price of the non-tradable good and wages in equilibrium. 13 There

  12
       We make this assumption for simplicity. We just want to describe a situation where labor exhibits decreasing returns.




                                                              27
is a distributional effect between classes: the distribution of the production of the
tradable good changes in favor of the workers and against the capitalist (or
equivalently, the capitalist’s rent decreases). When the occurrence of the sunspot
destroys pseudo-wealth, the opposite effect will occur: as the aggregate labor
supply increases, wages will fall and rents will increase. And these distributional
effects could have richer macroeconomic effects in an environment that features
aggregate demand externalities. 14



Example 3: Negative pseudo-wealth

  Differences in priors could also lead to situations where there is negative
pseudo-wealth – situations where the sum of the perceived wealth of the members
of the society is smaller than the actual wealth capacity of the society. In turn,
negative pseudo-wealth could have negative consequences for the process of
creation of actual wealth. We will show a simple example that illustrates this
phenomenon. We previously showed that completing markets in a context of
heterogeneous beliefs could lead to creation of positive pseudo-wealth, that in
turn could increase consumption volatility, and that under a criterion for welfare
analysis that uses any measure of reasonable beliefs (as defined in Brunnermeier,
Simsek, and Xiong, 2014) it could even reduce welfare. Unlike that case, the
example that follows will show an environment with heterogeneous beliefs in


   13
      The vector of equilibrium prices in this dynamic small open economy must satisfy the Euler equations for the
consumption of the tradable good, the non-tradable good, and the time worked; it must satisfy the equalization between
                                                           −𝑣′            −𝑣′       𝑤𝑡             𝑢𝑇′        1
marginal rates of substitution and relative prices,              = 𝑤𝑡 ,         =          , and         =          ; it must satisfy the equilibrium
                                                           𝑢𝑇′            𝑢𝑁′       𝑝𝑁,𝑡           𝑢𝑁′       𝑝𝑁,𝑡
                                              1

condition in the labor market 𝑙𝑇,𝑡 + �        �    = ∫0 𝑙𝑡𝑖 𝑑𝑖; and it must satisfy the equilibrium condition of equalization of
                                         𝑤𝑡
demand for and supply of the non-tradable good. When the wealth effect dominates, the new equilibrium will feature
higher 𝑝𝑁,𝑡 and 𝑤𝑡 ; and as analyzed earlier the presence of pseudo-wealth will lead to external borrowing (in terms of
tradable goods) for satisfying the Euler equation for the consumption of the tradable good.
   14
      As workers had borrowed when the market for bets was created due to the presence of pseudo-wealth, the decrease in
wages will increase the value of real debts. This Fisher effect can amplify the real effects of the negative pseudo-wealth
shock, as discussed in Guzman and Stiglitz (2015b).




                                                                      28
which moving in the direction of complete markets could eliminate the negative
pseudo-wealth, enhancing efficiency and improving welfare.

 Suppose that an individual owns an asset that can be used for productive
purposes. The owner of the asset - agent X - will produce one unit of services if it
holds the asset, while another agent - agent Y - by holding the same asset would
produce 𝐴 units, 𝐴 > 1. Both agents are consumers of the services produced by
the asset. It is efficient that agent X rents the asset to agent Y and agent Y
employs it for production. Suppose that at the time of signing a rental contract
there is uncertainty about the market price of the services. Let’s assume that the
market price, 𝑝, may take two values: 𝑝 = {𝑝𝐿 , 𝑝𝐻 }, with 𝑝𝐿 < 𝑝𝐻 . Let 𝑅 denote
the rental cost. The values of agents X and Y’s utilities if the rental contract is
signed are denoted by 𝑉 𝑋 and 𝑉 𝑌 , respectively:

                                 𝑅                  𝑅
                     𝑉 𝑋 = 𝜆𝑋 𝑢 � 𝐻 � + (1 − 𝜆𝑋 )𝑢 � 𝐿 � − 𝑢(1)
                                 𝑝                  𝑝

                𝑌     𝑌
                       𝑝𝐻 𝐴 − 𝑅           𝑌
                                               𝑝𝐿 𝐴 − 𝑅
              𝑉 = 𝜆 𝑢�          � + (1 − 𝜆 )𝑢 �         � − 𝑢(0)
                          𝑝𝐻                      𝑝𝐿

where 𝑢′ (𝑥) > 0, 𝑥 ∈ ℝ, and 𝑢(1) and 𝑢(0) would be the utility levels of agents
X and Y in the absence of a rental contract.

 Let {𝑅} denote the set of fixed rental contracts that make both agents weakly
better off ex-ante, i.e. {𝑅} = {𝑅 ∈ ℝ≥0 : 𝑉 𝑋 (𝑅) ≥ 0 ∧ 𝑉 𝑌 (𝑅) ≥ 0}. We can show
that under a sufficiently large disagreement of beliefs there are conditions that
imply {𝑅} = ∅. To illustrate this case, suppose disagreement is maximum: 𝜆𝑋 = 1
and 𝜆𝑌 = 0. Then, agent Y will only sign a rental contract if 𝑅 ≤ 𝑝𝐿 𝐴. But if
𝑝𝐿
     𝐴 < 1, there will be no mutually beneficial contract. Agent’s X (expected and
𝑝𝐻

realized) wealth will be one unit of the service and agent’s B will be zero: the




                                          29
implication is that realized wealth will be below the society’s capacity of wealth
creation.

  Note that the likelihood that the set of feasible fixed rental contracts is empty
depends on the nature of the beliefs disagreement. If agents were optimistic about
their own upside states (𝑝𝐿 for agent X and 𝑝𝐻 for agent Y), there would be more
feasible fixed rental contracts. This result is related to Simsek (2013) that shows
that the nature of beliefs disagreements matters for economic outcomes. 15

  However, under this scenario of maximum beliefs disagreement there are
feasible contingent rent contracts: Any contingent contract 𝑅(𝑝) with 𝑅(𝑝𝐿 ) ∈
[𝑝𝐿 , 𝑝𝐿 𝐴] and 𝑅(𝑝𝐻 ) ∈ [𝑝𝐿 , 𝑝𝐿 𝐴] will be feasible. In this case, moving towards
the direction of complete markets will align rather than divorce the society’s
expectations of future wealth and the society’s potential wealth capacity.

  This example illustrated a simple situation where dispersion of beliefs may have
negative macroeconomic consequences, not through increases in speculative trade
but on the contrary because of a decrease in the cardinality of feasible
intertemporal contracts due to heterogeneous priors.

  The pseudo-wealth theory can be used to analyze other situations where
disagreement over events has negative macroeconomic effects. For example, in an
already established borrower-lender relationship, a shock to the economy that
creates dispersion of beliefs such that the lender becomes more pessimistic than
the borrower about the capacity of repayment of borrowings will create negative
pseudo-wealth: the lender will think he is receiving less (in expected terms) than
the borrower thinks he is paying. In turn, this will decrease the lender’s
consumption with no counteracting increase in the borrower’s consumption,


   15
      Simsek (2013) proves that the tightness of collateral constraints depends on the nature of belief disagreements.
Different than in this case, the relevant asset price effects occur when there is a bias in favor of the probability of upside
states because this relaxes collateral constraints.




                                                              30
implying a decrease in aggregate consumption. If later the borrower turns out to
be correct, the lender will experience a positive wealth shock, that will lead to an
increase in his consumption, again not counteracted by a change in the lender’s
consumption. In a richer environment these effects could further affect the state of
the macroeconomy. 16



                                                  VI.        Conclusions

  This paper has shown that, when there are differences in beliefs, the amounts
that betting individuals expect to receive from other individuals may differ
markedly from the amounts that these same individuals expect to pay. This
disparity in (the present discounted value of) expected transfer payments we refer
to as pseudo-wealth. We have noted that there can be large changes in the
aggregate value of pseudo-wealth, and that these changes in aggregate pseudo-
wealth can give rise to large fluctuations in consumption.

  Our analysis does not need to assume that there is a well-defined distribution of
probabilities that it is correct, or that such a distribution is known by the agents of
the economy. Our approach is reasonable when agents form beliefs over a one-
time event. As the “rare” event only happens one time there would be nothing to
learn from its no occurrence.

  Indeed, even after the event has occurred, we cannot be sure which of the two
individuals was “right.” And it is sensible to think that all individuals would not
share the same beliefs about the likelihood of these occurrences, that there is no


   16
      The macroeconomic effects would be richer in the presence of collateral constraints, and in an environment where
pseudo-wealth fluctuations led to fluctuations in the price of the asset that is used as collateral. Relatedly, Hirano, Inaba,
and Yanagawa (2015) show that in the presence of collateral constraints, policy interventions that make the emergence of
bubbles more likely and the bust of bubbles less likely may positively affect ex-ante production efficiency due to the
crowding in effect on investments that a bubble may have when collateral constraints are binding.




                                                              31
common knowledge. If agents don't share the same beliefs, then there is room for
a bet that increases pseudo-wealth.

 The theory of pseudo-wealth is complementary of other theories of
macroeconomic fluctuations, but generates a set of testable hypotheses that
distinguishes it from those other theories. For example, representative agent
models with learning can also feature aggregate wealth misperceptions that lead
to consumption booms followed by busts. However, by construction, fluctuations
in those models only occur at the aggregate level. Instead, the pseudo-wealth
theory predicts both increases in aggregate consumption volatility as well as
larger variance of consumption at the cross-section level.

 Unlike other theories of macroeconomic fluctuations, for the pseudo-wealth
theory of fluctuations what matters is the dispersion of beliefs rather than average
beliefs: Any changes in average beliefs would be irrelevant in our model. Besides,
unlike other complementary theories, in the theory of pseudo-wealth the
distribution of the individuals’ consumption will change in every period before
the rare event occurs even if there are no changes in the dispersion of beliefs or in
average beliefs from one period to another. This occurs because in every period in
which betting occurs there will be a winner and a loser, and betting will continue
occurring as long as disagreement persists.

 The relevant population of economic agents for empirical tests will in general
be different for different situations in which pseudo-wealth can be created. For
example, in the case of trade in speculative assets, it is likely that the relevant
population will consist of the wealthiest households that have an easier access to
those markets. But we have noted that the model can be extended in directions
such that the waves of creation and destruction of pseudo-wealth can also have
macroeconomic effects that could affect the population that in principle did not
participate in either the pseudo-wealth creation or destruction processes.

  This paper is the first step of a research agenda that intends to offer a general
framework for understanding situations in which large changes in macroeconomic
behavior are observed together with no (or very small) changes in the state
variables describing the economy. The dynamics of pseudo-wealth—its
formation, dissolution, and its aggregate persistence both positively and
negatively—help explain macroeconomic volatility and gives insight into the
nature of persistent booms and busts —a fact still not fully explained by the
existing literature.
