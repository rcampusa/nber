              Research and Development, Utilization and Labor
                     Requirements: A Dynamic Analysis


                                  ABSTRTiCT


        In   this study we have developed a dynamic analysis of a firm

undertaking     plant and equipment and research and development investment,

along with labor requirement and P&E utilization decisions. It is shown

that in the short run increases in R&D cause the utilization rate of

plant   and   equipment to rise   and to decrease demand for labor per unit
of R&D. We distinguish between the effects of the stock of R&D and the

investment     flow. The short run effect of changes in the stock. of R&D

on labor demand are quite distinct from the behavior observed along

the intertemporal path. Along the path increases in the R&D investment

rate must be accompanied by an increase in the labor requirement per unit

of R&D. Contrary to a viewpoint held by many, the R&D investment flow

does not displace labor. Finally, our model provides a framework to

justify the empirically observed positive relationship between the

utilization and the P&E investment rates.

1.   Introduction

      By its very nature research and development (R&D) alters the level

and composition of the outputs supplied and inputs demanded by finns.

The empirical work of Edward Denison [1974], Dale Jorgenson and Zvi

Griliches [1967], John Kendrick [1973] and M. Ishaq Nadiri and Sherwin

Rosen [1973] has characterized how technological change has been a

significant element to output growth. Moreover, studies documented by

Edwin Mansfield [1972] have come to the conclusion that research and

development has been a major determinant of technical progress.

      The dynamic theory of investment by firms often ignores the

important interplay, both in the short run and intertemporally, between

the decisions to accumulate technical knowledge, to utilize and invest

in plant and equipment and to hire labor. A major stumbling block has

been that the only variable in4ut is generally.labor,..while plant and

equipment utilization is costlessly altered. This structure implies

that changes in the level of research and development only affect factor

proportions through changes in labor requirements, but not through

the utilization of plant and equipment.

     In a static framework Paul Taubrt'an and Maurice wilkinson [19701,

Robert Lucas [1970] and Gordon Winston and Thomas McCoy [1974] analyzed

the role of factor utilization which increases both output and input prices.

Recently Andrew Abel [1981] developed a dynamic model where labor utiliza-

tion is costly and instantaneously determined, while labor and capital are

quasi—fixed factors. In this paper we develop a dynamic analysis of the

determinants of labor requirements and capital utilization at any point in

time given the stocks of both R&D and plant and equipment (P&E) capital.

The firm alters the level of these stocks through their investment decisions,
                                                                            £




one pertaining to the standard P&E and the other to R&D.

      In our model we explicitly recognize the dual nature of R&D. As a

flow variable, the investment is part of the short run equilibrium, while

as a stock, its level governs the dynamic path of the firm. In the short

run we establish that increases in the stock of R&D relative to the stock

of P&E increase the rate of physical capital utilization and decrease the

requirements of labor per unit of the stock of knowledge. Thus the firm

becomes less labor intensive in the sense that the rate of P&E

utilization increases at the expense of labor in R&D intensive form.

      The dynamic path exhibits some interesting properties. First as

the stock of P&E relative to the stock of R&D rises towards its steady

state value, the P&E growth rate decreases.      This result occurs due

to the presence of convex acjustment costs. When lie stock is too low

relative to the long run magnitude, the marginal adjustment costs are too

high. This implies that the P&E growth rate falls towards its steady

state rate. Simultaneously, as the stock rises, there is an easing of

the pressure on the rate of P&E utilization and therefore over time it

also decreases. Thus we find that along the dynamic path the P&E

growth and utilization rates are positively correlated.

      Second, as the stock of P&E relative to the stock of R&D rises,

the R&D growth rate increases, because the demand price is too low

relative to its steady state value. Combining this conclusion, with

the short run result that the expansion of P&E relative

to R&D displaces labor per unit of R&D, implies that along the dynamic

path R&D investment an labor are positively correlated.
                                                                                    3



      We develop the structure of the model and the short run equilibrium

properties in Section 2. Section 3 is devoted to the dynamic path and

steady state characteristics. In Section 4 some comparative long run

results are discussed and then we conclude.



2. The Nodel

      In order to model the role of R&D and, its interaction with the

other two factors of production, plant and equipment services and labor

services, we assume that the firm's production process is represented as


             y(t) =
(1)
                       F[(t)Kp(t)Kr(t)L(t)]
where y(t) is output, F is the twice continuously differentiable

production function, (t) is the index of P&E utilization, K(t) is

the stock of P&E, K(t) is the stock of R&D and L(t) Is labor services.

All variables are evaluated at time t.1 The marginal products are

positive and diminishing for each of the factors.

      The physical capital utilization rate can be thought of as an index

of plant and equipment usage at each time period. In our model, the

stocks of P&E and R&D are quasi—fixed factors while labor requirements

and the P&E utilization rate are variable in the short run.

      R&D essentially affects the production process in two ways. First

it alters the nature of the factors of production. Indeed it seems

appropriate to view the services of plant and equipment and labor in

relation to the existing stock of knowledge. This implies that it is

k(t) =   Kp(t)IKr(t)
                       and 9,(t) =   L(t)IK   (t), along with the P&E utilization

rate which governs production.
                                                                                  4



        S )nd, if the technology exhibits constant returns to scale, then

knowledge, as well as physical capital and labor services, must all

increase by the same proportion in order to generate an equal percentage

increase in output. Thus if the stock of knowledge is fixed, we would

expect diminishing returns to the two other factors of production (K
                                                                              p
and L). We can incorporate these stylized facts by assuming that the

production function, F, is homogeneous of degree 1 in (t)K(t), K(t)

and L(t). Hence


              y(t) =
(2)
                       Kr(t)f[(t)kp(t)i(t)1•
       The endogeneity of the P&E utilization rate permits physical capital

to be operated at various times. Clearly labor prefers, certain times

to others, as the major portion of factories and machines are operated

in the daytime and during the week. Thus' in 6rder' t&'attract workers to

overtime, night arid weekend shifts, a premium wage rate must be paid. The

wage rate in our model consists of two components, the fixed scale or

basic rate, s, and the premium rate, w(B), which is an increasing convex

function of the P&E utilization rate.

       The flow of funds for the firm is


(3)           F py — su()L     —   C(I/K)I       —   E(I/K)I
where p is the fixed product price.3 The costs of installing

additional P&E is C with C' >      0,   C" >   0 for I > 0, C   C' = 0
                                                     p
for I = 0.     The costs of developing additional R&D is E with E' >     0,
E" >   Oforl>O,        E=E' =Oforl=O.4
       In this model themajor difference between the stocks 'of P&E and

R&D is that there are two costs associated with P&E; utilization [w(8)]

and installation [C(I/K)]. However, with respect tO R&D, there are
                                                                                                    5




only development costs associated with additions to the stock of

knowledge [E(I/K)I]. Once the stock of knowledge exists there are

zero costs associated with its utilization.

        Knowledge and physical capital are accumulated by

rate of R&D observance.

        The firm desires to maximize the present value of the flow of funds,

which is discounted at the constant rate r, subject to equations (2),

(4) and (5). In order to fulfill the objective, the firm selects P&E

utilization, labor and investment while K , K and the associated

There are also the transversality conditions and the Legendre—Clebsch

conditions, which state that the matrix of second order derivatives of

the control variables is negative definite.

        The short run equilibrium of the firm is denoted by (7.1) —                 (7.4),
that is, given the capital st,cks and the..investment.,,emand prices

(q1 and q2) we can determine the derived demand for labor, the P&E

utilization rate and investment per capital stock for both P&E and R&D.

        The determination of labor requirements and utilization is

simultaneous. In addition, the firm does not determine labor demand,

but rather labor relative to R&D. In other words labor in R&D intensive

form is the relevant measure at each time periods To see this divide

(7.2) by K, then pf1k —                sw'i   =   0.   The latter equation and (7.1) can

be solved for i =        (k,s/p),             =   B(k,s/p).    R&D intensive labor and the

P&E utilization rate depend on the R&D intensive stock of P&E and the

real scale wage rate.

        Combining equations (7.1) and (7.2),


(8)          e   = e/e
                                                                                            7




where 0         3/u is the utilization elasticity of the labor costs.

      ting that the labor elasticity of the labor costs is unity, equation

 8) illustrates, in the short run, that the ratio of cost elasticities

equals the ratio of revenue elasticities. If the labor elasticity of

revenue exceeds that for utilization, then the utilization elasticity

of costs is less than unity. The firm, in this situation, operates on

the inelastic portion of the premium rate. For the firm to operate on

the elastic segment, we must have             e >   e.6
         We are interested in establishing the response of labor requirements

and P&E utilization to changes in the capital stocks and the scale real

wage. If the stock of P&E in R&D intensive form increases, the effect

on the utilization rate is

                          2                          2

The Legendre—Clebsch conditions imply that net operating revenues in

R&D intensive form IT/K =                     — sw(13)2. is strictly concave in 13 and
                                pf(13k132,)
9..    Hence the Hessian determinant (fI) in equation (9) is positive.

         In addition, sufficient conditions for ft >             0 (besides w" > 0)   are

e <      min(—.1,   0), and e < 1          + min(e2,9.,e9.2,/0). The former condition

means that the marginal product of P&E utilization must diminish in

sufficient magnitude as 13 rises, while the latter condition implies that

the same marginal product must be limited in its increase as 2. rises.

         Another way to interpret these two conditions can be obtained from

equation (7.2). We see the difference between the value of the marginal

product and the marginal input cost for utilization depends on 13 and Z.
                                                                                         8



The restricLion on e guarantees that the difference decreases as

i creases and the restriction on e8 ensures that the difference

decreases as      increases. Clearly, with these two conditions, the right

3ide of (9) is negative. As k expands, because of the change in the

marginal product of P&E utilization, two effects are initiated. The

first can be termed the "own effect." The larger k causes the value of
                                                 p
the marginal product of utilization to diminish such that it is now below

the marginal input cost of utilization. The second effect (the "cross

effect") emanates from the fact that the value of the marginal product

of labor is now below the respective marginal input cost. In order to

restore equilibrium, the P&E utilization rate must decrease.

         The decrease in the rate of utilization, which decreases the wage

bill at each unit of labor services, and the increase in marginal product

of labor from an expansion of'k, causelaboritfR&T intensive form to

rise. This is seen from



                   =             2

                           [pf11k                       (e +


Hence as k decreases the firm becomes less labor intensive in the short
             p
run. This result occurs, not in the usual sense of changing the plant

and equipment to labor ratio, but rather, because the ratio of the

utilization rate to labor in R&D intensive form rises. As R&D expands

relative to P&E, labor relative to R&D falls and the utilization rate

rises.

         The scale real wage also creates a divergence in the magnitudes

of employment and utiliation. In our context an increase in the basic
                                                                                                         9




real wage s,         leads to a decrease in labor requirements and an increase

Ir P&E utilization. Differentiating (7.1) and (7.2) with respect to s/p

found in ould [1968], Lucas [1967] and Treadway [1969]. The investment

decisions illustrate the intertemporal link as the investment—capital

ratios depend on the demand prices, which are equal to the present value

of the rentals accruing to units of the capital stocks installed at time t

but brought into service over the remaining time horizon.



3. Dynamics and the Steady State

         Given the short run solution we are now in a position to analyze

the intertemporal path of the firm and the steady state equilibrium.

Substituting equations (13.1), (13.2), (14) and (15) into (7.5) —      (7.8)
yields    the dynamic behavior as

(16)            Kr/K = J(q1)      —

                             [3(q2)][J(q2)]
        Let   us proceed by first analyzing the intertemporal paths of the

capital stocks. Clearly, from (16) and (17) the rate of growth of P&E

and    R&D depend only on their respective demand   prices and depreciation
                                                                                        11



rates.     Tence, by noting that k =          k(K/K   —
                                                          Kr/Kr)   we can combine

 (16) and (17) into a single equation illustrating the evolution of the

ratio of the capital stocks. This mean that changes in k depend on


q1 and q2, such that            =   k3   >   0 and    = — kD3      < 0 (for k >   0).

Therefore, with k = 0 we have a locus in (q2,q1) space (see Figure 1)

which is positively sloped, since


              dq           3'

                    k=0
                    p


The k = 0 curve shows us that in order to maintain the equality between
       p
the growth rates for plant and equipment and research and development

both investment demand prices must rise thereby generating Increases in

investment rates for both types of capital. Moreover, if the demand

price of P&E (q1) is above that defined by the k = 0 locus for any

value of q2, then the P&E investment rate outruns the rate for R&D, causing

k > 0.     The converse occurs for values of q below the k = 0 curve.
 p                                          2                         p
       Turning to the price equations [(18) and (19)] we find that

changes in the prices over time are governed by the difference between

the net marginal input cost and the value of the marginal product. In

terms of plant and equipment, the net marginal input cost is (r +

minus the reduction in adjustment cost from increasing K which is

C'(I/K)2, while the value of the marginal product is pf18. Clearly,

if the net marginal input cost exceeds the value of the marginal product,

then in order for the firm to remain in short run equilibrium, there

must be a capital gain on the asset. Thus an increase in the price of a

a capital gain accrues to the firm. From equation (18),

since the rates of growth of both types of capital must be less than

the discount rates in order for the present value of the flow of funds

to be finite.

        The effect of an increase in the P&E to R&D ratio is

In addition, the production function [f(k,23] is strictly concave in

concave in these two variables. Thus the Hessian, with respect to 8, £

            A similar set of results holds for the demand price of R&D. We


find that       -       r   + n — I /K > 0 when the evaluation is at q = 0 =

                p2

firm. Thus, we find a locus q2 = 0 which is positively sloped in (k,q2)

space in Figure 1, with points above the curve defining q2 > 0 and below

q2 <   0.
            Using the four quadrant technique developed by Abel [19811 we can

characterize the steady state solution (k = 0 =                                q2) for the firm
                                                                          q1
                                                                                       t5



 from (Figu 1) at (ke,q,q). There exists a unique steady state which
  3   a saddle point. The steady state values are denoted by the formation

 of the rectangle and the dynamic paths are monotonic and illustrated in

 (k,q1) and (k,q2) spaces.9 Although the graphical nature of the steady

state is similar to Abel [1981], the path to long run equilibrium is

quite distinct.

         From Figure 1 we cancharacterize the nature of the path that the

firm follows to the steady state. The paths of k, q1 and q2 are

illustrated in the northwest and southeast quadrants.              Suppose that
k < ke;       then we find q1 >
                                  q and q2 < q.        From the results on the

dependence of utilization, labor and investment demand [equations (13) —

(15)],    B > Be,    <       /K

plant and equipment in R&D intensive terms is below its steady state

solution then P&E utilizationaj-id growth ratearé a&ve, while labor

per unit of R&D and the R&D growth rate are below their respective

long run solutions.
                                    e
         Intuitively, when k < k      ,   in   order for this ratio to increase, the
                             p      p
firm   must   be investing in P&E at a higher rate and investing in R&D at a

lower rate than necessary to sustain the steady state.             Simultaneously,
the existing P&E is utilized excessively. This means that the P&E

utilization rate is above its long run level because the firm            is   forced

to "squeeze" production into the smaller stock. Moreover, because there

is a smaller stock of P&E to R&D, there is less of a need for labor and

consequently labor to R&D requirements are below their steady state level.

The converse arises when k > ke.

      In   r model, the physical capital utilization and growth rates

are positively correlated over time, while labor and R&D investment

per unit of the stock of knowle6ge both move in the sante direction. These

results seem quite significant. First, the stylized facts (see Foss [1981] )are

that when the P&E utilization rate rises, the investment rate must rise in

order to ease the pressure on the stock. Clearly, we have provided a

framework which establishes this relationship.

      This result is the opposite to that found in Abel [1981] and it

illustrates a major difference in the treatment of utilization. Abel

does not deal with the problem of R&D, and he treats labor as a quasi—

fixed factor. In his framework, capital utilization directly depends

on labor utilization, and it is only the latter which is costly to use.

Consequently, with increases in labor decreasing the value of the

marginal product of labor utilization, the firm must decrease the

utilization rate in order to restore short run equilibrium. Therefore,

labor utilization and capital utilization (since it is directly dependent

on the former) increase as the capital—labor ratio rises. There is a

negative correlation between the utilization and the investment rate.

This result turns on the assumption that only labor utilization is costly.

      In our context labor is a variable factor and therefore is costly

to use. Indeed, the marginal input cost is sw. However, the crucial

element is that P&E is also costly to use. In fact, the marginal input

cost, which is sw'L, manifests itself in a higher wage bill.

     The second major conclusion concerning the nature of the dynamic

path is that labor in R&D intensive form and the R&D growth rate are

positively correlated. This result means that as the ratio of labor
                                                                           17




to the stoc. of R&D rises, workers have insufficient knowledge and thus

the R&D growth rate must rise accordingly. Recall that in the short

run if R&D expands relative to P&E then labor in R&D intensive form

 'ecrases. This conclusion arises only if the intertemporal dimension

is ignored. In a dynamic setting the stock of knowledge is not given to

the firm but it is endogenously accumulated. Indeed, it is the rising

R&D growth rate which allows labor requirements to grow relative to

the stock of knowledge. Hence we can characterize the rising P&E

investment rate as P&E utilizing and the rising R&D investment rate as
               10
labor using.



4. Comparative Steady States

      In this section we consider the effects of changes in the discount

rate, depreciation rates and te product' 'price on thelong run

equilibrium.

      Suppose. that the discount rate increases. From equations (18) and

(19) we observe that the marginal input costs of P&E and R&D increase.

Thus, at the original steady state, in order to maintain q1 =    = 0
                                                              q2
the investment demand prices must fall,'thereby lowering marginal input

costs to their original levels. However, as both q1 and q2 decrease, k

responds in an ambiguous fashion because both investment—capital ratios

are declining. Therefore, the impact 'on k is unknown and consequently

the actual magnitude of the changes in q1 and q2 are not exactly

proportional to the change in the discount rate. These results can be

derived by combining equations (16) and (17) and differentiating the

three resulting long run equilibrium conditions to yield
                                                                                              18

ambiguous and depends on the relative responsiveness of the investment—

capital ratios to their respective demand prices.11

        Next suppose that there is an autonomous change in the depreciation

rate on research and development; that is, knowledge becomes obsolete

at a faster rate. In this instance there is a shift towards the capital

stock with the relative increase in its life, which means that the plant

and equipment to research and development capftal rato rises. The

increase in k lowers the value of the marginal product for P&E,

therefore the demand price (q1) must fall in order to bring into line

the marginal input cost. Lastly, for this experiment, the demand price

for R&D is subject to two opposing forces. The Increase In r at the

initial k causes q2 to diminish to retain the constancy of the marginal

input cost to the unchanged value of the marginal product of R&D.

However, as k rises the value of the marginal product of R&D increases

and this shifts the burden of adjustment away from the price and onto

the stock. Formally,

       The final change we consider is the effect of an increase in the

product price. By inspection the capital accumulation equations [(16)

and (17)] are not directly affected by the product price. However, from

the investment demand price equations



               aq    =
(26)                      — f1 + 2sf1f12/p + B2sf1(e + 1)/p < 0

                                  2


Some ambiguity arises in this situation as                                0. However, since
                                                                 -i----

f222. + f12k <       0,   then if an.ncrease in. the...scale real wage

sufficiently reduces the labor to R&D rate and does not materially

increase the P&E utilization rate (i.e., the own effect dominates the


cross effect) then there is a presumption that                             <   0.
       Using the results from (26) and (27) and differentiating the

dynamic equations with respect to p yields

If      > 0   then            >   0.        If the increases in the product price cause

R&D to grow relatively more than P&E, then the marginal input cost

exceeds the value of the marginal product for R&D and a capital gain must

accrue to the firm (i.e.,                     increases). Noreover, with the larger k,

we deduce from the short run demand functions that the firm decreases

the utilization rate while increasing labor per unit of R&D capital.

product price elicit ambiguous results. The knife edge case (                       =   0)
where ambiguity ceases illustrates that increases in the product price

lead to a smaller steady state value of                   and larger steady state value

dynamic path two direct relationships exist. The first is between the

utilization and the P&E growth rates and the second relates the ratio

of labor to R&D and the R&D growth rate. The fact that with a

higher price the ultimate value of                   may be smaller and the ultimate

value of I/Kg larger, only informs us about the characteristic of the

steady state.



5.     Conclusion

        In this paper we have developed a dynamic analysis of a firm

undertcing plant and equipment and research and development investment,

along with labor requirement and P&E utilization decisions. We have

established that in the short run increases in R&D cause the firm to

increase the P&E utilization rate while decreasing its demand for labor

per unit of R&D. In addition, increases in the real scale wage rate
cause the firm to substitute physical capital utilization for labor.

      The dynamic path of the firm was characterized as one where the

utilization and investment rates for plant and equipment are positively

related, while investment in R&D and labor per unit of R&D are similarly

related. The latter conclusion illustrates the importance of

distinguishing between the stock of R&D and the investment flow. The

short run effect of changes in the fixed stock of R&D on labor demand

are quite distinct from the behavior observed along the intertemporal

path. Along the path increases in the R&D investment rate must be

accompanied by an increase in the labor requirement per unit of R&D.

Contrary to a viewpoint held by many, the R&D investment flow does not

displace labor. Finally, the direct relationship between the utilization.

and the P&E investment rates illustrates that our framework can be used

to justify this empirical observation.

         1 We can easily generalize our results to allow a variable

utilization rate on R&D. Suppose this rate is y and y =                               > 0,
(0) = 0. In the paper r' = 0 and y is normalized to unity.

In equation (1) the utilization elasticity of output equals the

P&E elasticity of output, as in.Nadiri and Rosen [19691.

         2.   The function ()          is   the premium tage function found in

Lucas [1970]. It is designed to capture the rising labor payment as

the hours the P&E is operated moves from the most to the least attractive.

         3. We delete the variable (t)               for   notational simplicity. The

results in this paper also hold when the firm is a monopolist in the

product market, with the inverse product demand function p =                     D(y),   D' <   0.
         4. Adjustment costs are by now quIte standard; see Lucas [1969],

Mussa [1977], Treadway [1970].

         5. We define         e =   f1k/f    >   0 as the utilization elasticity of

output and e =                      as the labor elasticity of output. In addition,
                     f22./f>0
e    =
         f11k/f1     <       0, e, = f229/f2     <   0 and
                                                             e2
                                                                  =
                                                                      f12i/f1.
         6. In Abel [1981] the firm must operate on the elastic portion of

the function             w() because (using our context) the production function

is   =                          If f is homogeneous of degree 1 then             =
                                                                                     Krf(kp9)•
Thus, utilization affects output in proportion to output obtained from

the full utilization of the capta1 stocks [Krf(kpi)l This implies

that the utilization elasticity of revenue is unity and so equation (8)

becomes e      lie       >   1, since e > 1.         The firm in this case must operate

o: the elastic portion of the premium rate. The production function in

our model allows for a variable utilization elasticity of production and

thereby also for revenue.

      7. We now introduce the usual assumption that f12 > 0.                    An

increase in k increases the marginal product of labor. Therefore,

e89; >0.
      8.   We ignore the fact that              can be nonpositive where k             0.
                                          3q1                             p

      9. The revelant boundary conditions on the production function

prevent ke (the steady state soLution) and thereby q and q from being

either 0 or .

     10.   We see the importance of a dynamic formulation of the R&D

decision. In a static framework we would not be able to distinguish

between the stock of R&D and the investment flow.
