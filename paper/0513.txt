                  Market Wages, Reservation Wages, and
                          Retirement Decisions


                                  ABSTRACT


     The paper is an empirical cross-section of the retirement decisions

of American white men between the ages of 58 and 67, predicated on the

theoretical notion that an individual retires when his reservation wage

exceeds his market wage.   Reservation wages are derived from an explicit

utility function in which the most critical taste parameter is assumed

to vary both systematically and randomly across individuals.      Market

wages are derived from a standard wage equation adjusted to the special

circumstances of older workers.

     The two equations are estimated jointly by maximum likelihood, which

takes into account the potential selectivity bias inherent in the model

(low-wage individuals tend to retire and cease reporting their market

wage).   The model is reasonably successful in predicting retirement decisions

and casts serious doubt on previous claims that the social security system

induces many workers to retire earlier than they otherwise would.      The normal

effects of aging (on both market and reservation wages) and the incentives

set up by private pension plans are estimated to be major causes of retirement.

1.   Introduction and preview

     Why do people retire?       This question is now attracting

. increasing attention because of recent and proposed changes

in the minimum age of mandatory retirement and because of the

likelihood that the social security system will be in need of

major structural overhaul in the coming years.        It is clear that

labor force participation rates among older men are declining

quite rapidly.    The reasons behind this trend are less clear.
     We can enumerate five basic classes of reasons why older

people retire from the labor force.       First, failing health in

old age may make work much more difficult, or less remunerative

if wages decline as a result of ill health.       Second, advancing

Third;-it has been suggested that the social security system

sets up powerful incentives.that induce people to retire earlier
                             2
than they otherwise would.        Fourth, private pension arrangements

may offer similar financial incentives for retirement.         Fifth,

as people age their preferences may shift in favor of leisure

and against work.    Our purpose in this paper is to estimate the

relative importance of each of these competing hypotheses--

health, wages, social security, private pensions, and tastes--

in explaining retirement decisions, and to see which (if any)


     lThat is, even for individuals whose health is average
for their age.

                                                                   2.


      can explain the trend toward earlier retirement.

           Healhh=     It is by now well documented that, when retirees

      are asked to explain their actions, ill health is the most common

      explanation of retirement. 3    Our estimates find a substantia 1,

      though not overwhelming, effect of ill health.     However, effects

      of health on retirement age will not explain the trend in

      retirement age since health improvements over time would imply

      an increase, not a decrease, in retirement ages.

           Wages.    When or if an individual chooses to retire depends

      critically on the life-cycle pattern of wages. 4    There is some

      controversy in the human capital literature over whether age

      ~~ ~   has a depressing effect on wages.     By using an econometric

      co~rection    for selectivity bias, we uncover evidence here that

      it does~     But a concave age-wage profile can explain an

      increasi~  propensity to retire only if it shifts in a manner
                                                  tentative
      that is unfavorable to older workers. We find/evidence that

      this has happened, too.

           Social Security.     The net wage late in life can decline

      either because the q~ wage falls (as just suggested) or

      because the tax-and-transfer wedge between gross and net wages

      increases.     Many people have thought that the social security

      system--and particularly the earnings test--causes such an effect

      by placing a heavy tax on work effort late in life.     We doubt

      that this explanation of retirement makes sense, and have designed

      our research program accordingly.    The reasons for our skepticism




          'For a summary, see Campbell and Campbell (1976).
                                                                    3·
merit some explanation.'

      Many observers have pointed out that the social security

law creates a complex multi-armed budget constraint for eligible

individuals. 6    Though labor supply decisions are distorted by
social security, perhaps substantially, it is most unlikely that

social security sets up strong incentives to        reti~--that   is, to

reduce hours of work to zero--because:

      1.   a small amount of earnings (currently %3,000 per year)

is allowed before the earnings test is applied.          Hence, in the

neighborhood of zero hours of work, the marginal tax rate
                    <


implicit in the social security system is zero.

      2.   current earnings have a potentially important effect on

future social    securi~y   benefits.   We have shown elsewhere that

under plausible circumstances this effect can amount to approxi-

mately a 50% wage subs idy and might well discourage people

from retiring ..(Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1980a»

      3.   individuals who opt not to begin collecting social security
benefits at age 62 earn an upward adjustment in their potential
benefits at age 65 that often provides more than actuarially fair
compensation.     (Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1980a ) •.')

      Consequently, we decided to concentrate our initial efforts

on   reti~ment   decisions, not labor    suool~   decisions in general,

leaving the more difficult, but worthwhile, extension to hours

of work to future" research. 7     Our basic model of retirement

     assumes that social security is irrelevant to retirement decisions.

     As a check on this, however, we append a few variables designed

     to "pick up" any social_ security effects that may have been

     overlooked.   In general, these variables achieve statistical

     significance, but are of little empirical importance.

          It hardly needs pointing out that if social security has

     little effect on retirement decisions, the growth of the social

     security system cannot explain the       ~rend   toward retirement--

     frequent claims to the contrary notwithstanding.

          Private Pensions.   The story is rather different, however,
                                          8
     when we consider private pensions.        First of all, many private

     pension plans include a provision for mandatory retirement at

     a prescribed age [Skolnik (1976)].        In such cases, the incentive

     to refire is fairly obvious: -a compulsory change in jobs may

     occasion a loss of wages so severe that the worker prefers to

     retire rather than take a job at a much reduced wage.          One goal

     of our model is to estimate this wage loss, and we find it to

     be very substantial.

          The effect of private pensions in the absence of mandatory

     retirement is more subtle, but may be quite powerful nonetheless.

     Once the age of eligibility for the pension arrives,.a worker

     who continues to work reduces the discounted present value of

     his pension benefits if he remains on the job because his future

     and Wise (1978), especially Chapters I and II.

annual rate of benefits is rarely adjusted upward.                         Thus if        w
is his annual wage and         b        is his annual pension benefit, the

marginal return to a year of work drops from                      w   to   w-b   at

the age of eligibility for the pension.                      Furthermore, many

private pension plans create a bonus for early retirement by

failing to adjust the annual pension benefit downward by the full

actuarial amount if the worker elects to retire early.9                          Our

estimates suggest a 'very strong effect of a private pension on

the retirement decision.               Since private pension plans have

grown so explosively during the postwar period, this factor can

      The plan of the paper is as follows.                     The next section

discusses our theoretical model of retirement decisions, and the

following section briefly describes the data source and estimation

technique.     Sections 4 and 5; the heart of the paper, flesh

out the details of our precise econometric specifications of a

market wage equation and a reservation wage equation respectively,

and also present and interpret the estimated coefficients.                             The

model, however, is sufficiently nonlinear and complicated that

the coefficient estimates do not "speak for themselves."                          Thus

Section 6 is devoted to analyzing the implications of our

estimates for retirement decisions.                Section 7 concludes the


      9 see Skolnik (1976), especially pp. 8-9.

      lOIn a broad sense, these effects of private pensions can
perhaps be considered indirect effects of social security since
it is probably the social security system that singled out age
65 as the standard age for pension eligibility and/or mandatory
retirement.

~   A Model of the Retirement Decision

        If we are to model retirement decisions, we must first

settle on a definition of retirement--a concept that is not

nearly so unambiguous as it may sound.          In this paper, we define

retirement    ~n   .the most straightforward possible way:    as zero

hours of work for money •. We note, however, that some other
                                                      I



authors have preferred alternative definitions. ll

        Our model of retirement is simple.       Indifference curves

between leisure and income      s~ift   naturally over time due to the

aging process, and also due to changes in health.          Similarly,

the market wage changes over time because of age, experience,

and 6tner reasons.       At some point for some people there comes

an age (the age of retirement) at which the highest indifference

curve is reached at a corner solution with zero hours of work,

as depicted in Figure 1.       Notice in Figure 1 that the shape of

the budget line far away from zero hours of work probably has

crucial bearing on the choice of optimal hours for those who

are not retired.


        Ilsee, for example, Boskin      (1977) or Reimers (1977).
     12 There is one important exception to this. If the budget
set is extremely convex--for example because current earnings
have a large positive effect on future social security benefits--
the shape of the budget line at high hours of work could influence
the retirement decisions of some people. This effect would
induce these people to stay in the labor force, not to retire.
For more on this, see Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1980 a ).
                                                                            1.


        To express these simple intuitive notions in a way that

lends itself to econometric work, let the market wage available

to individual            i at     date   t    be described by a "wage equation"

of the form:


                                                                           (1)


where       w     is the wage,       X   is a vector of characteristics relevant

to wages, - ~           is a vector of coefficients in the wage equation,

and     €       is a normally distributed error term. 13

        To derive the reservation wage, consider the following

utility maximization model of labor-leisure choice.                  Each
individual lives for three periods: the "Past," the "present,"

and the "future."               These will be denoted periods 0, 1, and 2

respectively, and assumed to have lengths (measured in years)

                2
periods (bequests are ignored, but can easily be allowed for)

and     L.1.    denote the fraction of each period spent at leisure,

the utility function to be maximized is assumed to be:




where             and           are subjective discount factors.         Ignoring

human capital formation and assuming perfect capital markets,

the only relevant constraint is the lifetime budget constraint:

        Each of the terms in (9) merits consideration.                 The first

in all life-cycle models.       Written out explicitly, it is:




The interpretation is clearest if the annual interest and time

discount rates are approximately constant and equal to            rand      p

respectively, for then this term is (r-p)A, where         A     is age.

If   p is low (high) relative to r, the individual prefers to

postpone leisurE{, i.e., the r.eservation\'Bge rises (falls) with
age. The final term in (9) is "full income" in past years. 17

         Statistically identical individuals, however, make different

labor-leisure choices (or, in this context, have different

reservation wages), presumably because they have different tastes.

So it seems important, in the stochastic specification of the

moder;--·,-to .a llow for individua 1 differences in tastes.     Though

the utility function we      hav~   used has five taste parameters,

it is clear that where retirement decisions are concerned the

parameter of greatest economic significance is         ~l'     the weight

on current-period leisure in equation (7).         So, for empirical

purposes, this is the one we a llow to vary across individual,

must be included in the "full income" concept.

empirical work,           loggi            is taken to be a linear function of a

number of observable variables (age, health, etc.) so we can

write (9) as:

               log w.~        =    Z.~ Y +    ~.

for the reservation wage, the model of retirement described in

words and qepicted in Figure 1 can be stated algebraically as

follows:

        Individual        i    will be retired or working according as:

                              R    >
                 log Wi < log Wi

                              or                                             ell)

                     ~.            ~   <       ~          ~




        It will be noted that our approach to deriving condition

(11) as a model of retirement is strikingly similar to the method

introduced by Heckman (1974) for dealing with selectivity bias

in another context.                The application of Heckman's analysis to

our problem is quite clear.                        Individuals who happen to draw

low values of        E.       will decide to retire, and hence we will not
                      ~

observe their wages.                   This suggests, for example, that the effects
                                                                   14.



of age on wages as estimated from the working population will

be biased   ~ard   by sample selection because it will be mostly

those with favorable drawings of     €i   that actually get into

the sample.   Thus, in addition to providing an empirical model

of the retirement decision, the model we estimate here offers

the side benefit of providing estimates of a standard wage

equation like (1) that are not afflicted by selectivity bias.

Selectivity bias corrections turn out to be sizeable in some

cases.



3.   Data and Method of Estimation

      The data used to estimate the model were drawn from the

first three waves (1969, 1971, and 1973) of the Longitudinal

Retirement History Survey (LRHS).     This survey conducted

extraordinarily detailed interviews of 11,153 individuals aged

58-63 in 1969, and repeated the interviews at two-year intervals

for those individuals who survived and could be located.          In

each survey year, individuals were asked a variety of questions

(wage rate, typical hours, ,eligibility for pension, etc.) about

their current job, if they had one.       In addition, the 1969

interview included questions about their previous job--which

would have been their last job if they were already retired,

and about a number of socioeconomic variables that would not

change through time (e.g., family background, education).

      From these data we extracted a sample of white males who

were not self employed and who worked for pay at least some
time in their lives as our basic sampling frame.        certain other
exclusions were forced upon us by the data.        For example, since
a principal focus of the wage equation was to estimate separately
the returns to   prio~   experience and tenure on the current job,
a respondent who did not report his job tenure, and for whom
this information could not be deduced, 18 was dropped from the
sample.   Secondly,    ~espondents   were free to report wages for
any time period they chose (e.g., hourly, weekly, monthly).          We
converted each response into an hourly wage and expressed each
in 1969 dollars.      However, whenever the reported information was
inadequate to construct the hourly wage rate, or was clearly
erroneous,19 the observation was dropped from the sample.        with

best we could rather than censor the sample.        On balance, of



     l8 For example, if job tenure was unknown in 1969, but
reported as 25 years in 1971, we assumed it was 23 years in 1969.

     19Reported wage rates above ~50 per hour (or ~100 per hour
in the case of managers and professional workers) or below one
third of the average wage rate in manufacturing (which was ~1.06
in 1969)" were considered erroneous.

     20There were a few case~ in which there was not adequate
information on the lifetime pattern of job holdings to construct
the measure of "full income" needed for equation (9). In a few
other cases, the reported data implied what to us was an
implausibly long hiatus between the end of schooling (or, more
accurately, years of education plus 6) and the start of the
first full time job. When this gap was greater than 15 years,
we dropped the observation from the sample.
                                                                                                        16.

lost 258 individuals in all three years because of an inability

to construct permanent -income: dropped 143 retirees because they

did not report their job tenure on their last job: and dropped

1,789 observations in 1969, 1,308 observations in 1971, and

1,625 observations in 1973 because of missing data on wage rate

or job tenure.                       In addition, there was                  some sample

attrition due to death or inability to locate the individual

for re-interview.                          After all these deletions, however, we were

still left with a sample If 15,981 observations, of which 9,879

 is rather complicated, and can best be understood if its

 objectives are made clear at the outset.             They were:

         (1)    To examine in some detail the effects of aging on

 wages, seeking to untangle the interrelated effects of age,

 vintage, and experience, since each of these might be relevant

 to retirement decisions.

         (2)    To investigate the effects of pensions and pension-

 related job provisions (such as mandatory retirement) on wages.

 As mentioned in the introduction, job transitions late in life

 induced either by mandatory retirement or by pensions may imply

 a substantial loss of earning power if job tenure (henceforth, j')

 is more valuable than previous experience on other jobs (henceforth,

 x).      A sharp drop in wages, in turn, might induce retirement.

 late in life that stem from reasons other than pensions (e.g.,

 from a desire to reduce hours of work).             This requires us not

 only to separate out the effects of job tenure from those of

 previous      exper~ence,      but also to disaggregate by occupation

 group since there is every reason to believe that the cost of

 a job transition varies by            occupat~on.

Previous Experience and Job Tenure

         The nonlinear par~ of (1) deals with the effects of

experience on wages, which the work of Mincer (1974) and others
has taught us is nonlinear.                     The need to (a) separate the

effects of      j   from those of                   x       and (b) disaggregate by occupation

led us to adopt a rather parsimonious functional form that

nonetheless allowed for                  dim~nishing            returns to experience.     We

selected as our basic specification:

               log w    = t3 0k + CXklog( j+bkx) ,

where the subscript              k       indicates that these coefficients vary

by occupation.
                     k
                       = 1, then only the sum j+x matters--as
                       If    b

in the conventional specification of wage equations. To the

extent, however, that previous experience is less valuable than

experience on the current job,                          b       will be less than unity.
                                                            k
(In our estimates, all of the b's turned out to be substantially

less than unity.)           Supposing that all the a's and b's turn out

to be positive (as they do), the specification implies positive

but diminishing returns to both                             j and   x , and a negative
interaction term, i.e., as job tenure increases, the value of

previous experience decreases.                          These properties seem reasonable

on   ~   PKiori grounds to us--more reasonable, e.g., than assuming

no interaction between                   j    and       x.

         This basic specification was extended in three ways in

order to implement the objectives listed above.                              First, we

allowed both the basic wage-experience profile and the relative

returns of      j   versus           x       to differ between jobs with or without

pensions.      Second, we allowed a change in occupation to "devalue"
                                                                     19.


one's previous experience.        Third, we recognized that in jobs

with pensions some part of hourly compensation is deferred, and

that workers might not value pens ion- contributions equally with

straight wages.       These led .to the following amendments to

our basic specification:




where     p
          is (our estimate of) the hourly pension contribution
            .         22
made by the employer,    DP is a dummy equal to one for workers

with pensions, and       DO   is a dummy equal to one for workers who

are currently in an occupation different from that of their

longest job.     The parameter     A   indicates the weight given to

pension contributions relative to straight wages.        We expect

o <   A < 1,   ~3 ~   0, but have no particular supposition about    ~l    •

        The choice of occupational groupings was meant to balance

our desire to obtain disaggregated information against our fear

of letting an already awesome computational problem become entirely

unmanageable.     Since each occupational group leads to three new

parameters, as can be seen in (13), we decided to limit ourselves

to the following four occupational groupings:

        Occupation Group 1:     Professionals and technical workers;

Managers, Officials, and proprietors.


     22 The construction of p was quite complicated, owing to
certain shortcomings in the data. Details are available on
request.
                                                                         20.



        Occupation Group 2:    Salesmen: Clerical workers.

        Occupation Group ;:    Craftsmen, Operatives, Private

household workers, Service workers.

        Occupation Group 4:    Nonfarm laborers, Farm managers, Farm

laborers, Occupation unknown.


The occupation groups were chosen for their inherent similarity

and can be loosely thought of as "high class" white collar,

"low class" white collar, skilled blue collar, and unskilled

blue collar.

        Estimates of the parameters just discussed appear in the

top portion of Table 1, which reports estimates of all the

parameters of the likelihood function that pertain to the market

wage •. The reader is reminded, however, that the market and

reservation wage equations were estimated jointly.           This was

necessary because     ~          the estimated market wage equation

would otherwise be atflicted by selectivity bias.
        The estimates contain a number of interesting results.

First, returns to experience (the       a       in equation (13»        turned
                                            k
out to differ surprisingly little across occupations.              The

estimates imply that the marginal returns to an additional year

of job tenure (j) are quite low for older workers.           If     j    = 20
and x    =   25, which are typical figures in our sample, the

marginal returns to an additional year of tenure on the jab range

between 0.6610 and 0.83 10 , depending on occupation.         Even in
                                                                                        21.



an extreme case like           j        = 5,           x   = 40,   the range is only from

1.11'10 to 2.17'70 per year.                          As we expect, profess iona:Is and

m~nqgers   reap the greatest returns from job tenure and laborers

the   +ea~t.

      There is more variation across occupations in the returns

to previous experience.                      But, more importantly, we see very low
returns to previous experience in all occupations.                                  The weight

attached to    x   in the weighted sum                             j + bx   ranges from .07 to

.28   if there has not been a change in occupation, and from .03

to .24 if there has been.                            Marginal returns to an additional

year of previous experience apparently are trivial for older

workers.

      The tremendous effect that having a pension has on the job

tenure profile is of particular interest because of its importance

for retirement decisions.                            As can be seen in (16), we allowed

the existence of a pension to affect both the intercept and the

slope of the wage-tenure profile.                              Specifically, for jObs

without pensions equation (13) becomes:

           log w   =   ~Ok +       a k log[j + ~2kx],

while for jobs with pensions it becomes:

                                                                                                 ( l3b)

Given our parameter estimates, wages are systematically higher

on jobs with pensions, though the amount by which they are

higher varies both by occupation and according to the mix of

job tenure and prior experience.                              The wage differential between

jobs with and without pensions is greatest when                                 j   is small
                       ; l         ..   "f   r'; .
                                                                                      22.


relative to           x , and diminishes as              j     rises relative to x. 23

It seems clear that the pension dummy is "picking up" some

unmeasured attribute that pays off in the form of higher wages;

among the possibilities are                   abi~ity,       reliability, some unmeasured

aspec t   0   f    h uman      ' ta
                            cap~      1 , or even the returns to          '

      An important question to ask, given our interest in retire-

ment decisions, is:              what does it cost an older worker to change

jobs late in his career (perhaps because he wants to step down
to a job with shorter hours)?                    To answer this, we assume first

that he has no pension on either job, so the issue is merely

one of swapping· j              for     x.      Table 2 displays the effect on

wages of giving up a job on which the worker has either 45,

20, or 10 years of experience in order to take a new job (with
                                                                                            25
j = 0,            x = 45).     The losses are typically quite substantial.



     23 For example, the different~al is 82 '70 when j =0 and
x=45, fa Ils to between 35 '10 and 54 '10 (depending on occupation)
when j=15 and x=45, and to                 20% - 33 10 when j=30 and x=15.

     24 0ur data did not tell us which individuals were union
members, and it is well known that pensions are more common
in the unionized sector.

      25 The calculation is based on comparing the value of
exp[aklog(j+~2kx)]              when      j   and   x        are as indicated in the

table with           exp[aklog(45~2k)].

entails both a loss of the benefits from being on a pensioned

job and substantial devaluation of one's previous experience.

By contrast, however, there is no wage loss (in fact,                a slight

gain) if the new job has a pension.

        On balance, the typical wage loss from a           job transition

late in life appears to be quite severe.              It is doubtful, therefore,
                \

that many older workers will want to make such transitions

voluntarily.        Loss of a job through unemploYment, mandatory

retirement, or a temporary bout of ill health, may well induce

a worker to retire rather than change jobs late in life.


Value of Pension contributbns

The point estimate of     ~   suggests that     ~l   contributed to a

pension fund is worth about 52¢ in direct compensation.            This

is rather lower than might be'expected, but it must be remembered

that some of these pensions were not vested and others were not

funded very soundly.     In addition, our rough approximation to

the variable    p   (the average pension contribution per hour over

the life of the job) may be a poor approximation to the marginal

contribution rate--suggesting downward bias from measurement

error.   This bias may be aggravated further by potential endogeneity

ofp(i.e., a positive correlation of         p   with €).


Age Variables

     As noted earlier, the pure effect of aging on wage rates

is of some importance for explaining why people retire. Furthermore,

there is some controversy in the human capital literature over

..( footnote 27 continued)
         PP = dummy equal to 1 for a prIvate job with a pension,
             whose benefits are unknown.

The   rationale is as follows. Consider the lefthand side of
(13) as a function of ~. Expanding it to find the Taylor
series approximation around ~ = 0 gives:

            log(w+~p) ::: logw + 12. P- •
                                  w
For people with unknown p, we set p=O on the lefthand side of
(13) and entered instead a dummy variable on the righthand side
whose ,coefficient is to be interpreted (with sign reversed)
as an estimate of the ratio of p-pJw in these jobs. Since we
know that this ratio is typically much greater in government
jobs than in private-sector jobs, we           entered the two
dummy variables defined above.
                                                                               29·


whether there is such an effect, once schooling and experience
are controlled for.          If there is a direct'effect of age on wages,
it seems most likely to show up among older workers.                     We tested
for it by including ,the following two variables:
      AGE - 61     = age minus 61 if positive
                     o otherwise
      AGEBC        = age 'minus 58 for blue collar workers (groups
                     3 and h. above)
                     o   for white collar workers

      The parameter estimates in Table 1 do indeed suggest an
effect of age      ~~~      on wages.      Specifically, we estimate a
typical decline in real wages of about 2.6 percent per year
starting at age 61 for white collar workers, and a decline of
about 1.7 percent per year between ages 58 and 61 rising to about
h..3 percent per year after age 61 for blue collar workers.                      Since
these numbers are much larger than the estimated returns to job
tenure at these ages, real wages typically will be falling after
age 61, and this wiIl provide some inducement to retire.
      One further aging variable was included to try to gain some
understanding of the mandatory retirement phenomenon.                      It seemed
to us that the existence of mandatory retirement must imply
that--for somereason--wages diverge from marginal productivity
late in life, and that firms have a need to terminate this

following variable to measure the gap between marginal products

For workers on'jobswith mandatory retirement, this variable
begins at 1 nine years before retirement and grows linearly to
10 just befpre retirement.        A positive coefficient would therefore
indicate that such workers are increasingly       "overpaidnr~lative

for manda.toryretirement.
     Though thElestimated coefficient is positive, and its
lit rattb-rt is moderately respectable, we cannot consider this
variable to be successful in .expla,ining mandatory retirement

account for about a 10 percent drop in wages whether it was

acquired recently or long ago.      However, the estimated coefficient

of "left last job for health reasons" is huge--toohuge, in

fact, to be believed.      The data show vividly that almost all

individuals who reported leaving their last job for health

reasons are now retired.      Very few, therefore, report a wage

rate that can be used to infer the negative effect of this

variable on market wages.      The role of the coeffiQient of HJ

in the equation;is to ensure that persons with HJ =1 have an

expected wage so low that they are virtually certain to be retired.

Frankly, we wonder if some people who wanted to retire for other

reasons simply found "left last job for health reasons" to be

a socially acceptable rationale for retirement.


Vintaqe-LBirth Cohort)

     As noted in the introduction, one possible explanation for

the trend in retirement is that older workers did not share

equally in the overall productivity growth of the economy.         We

were able to test this hypothesis for the 1969-1973 period

since our longitudinal sample made it possible to separate the

effects of age and experience from those of vintage, which we

defined as:

     VINTAGE   =   age in 1969, minus 57.

This variable ran from 1 for the youngest cohort (those born in

1911) to 6 for the oldest (born in 1906).
     The coefficient of the vintage variable turned out to be

almost zero--far short of the economy-wide average rate of
                                                               32.



increase of real wages between 1969 and 1973, tVhich was 1.6~o

per annum.     Thus it seems that product':i.v:itygrowth during this

short time span was not neutral across vintages ,and      in fact
shifted the age-wage profile in a way that was unfavorable to

older workers.
                                                                         ."
     The last two columns in Table 1 are included for econometricians

interested in the value of our correction for selectivity bias.

They show the point estimates (and standard errors) from a linear

ordinary least squares version of our wage equation., run on a

data set consisting only of the 9,879 workers..      (Some of the

parameters are not directly comparable because the nonlinear

aspects of our wage equation were approximated linearly.2 9 )

The main coefficients of interest are those pertaining to aging,

since this is a principal determinant of labor force

participation.     It can be seen that the age coefficients in

ordinary least squares suggested no direct effect of aging on

wages for white collar workers, and a very small negative effect

for blue collar workers.     By contrast, our corrected estimates

show wages falling significantly with age.       Another interesting

comparison is of the two vintage'effects:       roughly 1 percent

per year in the OLS regression, but zero in the corrected

regression.     The coefficient of short term (but not long term)


     29 Por example, the basic specification 10g(w+A.p) = alog( j +bx)
was approximated by setting A. to its estimated value and
expanding the righthand side in a Taylor series around b=l
to get:
                                   X

health problems also appears to have been plagued by serious

selectivity bias in OLS.



5.   The Reservation Wage Eguation

        As noted in Section 2, the reservation wage equation takes

the form:

                                                              (10)

           J.
                                                                   .   30
tastes, and the log of lifetime discounted potential earnings.

Estimation results for the reservation wage function are shown

in Table 4. 31


Full Income
     When (10) is estimated, the coefficient of       logY   is our

estimate of      5, the elasticity parameter in the utility function

(see equation (9).       It can be seen that full income does indeed

get the expected positive coefficient.       However, the coefficient

of .10 is surprisingly low.      Since the variable is   logY,


       0
      3 TO avoid an obvious simUltaneity problem, in constructing Y
we used a least squares estimate of each individual's lifetime
earnings, rather than his actual earnings. This estimate was
based on ~ linear wage equation similar to that in Table 1, which
was used to forecast and backcast wages.   (For more details on
the procedure, see Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1980b).)
      According to the tpeoretical derivation in Section 2, Y
ought to include only potential earnings in past years if the
individual will be retired in "the future," but should include
future potential earnings as well if he will not be retired. As
an empirical compromise between these two notions, we assumed
full-time work (2,000 hours per year) until· age 67, and complete
retirement thereafter.
     3 l The r~ader is again reminded that these estimates come
from the same maximum likelihood estimation problem as those
in Table 1.

a rise of 1.0 represents a huge increase in lifetime income,
                        R
and yet increases   w       by only about 10 percent.

      This low coefficient has two principle implications.

First, since the estimated income effects on labor supply are

so weak, it seems unlikely that rising average income levels

have been a major cause of the trend toward earlier retirement.

Second, since the estimated indifference curves between labor

and leisure are so flat, the implied labor supply function should

be highly elastic to wage rates.       This implication is not as

unrealistic as it may seem.       It implies, in essence, that the

typical worker will work full time                 inelastically

until he nears retirement, then a brief period of extreme

sensitivity will ensue, followed by complete withdrawal from the

work force.    In fact, this is what the data seem to show.        In

1973, when our sample ranged in "age from 62 to 67, 60io worked

zero hours while 34'10 worked 35 hours per week or more ..

     Note finally that, in conjunction with our earli.er finding

of substantial wage loss from job transitions late in life,

these flat indifference curves suggest that few workers will

make such transitions.       They will opt for retirement instead.


~e   Effects

     We entered age in a piecewise linear: form with changes in

slope at ages 62 and 65 and a finite jump at age 65, an age

chosen to reflect eligibility for full social security benefits.3~

     3 2 The effect of age on logwR includes both the effect of
age on the taste for leisure (~i) and the difference between the
rates of interest and time discount.
For reasons explained in Section 1, we did not expect any

particular effect of social security on retirement.      Despite

this, a finding that there is either a jump in the reservation

wage at age 65 or a sharp increase in slope at age 62 might be

grounds to suspect that social security really matters after

all--perhaps only because of a demonstration effect.

      The estimated age effects on logwR     proved to be substantial,

and in the anticipated direction:      the reservation wage rises

with age.      More specifically, the reservation wage grows at

roughly 4 percent per year from age 58 to 65, makes a finite

jump of about 6 percent at age 65, and then grows at about 6

percent per year after age 65.      There are several interesting

observations to be made about this set of coefficients.

      'First, while we allowed for it, there is no apparent break

in the reservation wage trend at age 62, the age of eligibility

for partial social security benefits.      This is as we expected.

Second, there is however a noticeable (though small) jump at

age 65, the age of full eligibility.      This provides some weak

evidence (the standard error is almost half as large as the

coefficient) that social security may be having some effects.

      Third, the rate of increase of the reservation wage with

age   (4-6   percent per year) is moderately higher than the rate

of decrease of the market wage (about 2.6 percent after age 61)--

indicating that increasing tastes for leisure are somewhat more

important than falling wages in explaining retirement behavior.
                                                             37.



More on Social Security

     To test further for possible effects of social security on

retirement decisions,   ~e   added to our equation the ratio of

potential social security wealth (i.e., the discounted present

value of potential social security benefits) to full income

called SSW/Yo

     The rationale for a variable like this one is as follows.

It could be that many older workers want to retire, but are

deterred because a substantial fraction of their wealth is

tied up in a highly illiquid form--social security wealth.         When

they reach age 62, it becomes possible for them to draw on this

wealth, and they consequently retire. 33     If this scenario is

empirically important, the ratio of SSw/y should enter the

reservation wage equation strongly and positively after age 62,

but should get a negative sign before age 62.      Consequently,

we interacted SSw/y with a dummy variable for those 62 and older,

and entered the two variables indicated in Table     4.
     To construct ,SSW/Y, it was necessary to supplement our

data source with information from each individual's social

security file--information that was available from ~he 1975 wave

of the LRHS.    However, because of potential endogeneity problems,

we did not use the actual ssw of each person, but rather an


     33 This hypothesis was suggested to us by several readers
of the earlier draft of this paper.
                                                                 38.


instrument constructed by assuming a fixed age-hours profile. 34

This made each individual's SSwjy ratio independent of his

particular labor-leisure choices.

     Qualitatively, the results gave little indication that

the illiquidity of social security wealth influences retirement

decisions very much.   Prior to age 62, social security wealth

is totally insignificant (and incorrectly signed).         After age

62, its coefficient is significantly positive, but economically

unimportant.   A typical value for SSwjY is about       .07,   with

most people clustered in a range from   .05   to .12.    An increase

of .01 in this variable thus represents a substantial boost in

social security benefits.   Yet it adds only 0.3%       to the

reservation wage according to the estimate.




     Since blue collar work has an element of physical arduousness

that is mostly absent from white collar work, it seemed a

plausible conjecture that reservation wages rise more steeply

for blue collar workers than for white collar workers.           To test



     34Inparticular, we normally took the age profile of the
fitted wage rates used in constructing Y (full income), multiplied
by 2000 hours per year, assumed retirement at age 65, and calculated
the implied actuarial present value of social security benefits in
1969 using the 1969 law and information about the ages of the
spouse and children (if any). However, if the individual had
insufficient quarters of coverage to receive benefits according
to his social security record, we set SSW=O.  In addition, if
the reported earnings on the social security record in any year
the individual worked were below 40% of our forecasted earnings,
we assumed that the individual's main job in that year was not
covered by social security, and set that year's earnings to
zero when calculating SSW.
                                                                  39.


for this, both the intercept and slope of the reservation wage-

age profile were allowed to differ between blue and white collar

employment by entering the following two variables:

      DBC   =a dummy equal to 1 for blue collar workers (occupation
             groups 3 and 4)

     AGEBC   =   the same age/blue collar interaction used in the
                 market wage equation.

      The estimates contradicted our expectations.      Apparently,

,blue-collar workers have lower, and more slowly growing,

reservation wages than white-collar workers.      Indeed, for blue-

collar workers, reservation wages seem to rise at about 2-4·10

. per year (versus 4-6%    for white-collar workers).


Health

      From among the several possible health variables, we

selected only:

     HCO = health is worse than others of same age.

According to the estimates, having bad health compared to others

adds about 7 '10 to the reservation wage. 35


Egucation.

      It has been suggested, e.g., by Mincer (1974), that people

who acquire more schooling remain in the labor force longer in

order to recoup the costs of their human investments.       Our



     35 The dummy variable HJ (left last job for health reasons)
is conspicuous by its absence. The paltry number of wage
observation for which this dummy was "on" made it fruitless to
try t()include it in b0th the market wage equation (th~ vector X)
and the reservation wage equation (the vector Z).   Our decision
to include it only in X was an arbitrary one.
                                                               40.


estimate of the effect of education on the reservation wage,

which is highly significant, has the opposite sign from that

suggested by Mincer.     other things (especially their market

wages) held equal, more educated people are more prone to retire,

not less.


Vintage

     Another plausible taste variqble is vintage, the supposition

being that older cohorts have a stronger work ethic and hence a

lower reservation wage.     We thus expect a negative coefficient

for the variable VINTAGE defined earlier, which is precisely

what the estimate shows.     How~y~r,   it should be noted that

VINTAGE will also pick up any systematic (linear) effects of

calend~r    time, so the interpretation of the coefficient is not

entirely clear.



    While the variables mentioned to this point can legitimately

be considered as potential determinants of tastes, a further set

of variables pertaining to pensions was included for rather

different reasons.     The estimation technique that we used requires

that any taste differences that are impounded in the error term

vi (i.e., not controlled for by inclusion in       z.)
                                                    1.
                                                         must be

orthogonal to the variables included in      Xi.    Now, since there

are many jobs with and without pension plans, it seems likely

that workers with an unobservable "taste for retirement" around

65 will   ~rt   themselves into jobs with pensions.      Thus the

following two variables could be highly correlated with whatever

omitted taste variables lead to a high reservation wage:
                                                                   41.


     DP   =   dummy equal to 1 if the job has a pension

     DP65     =   dummy equal to1 if the job has a pension Sond
                  the worker is 65 or older.

(The latter variable allows the effect of pensions on the

reservation wage to jump at age 65--the age typically prescribed

for retirement.)          Consequently, for purely econometric reasons,

we decided to include both of these variables in          Z.

     Only about half of all workers with pensions know what

those pensions are worth in future benefits.          It is possible

that not knowing the value of one's pension (late in life) is

an indication that one does not plan to make use of it, i.e., an

indication of a low reservation wage.          So we entered a variable

defined as:

     GP + PP       =   a dummy equal to 1 if the worker has a pension,
                       but does not know its amount.

     In the same spirit, a change from one's longest occupation

might conceivably be a signal of a desire to remain in the labor

force rather than retire.          So we included the variable:

     DO = a dummy equal to 1 if the current occupation differs
          from the occupation of longest job.

     The pension variables seem quite successful at "picking

up" a propensity to retire.          According to the estimates,

individuals with pensions have a log reservation wage some .25

above that for individuals without pensions up to age 65, and

a log reservation wage about .46 higher after 65.          The dummy

for not knowing the amount of pension benefits has the expected
                                                                                     42.


sign, but a very small magnitude.                             The dummy variable for a

change in occupation has the anticipated effect on                             wR : and it

is substantial--roughly a 15 percent reduction in the reservation

wage. 36


Stochastic Specification

         It will be recalled that the error term in (10) was assumed

to follow:

                  1').   = p€.         +   V.
                    ~             ~         ~



In addition, the variance of                         v   was allowed to vary with age,

viz. :

                  a~     =   a~       + s(AGE-6l)


     _~e        stochastic specification produced some striking results.

First,      p    = .58        indicates a substantial correlation between

the error terms in the market wage and reservation wage equations:

people with surprisingly high market wages also have surprisingly

high reservation wages.                         One possible explanation for this

pos itive correlation is that omitted variables ("ability") affect

both the market wage and lifetime income in the same direction.

Second, the variance of                         v   is very small prior to age 62.

(For comparison, the variance of                          €    is more than 8 times as

high.)     This means that, except for differences embodied in the


     36Several family status vari3bles were also included in
the equation, but are not discUYded. See Table 4.
vector       Z, tastes for leisure are rather uniform.                         However,

third, this variance grows quickly with age since the parameter
                                                            2
s     in equation (14) is almost as large as               0'0 •



6.    Analysis of the Retirement Decision

       As should be clear from the last two sections, a number of

variables (such as age)'affect both market wages and reservation

wages.       If we are to analyze the retirement decision, both effects

must be considered simultaneously.                  For each individual, our

estimates of the vectors              Y   and   ~   , along with data on              X.1
and    Z.            and estimates of the variances of         €       and     v , enable
         1

us to generate an estimated probability of retirement by integrating
under the relevant normal density functions.                       '     In fact, there

are two different ways to generate this estimated probability,
             .....
called       P.

       First, we can assume ignorance of the available wage rate

wi ' and forecast the probability that an individual will be

retired based just on information in                 X   and           Z .37    The

distributions of the forecasted probabilities, reported separately

for those who were actually retired and for those who were

actually working, are reported in Table 5.                     We find that the




       37Using formula (A.2) in the appendix.
                                                               44.


"goodness of fit" of the model varies substantially across age
groups.
     Discrimination is really quite good for 58-61 year olds.
The vast majority is still working, and our model forecasts their
behavior extraordinarily well.    For the minority of 58-61 year
olds who are retired, the model correctly retires about      60~

and incorrectly labels about 37 1cJ as still working. 38    Results
are almost as good among 62-64 year olds, a group that is much
more evenly divided between retirement and work.      Of those
actually retired, the model correctly classifies about 49 10 and
incorrectly classifies about 33 10 •    Of those actually still

working, the model correctly class ifies about 88 'fo and
misclassifies almost no one.
     The model has less success, however, in capturing the
retirement decisions of those aged 65-67.     While very few
retirees are 'incorrectly classified as working,            many
workers are incorrectly classified as retired.      We do not know
how to explain this.   It is worth stressing, however, that if
our model erred by underestimating the incentives to retire
provided by the social security system, we would expect it to
"retire" too few workers over 65.      In fact, it retires too many.


     3S In this sentence, and in what follows, the model is
~onsidered  to classify a person as retired if it gives him a
P ~bove .6 , and to classify him as working if it gives.him
a P below .4. Persons assigned ~ values between .4 and .6
are considered to be "not classified."
    A                      .   ~


a p > .6 for retirees or P < .4 for workers.
b            ~

                                                                   46.


Thus whatever weaknesses remain in the model, its treatment of

social security does not seem to be one of them.

     A second forecasting method is available for those who

actually chose to work.           Since we know the wage (and hence the

value of   Ei) for these men, we can forecast the probability

that these individuals would indeed choose to work, conditional

on this value of     E ••    39    The resulting probabilities are
                       1..

reported in Table 6.

     Comparing these results to the righthand panel of Table 5,
we see that knowledge of the wage leads to minor improvements

in our (already very good) ability to predict the behavior of

those between the ages of 58 and 64.              Misclassifications are

almost entirely eliminated.              Forecasting improvements are much

greater for those aged 65-67, but we still do not do very well.

     How sensitive is the probability of retirement to changes

in any of the determinants of market wages or reservation wages

(the elements of    X   and        Z)?    To answer this, we first computed

the retirement probability (assuming ignorance of the true market

wage) of a "typical" member of our sample, -whom we call the
            40
"base case.~       For such a typical individual, the estimated

probability of being retired is only .187.        Table 7 shows how

this estimated probability varies as a number of these

characteristics change!       Reading across any line shows the

pattern of retirement probabilities by age, and comparing any

of lines 2 through 11 with line 1 shows the effect of various

deviations from the base case.

begins very low at age 58 in the base case (about 4 percent),

rises slowly until age 61, and then rises more quickly thereafter.

It makes a substantial jump (from .34 to .48) at age 65, and

reaches .62 by age 67.       This general age profile is pretty

typical of all the cases considered in Table 7, though they

the reservation wage.      Not surprisingly, retirement probabilities

increase by miniscule amounts.

        The vintage effect on retirement is moderate (see row       4).
As compared with men born in 1911 (the base case), men born in

1906 are 2-8 percent less likely to be retired, depending on age.

        Differences among occupation groups are also very small.

In fact, retirement     probabi~ities   among farmers and unskilled

blue-collar workers (group 4) are virtually identical to those

of sales and clerical workers (group 2).        Professional workers

and managers have the lowest retirement probabilities, and

skilled blue-collar workers have the next lowest.

        As can be seen in row 8, workers with pens ions are no more

likely to retire than workers without pensions up to age 64.

However, at age 65, when the retirement probability for workers

witliout pensiqn s jumps by .15, that for workers with pensions

ju~ps    by .35.   The retirement pattern for workers with pension

plans ~nd mandatory retirement (at age 65) is qualitatively

similar to this, but quantitatively different.        The jump in

the retirement probability at age 65 is .41.

        Finally, lines 10 and 11 show the extreme sensitivity of

retirement decisions to wage rates.        In line 10, the log wage

is increased by 50 percent (which adds 40.5%        to the market

wage).     This makes retirement extremely unlikely up to age 63

or 64, and leaves the probability as low as .28 even at ,age 67.

In line 11, the log wage is reduced by 50 percent (this lowers

the market wage by 69 «to), which ra ises retirement probabilities

very dramatically, especially at younger ages.
                                                                    51.



         Lines 12 and 13 show two rather different types of retire-

ment" profiles.        Holding age constant at 62, line 12 indicates

how the probability of being retired varies with years of

education. 43     It can be seen that the probability rises slowly

up to 10 years of schooling, and then falls.          College graduates

are only half as likely to be retired at age 62 as are high

school graduates.           In line 13 we seethe effect that exchanging

previous experience for job tenure has on the market wage:

as   j     rises and    x    falls, the probability of retirement drops.

Workers with long job tenure are therefore much less likely to

retire than those with short job tenure.



20   Conclusion

         This has been a long paper, and many interesting results

have been pointed out along the way.          Rather than try to catalog

these, let us close by addressing the questions posed at the

mtset of the paper:

First; why do people retire1

         1) It is clear that age has a dramatic effect, both because

age affects wages and because age affects labor-leisure tastes

(reservation wages).          In our base case,the probability of

retirement increases from below 10 percent at age 61 to above


     43 In this experiment x and j both adjust to the change
in years of education, with the difference j-x held constant.
                                                                     52.


60 percent by age 67.

     2)    If we put aside people who say they left their last

job for health reasons _(w~o may be using this to rationalize a

decision made on other grounds), poor health seems to be a

moderately important cause of retirement.

     })    Pension plans--with or without associated mandatory

retirement provisions--provide powerful incentives to retire

at the age of eligibility for the pension (normally 65).           Social

security, however, has a much weaker effect (if any) on retirement

decisions.

     4)    Retirement decisions are highly sensitive to market         \

wages.    For this reason, few people will voluntarily change

jobs late in life if that job transition implies a substantial

reduct-ion in wages (as it normally does).       Similarly, individua ls

forced to leave their main j9bs because of mandatory retirement

normally will retire rather than take a new job at a lower wage.

     While one must exercise extreme caution in drawing time

series inferences from cross-sectional data, the following

tentative explanation for the trend toward retirement is suggested.

     1.   Wages late in life may have declined relative to wages

earlier in life, thus inducing more men to retire.

     2.    Private pensions have expanded rapidly.      These plans

typically provide strong incentives to leave the job, often even

mandating it.    The resulting   drop~in   market wages normally is

severe enough to induce complete withdrawal fJ:.om    ·~the   labor force.
                                                                 53.



     3.   Younger cohorts seem to have a stronger taste for

leisure, perhaps due to growth in the economy, causing them to

retire earlier.

     4.   It seems unlikely that the growth of the social

security system, as impressive as it has been, has contributed

much to the trend toward retirement.

      '."here        4>    is a. standard -norma~ density function.
      The.                 contribution to the log likelihood function of all working

      pe091e is thus:

                          -      logw. -f(X. ~~
                 L    log   eP [ ~-  , l..    J.

      T:te ~verall log likelihood function is the sum of (A.,) and CA.5),

      anq it is maximized w~th ,respect to,              c,~   Y, p, a€   and       a
                                                                                    .:3
                                                                                          •-._.

                                  2
      In addition,               av   was assumed to be given by:



                 _a; = a~         + s(AGE-61) ,                                                   (A.6)



      so a           actually contains two parameters.          Given 31 components of
           v
      ~   and             20   components of   Y ,·there are 55 parameters in all.
