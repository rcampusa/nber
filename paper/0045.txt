       In the late fifties, Boover and Vernon In their study for the ew

York Regional Plan Association first put forth what has since come to

be    called the   "incubator" hypothesis. This hypothesis states that

small   manufacturing establishments beginning operations will find it
to their comparative advantage to locate at highly centralied locations
within the metropolis. This advantage is due to any number of factors

including the availability of (1) rentable production space, (2) inputs,

(3) lower supply risks, (4) labor, and (5) other services at such

locations.1 The hypothesis was stated in the context of a more general

discussion of the external economies available in what they term the

"core" area of the metropolis.

        Since its    formulation, the hypothesis has been expanded in several

ways    to form    the   basis   for a theory of the intra—urban industrial 1ocatio

process.       One generalization      has been to apply it to all new firms, not

 just small firms or those particularly dependent on especially close

 contact with their customers or suppliers. A second form of the generaliza-

tion has been to         explore   the dynamic   aspects   of the   hypothesis.    This

generalization implies, for example, that the high mortality rates of

new ventures would account for relatively high rates of business failure

seemingly observed in central cities; further, as these fledgling enter-

prises mature and their dependency on others is              reduced,    outward movement
to lower density areas might be anticipated. More systematically, one

might expect that areas which best provide for the              incubation      functIon
will be characterized by           (1) relatively   high establishment birth rates,
(2)   relatively    high establishment death



          actual statement was "The process,
        1The                                  as we see it,     one in     is
 which persons aspiring to go into production on a small scale have found
 themselves less obviously barred by a high cost structure at the center
 of the urban area than at the periphery." E. H. Hoover and Raymond Vernon,

    matured   establishmentr seeking space for expansion, a:i (A)
    a   positive net increase in the employment of the smaller,

    still—existing and maturing establishments.



          The purpose of this paper is to review the   past   evidence

    and to offer some new data to assess whether the hypothesis

    can be empirically supported. In particular the two general

    aspects of the hypothesis described above will be tested.

    First, we will examine the proposition that highly centralized

    locations are attracting a disproportionate number of new firms

    and/or the employment associated with new firms. Second, we

    will test the hypothesis that new firms which are formed in

    high density areas move outward from such sites in their

    early years of existence in order to expand their productive

    activities. We refer to

    these as the "simp1e and "dynamic" hypotheses in the rest of the paper.
    Our analysis is based on   the experience of all manufacturers in several
    U.S. cities. We recognize that     it is quite possible that the hypothesis
    could hold for certain industries even if it is unsupported fCr all firms

    together. Our intent, however, is to test the validity of the hypothesis

    as. a general theory of intraurban location behavior.

           The paper consists of three sections. The first two present evidence

    on the "simple" and "dynamic" hypotheses. The final section summarizes

    our findings and offers some conclusions.



                              I.   THE SIMPLE hYPOTHESIS


    Hoover and Vernon

           Hoover, Vernon, and others associated with the New York Regional

    Plan Study did not directly support (as they did not directly state)

    the incubator hypothesis. More, it was the linking of the arguments

    for the necessity of external economies for small firms and for those

    in need of rapid communication with customers and suppliers which by

    implication offered support for the hypothesis as it was eventually stated.2

    Their argument was strengthened by Daniel Creamer's earlier study of the

    incidence of new establishments within metropolitan areas for 1929 and l933.

    Of special note for Hoover and Vernon was Creamer's division of industries

    into durable and semi—durable groups. His results showed that in major

    employment size in the core, inner ring, and outer ring of the re;1on

    in the core area; Hoover and Vernon. on. cit., Table 9, p. 16.

metropolitan areas semi—durable industries had consistently high   birth
rates in central cities while for durable goods industries birth rates

were essentially uniform across areas. The industries included in the

semi—durables group coincided closely with those included by Vernon and

Hoover in their list of industries relying on rapid coimnunications and

external economies. Further, the precarious existence of such establish-

ments makes a high turnover probable,4 meaning a greater number of births

will be present where such industries are concentrated. Thus, given the

clustering of these industries at central locations, their relatively

small average size, and rapid turnover, a higher level and/or rate of

births at central locations was to be expected. Finally, although Hoover

and Vernon were clearly aware that as a firm grows, it becomes economical

to produce internally services previously purchased outside the firm.

This can make decentralization more attractive as a firm ages and expands.



Creamer

     As part of a more general study of the location patterns of manu-

facturers,   Daniel Creamer later examined the components of location

industries they are: core, 6.1 percent; inner ring, 6.8; outer ring,
2.8. As such they do not strongly support the text statement. More
recent data, however, confirm that birth and death rate are highly
correlated. See, for example, R. Struyk and F. James, "A Comparative
Study of Manufacturing Employment Location in the Boston and Phoenix
Metropolitan Areas," Explorations in Economic Research, forthcoming,
and Roh2rt A. Leone, The Location of tnuTacturinc Activity in the

change for Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA's) in Pennsylvania

using the   State's   Industrial Census.5 He   observed   that principal cities

enjoy some advantage over their environs as incubators of n.ew manufacturing

establishments.6 The comparison which Creamer makes is at a higher level

of aggregation than we consider appropriate for a test of this hypothesis.

Because of data limitations, Creamer was forced to define the principal

city   of each SMSA was geographically equivalent to the county in which it
was located. The one exception was Philadelphia where the city and county
are   coterminous. Thus, while Creamer finds the principal cities to have

higher birth rates in ten of the 18 city—year observations reported, his

concept of centrality is in most instances considerably broader than

that generally conceived in statements of the incubator hypothesis.




Struyk—James

       Using   the establishment level Dun and   Bradstreet data it was posaible

for    these researchers to use a finer geographic detail than previously
employed to test the hypothesis.7 Three different types of area within

         fairness it should be noted that Creamer's main comparisons involved
s1c types of manufacturing locations: (1) principal cities of industrial
areas, (2) remainder of industrial areas, (3) cities of 10,000 or greater
population outside of industrial areas, (4) the remainder of large non—
industrial counties, (5) other industrial counties, and (6) rc-:ainder of
the state. We have limited our discussion of his findings to (1) and (2).

each of the four included SMSA's in the study were considered as possible

incubation sites: Central Industrial Districts, the Central City and

Traditional    Manufacturing Sites.   (1) The central jri'1          '4t (Cm)
is best thought of as a substantially augmented central bustncss district
as   defined by Census; this is generally the highest density land use area

in   the SNSA. (2) The central city is as defined by the Census. (3)
Traditional manufacturing sites in each of the included SMSA's, although
possibly not centrally located, are characterized by a significant capital
infrastructure    (frequently aged) which could be suitable for new enter-

prises; they also have skilled labor forces available as well as the

services   of other manufacturers. The three types of site are not, of
course, mutually exclusive.
       To test the hypothesis, the share of the SMSA'S new firms at an
incubation    site   was contrasted with the site's share of the SMSA's finns
in   the initial year of the study. If the incubation sites were attract-

ing a disproportionate number of new firms, the ratio of these shares

should be greater than 1. Table 1 presents such ratios on an establishment

and on an employment basis for each incubation site in each of the sample

SMSA's. The employment figures offer some support for the hypothesis.

All   three   Cleveland zones, for example, appear to be relatively fertile,

particularly the CID. The St. Paul and Phoenix central cities also passed

the test as well as the traditional manufacturing centers in Boston. The

tests based on the location of new establishments provided no support for

the hypothesis. On balance, the Struyk—James study provided very limited

support of the hypothesis.8


Leone

      Using similar Dun      and Bradstreet data for the 1967—1971 period, Leone
has studied the incubation process in the New York Metropolitan area.9

The ratios in Table 1 also summarize his findings. The time period was

divided into the 1967—1969 and 1969—1971 periods in order to separate periods

of economic expansion and slowdown. Although not shown in Table 1 the

Manhattan CBD, which dominates aggregate manufacturing activity, dominates

births to a moderately greater extent in both periods. Second, the

traditional manufacturing areas outside the CBD fared relatively poorly

except during the 1967—1969 time period. Leone observed that the fringe

areas were strongly represented in birth activity, especially for small

establishments. This observation is consistent with the findings of

Struyk—James. Third, the New York CID appeared to be especially attractive

for the larger of the new firms.

      Leone   also speculated that the favorable performance of both the CII)
and theTraditional Manufacturing Areas in the 1967—1969 time period
stemmed largely from the fact that the period was the tailend of an

economic boom. During such a period, the nearly obsolete        capital stock
in   the oldest areas is drawn upon because of capacity constraints elsewhere.

Summarj

      The evidence we have examined provides little cu7prt to the
simple incubator concept of urban growth. Hoover and Vernon, of
course,   originally formulated the incubator hypothesis in the New

York context. It is both a credit to them and an indication of the

uniqueness of the New York experience that the strongest support for

the   hypothesis is   in New York. In general, however, the simple

incubator    hypothesis appears to be a weak explanation of urban growth
processes.


                           II. THE DYNAMIC HYPOTHESIS


      Even though   we have not found strong support for the   simple
incubator hypothesis, it is worthwhile exploring the movement and

growth pattern of new firms at central locations because it is

possible for this aspect of the hypothesis to be supported independently

of the other. In addition, because such firms constitute a substantial

fraction of all new manufacturing activity   ,   knowledge of their
locational behavior will increase our understanding of urban development,
                                    —9—

     The dynamic hypothesis itself is composed of two related but

separable parts. The hypothesis states that as new firms mature and

grow they become less dependent on the services afforded by others

at incubation sites as they are able to supply themselves with many

of these services. This decreased dependence coupled with requirements

for additional space to accommodate expansion push the firm away from

the incubation site to lower density areas. Thus, the two parts of

the hypothesis concern the growth and the relocaUon patterns of new

firms compared to mature firms. These are examined sequentially in

the following paragraphs.

     To carry out the analysis we use the same 1967—1969 and 1969—1971

Dun and Bradstrcet samples of the New York area manufacturing establish-

ments employed in Leone's original test of the incubator hypothesis

described n the previous section.


nployment growth rates by age of establishment

     The first and simplest question to examine was whether or not-

there were discernibly different rates of growth in new firms versus

old firms. Table 2 shows employment growth rates in the New York SMSA

by age of establishment.10 The table indicates the extent to which
                     0




     10Note that in the data base used, there is no date of establishment
formation variable for branch plants of manufacturing firms. Branch plant
employment is included in the "1960, earlier and not available" category.
Branches typically account for 13% of New York SMSA manufacturing employment.

growth is associated with establishment age. Throughout the 1967—1971
period, which encompasses both a period of economic bouyancy (1967—69)

and a period of contractioi (1969—71), the oldest estabuiints

experienced employment declines. Employment in the younger plants

was much more volatile, responding quickly to variations in the business

cycle.

     After an initial period of expansion in the first year or two, new

plants ;apparently experience a period of retrenchment. Given that younger

plantsexperience more employment volatility and given that rates of

establishment relocation appear to be sensitive to changing space require-

ments,'1 the question arises whether or not the probability that a plant

will relocate is related to its age. Table 3, which gives the age

distribution of all establishments and those which relocate, indicates

that younger plants are more likely to re1ocate. Also given is the

ratio of these two percentages, where a number greater than one indicates

a higher than average propensity to move.

    iligher rates of relocation for younger establishments, coupled with

the well documented trend toward the decentralization of employment in

the manufacturing sector'2 raises the question as to whether these

younger plants are decentralizing more or less rapidly than their older




     "The sensitivity of the relocation decision to space requirement

    tomorrow's growth in the suburbs?

     Decentrali7ation and New Manufacturing Plants

         There is very little support for the view that new plants which

    incubate in the CBD, after a brief period of incubation, relocate in

    less dense areas outside the central city. As Table 4 shows, quite the

    opposite is the case. The youngest plants (3 years old or less) show

    a greater than average tendency to relocate within the zone of origin;

    i.e., newer firms move shorter distances than older ones.

         Table 4 does suggest that after an initial three—year incubation

    period, some decentralization does occur, primarily to other central

    city areas outside the C]3D. This is also observable in Table 5 which

    shows the destination patterns of relocating plants originating in the

    Core Outside the CBD. Plants three to six years old have a greater

    probability of moving to the Inner Ring.

         Particularly interesting in Table 5 is the relocating pattern of

    the Core area's youngest plants. One and two—year—old plants are quite

    likely to move into the CBD. Both Tables 4 and 5 indicate that younger

    plants change their relocation pattern in short moves. The net effect

    is decentralization. Almost certainly a large number of plants

    incubating in the central city eventually end up in the less dense

    Inner and Outer Ring counties, but our evidence implies that it often takes

    more than one move to get there.'3 In fact, the evidence of core area


         '3The tendency for the relocation of manufacturers to cover relatively
    short distances has been widely observed. See Leone,      cit., Chapter 4:

plants suggests that some recentralization may even take place during

the   early   stages of the life cycle of a typical manufacturing plant.

The   process   is apparently   a complex one   and   as   our data show, not

subject to easy generalization.

       Because   establishn'ent relocation and employment growth are highly
correlated, a final question arises as to whether or not the faster
growing plants incubating in the CBD are decentralizing more rapidly
than other plants. The evidence is contained in Table 6.
       Table 6 indicates, first, that plants relocating outside the zone
of origin generally grow more than those relocating within the zone of
origin. This finding holds for plants originating in the CBD as well.
as others. Further for all plants, growth tends to be greater among newer
      Ltho se
plants)established since 1962). however, those younger plants relocating
outside the zone of origin grow more slowly than their older relocating
counterparts.
    The final column of Table 6 for the first time lends support to
the view that the plants incubating in the CBD are later a source of
growth outside the CBD. The highest rates of growth for relocating
establishments originating in the CBD is experienced for plants over
 three years old with destinations outside the CBD. These were also
 the plants identified in Table 2 as the most likely to decentralize.
 It does appear, therefore, that the most successful plants (measured
 in einloyment growth) incubating in the CBD do move out to lower density
 areas.

                           III.   CONCLUSIONS


    According to the incubator hypothesis, new, small manufacturing

plants might be expected to concentrate in the older areas in central cities

due to the ready availability of low cost easily divisible loft space.

Upon reaching maturity these plants might be expected to decentralize

in keeping with well documented relocation trends. If today's plants

incubating in decaying areas of central cities are a source of growth to

less dense, more recently developed areas in the future, then there are

implications for public policy in the area of urban renewal, local economic

development and even fiscal policy.

     Previous research had demonstrated that the births of new manu-

facturing enterprises were not concentrated in the old cities, as the

incubator hypothesis would suggest. The dynamic aspects of the hypothesis,

however, had not been subjected to empirical test.

     In this paper we have examined the growth and relocation patterns

of a sample of manufacturing firms in the New York metropolitan area.

Stratifing by age of establishment, we were able to add little in the

way of support to the incubator concept. We did observe both higher

growth rates and greater probabilities of establishment relocation for

younger plants, but there was little evidence that these activities were

contributing disproportionately to decentralization. To the contrary,

we found that the younger plants were more likely to relocate within

the zoe of origin.

     After an incubation period lasting on the order of three years, we

did observe that the fastest growing relocating plants originating in

the CBD decentralized with greater frequency than their slower growing
                                 — 14


counterparts. This phenomenon, however, was not peculiar to younger

plants. Relocating firms, generally, tend to move longer distances when

they experience higher rates of employment growth.

     In sum, the formation of new plants is an important contributor to

the economic vitality of urban areas. Firms initially locating in

central areas tend to relocate outside the area slowly. Births of new

plants and their growth and development over time contribute little to

the growing disparities between central area and suburban employment

opportunities.

    While the incubator hypothesis was not confirmed, the evidence

is consistent with a "life cycle" explanation of firm location patterns.

This illustrates the necessity in further research of examining the

characteristics of the locating establishments. Research which focuses

on the location behavior of industries or the characteristics of

geographic areas is incomplete without the consideration of firm

structure and history.
