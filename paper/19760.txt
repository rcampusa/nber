Employer Contribution and Premium Growth in Health Insurance

                                             ABSTRACT

We study whether employer premium contribution schemes could impact the pricing behavior of health
plans and contribute to rising premiums. Using 1991-2011 data before and after a 1999 premium subsidy
policy change in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), we find that the employer
premium contribution scheme has a differential impact on health plan pricing based on two market
incentives: 1) consumers are less price sensitive when they only need to pay part of the premium increase,
and 2) each health plan has an incentive to increase the employer's premium contribution to that plan.
Both incentives are found to contribute to premium growth. Counterfactual simulation shows that
average premium would have been 10% less than observed and the federal government would have
saved 15% per year on its premium contribution had the subsidy policy change not occurred in the
FEHBP.

1        Introduction
The rising cost of health insurance has received enormous attention in the past decade. According to
an annual survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research & Educational
Trust (henceforth known as Kaiser/HRET), the nominal annual premium of employer-sponsored
health insurance has more than doubled from 2001 to 2013, outpacing the rate of inflation every
year. While new medical technology and aging population may explain part of the premium growth
(Schwartz, 1987; Newhouse, 1992, 1993; Chandra and Skinner, 2012), we argue that employer
contribution to health plan premium can be another important driver. Both theoretically and
empirically, we show that a seemingly neutral change of employer contribution scheme can have
unintended consequences on premium growth.
        In the U.S. most employers offer employees health insurance as a fringe benefit for risk pooling
and tax reasons. Employer-sponsored health insurance covers on average 60% of all Americans and
65% of working-age Americans in the last decade (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011). Under employer
sponsorship, one common premium-sharing rule is a capped proportional contribution scheme where
the employer contributes a fixed percentage of the total gross premium up to a dollar maximum,
leaving workers responsible for the rest.1 For example, in the largest employer-sponsored health
insurance program in the U.S., the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the
federal government subsidizes 75% of any plan premium up to a dollar maximum.2 The large share
of employer contribution is not unique in the FEHBP. According to Kaiser/HRET, employers
contribute on average 82% of the premium for single coverage plans and 72% for family coverage
plans in 2011.3
        Researchers have analyzed the role that employer contribution plays in the demand for health
insurance, but very few look at the supply side. To fill this gap, we exploit a shift of employer
contribution scheme in the FEHBP and analyze how premium growth has changed after the shift.
In particular, before 1999, the dollar maximum from the FEHBP employer contribution was defined
as 60% of the simple average premium of the biggest six plans, which we refer to as the “Big Six”
formula. After 1999, a “Fair Share” formula took effect, and the maximum employer contribution
was calculated as 72% of the enrollment-weighted average premium of all health plans in the
program. Not only does this policy change redefine the dollar maximum applicable to all plans,
it changes the influence that each plan may have in defining the dollar maximum. This implies
differential effects on health plans depending on their enrollment in the previous year, thus allowing
us to identify heterogeneous effects of the policy change on premium growth.
    1
     Virtually all employer premium contribution schemes can be viewed as a capped proportional contribution scheme,
given a certain fixed margin and a dollar maximum. When the dollar maximum is very large, we have a simple
proportional contribution scheme given a fixed margin. When the dollar maximum is very small, we have a simple
voucher system where each plan gets the same amount of employer contribution.
   2
     This employer contribution scheme applies to all federal civilian employees, annuitants, and their dependents.
   3
     The average percentage of employer contribution includes those who contribute 100% of the premium.



                                                         1
   Before diving into the data, we present a simple oligopoly model to argue that the employer
contribution scheme can affect health plan pricing via two incentives: first, consumers are less price
sensitive when they only need to pay part of the premium increase; second, each health plan has
an incentive to increase the employer’s premium contribution to that plan. Both incentives can
contribute to premium growth.
   Consistent with the theoretical insights, we have three main empirical findings: 1) due to
differences in consumer price sensitivity below and above the subsidy cap, plans that have charged
below the subsidy cap in the previous year increase their premiums more than those above, 2) the
farther away the plan premium is below the subsidy cap, the faster the premium grows, whereas the
opposite is true for plans above the subsidy cap, and 3) when health plans are able to influence the
employer premium contribution after 1999 through their FEHBP-wide market share, larger plans
above the subsidy cap raise their premiums more, which is consistent with their incentives to push
up the upper limit of the employer contribution.
   Counterfactual analysis shows that average premium would have been 10% less than observed
had the subsidy policy change not occurred in the FEHBP. Due to higher employer premium
contributions under the new “Fair Share” subsidy policy where the maximum employer contribution
is endogenously determined by health plan premiums, the federal government bears most of the
increase in insurance premiums after 1999, and would have saved 15% per year on its premium
contribution toward the FEHBP.
   We believe our results are useful for not only employer-sponsored health insurance but also any
insurance that allows some enrollees to receive government subsidies in insurance premiums. Such
subsidies, if done in a capped proportional scheme, will discourage insurers from charging gross
premiums strictly below the cap. If the cap is endogenously determined by gross premiums set by
insurers, the incentive to raise the premium is even greater because higher premiums can raise the
cap and in turn allow insurers to receive more subsidies from the government. These supply-side
incentives must be taken into account when policy makers design the subsidy scheme and predict
the actual cost of government subsidies.
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the background and reviews
related literature. We present an analytical framework of the health insurance market in Section 3.
We then describe the data set in Section 4, followed by empirical strategies to analyze the effect of
employer premium contribution schemes on health plan pricing as well as the corresponding results.
Counterfactual analysis is presented in Section 5. Section 6 discusses extensions and robustness
checks, and Section 7 concludes.

2     Background
2.1   Employer Premium Contribution
From 1960s to 2010, health care spending in the U.S. has climbed from 6% of the GDP to 18%,
and the share of the expenditure attributable to health insurance costs has soared from 30% to
76% (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2011). As a result, health insurance now plays
a pivotal role in the nation’s health care spending, and this role will only be strengthened with
the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), which mandates universal individual
health insurance coverage since 2014.
    There are many forms of health insurance, the most common being employer-sponsored health
insurance, which covers about 150 million non-elderly people in the U.S. Since employer-sponsored
health insurance has such a wide coverage in the U.S., and employers typically contribute to 70-
80% of health plan premium, it is important to know whether the employer premium contribution
scheme itself can affect both the demand and supply sides of health insurance. Lessons learned
from employer-sponsored health insurance are also useful to many other health insurance programs
that allow premium sharing between individual enrollees and public entities.
    In analyzing the role of employer contribution in health insurance, much of the previous liter-
ature has focused on the demand side. In 1995, Harvard University moved from a linear premium
subsidy scheme, where premiums are subsidized at a certain percentage rate, to a fixed contribu-
tion scheme, where each plan receives the same amount of employer contribution. Using this policy
change, Cutler and Reber (1998) showed that the new fixed contribution scheme induced significant
adverse selection while reducing plan total premiums by 5-8%, thus creating a net effect of welfare
loss from adverse selection. By simulating the effect of lowering the subsidy cap to the lowest plan
premium in the market using data from the FEHBP, Florence and Thorpe (2003) found a similar
yet smaller effect.
    Other than plan selection, researchers have also looked at whether premium subsidy affects
health insurance takeup. In the FEHBP, federal civilian employees used to deduct their out-of-
pocket insurance premiums from their after-tax income. Starting from October 2000, they were
allowed to pay their portion of the premium on a pre-tax basis. After this tax subsidy policy
change, however, Gruber and Washington (2005) found little change in insurance takeup.
    Other studies looking at tax subsidies have generally used data on health insurance takeup
and amount purchased among the self-employed, thanks to recent changes in tax laws on the
deductibility for self-employed health insurance premiums, but many have found mixed results
(e.g., Gruber and Poterba, 1994; Selden, 2009; Heim and Lurie, 2009).
    Despite the abundant evidence on the effect of premium subsidy on the demand for health in-
surance, there is relatively little discussion on the supply side regarding how the employer premium
contribution scheme affects premium growth. According to health benefits surveys of large employ-


                                                 3
ers with more than 200 workers conducted by Kaiser/HRET, the annual growth rate in nominal
employer-sponsored health insurance premiums has consistently outpaced the rate of inflation (see
Figure 1). After deflating the premiums in the FEHBP and comparing its growth rate with GDP
growth, Figure 2 shows that the real premium growth has largely outpaced GDP in the last decade,
even though it grew slower than GDP in the late 1990s.4

      There are undoubtedly many forces behind the persistent growth in health insurance premium.
For example, advances in medical technology are known to contribute to health care spending
growth, which in turn leads to premium growth.5 A number of studies attribute premium growth
to market concentration (e.g., Wholey et al., 1995; Dranove et al., 2003; Dafny et al., 2012).
      Adverse selection and moral hazard of consumers, on the other hand, can also contribute to
rising premiums. Recent work on testing and documenting various forms of information asymmetry
has shown great promise in understanding the complexity of the insurance market (e.g., Finkelstein
and Poterba, 2004; Finkelstein and McGarry, 2006; Einav and Finkelstein, 2011). Relatively few
studies, however, have focused on supply-side moral hazard to look at the direct impact of employer
premium contribution schemes on the pricing strategies of health plans.
      One assumption we make before analyzing the effect of premium contribution schemes on plan
pricing is that employee wages do not adjust immediately to changes in the employer premium

      Real premiums for family plans show a similar trend.

subsidies. The idea of sticky prices or wages goes back to the 1980s when Akerlof and Yellen (1985)
built a model of business cycles incorporating sticky wages. It could be argued in the case of the
FEHBP that the federal government sets rigid pay schedules for all federal employees, and do not
frequently revise them over time. Wage adjustments, even if they do occur, usually apply to the
entire federal work force instead of a certain population.

2.2      Subsidy Policy Change
Effective January 1, 1999, the FEHBP changed the employer contribution scheme for all federal
civilian employees and annuitants, providing a natural laboratory to study the effect of subsidy on
premium growth. Before 1999, the federal government contributed 75% of any plan premium up
to a dollar maximum, determined by 60% of the simple average of the so-called “Big Six” plans.6
Starting in 1999, under provisions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-33), while
the federal government still contributes at most 75% of the gross premium, the new subsidy cap is
determined by a “Fair Share” formula, which is 72% of the enrollment-weighted average premium
of all health plans in the program.
       Each Spring, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), who administers the program, sends
   6
    According to Thorpe et al. (1999), the “Big Six” plans are the two largest national employee association plans,
two largest health maintenance organization (HMO) plans, the Blue Cross Blue Shield high-option plan, as well as a
phantom plan whose premium is calculated each year using the average increase in the other five plans.


                                                                     5
out a “call letter” outlining the basic benefits and reporting requirements, along with any statutory
changes that would apply to the next plan year. The FEHBP has been widely touted as a model for
Medicare reform as well as the most recent state health insurance exchanges mandated by the ACA,
partly due to its simple program design that allows market competition and low administrative cost.
The OPM does not actively negotiate premiums with plans or solicit competitive bids (Feldman
et al., 2002). Once a private health plan meets the basic requirements stipulated by OPM, it can
participate in the FEHBP.
    One paper that discusses premium growth in relation to employer premium contribution schemes
is by Thorpe et al. (1999), who showed that in the FEHBP, among plans whose employer contribu-
tion was below the subsidy cap, premiums rose at least five percentage points faster annually from
1992 to 1999 than plans above it. Nevertheless, their paper did not analyze the effect of the 1999
subsidy policy change.
    By incorporating this policy change and extending the study period to 2011, we contribute to
the previous literature in two ways. First, under a simple duopoly model, we show that there are
two market incentives at play that contribute to growth in employer-sponsored health insurance
premiums. Second, we present empirical evidence that supports these two market incentives and
analyze their impact on health plan premium growth.


3     Model
This section presents a simple differentiated oligopoly model with logit demand, in order to highlight
the role of employer contribution in health insurance pricing. The first subsection presents a
model with J plans and derives implications from the first order condition. The second subsection
simulates how equilibrium solutions change when the FEHBP subsidy rule changes from “Big Six”
to “Fair Share.” The simulation is done for a market with J = 2 plans for the purpose of illustration.

3.1   Basic Set Up
On the demand side, consider consumer i whose utility function from consuming health plan j
depends on the net premium she needs to pay (P̃j ), other plan characteristics (αj ) and an i.i.d.
error term that is assumed to follow a type 1 extreme value distribution (εij ):



                                       Uij = αj − βj P̃j + εij ,                                  (1)

Given a choice set of J plans, consumers choose a health plan that yields the highest utility. Since
the consumer base in the data set is composed of those who choose a plan every year, we do not




                                                  6
consider an outside option here.7
    Given this utility formulation, the logit demand model computes the share of plan j in a local
market relative to the other alternatives as

                                                    exp(αj − βj P̃j )
                                     Sj = P                                        ,
                                              j 0 =1,...,J exp(αj 0 − βj 0 P̃j 0 )


    If the employer contributes 1 − θ fraction of any plan’s gross premium (Pj ) up to a dollar
maximum (M AX), the net premium an employee pays can be expressed as

                                        P̃j = max(θPj , Pj − M AX).

In the case of the FEHBP, θ = 0.25. In the case of Medicaid where enrollees are too poor to
share any premium, θ = 0. In the individual insurance market where enrollees must pay for plan
premiums in full, θ = 1. Most employer-sponsored health insurance plans have 0 < θ < 1, and so
do the Medicare Part D plans or plans to be offered in the health insurance exchanges following
the 2010 ACA, if individual enrollees qualify for government subsidy.
    To help illustrate, we define the maximum gross premium a plan can charge, while still being
subsidized at the 1 − θ margin by the employer, to be the “subsidy cap” ( M1−θ
                                                                            AX
                                                                               ). For plans who set
their gross premiums below the subsidy cap, consumers pay P̃j = θPj , whereas for plans with gross
premiums above the subsidy cap, consumers pay P̃j = Pj − M AX. Therefore, the newly defined
subsidy cap acts as a cutoff point for health plan gross premiums in terms of maximum subsidy
benefits.
    On the supply side, plan j faces a constant marginal cost of Cj and chooses a gross premium
Pj to maximize its profit

                                         πj = Pj Dj (P̃ ) − Cj Dj (P̃ ),                                      (2)

where Dj is the demand for plan j, which depends on the net premium P̃ of all plans.
    If we normalize the market size to one, the demand for a health plan is equal to its market
share, Dj = Sj . Therefore, if an interior solution exists, the optimal price must satisfy the first
order condition (FOC). When the employer subsidizes health plan premiums by a fraction 1 − θ,
the FOC can be rewritten as:

                                                                1
                                           P j = Cj +                   .                                     (3)
                                                          θβj (1 − Sj )
   7
     In the data set we later use for empirical analysis, the percentage of employees who opt out of the employer-
sponsored health insurance offered by the FEHBP remains roughly the same over time.




                                                          7
where

                                                       exp(αj − θβj Pj )
                                        Sj = P                                        .
                                                j 0 =1,2,...J exp(αj 0 − θβj 0 Pj 0 )

      The FOC has two implications. First, taking the other plans’ premiums as given, it can be shown
       ∂Pj
that    ∂θ   < 0. In other words, plan j has an incentive to lower its gross premium if employees are
required to pay a higher fraction of the premium. This result is intuitive: the bigger the employee
contribution (θ), the more disutility an employee gets from a marginal increase in the gross premium,
and the more elastic the demand will be for plan j.8
      For any employer contribution scheme that pays a fraction of gross premium up to a dollar
maximum, the fraction of the employee contribution is 0 < θ < 1 if a plan’s gross premium is
below the employer’s subsidy cap. This fraction becomes θ = 1 if a plan’s gross premium is above
the subsidy cap. The FOC implies that, everything else being equal, every plan faces less elastic
demand below the subsidy cap and therefore has more incentive to raise the premium when it is
below the cap than above the cap. This is essentially the incentive of “chasing the cap” as described
in Thorpe et al. (1999).
      The second implication of the FOC is that prices are strategic complements among competing
                              ∂Pj
plans. Mathematically,        ∂Pk    > 0, ∀k 6= j. This implies that when one plan lowers its premium, all
other plans would lower their premiums as well. In a symmetric equilibrium where every plan faces
the same parameters (Cj = C and βj = β) and charges the same premium (P ∗ ), we can derive that
                              ∂P ∗
P∗ = C +         J
              θβ(J−1)   and    ∂J    < 0. Obviously, the equilibrium premium declines with the number of
plans as one would expect in a differentiated oligopoly, but this does not alter the fact that the
                                                                                          ∂P ∗
equilibrium price declines with the fraction of employee contribution                      ∂θ    < 0 for all J ≥ 2.

3.2     From Big Six to Fair Share
The above basic set up confirms the argument that everything else being equal, plans face less
elastic demand below the subsidy cap than above the cap, and therefore have incentives to “chase
the cap” from below (Thorpe et al., 1999). This incentive always exists no matter how the employer
determines the subsidy cap. However, when the FEHBP switched from “Big Six” to “Fair Share”,
the “Fair Share” formula allows every plan to influence the exact magnitude of the cap. In contrast,
“Big Six” plans on average only make up 2.5% of the total available health plans in the FEHBP
during 1991-2011.9 To capture the incentive difference between these two schemes, we now simulate
equilibrium solutions for a simple market with J = 2 plans, where both plans take the cap as
exogenously given in the “Big Six” scheme but recognize their power in influencing the cap in the
“Fair Share” scheme.

    Demand elasticity of plan j is ∂lnPjj = − j j Sj j .

    The market share of “Big Six” ranges from 1.4% to 4.3% depending on the year.

       Following Aravindakshan and Ratchford (2011), Appendix A shows that each plan’s first order
condition can be rewritten using the Lambert W function, which can be numerically approxi-
mated.10

3.2.1      Big Six

Under the “Big Six” formula before 1999, we assume both plans are non-Big-Six plans who treat
the dollar maximum of FEHBP contribution as an exogenous constant (c). The subsidy cap is
defined as dollar maximum/.75, which is equal to c/.75.
       In each period, plan 1 submits a premium bid of P1 . When plan 1 prices above the subsidy cap,
consumers pay a net premium of P1 − c; when plan 1 prices below the subsidy cap, consumers pay
.25P1 .
       Similarly, plan 2 can also price below or above the cap, which gives us four cases to consider.
Below we present simulated solutions in the case where plan 1 prices above and plan 2 prices below
the subsidy cap. Appendix B presents equilibrium solutions in the remaining three cases.
       In this case of P1 ≥ subsidy cap and P2 ≤ subsidy cap, consumers pay a net premium of
P̃1 = P1 − c for plan 1 and P̃2 = .25P2 for plan 2. We have a constrained optimization problem
with the inequality conditions P1 −c/.75 ≥ 0 and P2 −c/.75 ≤ 0. Since only plan 1’s price constraint
has the argument P1 in it, the Lagrangian function of plan 1’s profit maximization problem can be
written as:

                                L(P1 , λ) = (P1 − C1 )D1 + λ(P1 − c/.75).

The FOC of the interior solution when the constraint does not bind (P1 > c/.75) is

                                                             1
                                          P1 = C1 +                 ,                                 (4)
                                                       β1 (1 − S1 )

and its market share is

                                             exp(α1 − β1 (P1 − c))
                            S1 =                                               .                      (5)
                                   exp(α1 − β1 (P1 − c)) + exp(α2 − .25β2 P2 )

       Following Appendix A, we derive the best response function of plan 1 and its market share in
terms of P2 as follows:

                                                      1 + W (x)
                                          P1∗ = C1 +            ,                                     (6)
                                                         β1
                                                   W (x)
                                           S1∗ =           ,                                          (7)
                                                 1 + W (x)
  10
    The Lambert W function is defined as W (x), which is the inverse function associated with the equation
W (x)eW (x) = x.

where P1 > c/.75, P2 ≤ c/.75, and x =                             . When plan 1’s constraint binds,
                                           exp(α2 − .25β2 P2 )
we have the corner solution P1∗ = c/.75. Similar derivation applies to plan 2.
      Since the Lambert W function can be numerically approximated, we plot the best response
functions of plan 1 and plan 2 in Figure 3 when the dollar maximum c = 100, after initiating some
parameter values.11 There is a kink in each plan’s best response function because of the constraint
that plan 1 prices above the subsidy cap, which is equal to c/.75 = 100/.75 = 133.3, and plan 2
prices below the subsidy cap. When we set the dollar maximum c to be smaller, such as the actual
1998 biweekly dollar maximum level (c = 66) observed in the FEHBP for self-only plans, plan 2
would price at the subsidy cap (c/.75 = 88) at all times (see Figure 4).

3.2.2      Fair Share

After 1999, the dollar maximum of employer contribution is set at 72% of the enrollment-weighted
average of all plan premiums. If we denote the lagged program-wide market share (or enrollment
weight) of the two plans as w1 and w2 , respectively, the maximum employer contribution can now

be expressed as .72(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ). As a result, the maximum gross premium a plan can charge
that is still subsidized at the 75% margin, namely the subsidy cap, is .72(w1 P1 + w2 P2 )/.75 =
.96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ).
   Again, depending on whether plan 2 chooses to price above or below the subsidy cap, plan 1’s
profit function can change. Given the new subsidy cap policy, however, it is not possible for both
plans to price below the subsidy cap. We briefly present the solutions to the profit maximization
problem of plan 1 in the case of P1 ≥ subsidy cap and P2 ≤ subsidy cap below, leaving the remaining
cases to Appendix B. Similar derivation applies to plan 2.
   After the policy change, since the subsidy cap is now .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ), when plan 1 prices
above the subsidy cap and plan 2 prices below, we have two inequality constraints:

                                            P1 ≥ .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ),
                                            P2 ≤ .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ).

   It turns out that only the second constraint is needed since it automatically implies the first
one. The net premiums consumers pay for plan 1 and plan 2 are P̃1 = P1 − .72(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ) and



                                                       11
P̃2 = .25P2 , respectively. The Lagrangian function of plan 1’s profit maximization problem can be
written as:

                           L(P1 , λ) = (P1 − C1 )D1 + λ(.96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ) − P2 ).

Consider the interior solution first. When the constraint does not bind, the FOC of plan 1 is

                                                             1
                                     P 1 = C1 +                            ,                          (8)
                                                  β1 (1 − .72w1 )(1 − S1 )

where

                                    exp(α1 − β1 (P1 − .72(w1 P1 + w2 P2 )))
                  S1 =                                                                  .             (9)
                          exp(α1 − β1 (P1 − .72(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ))) + exp(α2 − .25β2 P2 )

Solving the above simultaneous equations, we get the following closed form solution to be plan 1’s
best response function and market share, in terms of P2 :

                                                      1 + W (x)

                                               1 + W (x)

                                       exp(α1 − 1 − β1 (1 − .72w1 )C1 )
where P2 < .96(w1 P1∗ + w2 P2 ) and x =                                 .
                                       exp(α2 − (.25β2 + .72w2 β1 )P2 )
    When the constraint binds, the corner solution in this case is P2 = .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ), or
P2      .96w1
    =            . Plugging the above expression into plan 1’s market share expression in (9), we
P1    1 − .96w2
derive the following corner solution:

                      1 − .96w2
              P1∗ =             P2 ,                                                                 (12)

                                                                 2

                                                      2




Similar derivation applies to plan 2.
   When drawing the best response functions, in addition to using the same parameter values as
in Section 3.2.1 before the subsidy policy change, we present simulations in two settings: one has
w1 = .8 and w2 = .2, and the other has w1 = w2 = .5. The contrast of these two market settings
sheds light on the importance of the lagged global market shares that now enter the equilibrium
conditions. As shown in Figure 5, both best response functions move as the lagged market shares
change. Again, the kinks in both plans’ best response functions are due to the constraint that plan
1 prices above the subsidy cap and plan 2 prices below. The new equilibrium price levels of both
plans are lower in the case of w1 = w2 = .5 than in the case of w1 = .8 and w2 = .2.

   What role does the lagged market share play in a plan’s pricing behavior under the “Fair Share”
scheme? Taking P2 as given, plan 1 would set an optimal price (P1∗ ) depending on the subsidy
policy. Before 1999, plan 1 (a non-Big-Six plan) takes the dollar maximum (c) as given in addition
to P2 . After 1999, however, the dollar maximum becomes endogenous in that each plan has some
weight in determining its level: the larger the plan’s market share, the more influence it has on
setting the dollar maximum.
   When plan 1 prices above the subsidy cap and plan 2 prices below, we have

                           ∂P1∗     .72C1     W (x)    .72β1 (1 + W (x))

           exp(α1 − 1 − β1 (1 − .72w1 )C1 )
where x =                                   . The intuition behind this result is that if plan 1 prices
           exp(α2 − (.25β2 + .72w2 β1 )P2 )
above the subsidy cap and has a large market share, it will have an incentive to increase its premium
bid for the upcoming year, which could in turn help raise the upcoming subsidy cap given plan 1’s
large weight in determining the dollar maximum. We refer to this incentive as “raising the cap.”
   In comparison, plan 2, which prices below the subsidy cap, faces a different situation. Taking

               exp(α1 − β1 (1 − .72w1 )P1 )
   The intuitive reason for the negative sign here, as opposed to the positive sign derived earlier
in the case of plan 1, is that a low enrollment weight of plan 2 indicates a large enrollment weight
enjoyed by plan 1. The smaller the plan’s market share is, the more it anticipates plan 1 to raise
the premium. Because prices are strategic complements and there is an incentive to chase the cap
from below, the smaller the plan is, the more it raises its own price to keep up with the subsidy
cap. Taken together, this explains why in Figure 5, we observe lower equilibrium prices when the
two plans share the market equally than when plan 1 enjoys a larger market share than plan 2.

3.3   Policy Experiment
Keeping the same parameter values described in Section 3.2.1, we conduct a policy experiment to
see how the change from “Big Six” to “Fair Share” could affect the equilibrium prices of the two
plans in the market.
   We simulate three scenarios in Table 1. In Scenario 1, both plans choose their own equilibrium
gross premium while taking the exogenous dollar maximum c as given (c = 66 is the actual 1998
biweekly dollar maximum level in the FEHBP). To facilitate comparison with other scenarios, we
assume the cost and demand parameters are such that plan 2 sets its gross premium at the subsidy
cap (P2∗ = c/.75 = 88). With the values of c and P2∗ , we can derive P1∗ based on plan 1’s best
response function. It turns out that P1∗ = 107.8.
   In Scenario 2, we change the way the dollar maximum is determined from the “Big Six” formula
to the “Fair Share” formula, assuming there is no behavioral change in health plans. When w1 = .8
and w2 = .2, we derive the new dollar maximum c = .72(.8P1∗ + .2P2∗ ), and combine this equation
with the FOCs under the “Big Six” formula to calculate the “naive” equilibrium price levels P1∗ and
P2∗ . The reason we phrase these new equilibrium price levels as “naive” is that we are assuming
the two plans would consider the dollar maximum exogenous as before and therefore react in the
same way as the pre-1999 case facing a new c0 . Simulation suggests that this will lead to a new
equilibrium with higher premiums in both plans (P1∗ = 116.7 and P2∗ = 99.7).
   Scenario 3 describes the real situation of “Fair Share.” After the policy change in 1999, the
two plans now choose their price levels taking into account the fact that the dollar maximum is

now a function of their own prices. As a result, their best response functions are dependent on
their lagged market shares w1 and w2 . As shown in Table 1, the equilibrium premiums of both
plans are higher than the “naive” prices after we let the plans internalize the maximum employer
contribution (P1∗ = 146.3 and P2∗ = 101.7). Dollar maximum and subsidy cap increase accordingly.
   Overall, the simple oligopoly model presented above highlights two pricing incentives of employer-
sponsored health plans: first, plans below the subsidy cap face less elastic demand and therefore
have extra incentives to charge gross premiums up to the cap. In the FEHBP, one dollar increase
in gross premium will require one more dollar of out-of-pocket enrollee payment if a plan charges
above the subsidy cap, but the enrollee payment only increases by 25 cents if a plan charges below
the cap. This difference in consumer price sensitivity creates an incentive of “chasing the cap” from
below. The second incentive is raising the cap if a plan’s own premium has a large positive influence
on the subsidy cap. This implies that, in the FEHBP’s “Fair Share” scheme, plans with a larger
FEHBP-wide market share last year will have a stronger incentive to increase its own premium in
order to raise the cap. Because prices are strategic complements, one plan’s incentive to increase
its premium will motivate competing plans to increase premiums even further. The raised subsidy
cap also reinforces the incentive to chase the cap from below. As a result, strategic interactions
among competing health plans, the incentive to “chase the cap” from below and the incentive to
“raise the cap”, reinforce each other to promote premium growth under the “Fair Share” scheme.

4         Empirical Analysis
4.1        Data
Our data come from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), who oversees the FEHBP. The
plan-level dataset contains information on various characteristics of all health plans offered in the
FEHBP during 1991-2011. Although the subsidy policy change applies to both federal civilian
employees and annuitants in self-only as well as family plans, we focus on federal civilian employees
under age 65 who enroll in self plans only, due to other possible health insurance coverage (such as
Medicare) faced by annuitants and the lack of information on dependents among those who enroll
in family plans.12
         Each year, the OPM contracts with over 200 plans. A health plan in a certain year is defined
as a unique combination of a federal plan code and an option code (high or standard). If a plan
is fee-for-service (FFS), it is offered nationwide and open to anyone covered by the FEHBP. A
managed care (non-FFS) plan, however, is associated primarily with one state, and only residents
within that state, or sometimes within certain counties, can enroll.

4.2        Testable Predictions and Empirical Strategy
Recall that our model predicts an incentive to chase the cap from below for all years and an incentive
to raise the cap after the FEHBP adopted the “Fair Share” formula in 1999. This facilitates two
comparisons: the difference between plans above and below the subsidy cap captures the first
incentive, and the difference before and after 1999 captures the second incentive. Moreover, we can
calculate how much a plan is below the cap and how large a plan’s market share is in the entire
FEHBP program. These continuous measures allow us to assess the strength of the two incentives.
         Before we carry these intuition to the real data, it is worth noting that the data departs from
the model in several ways. First, our model takes the subsidy cap as exogenously given under
the “Big Six” scheme, and endogenizes the subsidy cap under the “Fair Share” scheme. In either
scheme, all health plans (including the Big Six) choose their own premiums simultaneously and
do not know the concurrent subsidy cap for sure when they report their premiums to the OPM.
This implies that regressing plan premiums on whether or not a premium ends up being above or
below the current subsidy cap is subject to a serious endogeneity problem. However, every plan
does observe last year’s subsidy cap. A plan that was below last year’s subsidy cap has reasons
to believe that it faces a lower demand elasticity than an above-cap plan, because every dollar of
premium increase implies 75 cents more in subsidies from the federal government and 25 cents more
in out-of-pocket payments from enrollees. According to our model, a below-cap plan should have a
greater incentive to raise its premium this year than an above-cap plan. This motivates us to use
    12
    FEHBP plans charge both civilian (non-postal) and postal federal employees the same gross premium, but the
government subsidizes at a much higher margin (around 85% in 2012) for postal workers.



                                                     16
premium growth as the dependent variable, and create the dummy variable of below cap based on
whether a plan was below or above last year’s subsidy cap.
       Additionally, our model emphasizes market equilibrium in a single year but many plans exist
in the FEHBP for many years. In both theoretical and empirical analyses, we assume away plans’
dynamic incentives such as setting a low premium in one year in order to attract new employees
and then raising the premium next year when existing enrollees are reluctant to switch. While
switching costs are important in health insurance, we argue that this dynamic incentive is similar
across all plans and therefore can be controlled by year fixed effects.
       With these limitations in mind, we propose three specifications, each focusing on a separate
channel through which the employer subsidy policy can affect the pricing strategies of health plans.
The impact from local competition is taken into account in all specifications by introducing the
lagged number of plans in a local market as well as a plan’s lagged local market share.
       To check whether the capped subsidy system affects plans below or above the subsidy cap
differently, we estimate the first baseline regression model as follows:

                 ∆Pjst = β0 + β1 P ostt + β2 Belowjs,t−1 + β3 Belowjs,t−1 × P ostt
                                                                                                              (14)
                                                                       0
                             + β4 P lanss,t−1 + β5 LocalSharejs,t−1 + Xjst Γ + θs + jst .

The unit of observation in the equation above is plan j in state s and year t. As argued above,
demand elasticity is related to marginal change of premium, so our dependent variable, ∆Pjst =
Pjst − Pjs,t−1 , is the first difference in real biweekly gross premium of each plan.
       The Postt dummy variable takes on a value of one for years greater than or equal to 1999. The
Belowjs,t−1 dummy variable indicates whether plan j in state s prices below the subsidy cap in
year t − 1. We also include an interaction term between Postt and Belowjs,t−1 in order to capture
any differential impact before and after the subsidy policy change. The variables Planss,t−1 and
LocalSharejs,t−1 indicate the total number of self-only plans and plan j’s local market share in state
s and year t − 1.13
       Local market structure (P lanss,t−1 ) and a plan’s local market power (LocalSharejs,t−1 ) are
both lagged because when plans submit their premium bids for year t in April of year t − 1, they
do not yet have the market-specific characteristics in year t available to them. As a result, we
assume they decide how much to increase premium next year based on the existing information in
the previous year.
       The plan control variables Xjst include dummy variables such as whether the plan is “Big Six”,
FFS, high option, and whether it has a companion high or standard option. Additionally, we collect
plan benefits and quality measures from the annual Guide to Federal Employees Health Benefits
Plans distributed by OPM. Because our dependent variable is premium change from the previous
  13
    In order to capture health plan competition within the local market only, we do not include the nation-wide FFS
plans in the calculation of the number of local plans.



                                                        17
year, these benefits enter the equation as changes in outpatient copay, hospital deductible, generic
and brand drug copay, as well as each plan’s national accreditation status in the regressions.
Last but not least, we include state fixed effects, θs , to control for time-invariant state-specific
characteristics.
   The coefficient β2 in equation (14) tells us whether plans below the subsidy cap raise premiums
faster than plans above, and β3 indicates whether after the subsidy policy change, the sign and
magnitude of that difference stay the same. Coefficients β4 and β5 capture local competition effect.
   In the second specification, we introduce into the equation the distance of how far away the
plan’s lagged gross premium is from last year’s subsidy cap (Distancejs,t−1 ), and interact it with
whether the lagged premium is below or above the subsidy cap, as well as whether it is before or
after the policy change. The second estimation equation can be written as follows:

                   ∆Pjst = β0 + β1 P ostt + β2 Belowjs,t−1 + β3 Belowjs,t−1 × P ostt
                              + Distancejs,t−1 × {β4 Belowjs,t−1 × P ret
                              + β5 Abovejs,t−1 × P ret + β6 Belowjs,t−1 × P ostt                (15)
                              + β7 Abovejs,t−1 × P ostt } + β8 P lanss,t−1
                                                       0
                              + β9 LocalSharejs,t−1 + Xjst Γ + θs + jst

The dummy variables Belowjs,t−1 and Abovejs,t−1 indicate whether plan j in state s prices below or
above the subsidy cap, the dummy Pret is an indicator for whether the year is before 1999. Com-
pared to the baseline specification, equation (15) has the added independent variables estimated by
β4 through β7 , indicating how premium growth are affected by how far a plan was below or above
the subsidy cap in the previous year before and after the policy change.
   Next we look at whether the plan’s program-wide global market share, as opposed to its local
market share, could impact its pricing behavior after the policy change. Since the subsidy cap
before 1999 is the simple average premium of the “Big Six” plans regardless of the enrollment
pattern of the remaining plans, we do not expect a plan’s lagged global market share to play a role
in influencing premium growth before 1999 unless the plan itself is one of the “Big Six.” After all,
we have already included the plan’s local market share in the regression model. After the policy
change, however, the subsidy cap is determined by an enrollment-weighted average of all plan
premiums in the program, which would potentially have a differential impact on plans of different
enrollment sizes, or global market shares. Therefore, we specify the third estimation equation as




                                                  18
follows:

                    ∆Pjst = β0 + β1 P ostt + β2 Belowjs,t−1 + β3 Belowjs,t−1 × P ostt
                                + GlobalSharejs,t−1 × {β4 Belowjs,t−1 × P ret
                                + β5 Abovejs,t−1 × P ret + β6 Belowjs,t−1 × P ostt                             (16)
                                + β7 Abovejs,t−1 × P ostt } + β8 P lanss,t−1
                                                         0
                                + β9 LocalSharejs,t−1 + Xjst Γ + θs + jst

The global market share of plan j in state s and year t − 1, GlobalSharejs,t−1 , is calculated as
the percentage of enrollees choosing plan j among all federal civilian employees in the FEHBP
who enroll in self-only plans.14 Comparing equation (16) with (14), we are now allowing a plan’s
lagged global market share to play a role in determining next year’s premium, with potentially
heterogeneous effects depending on whether the plan prices above or below the subsidy cap, and
whether it occurs before or after the policy change.
       In all three regression specifications discussed above, due to the inclusion of the Post dummy
variable, which is equal to one for all years greater than or equal to 1999, we do not include year fixed
effects. In order to account for macroeconomic shocks such as advances in medical technology and
an aging population, we need to introduce some time trends. As a result, for all three specifications,
we add separate linear time trends before and after the policy change, and later year fixed effects
(after getting rid of the Post dummy) as model variants. In an attempt to control for time-invariant
characteristics at the plan code level, we also try including plan code fixed effects in lieu of state
fixed effects.

4.3       Evidence From the Raw Data
Table 2 provides the descriptive statistics for average plan characteristics of all years. The average
annual premium in nominal terms increases in most years, as does the subsidy cap. The average
annual growth rates of real premiums and the subsidy cap are close in magnitude. This is reasonable
because the subsidy cap for the new plan year is determined by the premium bids submitted by
insurance plans, whether through a simple average before 1999 or an enrollment-weighted average
after 1999.
       At the same time, the total number of plans increased in the late 1990s, before falling back in the
early 2000s due to mergers and consolidation among health maintenance organization (HMO) plans.
Figure 6 plots the growth rate of real premiums along with the average number of health plans per
  14
    We choose the denominator to be the total number of federal civilian enrollees in the FEHBP who choose self-only
plans because the new subsidy policy effective in 1999 uses the same methodology to calculate enrollment weights for
the subsidy cap. However, since the new subsidy cap also takes into account enrollment among postal workers when
calculating the enrollment-weighted average, our measure is an approximation of the program-wide market share
since our plan data does not include those for postal workers.

   Over time, the percentage of plans who price below the subsidy cap decreased (see Figure
7), meaning more plans have caught up with the subsidy cap and are taking full advantage of
maximum premium contribution from the employer. Table 3 tabulates the real premium growth
rate of plans who priced below versus above the subsidy cap. We see a clear pattern that plans who
priced below the subsidy cap in the previous year choose to grow faster than plans pricing above,
especially before 1999, confirming the findings by Thorpe et al. (1999). After 2000, however, the
difference between the two diminished.
   One concern is that plans below the subsidy cap could grow faster than plans above merely
due to their lower base premium. Therefore, we also graph the average premium change for plans
above and below the subsidy cap over time in Figure 8, which shows that plans below did increase
their premiums more on average than those above, although that difference diminished after 1999.
   Ideally, we would like to explicitly control for aggregated demographic characteristics of enrollees
under each health plan such as their age, gender, education, and salary. Unfortunately, we only have
enrollees’ demographic information in the FEHBP from years 1991-2000. By examining enrollee
characteristics during 1991-2000, however, we find very little change in the aggregate demographic
composition of federal employees. It is understandable since the population of federal employees
remains fairly stable over time.

4.4      Evidence from Regressions
Recall that when a plan prices below the subsidy cap the employer subsidizes 75% of the gross
premium, and consumers only pay 25 cents of every one-dollar increase in the gross premium. On
the other hand, when a plan prices above the subsidy cap, the employer subsidizes a fixed dollar
maximum, and a one-dollar increase in the gross premium in this case will be fully borne by the
consumer. As a result, considering the different price sensitivities faced by consumers, health plans
will price accordingly depending on whether they are above or below the subsidy cap.
      Echoing the results presented in Table 3, the consumer sensitivity OLS estimates in Table 4
from regression equation (14) show that before 1999, plans below the subsidy cap would increase
their real biweekly premiums by $5 to $8 more on average compared to plans above the cap, which
is around $130 to $208 per person per year.15 After 1999, however, the average biweekly increase
seen in plans below the cap is only around $2 more than plans above, which translates into a $52
increase per year. Therefore, even though premiums among plans below the subsidy cap still grow
faster than plans above after the policy change, the magnitude is largely dampened.
      The coefficient on the lagged number of plans turns out to be negative as expected, indicating
that local competition can keep premium growth in check. One caveat is that although statistically
significant, the magnitude of the impact from local competition is relatively small – one more plan

explanation is that plans within a local market are differentiated enough that they are able to
limit the effect of competition, which is also why larger plans seem to be able to charge higher
premiums, as the local market share of a plan is positively correlated with the level of premium
increase. Another explanation is that due to little switching among enrollees, large plans are able
to capture more consumers even if they raise prices.
   The Post dummy is positive and significant at the 1% level, showing that real biweekly plan
premiums increase around $11 more on average after the “Fair Share” formula took effect, which
is an annual increase of $286, even after taking into account separate linear time trends for the two
time periods before and after 1999. The Post dummy has to be omitted in the third and fourth
columns when we include year fixed effects in the model, but all the other regression coefficients
remain relatively stable.
   The results from the second specification, as shown in Table 5, indicate that conditional on
pricing below the subsidy cap, the farther away a plan is from the cap, the faster it grows. After
controlling for plan code fixed effects, for plans below the subsidy cap before 1999, being one
more dollar away from the cap translates roughly into an additional 36-cent increase in biweekly
premium next year, or around $10 annually, ceteris paribus. On the other hand, the opposite is
true for plans above the subsidy cap, as all of the coefficients are negative. After 1999, however,
the effect of distance from the subsidy cap on premium growth is largely dampened for all plans,

   In terms of global market share, the results in Table 6 are as expected in that the program-
wide enrollment share of a plan did not influence its premium growth before 1999, whereas the
coefficients are significant at the 1% level after the policy change when we include state and year
fixed effects. In column 4, the sign and the magnitude of the coefficient for the above-cap plans
after 1999 indicate that a 1% increase in the global market share of an above-cap plan would lead to
an almost 20-cent increase in the plan’s biweekly gross premium next year, which is approximately


                                                          26
a $5 increase in annual premium. Moreover, the signs of the coefficients for the effect of global
market share among below-cap plans after 1999 are consistent with theory predictions.

   In all three specifications, the regression coefficients do not change much across different models
as indicated by each separate column. In column two we include separate linear time trends for
before and after the policy change, in column three we present estimates including year fixed effects,
and in column four we drop state fixed effects and include plan code fixed effects instead. It is
possible that plans of the same plan code but different option code (high or standard) tend to


                                                           27
follow the same pricing strategy over time, therefore we estimate clustered standard errors of the
coefficients by allowing correlation within the same plan code.
         In addition, we test for serial correlation using the method derived by Wooldridge (2001) for
linear panel-data models. For all model variants in the first and third regression specifications
presented in Tables 4 and 6, the null hypothesis that there is no first-order autocorrelation cannot
be rejected. For the second specification, however, the null hypothesis is rejected, which means
that the standard errors reported in Table 5 could be understated.
         As a result, we re-estimate the second regression specification involving the distance of the
premium from the subsidy cap by allowing an AR(1) process in the error term. It turns out that
all the variables in interest still bear the same sign as in Table 5 and are statistically significant,
with the only difference being coefficients having larger magnitudes.


5         Counterfactual Simulation
In the following counterfactual analysis, we simulate the trajectory of the average annual gross
premium in the FEHBP had the pre-1999 subsidy policy remained in effect, or had the health
plans not changed their pricing strategies facing the new subsidy policy.16 First, we estimate the
following regression model using the pre-1999 data set, with the same set of plan control variables
(Xjst ) mentioned in Section 4 as well as both state (θs ) and year (ηt ) fixed effects:

                    ∆Pjst = β0 + β1 Belowjs,t−1 + Distancejs,t−1 × {β2 Belowjs,t−1
                               + β3 Abovejs,t−1 } + β4 P lanss,t−1 + β5 LocalSharejs,t−1                     (17)
                                  0
                               + Xjst Γ + θs + ηt + jst

         One way to take into account the time trend for post-1999 counterfactual premium prediction
is to introduce a linear trend. However, we know from reality that the time trend is far from linear.
In order to better model how the average premium changes over time after 1999, we calculate the
post-1999 year fixed effects using the average percentage increase in health insurance premiums
observed in large firms that sponsor health insurance programs during years 1999-2011. These
average growth rates of large firms are reported in annual Kaiser/HRET surveys of employer-
sponsored health benefits.17
         In the post-1999 prediction equation, we use the simulated real gross premiums to produce
the counterfactual subsidy cap, in order to determine independent variables such as Belowjs,t−1
and the two interaction terms that involve Distancejs,t−1 . Based on either the pre-1999 “Big Six”
formula or the post-1999 “Fair Share” formula, we first calculate the counterfactual subsidy cap,
    16
    Same as before, premiums here are deflated using CPI and expressed in year 2000 dollars.
    17
    Before 2008, we took the average growth rates for large firms with 5,000 or more workers. After 2008, however,
only growth rates for large firms with 200 or more workers are reported.



                                                       28
then determine whether the health plans price below or above the subsidy cap, and finally find out
the distance of these simulated premiums to the counterfactual “Big Six” or “Fair Share” subsidy
cap. For other plan and state characteristics, however, we use the actual data from years 1999-2011.
The regression coefficients are taken directly from equation (17) above in order to maintain the
pre-1999 data generating process.
   Figure 9 shows the counterfactual trajectories of the average annual real gross premium after
1999 along with the actual real premium observed in the data set. It is clear that the counterfactual
average premiums using both formulas stay below the actual premium throughout the post-1999
period, albeit being pretty close during 2007-2008. The mean dollar difference between the actual
real premium and the simulated counterfactual real premium is around $320 under the “Big Six”
formula and $290 under the “Fair Share” formula per person per year, which means that average
premium in the FEHBP would have been around 10% less than observed after 1999.

   We also plot the maximum annual employer contribution in real dollars after 1999 under differ-

          Notes: We consider two counterfactual scenarios based on either the “Big Six” or the
          “Fair Share” formula in order to determine the counterfactual subsidy cap after 1999.

   Finally, Figures 11 and 12 plot the actual versus predicted average annual employee and em-
ployer contribution for all years after the subsidy policy change. It appears that employees would
have contributed the most amount of premium had the pre-1999 “Big Six” subsidy policy stayed
in effect, whereas the employer would have incurred the least premium contribution costs among
the three scenarios. In comparison, if the “Fair Share” formula took effect in 1999, but the health
plans did not adjust their pricing behavior – meaning if they kept their pre-1999 pricing strategies
– then we would have seen a similar level of average employee premium contribution to the actual
figures, while at the same time the employer would still have contributed less.
   The average difference between the actual and counterfactual annual employer contribution in
year 2000 dollars is around $350 under the “Big Six” formula and $250 under the “Fair Share”
formula per person per year. In percentage terms, the $350 savings in annual subsidies represent
a 15% drop in average employer contribution. If we assume that the same counterfactual results
apply to family plans, and we consider the fact that the FEHBP covers 9 million enrollees, then
the new subsidy policy is costing the federal government $3.15 billion a year.
   Under the “Fair Share” formula, market incentives exist such that large above-cap plans want

                                                                                                 30
to increase their premiums, while at the same time below-cap plans want to catch up with the
subsidy cap. Taken together, the new “Fair Share” subsidy policy in the FEHBP seems to have
pushed up the average gross premium level as well as employer subsidies, which contradicts the
original intent of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to curb government spending and balance the
nation’s budget.

6    Extensions and Robustness Checks
The results thus far have shown that plans below the subsidy cap increase premiums more than
plans above, although the magnitude is much smaller after the “Fair Share” subsidy policy took
effect in 1999. The reason for this dampened magnitude was due to the fact that plans in the
program have internalized the subsidy cap under the “Fair Share” formula – in that they can now
influence the dollar maximum directly – especially if they are large above-cap plans as measured
by their program-wide global market share. As a result, large plans above the subsidy cap are
increasing their premiums more than before, which counteracts the premium increase among plans
below the subsidy cap. In this section, we present several extensions and robustness checks to

complement the main results.

6.1   Premium Growth Rate
In order to get an idea of the premium growth rate under different employer contribution schemes,
which would help us better gauge the magnitude of the increase, we use the percentage change
in premium level as the dependent variable and rerun all the regression specifications discussed
previously. The results are shown in Tables 7 through 9, and are very similar to those described in
Section 4.
   The average increase in premium growth rate after 1999 is estimated to be 8-11 percentage
points higher than before. Among health plans below the subsidy cap, their premiums increase on
average 6-8% faster than plans above, although after 1999, the magnitude falls back to 4-6% when
compared to plans above.
   In terms of the effect of the distance between plan premium and the subsidy cap, the sign and
magnitude of the coefficients among the four interaction terms remain the same when we look at
premium growth rates instead of level changes.
   Finally, the program-wide global market share did not matter before 1999, but afterward, among

                                                                                            32

for plans below the cap.
   After including plan code and year fixed effects, a one-percentage increase in an above-cap plan’s
global market share would contribute to a 14 basis point increase in the plan premium, which in
turn pushes up the maximum employer contribution.

6.2      Low- Versus High-Cost Markets
The main empirical results show that the downward pressure on premiums increases as more plans
enter the market. As an empirical extension, we show that this competition pressure can vary
across local markets depending on whether the market is composed of plans mostly above or below
the subsidy cap. The hypothesis is that competition matters less in low-cost markets where most
of the plans are below the subsidy cap.
       We test this hypothesis using the same FEHB data set described before, and estimate the
following regression specification:

                  %∆Pjst = β0 + β1 P ostt + β2 Belowjs,t−1 + β3 Belowjs,t−1 × P ostt
                                + β4 P lanss,t−1 + β5 P ercBelows,t−1
                                                                                                 (18)
                                + β6 P lanss,t−1 × P ercBelows,t−1
                                                         0
                                + β7 LocalSharejs,t−1 + Xjst Γ + jst

Compared to the baseline model in equation (14), the newly added explanatory variables here are
those preceded by β5 and β6 . The variable PercBelows,t−1 stands for the percentage of plans within
a local market (in state s and year t − 1) that price below the national subsidy cap determined by
either the pre-1999 “Big Six” formula or the post-1999 “Fair Share” formula. In the specification
above, we do not include the state fixed effects since the variable PercBelows,t−1 is a state-specific
variable that varies little over time in some smaller states.
       According to our hypothesis, plans in low-cost markets should face lower consumer price sensi-
tivity, thus dampening the effect of competition on premium growth. As shown in the first column of
Table 10, the sign of the coefficient for the interaction term between P lanss,t−1 and PercBelows,t−1
is positive, counteracting the negative coefficient in front of the variable P lanss,t−1 . This result
suggests that in low-cost markets where the percentage of plans below the subsidy cap is high,
competition matters less in that the composite effect of competition is measured by both β4 and
β6 .
       After we include state fixed effects in column 2, however, the coefficient β6 is no longer sig-
nificant. On the other hand, the coefficient β5 on PercBelows,t−1 is now positive and significant,
meaning that plans in low-cost states tend to increase their premiums faster, possibly in an at-
tempt to catch up with the subsidy cap. When we include both state and year fixed effects, these
market-based variables can no longer explain the variation in premium growth.


7       Conclusion
Many studies have tried to figure out why health insurance premiums and expenditures have been
growing much faster than GDP in the last decade. Few studies, however, have looked at the effect of

employer premium contribution schemes on the pricing strategies of health plans. Using a subsidy
policy change that occurred in the FEHBP, largest employer-sponsored health insurance program
in the U.S., we study whether and how the employer premium contribution scheme affects health
plan pricing.
   With the help of a simplified analytical framework featuring differentiated products, we show
that two market incentives may contribute to higher health insurance premiums: 1) consumers are
less price sensitive when they only need to pay part of the premium increase, and 2) each health
plan has an incentive to increase the employer’s premium contribution to that plan.
   Empirically, we find that the “Fair Share” formula that took place in 1999 under the Bal-
anced Budget Act introduced incentives for large health plans above the subsidy cap to raise their
premiums more, after learning that the maximum employer contribution is now determined by
an enrollment-weighted average of all plan premiums. At the same time, health plans below the
subsidy cap still increase their premiums more than above-cap plans due to lower consumer price
sensitivity and strategic complementarity among competitors. Taken together, both market incen-
tives contribute to higher insurance premiums in the FEHBP.
   Under the new “Fair Share” formula, health plans internalized the subsidy cap and pushed
the upper limit of the employer premium contribution higher than it would have been under the
“Big Six” formula. As a result, the federal government ended up bearing most of the increase in
premium costs. In the absence of the new subsidy policy, average premium level would have been
10% lower than observed, and the federal government would have incurred 15% less in premium
contribution toward the FEHBP.
   These findings suggest that employer premium contribution schemes can influence health plan
pricing strategies and significantly impact total premium costs. Admittedly, instead of choosing
the optimal premium level in each period statically as modeled in this paper, a health plan might
base next year’s premium on its previous premium levels as well as its expectation of future market
conditions. A richer dynamic model would allow us to analyze the entry and exit decisions of
plans over time, in response to changes in employer premium contribution schemes, although such
a model is beyond the scope of this paper. Future research topics can thus explore other potential
impacts of the employer premium contribution scheme on the supply of health insurance.

Appendix A            Solving Simultaneous Equations
This appendix presents the steps to express the equilibrium prices and market shares in the Lambert
W function, following Aravindakshan and Ratchford (2011). One can use the same method to
express equilibrium conditions under different subsidy schemes.
    Assuming the fraction of employee contribution is θ, Section 2.1 has illustrated the simultane-
ity equations that plan j’s price and market share need to satisfy in the logit demand model.
Substituting the market share equation into the price equation, we get

                                       β1 1 −      exp(α1 −θβ1 P1 )+exp(α2 −θβ2 P2 )

This equation can be rearranged as:
                                                                 
                 exp(α1 − θβ1 P1 )           exp(α1 − θβ1 P1 )            exp(α1 − 1 − θβ1 C1 )
                                   exp                                =                         .   (20)
                 exp(α2 − θβ2 P2 )           exp(α2 − θβ2 P2 )              exp(α2 − θβ2 P2 )

Recall that the Lambert W function is defined as the inverse function associated with W (x)eW (x) =
                  exp(α1 − θβ1 P1 )
x. Assume W1 =                      , and we can rewrite the above equation as
                  exp(α2 − θβ2 P2 )

                                             W1 (x1 )eW1 (x1 ) = x1 ,

             exp(α1 − 1 − θβ1 C1 )
where x1 =                         .
               exp(α2 − θβ2 P2 )




                                                       40
   Taking log on both sides and substitute in the newly defined W (x), we get the best response
function of plan 1 as:

                                                    1 + W1 (x1 )
                                       P 1 = C1 +                ,
                                                        θβ1

   In equilibrium, the market share of plan 1 can also be written as a function of W1 (x):


                                                   W1 (x1 )
                                          S1 =                .
                                                 1 + W1 (x1 )

   Similarly, for plan 2 we have:


                                                    1 + W2 (x2 )
                                       P2 = C2 +                 ,
                                                        θβ2


                                                   W2 (x2 )
                                          S2 =                ,
                                                 1 + W2 (x2 )

             exp(α2 − θβ2 P2 )            exp(α2 − 1 − θβ2 C2 )
where W2 =                     , and x2 =                       .
             exp(α1 − θβ1 P1 )              exp(α1 − θβ1 P1 )

Appendix B           Solving Remaining Profit Maximization Problems
B.1    Before 1999: Big Six
   • Case 2: P1 ≥ subsidy cap, P2 ≥ subsidy cap

When plan 2 prices above the subsidy cap, consumers pay a net premium of P̃2 = P2 − c, whereas
the net premium of plan 1 remains P̃1 = P1 − c. Similar to case 1, we can write out the Lagrangian
function of plan 1’s profit maximization problem with the inequality constraints P1 − c/.75 ≥ 0 and
P2 − c/.75 ≥ 0. Holding P2 − c/.75 ≥ 0,

                               L(P1 , λ) = (P1 − C1 )D1 + λ(P1 − c/.75).

The FOC when there is an interior solution is
                                                          1
                                        P1 = C1 +                ,                            (21)
                                                    β1 (1 − S1 )

and plan 1’s market share is

                                          exp(α1 − β1 (P1 − c))
                       S1 =                                                  .
                               exp(α1 − β1 (P1 − c)) + exp(α2 − β2 (P2 − c))

Solving the above two simultaneous equations, we derive the best response function of plan 1 and



                                                    41
its market share as follows in terms of P2 :
                                                   1 + W (x)
                                        P1∗ = C1 +           ,                                    (22)
                                                      β1
                                                W (x)
                                        S1∗ =           ,                                         (23)
                                              1 + W (x)

                                        exp(α1 − 1 − β1 (C1 − c))
where P1∗ > c/.75, P2 ≥ c/.75, and x =                            .
                                           exp(α2 − β2 (P2 − c))
   When plan 1’s constraint binds, P1∗ = c/.75, and depending on the optimal level of P2 (holding
P2 ≥ c/.75), we can derive plan 1’s equilibrium market share.

   • Case 3: P1 ≤ subsidy cap, P2 ≥ subsidy cap

When plan 1 prices below the subsidy cap, and plan 2 prices above, we have P̃1 = .25P1 and
P̃2 = P2 − c. Given the constraints P1 ≤ c/.75 and P2 ≥ c/.75, the Lagrangian function of plan 1’s
profit maximization problem, given P2 ≥ c/.75, can be written as:

                               L(P1 , λ) = (P1 − C1 )D1 + λ(c/.75 − P1 ),

and plan 1’s best response function and market share in the interior solution are

                                                   1 + W (x)
                                        P1∗ = C1 +           ,                                    (24)

   • Case 4: P1 ≤ subsidy cap, P2 ≤ subsidy cap

When both plans price below the subsidy cap, we have P̃1 = .25P1 and P̃2 = .25P2 . The Lagrangian
function of plan 1 given the constraints P1 ≤ c/.75 and P2 ≤ c/.75 is

                               L(P1 , λ) = (P1 − C1 )D1 + λ(c/.75 − P1 ),

and the interior solution is
                                                   1 + W (x)
                                        P1∗ = C1 +           ,                                    (26)

where P1∗ < c/.75, P2 ≤ c/.75, and x =                            . The corner solution is P1∗ = c/.75.
                                            exp(α2 − .25β2 P2 )
    Since the simultaneous pricing game plan 1 and 2 play is symmetric, we omit the derivation
process to solve for plan 2’s equilibrium prices and market shares, as plan 2’s equilibrium solutions
are the same as plan 1’s as presented above, after substituting the subscript 1 with 2 in each case.

                                                  42
B.2     After 1999: Fair Share
   • Case 2: P1 ≥ subsidy cap, P2 ≥ subsidy cap

Given both plans price above the subsidy cap, we have two inequality constraints:

                                             P1 ≥ .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ),
                                             P2 ≥ .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ).

The two constraints are not redundant in this case, and they can be rewritten into
                                            .96w1     P2   1 − .96w1
                                                    ≤    ≤           .
                                          1 − .96w2   P1     .96w2
The Lagrangian function of plan 1 is:

           L(P1 , λ1 , λ2 )
               = (P1 − C1 )D1 + λ1 (P1 − .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 )) + λ2 (P2 − .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 )).

The two corner solutions are P1 = .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ) and P2 = .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ), or in other words,
P2      .96w1        P2    1 − .96w1
    =           and     =            . When neither constraint binds, The interior solution can be
P1    1 − .96w2      P1      .96w2
derived as:
                                                          1 + W (x)
                                      P1∗ = C1 +                            ,
                                                  (1 − .72w1 )β1 + .72w1 β2
                                               W (x)
                                       S1∗ =           ,
                                             1 + W (x)

where P1∗ > .96(w1 P1∗ + w2 P2 ), P2 > .96(w1 P1∗ + w2 P2 ), and

      exp(α1 − 1 − [(1 − .72w1 )β1 + .72w1 β2 ]C1 )
x=                                                  .
        exp(α2 − [(1 − .72w2 )β2 + .72w2 β1 ]P2 )

    It is easily observed that when both plans price above the subsidy cap, assuming β1 = β2 , the
solution to the profit maximization problem after the policy change is the same as before.
   • Case 3: P1 ≤ subsidy cap, P2 ≥ subsidy cap
Case 3 is symmetric to case 1 discussed in Section 3.2.2 in the sense that plan 1 and plan 2 switch
roles here as compared to case 1. The two inequality constraints are now:

                                             P1 ≤ .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ),
                                             P2 ≥ .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ).

   Similar to case 1, the first constraint implies the second constraint. The net premiums consumers
pay for both plans are P̃1 = .25P1 and P̃2 = P2 − .72(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ), respectively. The Lagrangian
function of plan 1’s profit maximization problem is

                              L(P1 , λ) = (P1 − C1 )D1 + λ(.96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ) − P1 ).


                                                        43
                                                        P2   1 − .96w1
The corner solution is P1 = .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ), or        =           . As for interior solutions, when
                                                        P1     .96w2
P1 < .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ), the FOC of plan 1 is
                                                        1
                                P1 = C1 +                                ,
                                            (.25β1 + .72w1 β2 )(1 − S1 )

where
                                             exp(α1 − .25β1 P1 )
                 S1 =                                                                 .
                        exp(α1 − .25β1 P1 ) + exp(α2 − β2 (P2 − .72(w1 P1 + w2 P2 )))

Solving the above simultaneous equations, we get the closed form expressions of plan 1’s best
response function and market share, in terms of P2 :

                                                   1 + W (x)
                                     P1∗ = C1 +                  ,
                                                .25β1 + .72w1 β2

                                           1 + W (x)

                                            exp(α1 − 1 − (.25β1 + .72w1 β2 )C1 )
where P1∗ < .96(w1 P1∗ + w2 P2 ), and x =                                        .
                                                exp(α2 − β2 (1 − .72w2 )P2 )
   • Case 4: P1 ≤ subsidy cap, P2 ≤ subsidy cap

It is not possible for both plans to price below the subsidy cap since the following two inequality
conditions cannot both hold at the same time:

                                       P1 ≤ .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ),
                                       P2 ≤ .96(w1 P1 + w2 P2 ).

   Similar to the pricing game before 1999, the two plans play a symmetric game here, which
means that plan 2’s equilibrium solutions are the same as plan 1’s after substituting the subscript
1 with 2 in each case.
