New Evidence on the Markup of Prices over Marginal Costs and the Role of Mega-Firms
in the US Economy

                                          ABSTRACT

The markup of price over marginal cost reveals market power. The distinction between marginal
and average cost is key. Average cost is easy to measure, but the price/average cost ratio
understates the price/marginal cost ratio when fixed costs are present. In particular, in free-entry
equilibrium, where revenue equals cost, the price/average cost ratio is always one, while the
price/marginal cost ratio may be above one. The idea here is to calculate marginal cost as the
ratio of the adjusted expenditure on inputs to the adjusted change in output. The first adjustment
is to remove the change in expenditure that arises from the changes in input costs. The second
adjustment is to remove the change in output attributed to productivity growth. Application to
KLEMS productivity data finds a typical markup ratio of 1.3. Markup ratios grew between 1988
and 2015. For mega-firms, the paper uses employment at firms with 10,000+ workers. Substantial
heterogeneity occurs across sectors and in growth rates. There is no evidence that mega-firm-
intensive sectors have higher price/marginal cost markups, but some evidence that markups grew
in sectors with rising mega-firm intensity.

1     Introduction
The ratio of price to marginal cost is an interesting quantity in many branches of economics.
A profit-maximizing price-taking firm equates its marginal cost to the prevailing price of
output. That price is invariant to the firm‚Äôs output choice. The firm‚Äôs price/marginal cost
ratio is one. A firm facing a constant-elastic residual demand, with elasticity , maximizes
profit at the point where the ratio of price to marginal cost is /( ‚àí 1). In general, the ratio
of price to marginal cost, designated ¬µ in this paper, is a useful way to think about market
power or monopoly power. It has a simple functional relationship to an equivalent measure,
the profit margin on sales, or Lerner index,
                                                    1
                                          L=1‚àí        ,                                      (1)
                                                    ¬µ
which maps the price/marginal cost ratio from ¬µ ‚àà [1, ‚àû] to L ‚àà [0, 1].
    The literature on measurement of ¬µ has two main branches. The demand-side approach
infers the residual elasticity , typically from a differentiated-products oligopoly model. The
supply side-approach uses data on price and cost from firms. Thirty years ago, Hall (1988)
proposed a refinement of the supply-side approach that measures marginal cost rather than
average cost. De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) proposed a related method also focusing
on empirical marginal cost, and De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017) recently captured a great
deal of attention with the finding that ¬µ has risen substantially in the US in recent decades.
See Traina (2018) and GutieÃÅrrez and Philippon (2017) for critiques of that paper. Since the
publication of my paper, much improved data have become available, thanks to the efforts
of US statistical agencies in developing productivity data. Their compiled data feed directly
into calculations of ¬µ. In addition, De Loecker and Eeckhout‚Äôs recent paper together with
a literature on the rising importance of large firms and the decline in the labor share has
generated great interest in the growth of the price/marginal cost ratio. This paper responds
to those developments. It finds support for the conclusion that the ratio has risen in recent
decades, though by less than in De Loecker and Eeckhout‚Äôs paper.
    One reason for the rise in market power revealed in the price/marginal cost literature
may be increasing concentration, particularly the rising role of mega-firms in some US in-
dustries. Most work on this topic has used data from publicly traded firms. In data from
the US Economic Census covering all firms (not establishments), which reports employment
in firms by number of employees, including those with 10,000 or more, which I designate as

                                               2
mega-firms, increases in the mega-firm employment fraction are modest where they occur.
Further, important sectors including manufacturing experienced declines in the mega-firm
employment fraction. I find no systematic relation between the level mega-firm fraction and
the price/marginal cost ratio across 19 major sectors of the US economy. But there is mod-
erately strong evidence that industries with growing mega-firm fraction have gained market
power in the years since 1998.
    This paper is self-contained and presumes no acquaintance with my earlier work or other
work on this subject. Nonetheless, everything here is new, including a novel derivation of
the basic idea of extracting marginal cost from time-series data.


2     Framework
2.1    Measuring the ratio of price to marginal cost, ¬µ
In time-series data, a natural measure of marginal cost is the change in cost divided by the
change in output. More precisely, the numerator is the change in cost not associated with
changes in factor prices and the denominator is the change in output not associated with
the change in Hicks-neutral productivity. Cost is
                                                X
                                         c=           p i xi ,                           (2)
                                                  i

in obvious notation. The change in cost is
                                        X                X
                                 dc =         xi dpi +           pi dxi .                (3)
                                         i                  i

The first summation is the component associated with changes in factor prices, while the
second is the desired component purged of effects from changing factor prices:
                                                X
                                        dÀúc =         pi dxi .                           (4)
                                                  i

    The technology is
                                             y = A f (x),                                (5)

so the part of output growth to leave out of dÀúy is
                                                          dA
                                        f (x) dA = y         .                           (6)

the share of factor i in revenue, p y. The expression for output growth can then be written
                                   dy    X dxi dA
                                      =¬µ   Œ±i     +   .                                           (11)
                                   y     i
                                              x i   A

With discrete time, the same equation is
                                          X
                            ‚àÜ log y = ¬µ       Œ±i ‚àÜ log xi + ‚àÜ log A.                              (12)
                                          i

This expression for the price/marginal cost ratio is useful because the quantities ‚àÜ log y
    P
and i Œ±i ‚àÜxi are calculated meticulously in productivity accounts based on Solow (1957).
These accounts publish the value of the Solow residual,
                                                     X
                            ‚àÜ log AÃÇ = ‚àÜ log y ‚àí            Œ±i ‚àÜ log xi ,                         (13)
                                                       i
                                                              P
so the measure of the change in total factor input,              i   Œ±i ‚àÜ log xi , can be calculated by
subtracting the Solow residual from the rate of change of output. Note that if ¬µ > 1, the
Solow residual does not measure actual technical progress, because it does not adjust for
market power.
     Notice that this derivation of the measurement of ¬µ does not assume anything about
optimal choice by the firm, apart from remaining on its production function. The firm is not
necessarily satisfying its first-order conditions in the output market or any input market.
The coefficient ¬µ does not necessarily describe the residual demand function facing the firm,
effects of market power by sellers of inputs including labor unions, or monopsony power of
the firm in those input markets.


                                                4
   The growth rate of productivity, a = ‚àÜ log A, is a statistical residual in equation (12).
It can only be measured with knowledge of the price/marginal cost ratio ¬µ. The most
basic approach is to treat ¬µ as a parameter to be estimated in time-series or panel data, with
suitable instrumental variables. Eligible instruments are variables that are uncorrelated with
productivity growth but are correlated with output and inputs. The residual based on the
estimated value of ¬µ is the estimated rate of true productivity growth, adjusted for market
power.
   With a single time series, the specification for ¬µ may capture changes over time, with a
small number of parameters. For example, an equation that considers a linear trend is
                                                     X
                             ‚àÜ log yt = (œÜ + œàt)         Œ±i,t ‚àÜxi,t + at .                     (14)
                                                     i

Here œÜ controls the level of ¬µ and œà is the per-period growth of ¬µ. With panel data, the
specification of ¬µ may capture differences in market power across industries as well.

2.2      Potential sources of bias in the measurement of the markup
         ratio
Here I consider a number of cases where the procedure described earlier either measures
marginal cost accurately or measures it with a bias of known sign. The estimate of the ratio
                                                                                    P
of price to marginal cost, ¬µ, is the slope coefficient of the relation of ‚àÜ log y to i Œ±i ‚àÜ log xi .
The examples considered here all involve potential biases in one of the Œ±i s. In all of them,
the input quantities are taken to be measured correctly. If an Œ±i is biased downward, the
slope coefficient ¬µ is also biased downward.

A firm makes excess profit. The productivity data used in this paper measure the price
                                                         P
of capital services as a residual‚Äîthe payments to factors i pi xi add up to revenue p y.
Consequently, the price of capital services is overstated for a firm that enjoys excess profit,
and the share Œ±i is correspondingly overstated. Thus ¬µ is overstated. This effect is likely
to be small because changes in capital from year to year are usually quite small. To cure
this problem, one could replace the residual price of capital with a price inferred from the
formula for the rental price of capital.

An industry is in zero-excess-profit equilibrium with monopolistic competition. With zero
excess profit, the measured level of profit equals the market rental cost of capital, so the


                                                 5
problem discussed above does not arise. The measured ratio of price to marginal cost reflects
the actual market power.

The firm purchases an input in a market where sellers of the input have market power. The
leading example is unionized labor. If a seller of an input exercises its market power by
setting a higher price that reflects that power, the calculation described in this paper takes
account of the true marginal cost associated with that input, and the calculation uncovers
the true price/marginal cost ratio of the firm. Notice that such an arrangement is bilaterally
inefficient. If the firm and the input seller use efficient two-part pricing, the average price paid
exceeds the underlying marginal price. In that case, the calculation overstates ¬µ. Because
labor‚Äôs input share is generally large and the change in labor input is also generally large,
the bias is probably more important than the one arising from monopoly profits.

The firm has monopsony power in an input market. The leading example is a firm whose
employment level is a substantial fraction of total employment in its labor market. The
average price paid for the input understates the effective marginal price. The share Œ±i is
understated and the estimate of ¬µ is correspondingly understated.


3     Data
The data in the Solow productivity framework come from klemscombinedbymeasure.xlsx,
available at bls.gov/mfp/mprdload.htm#Multifactor%20Productivity%20Tables. See bls.gov/
mfp/#technotes for extensive technical descriptions of the data. The data are annual start-
ing in 1987. I use the version of the data for 60 distinct non-overlapping industries. Some of
the advantages of the data relative to data in earlier work on production-side measurement
of the price/marginal cost literature are:

    ‚Ä¢ Rigorous adherence to proper measurement of output‚Äîno reliance on value added

    ‚Ä¢ Uniform use of the modern NAICS industry definitions

    ‚Ä¢ Breakdown of inputs into 5 categories: capital, labor, energy, materials, and services

    ‚Ä¢ Aggregation of capital and labor inputs from detailed underlying data using appropri-
      ate methods

    ‚Ä¢ Use of T√∏rnqvist‚Äôs refinement of the weights applied to log-changes in factor inputs

   For instrumental variables, I follow the identification strategy of Hall (1988), which treats
an industry‚Äôs productivity growth as orthogonal to government purchases of military goods
and services and to movements of the oil price. NIPA table 3.11.3 breaks down real military
purchases into a variety of categories. I use FRED series ACOILWTICO, the market price
of west Texas intermediate crude, as a measure of the oil price. The instruments are:

   ‚Ä¢ Military purchases of equipment

   ‚Ä¢ Military purchases of ships

   ‚Ä¢ Military purchases of software

   ‚Ä¢ Military expenditure on research and development

   ‚Ä¢ The oil price

All of these enter as log differences.
   Data on the fraction of employment by industry of very high employment firms (10,000
or more employees) come from the SUSB database compiled from business census data. See
census.gov/data/tables/2015/econ/susb/2015-susb-annual.html, link to ‚ÄúU.S., NAICS sec-
tors, larger employment sizes up to 10,000+‚Äù and similar for years back to 1998. These data

                                                      7
are for 19 NAICS sectors and begin in 1998. Data on the distribution of firm employment at
more detailed industry levels is available, but not including the employment at mega-firms,
thanks to disclosure restrictions. Apparently many more detailed industries have only one
or a small number of mega-firms, so publication of the data would violate the anonymity of
census data.


4     Results
From the perspective of research on total factor productivity in Solow‚Äôs framework, it is
natural to write the estimating equation with output growth on the left and weighted total
input growth on the right side. In principle, in an instrumental variables setting, the results
of estimating ¬µ in that normalization would be the same as flipping the variables, estimating
¬µ‚àí1 and then taking the reciprocal as the estimate of ¬µ. With a single instrumental variable,
the results are numerically identical. In the KLEMS data using the 5 instruments in this
paper, the principle of reciprocity comes close to holding. But for the reason discussed in Hall
(1988), it is better to estimate ¬µ‚àí1 . As noted earlier, ¬µ ranges from 1 to infinity. Very high
values will occur in cases where variable inputs are unimportant‚Äîsoftware and proprietary
pharmaceuticals are examples. The reported standard error for these cases will be high. The
results in those cases make more sense where ¬µ‚àí1 is estimated, and the high and uncertain
values of ¬µ are mapped into a small region around 1.

4.1    First-stage results
With the normalization that output growth is on the right side of the equation, the first-
stage regressions have output growth on the left and the five instruments, as log-changes,
on the right. The KLEMS data form a panel with 60 industries and 28 years when stated
as log differences. Because the instruments are all time series, cross-section regressions in
single years, or in small groups of years, are not identified. I focus on the 60 first-stage
regressions where each industry contributes a time-series OLS regression. The question at
hand is whether the instruments have adequate power to support instrumental-variables
estimation.
    Table 1 describes the power of the instruments in terms of the ratios of the first-stage
coefficients to their standard errors. The first column gives the percent of the 60 ratios
that exceed two in absolute value. These numbers would be about 5 percent if the data

were purely random. All 5 of the instruments outperform that standard, by a considerable
margin in all cases but one.

4.2    Estimates of the ratio of price to marginal cost, ¬µ, by industry
The results for the 60 industries are too extensive to digest in a single table. Table 2 sum-
marizes them in aggregates at the level of 19 NAICS sectors, sorted by the estimate of the
estimated markup ratio ¬µ. The table presents averages across the industries contained in
the sectors. The standard errors of the coefficients are summarized as averages and should
not be confused with the standard errors that would result from aggregating the underly-
ing data and estimating a single coefficient. The coefficients for four sectors‚Äîinformation,
utilities, finance‚Äìinsurance, and agriculture‚Äìfishing‚Äìhunting‚Äîare sufficiently large to render
the estimates questionable. In these cases, the instruments lack the power to identify the
markup ratio with usable accuracy.
   From Table 2, it is clear that the estimates specific to the industries have a good deal
of sampling error. In particular, 31 percent of the industries have values of ¬µÃÇi below the
minimal possible value of one. To disentangle the distribution of the true values of the
price/marginal cost ratio across industries from the distribution of sampling error, I consider
a simple statistical model that exploits the fact that sampling error must have a role sufficient
to explain the 31 percent of values of the ratio that are estimated to be below one. The
statistical model is
                                                ¬µÃÇ = Œ∑ + ŒΩ + 1,                               (15)

where the sample error Œ∑ is normal(0,Œ≥) and the log of the true markup‚Äôs random component
is normal (Œ¥, œÉ). The two components are independent. Identification rests on the hypothesis
that ¬µ = ŒΩ + 1 ‚â• 1. To find the parameters, I match the first three uncentered moments of
¬µÃÇ ‚àí 1. These are                                      

These equations form a well-conditioned system that is easy to solve with a Newton-type
solver.
   Table 3 shows the inputs to and results of these calculations based on the distribution
of estimates ¬µÃÇ. The upper panel shows the uncentered moments of the 60 estimates of
the markup ratio. The middle panel translates those moments into the solved values of
the underlying parameters. The standard deviation Œ≥ of the implied distribution of the
sampling error, Œ∑, is 0.34. The main feature of the distribution of the estimated markup
ratio that supports this finding is that 31 percent of the estimates are below one, which can
only arise from the left tail of the distribution of the sampling error. The mean, Œ¥, of the
distribution of log ŒΩ, the measure of true ¬µ ‚àí 1, is -1.43, indicating that the distribution is
bunched near zero‚Äîthat is, the distribution of ¬µ places high probability on values not far
above the competitive value of one. But the standard deviation of log ŒΩ, labeled œÉ, is 0.70,
so the distribution has an extended upper tail. The bottom panel gives the implied mean
and standard deviation of the level of the true markup ¬µ. The mean is one plus the mean
of the distribution of the estimated ¬µ ‚àí 1, as shown in the top line of the table, 1.31, and
the standard deviation is 0.24. Thus the distribution of the true markup is fairly tightly
contained in the range between 1.0 and 1.5.
   Figure 2 plots the inferred distribution of the true value of the markup ratio ¬µ and the
inferred distribution of the measured value, which is the convolution of the distributions of
the true value and the sampling error. All of the distribution of the measured value below
one is the result of the sampling error and a fair amount of the distribution above 1.5. Figure
3 compares the calculated cumulative distribution to the cumulative distribution of the 60

estimates. The fit is pretty good. The model smooths the distribution without seriously
altering its general features.

4.3    The change in the markup coefficient over time
To study the widely discussed hypothesis of growth in market power, I extend the specifi-
cation to include an industry-specific linear time trend over the sample period from 1988
through 2015:
                            X
                                     Œ±i,t ‚àÜxi,t = (œÜi ‚àí œài t)‚àÜ log yt ‚àí at .              (19)
                                 i

Here t advances by one each year and crosses zero in the middle of the sample period, 2001.
The implied functional form for the ratio of price to marginal cost is

I extend the set of instruments to include the product of the log-changes and the time-trend

   Table 4 shows the growth coefficients œài in the same sector groupings as in Table 2 earlier.
They are sorted from highest to lowest. Though the ranking is plausible‚Äîfor example,
the information sector has relatively rapid growth in market power‚Äîthere is substantial
sampling error. There is no neat way to separate sampling variation from heterogeneity in

the true coefficients. There are indications that sampling variation dominates the observed
heterogeneity of the estimates. For example, if there were substantial variation in the true
values, the t-statistics would have more dispersion across industries than the standard t
distribution has. In fact, the average of the squared t-statistics is 0.97, whereas it would be
1.13 for a t distribution with 15 degrees of freedom.
   Despite the preponderance of sampling variation, the estimates give reasonable support
to the hypothesis that the overall price/marginal-cost ratio rose over the period from 1998
through 2015. Table 5 shows the weighted average of the 60 estimates of œà, which is 0.0061
decrease in ¬µ‚àí1 per year or a 0.0078 increase in ¬µ per year, as of 2001. The weights are
the shares of the industries in total value-added. The t-statistic for the hypothesis that œà is
actually zero, and that sampling error accounts for the increase, is 1.20. The p-value for the
one-tailed test is 0.11, which is reasonably strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
   Figure 4 plots the growth of the markup of price to marginal cost at the weighted averages
of the parameters œÜi and œài . The markup ratio grew from 1.12 in 1988 to 1.38 in 2015. This
finding indicates substantial growth in market power, though rather less than the economy-
wise increase reported by De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017).

5     Mega-Firms and the Price/Marginal Cost Ratio
Autor, Dorn, Katz, Patterson and Van Reenen (2017) describe superstar firms that grow to
account for large fractions of sales in their output and input markets and presumably high
ratios of price to marginal cost. The rise of these firms is thought to account for the decline
in the labor share in the US and many other countries in recent decades. Here I investigate
the relation between the employment share of high-employment mega-firms and the price-
marginal cost ratios found using the method of this paper. I study the level and growth of
the shares of mega-firms using the data described earlier. Table 6 shows the employment
shares of firms with 10,000 or more workers in the 19 NAICS sectors in the first year the
data are available, 1998, and the most recent year, 2015.
    Growth in the shares of mega-firms has been anything but uniform across sectors. In
four of the 19 sectors, very high-employment firms declined in importance over the 17-year
span of the data. These sectors include all of manufacturing, which is the third-largest
sector. The largest positive growth was in utilities, where mega-firms rose from 33.5 percent
of employment in 1998 to 46.0 percent in 2015. Retail trade was another sector with a large
increase in concentration by this metric. The weighted-average increase across all sectors
was only 1.8 percentage points, from 25.3 percent to 27.1 percent. Thus it seems unlikely
that rising concentration played much of a role in the general increase in market power
that probably occurred over the 17 years. Figure 5 shows the movements of the high-firm-
employment share by sector in the intervening years.
    Figure 6 shows that there is essentially no systematic relation between the mega-firm
employment ratio, on the horizontal axis, and the ratio of price to marginal cost found
earlier in the paper, measured as the parameter œÜ. Over the wide range of variation in the
employment ratio, sectors with low market power and with high market power are found, with
essentially the same average values. There is no cross-sectional support for the hypothesis of
higher markup ratios in sectors with more very large firms and thus more concentration in
the product markets contained in those sectors. In Section 2.2, I observed that monopsony
power in the labor market results in a downward bias in the estimated markup ratio. Thus
the finding of no relation between labor-market concentration and the markup ratio could
reflect the canceling of the offsetting upward effect on true markups and the downward bias
from monopsony power.

Table 7: Slope Coefficients for the Relation between Employment in Mega-Firms and the
Trend Coefficient for the Markup Ratio

    The upper row of Table 7 describes the relation between the level of the mega-firm
employment ratio and the estimated markup ratio. It confirms the lack of a relationship.
But the standard error of the coefficient is high enough that the results do not refute the
hypothesis of a meaningful positive relationship.
    Figure 7 shows the relation between the change in the mega-firm employment ratio, on
the horizontal axis, and the trend coefficient œà in the price/marginal cost ratio. The plot
suggests some upward-sloping relation. The point at the lower left, for mining, quarrying,
and oil and gas extraction, is both influential and suspicious. Extraction industries present
a challenge to the measurement of productivity and its cousin, the markup ratio measured
in this paper. The other influential observation supporting an upward slope, for utilities, is
at the upper right. The lower row in Table 7 confirms that there is moderate evidence in
favor of an upward slope. Thus the hypothesis that a movement toward higher labor-market
concentration has a role in rising market power receives some support here.


6     Concluding Remarks
Direct measurement of market power using high-quality annual time-series productivity data
for 60 industries yields good information of the heterogeneous incidence of positive market
power in US industries. The mean of the markup ratio is 1.31 and the standard deviation of
the ratio across industries is 0.24. The mean grew from 1.12 in 1988 to 1.38 in 2015, though
sampling uncertainty is present in the growth rate. There is no evidence that concentration,
measured by the fraction of workers in a sector employed at firms with 10,000 or more

workers, is related to market power, but some evidence that growth of superstar mega-firms
is associated with rising market power.
   There is a good deal of noise in the calculations at the individual industry level. The
noise is interpreted as the annual growth of Hicks-neutral technology. The paper tries to
state the precision in its estimates using standard statistical tools. There is a good deal of
cross-industry heterogeneity in the estimated parameters. All of the results are interpreted
in a framework of heterogeneity.
   The choice to use modern productivity data has advantages and disadvantages. The
alternative is to use data from individual firms, such as Compustat for publicly traded firms
or confidential survey or administrative data. The advantage of the productivity data is the
care with which the BEA and BLS measure inputs and outputs. No data on individual firms
comes close to the accuracy and detail of the productivity data. The advantage of the data
on individual firms is much more variation in growth rates of inputs and outputs and thus
lower sampling variation in the estimated coefficients.
