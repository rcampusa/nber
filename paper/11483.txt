Does Falling Smoking Lead to Rising Obesity?
Jonathan Gruber and Michael Frakes
NBER Working Paper No. 11483
July 2005
JEL No. H1, I1

                                            ABSTRACT

The strong negative correlation over time between smoking rates and obesity have led some to
suggest that reduced smoking is increasing weight gain in the U.S. This conclusion is supported by
findnigs of Chou et al. (2004), who conclude that higher cigarette prices lead to increased body
weight. We investigate this issue and find no evidence that reduced smoking leads to weight gain.
Using the cigarette tax rather than the cigarette price and controlling for non-linear time effects, we
find a negative effect of cigarette taxes on body implying that reduced smoking leads to lower body
weights. Yet our results, as ell as Chou et al., imply implausibly large effects of smoking on body
weight. Thus, we cannot confirm that falling smoking leads in a major way to rising obesity rates
in the U.S.

       Two of the most noticeable trends in the health of Americans over the past thirty years

are shown in Figure 1. On the one hand, there has been a striking decline in the incidence of

cigarette smoking among Americans; whereas 37.4% of the population smoked in 1970, only

22.5% of the population smoked in 2002. On the other hand, there has been a large rise in the

rate of obesity among Americans over this same time period. The obesity rate for Americans

over the age of 20 has more than doubled from an average rate of 14.6% between 1971 and 1974

to over 30% today (Flegal et al. 2002).1 As Figure 1 shows, while the U.S. used to have more

than twice as many smokers as obese persons, since the mid 1990s there have been more obese

persons than smokers.

       Are these trends related? Some suggest so. After all, it has long been believed that

quitting smoking can lead to weight gain. In 1990, the U.S. Surgeon General found that between

58% and 87% of those individuals who quit smoking gain weight and, on average, those who

quit gain 4 pounds more than those who continue to smoke. While there is clear evidence of

short-run weight gains, however, there is little evidence to show a direct link between smoking

and steady state weight. Whether or not there is any merit to the perceived wisdom that smoking

facilitates weight loss, research suggests that many smokers, particularly women, make no

attempt to quit smoking because of fear of ensuing weight gain (Caan et al. 1996)

       A large literature documents the welfare gains from reduced smoking in the U.S., both in

terms of external gains to society from lower medical costs, and internal gains to individuals

from living longer. At the same time, a number of recent studies have emphasized the welfare

costs from increased obesity in the United States. Medical expenses attributed to individuals

being either overweight or obese accounted for 9.1 percent of total U.S. medical expenditures in

1998 (Finkelstein, Fiebelkorn, and Wang, 2003). Additionally, obesity accounts for an almost

equal amount of indirect costs, mostly due to the reduced productivity resulting from obesity-

related mortality and morbidity (Wolf and Colditz 1998; Wolf 1998). If efforts to reduce

smoking do, in fact, lead to increased obesity among Americans, then the welfare costs

attributable to the expanding obesity problem may offset the public health benefits of the decline

in smoking.

       A recent suggestive piece of evidence on the link between smoking and obesity was

provided by Chou, Grossman and Saffer (2004). They showed that higher cigarette prices,

which reduce smoking, are associated with higher rates of obesity. This suggests a direct link

between smoking and weight, and has formed the basis for Rashad and Grossman’s (2004) view

that rising obesity due to falling smoking is an example of “the price that must be paid to achieve

goals that are in general favored by society”.

       In this paper, we revisit the question of the impact of smoking on obesity. Using the

same BRFSS data source as Chou et al., we estimate a negative relationship between cigarette

taxes and body weight: higher cigarette taxes lead to lower rates of obesity. Assuming that

cigarette tax effects run only through smoking, this implies that reducing smoking actually

lowers body weight. We can largely explain our differences from Chou et al. by the use of more

complete controls for time trends in smoking, and use of cigarette tax rates rather than potentially

endogenous cigarette prices. One limitation we highlight for both our results and those of Chou

et al., however, is that the findings imply implausibly large effects of smoking on body weight.

Overall, we cannot confirm that higher cigarette taxes will lead to increased obesity.

                                        Part I: Background

Smoking and Weight Gain

         An extensive medical literature has supported the popular contention that smoking

facilitates weight control. In 1990, the U.S. Surgeon General reviewed 15 medical studies

involving a total of roughly 20,000 test subjects (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

1990). Between 58% and 87% of those who had quit smoking gained weight. On average,

quitters gained four pounds more than those who continued smoking. Individual weight gains of

20 pounds or more following smoking cessation were found to be rare and occur in only 3.5% of

cases.

         The followup periods employed in the 15 studies reviewed by the Surgeon General

ranged from 1.5 months to 6 years, with a median followup of 2 years. Several studies, however,

have shown that the rate of weight gain following cessation is transient, slowing down after 6

months in response to a return in energy intake to baseline levels (Caan et al. 1996). The weight

gained prior to this return to equilibrium is generally retained for at least 6 years (Froom et. al.

1999). However, some studies have found that quitters ultimately lose at least a portion of this

initially gained weight (Mizoue et al. 1998). Employing a cross-sectional analysis with data from

periodic health examinations of Japanese workers, Mizoue et al. find that steady state weight

levels for former smokers approach those of never smokers. While heavy smokers may

experience large weight gain and weigh more than never smokers in the few years following

smoking cessation, they will ultimately lose this weight and return to the never-smoking weight
                                                   4
levels. Mizoue et al. further find that light or moderate smokers may gain weight following

smoking, but only up to the never smoker levels

       Regardless of the merits of the perceived link between smoking and steady-state body

weight, the perception itself is very real. According to numerous studies, the fear of weight-gain

following smoking cessation discourages many smokers from attempting to quit (Caan et al.

1996). The 1986 Adult Use of Tobacco Survey asked current smokers who had tried to quit to

evaluate numerous reasons for the decision to continue smoking (U.S. Department of Health and

Human Services 1990). Twenty-seven percent of respondents indicated that “actual weight gain”

was a “very important” or “somewhat important” reason for their decision not to quit and forty-

seven percent reported that they agreed with the statement that “smoking helps control weight.”

Thus, aside from any actual connection between weight and smoking, this perception alone may

be contributing to negative outcomes.

       Even if there is an effect of quitting smoking on weight gain, researchers frequently stress

that any such effect is small in relation to the significant health benefits from discontinued

smoking. Furthermore, research also indicates that smokers generally exhibit less healthful

behavioral habits. For instance, they consume less fruits and vegetables (particularly those high

in vitamins A and C), high fiber grains, low fat milk, and vitamin and mineral supplements

(Subar, Harlan, and Mattson 1990). According to the 1990 Report by the Surgeon General, some

prospective medical studies report increased physical activity following smoking cessation.

Moreover, the Surgeon General’s Report also notes that any effects from post-cessation weight

gain are mitigated by favorable changes in lipid profiles and body fat distribution.

The Decline in Smoking and the Rise in Obesity

       The decline in smoking in the U.S. has been one of the major public health victories of

the second half of the twentieth century. After rising rapidly until 1953, cigarette consumption

per capita rose much more slowly until the late-1970s, and then began to decline. The major

determinant is assumed to be changing public attitudes towards the health risks posed by

smoking, beginning with the release in 1954 of information on the health hazards of smoking.

       Another contributing factor may have been a slow but steady rise in the real price of

cigarettes during the 1980s. A large literature shows that smoking is sensitive to cigarette prices,

with a consensus elasticity in the range of -0.4 to -0.6.2 From a minimum of 76 cents per pack in

1980 (in $1982), cigarette prices rose to $1.30 per pack by 1992. This period saw the steepest

decline in per capita cigarette consumption, from roughly 2800 cigarettes per capita in 1980 to

2000 cigarettes per capita in 1992. At an elasticity of -0.5, this 70% rise in prices can explain

almost all of the 40% decline in cigarette consumption per capita over this period. Prices then

fell due to a cigarette industry price war in 1993, and were flat before rising again starting in

1997 due to a series of tobacco industry settlements with the states and private litigants.

Smoking was likewise fairly flat in the mid-1990s before declining sharply in the late 1990s.

       Over this same time period, the United States has also witnessed considerable growth in

the rate of obesity among both the adult and youth populations. The U.S. Surgeon General has

recently noted that obesity in the United States has reached “epidemic proportions” (U.S.

Department of Health and Human Services 2001). Obesity is determined according to the Body

Mass Index (BMI), defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared
2
 The review in Chaloupka and Warner (2001) points to -0.4 to -0.45 as consensus estimates, but
recent work has produced higher elasticities, such as in Gruber and Koszegi (2004).
                                              6
(kg/m^2). Those with BMI greater than or equal to 30 are considered obese. BMI of less than

18.5 is considered underweight, while 18.5-25 is normal and 25-30 is overweight. Over the last

several decades, the rate of obesity among U.S. adults has doubled, reaching over 30% today.3

         These trends in dietary outcomes are of particular importance to national health policy.

The public health arena has long recognized the connection between dietary behavior and

various health outcomes, including mortality. In 1999, heart disease was the leading cause of

mortality in the United States, amounting to 30.3% of deaths (CDC 1999). Roughly three-

quarters of these deaths were due to ischemic heart disease (IHD) (CDC 1999). Medical

evidence establishes a strong link between IHD and diet / sedentary lifestyle (Campbell, Parpia

and Chen 1988). All told, experts estimate that obesity contributes to over 300,000 premature

deaths per year (McGinnis and Foege 1993).

         The time series causes of the rise in obesity are not altogether clear. Two leading

theories are proposed by Philipson and Posner (1999) and Cutler, Glaeser, and Shapiro (2003).

Philipson and Posner attribute the rise in obesity to technological change, which has lowered

both the real cost of food and the level of physical intensity in the workplace. In a modern post-

industrial society, such as that of the United States today, work tends to be relatively sedentary

and non-strenuous, leading to a reduction in the level of calories expended daily. This

technological explanation helps in interpreting the puzzling observation of rising obesity during a

period of time in which there had been only a modest increase in caloric consumption and a rise

in recreational exercise and dieting.

       Cutler, Glaeser, and Shapiro also attribute the rising obesity trends to technological

factors. However, unlike Philipson and Posner who focus on the effect of technology on caloric

expenditure, Cutler et al. propose that technological innovations led to increased food

consumption. The development of microwave ovens and various innovations in food processing,

packaging, and storage have led to a shift in the division of labor in food production. The switch

from individual food preparation within the home to mass food production at centralized

shipping locations led to a decrease in the time cost of food consumption and to an increase in

the quantity and variety of food consumed.




Causal Evidence on the Smoking/Obesity Link

       We are aware of only one article in the economics literature which has tried to provide

causal evidence on the smoking/obesity link, Chou et al. (2004). Using micro level data from the

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (1984-1999), Chou et al. attempt to determine how

much of the trend in obesity is explained by various state-specific factors, including the real price

of cigarettes. Employing state fixed effects and a quadratic time trend, they run a reduced form

model to find an elasticity of BMI with respect to cigarette price (inclusive of state and federal

excise taxes) of 0.025 and an elasticity of the probability of being obese with respect to cigarette

price of 0.445. They conclude that the effect of smoking on body weight does indeed work in the

commonly perceived direction.




                                           Part II: Data
                                                 8
       Our basic data source for this analysis is the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System

(BRFSS). The data consists of repeated cross-sections for the years 1984 through 2002, collected

via monthly telephone surveys of individuals aged 18 years and older. The BRFSS is a nationally

representative survey of the United States and has been conducted by state health departments in

coordination with the CDC for the purpose of collecting state-level data pertaining to risky

personal health behaviors. 15 states took part in the first survey in 1984. By 1994, all 50 states

and the District of Columbia became involved. The survey was administered to an average of

817 individuals per state in 1984, rising to an average of 4700 per state in 2002.

       The data contain information on respondents’ weight, height, smoking behavior and

survey month, along with various demographic characteristics. Self-reported weights and heights

allow us to calculate the BMI of each respondent, as well as a dummy variable for whether BMI

exceeds 30, the generally recognized classification for obese.

       We combine responses from two survey questions to construct an indicator for whether

or not the respondent currently smokes, conditional on having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in

his or her lifetime. The 1984-2000 surveys also contain information on the number of cigarettes

smoked per day, on average, by each reported smoker. With this information we construct the

average number of cigarettes smoked by all respondents (with 0 values for non-smokers).

       We match the BRFSS data to monthly cigarette excise tax data from The Tax Burden on

Tobacco (Orzechowski and Walker 2000). To allow a slight lag, we match on the tax rate at the

end of the previous month. We create real excise tax data using monthly CPI measures from the

Bureau of Labor Statistics. We also match onto each respondent state-level data on the average

annual real retail price of cigarettes (per pack) from The Tax Burden on Tobacco. Finally, we
                                              9
match onto our data unemployment rates by state, year, and month, obtained from the U.S.

Bureau of Labor Statistics4.

       An advantage of the BRFSS is that it contains information on both smoking behavior and

body weight/height. Another advantage is that the survey has been carried on for many years

and ultimately across every state. Over the relevant time period, there has been significant

variation in the excise tax rates imposed by the states, in both absolute and relative terms. This

extensive variation allows for identification of the effect of smoking on BMI.

       In the analysis below we restrict our sample to those respondents under 65 years of age in

order to ameliorate a possible health bias. Higher cigarette taxes result in reduced smoking,

which in turn results in fewer sick individuals. Since sicker individuals are generally skinnier

than healthy ones, we should expect to find a negative bias in the relationship between smoking

and weight measures due to this general health mechanism. Restricting the sample to those

respondents under 65 should minimize the impact of these more general health factors and focus

our results on those behavioral and metabolic forces of interest.

       Table 1 reports the means and standard deviations of the relevant variables in the BRFSS.

These figures are computed based on BRFSS sampling weights and are representative of the

population at large. The BRFSS data are weighted for the probability of selection of a telephone

number, the number of adults in a household, and the number of telephones in a household. To

generate final sample weights, a poststratification adjustment is made to account for other

factors, including the nonresponse and noncoverage of households without telephones. In order

to ensure consistency of our estimates, these sample weights are also employed in our regression

models below (DuMouchel and Duncan 1983).

       The average BMI across the sample is 25.8, and 16.8% of the sample is obese (somewhat

lower than the average found in the numerous National Health and Nutrition Examination

Surveys, as reported in Flegal et al.). Average BMI for smokers is 2.7% lower than that for non-

smokers (25.9 v. 25.2), and the obesity rate is 4% lower for smokers than that for non-smokers

(13.9% v. 17.6%). It is unclear, however, whether or not these numbers suggest a causal link

between decreased smoking and obesity, particularly where these two behaviors are part of a

more complex decision-making process.

       Table 1 also reports the means and standard deviations of the cigarette excise tax and

price data. The average state excise tax (in 2002 dollars) across the sample is $0.44, with a

standard deviation of $0.28. The data show a significant variation in excise taxes across states,

within any given time period. The standard deviation of real excise taxes in year 2002 is $0.43

(with a mean of $0.60). About 25% of the variation in excise taxes is within states over time

(Gruber and Mullainathan 2002). The substantial within-state variation in excise taxes will allow

us to identify the impact of smoking on obesity measures while controlling for fixed differences

across states, as well fixed differences across sample years.

       Finally, Table 1 also shows the means and standard deviations for the control variables

used in our analysis. Some interesting observations are worth noting. 48% of the sample is male.

Obesity is roughly the same across sexes. However, male BMI’s are an average of 1.2 higher

than females. Reconciling these two results, males are roughly 17% more likely to be in the

“overweight or obese” classification. Males are also more likely to smoke than females (25% v.
                                               11
21%). 27% of the sample has at least a bachelor’s or an associate’s degree. 14% did not complete

high school. 33% have a high school degree or a GED equivalent. Finally, 26% attended some

college or completed a technical degree. Those respondents who have a high school degree or

lesser education have a 5% higher obesity rate and have, on average, a higher BMI (26.1 v.

25.4). They also are roughly 10 percentage points more likely to smoke (28.9% v. 18.3%

smoking rate). These cursory demographic observations suggest caution in inferring a causal

relationship between the smoking and obesity trends.




                                   Part III: Empirical Strategy

       We begin our analysis by showing reduced form estimates of the impact of cigarette taxes

on measures of body weight. In particular, we estimate regression equations of the form:

       BMIijt = α + β1RTAXjt + β2Xijt + β3URjt + λj + τt + εijt

where i indexes individuals, j indexes states, and t indexes years
       BMI is body mass index or some other measure of body weight
       RTAX is the real cigarette tax in state j in year t
       X are a set of individual-specific covariates (e.g. age)
       UR is the unemployment rate in state j in year t
        λj and τt are fixed effects for state and year, respectively


       This model estimates the impact of cigarette taxes on body weight controlling for fixed

differences in taxes and body weight both across states and over time. In addition, we include

controls for a number of individual characteristics: sex, race, age, income, marital status and

education. In order to control for time-varying economic conditions of the separate states, we

also include monthly state unemployment rates.
                                                   12
        In this model, therefore, it is changes in cigarette taxes within states, relative to other

states that do not change their tax, that identifies the effect of taxes on body weight measures. Of

course, even this fixed effects specification does not control for all potential threats to causal

estimation of the impact of cigarette taxation on obesity. For example, it could be that states

raise cigarette taxes in times of recession, and body weight goes down (or up) in recessionary

periods. We attempt to control for this in two ways in the estimation below: by including

controls for state economic conditions, and by including state-specific trends in the analysis.




                                          Part IV: Results

        Table 2 presents our initial results from estimating equations such as that shown above.

We estimate our model for two different measures of body weight: the level of the BMI (results

are similar if we use the logarithm of BMI instead) and an indicator for obesity (BMI>30). We

express the cigarette tax in fractions of a dollar, rather than cents (e.g. 0.4 not 40) for ease of

interpretation of the coefficients.

        Surprisingly, we find that there is a negative relationship between cigarette taxes and

BMI; higher taxes lead to a lower BMI. This finding implies that the reduced smoking due to

higher taxes lowers, rather than raises, weight, although the estimated effects are fairly small.

For example, for BMI, our estimates imply that a $1.00 rise in cigarette taxes would lower BMI

by 0.15, or less than 1% of the sample mean; this estimate is significant. This same $1.00 rise in

cigarette taxes would lower the odds of being obese by 0.015 percentage points, or about 1% of

the sample mean, and the estimate here is more highly significant.
                                                13
       Table 2 also shows the coefficients of the control variables used in the initial BMI and

obese regressions. We find a negative and statistically significant relationship between real

household income and BMI, although the estimated effect is quite small, with an implied

elasticity of 0.02. However, the estimated effect of real income on the probability of being obese

is of greater magnitude, with an implied income elasticity of 0.18. We estimate a strong negative

effect of years of education on both BMI and the probability of being obese. The state-specific

unemployment rate has a negative and statistically insignificant effect on BMI and a negative

and marginally significant effect on the odds of obesity.

       Blacks, whites, and Hispanics all have higher BMI’s than individuals of other racial

groups, along with higher probabilities of being obese. In particular, blacks have significantly

higher measures of both outcomes. Females have lower BMI’s than males. However, males and

females have roughly equivalent probabilities of being obese. Age follows a non-linear

relationship with both BMI and the probability of obesity, with younger individuals having lower

weight outcomes. BMI and obesity appear to rise with age and then peak in the 50's, thereafter

lowering again for those in their 60's. Married and widowed individuals have higher BMI and

obesity odds than divorced and never-married individuals; divorced individuals, in turn, have

lower weight outcomes than those who have never married.




Comparison to Chou et. al.

       These striking “wrong-signed” findings stand in direct contrast to the results of Chou et

al., who found significant positive effects of cigarette prices on body weight. In this section, we
                                                 14
reconcile these two sets of findings (thanks to the generosity of Chou et. al. in sharing their data),

over the same 1984-1999 period used by Chou et al.

        There are three fundamental differences between our approach and that of Chou et. al.

The first is the sample and control variables used. Chou et al. include all those age 18 and over

(whereas we exclude those over 65 for health reasons), and also control for numerous state-

specific measures, including the density of restaurants, fast-food prices, full-service restaurant

prices, food-at-home prices, and clean indoor air laws. The second source of difference is the

treatment of time controls. While we include dummies for every year, Chou et. al. use a

quadratic time trend instead. The third source of difference is the measure of smoking cost. We

use the cigarette tax rate, while Chou et. al. use the state-specific cigarette price.

        Table 3 shows the comparison of our results, for BMI and obesity; we show just the

coefficient of interest, that on cigarette price (or tax). We begin by showing the results for Chou

et al. in the first column, and our replication in the second column, which is very close to their

result. In the third column, we change the controls for time, moving from a quadratic trend to a

full set of year and month dummies. Doing so substantially reduces the coefficients of interest,

which are now about half as large, along with the corresponding t-statistics. In the fourth

column, we also replace the cigarette price with the cigarette tax. This has a dramatic effect,

making the coefficients negative and, in the case of BMI, significant. Indeed, as a comparison

with the next-to-last column (which shows our basic specification) illustrates, the results using

year/month dummies and cigarette tax rather than price is very similar to our basic findings.

        Both of these changes seem reasonable. Given the available data, and the large

movements in obesity and smoking over time, it is more careful to control non-parametrically for
                                                15
time trends; doing so causes only a very small rise in the standard errors, so there is little loss in

precision. Moreover, while cigarette tax may suffer from political endogeneity, it is clearly a

more exogenous measure than price. Price changes within states are largely driven by tax

changes, but may also be driven by other market factors which affect both the rate of smoking

and eating. For example, suppose there is a demographic shift in a state (e.g. more young

persons) which leads to both more smoking and less eating. Cigarette companies may raises

prices in the face of this increased cigarette demand, leading to a spurious correlation between

cigarette prices and both smoking and body weight.

Robustness to State-Specific Time Trends

        One natural concern about using cigarette taxes (or prices) as a regressor is reverse

causality: perhaps taxes (or prices) are reacting to the underlying trends in smoking (and body

weight). To address this concern, we have also included in our model state-specific linear time

trends. These interactions of each state dummy variable with a time trend will pick up generally

increasing or decreasing body weight trends in each state that might be correlated with cigarette

tax (or price) policy.

        The final column of Table 3 shows the effect of including state-specific time trends in our

models. The results do not change much at all. This suggests that reverse causality that is

caused by a slow-moving trend in the data is not driving any of our results.




Interpretation

        One troubling aspect of both the Chou et al. results and our results, however, is that the

coefficient on the cigarette price/tax seems much too large. Consider the coefficient on cigarette
                                                 16
tax/price in the obesity regression. For our basic specification, we find that each $1 rise in

cigarette taxes raises the odds of being obese by 0.015 percentage points. The first column of

Table 4 shows corresponding “first stage” regressions of the odds of smoking on the cigarette tax

in the BRFSS data. We find that each $1 rise in cigarette taxes lowers the odds of smoking by

0.026 percentage points. Thus, as the second column shows, the “instrumental variables”

estimate of the effect of smoking on obesity is enormous: the estimate implies that individuals

who quit smoking are 56% less likely to be obese! Since the Chou et al. results are of a similar

magnitude (but of an opposite sign), the implication is correspondingly large (in the opposite

direction). Such a large effect, in either direction, is clearly implausible and is inconsistent with

the relatively small weight gain discussed in observational studies.

       Of course, rising taxes lead individuals not only to quit smoking, but also to smoke less,

and this second effect may also affect body weight. Thus, in the third column, we show the first

stage results using as the dependent variable the number of cigarettes smoked (including zeros

for non-smokers). Here we get a coefficient of -0.726, indicating that each dollar of taxation

leads individuals to smoke 0.7 fewer cigarettes on average. The second stage coefficient in this

case is 0.02, indicating that smoking one fewer pack of cigarettes (20 fewer cigarettes) would

lower the odds of obesity by 40%; this is once again implausibly large.

       These results are worrisome in that they indicate an effect which seems too large to be

plausible. One limitation of these findings, however, is that the BRFSS data seem to indicate an

very low price elasticity of cigarette consumption. The overall elasticity is only -0.2, which is

much lower than that estimated with aggregate data (-0.5 to -0.6; see Chaloupka and Warner

(2001) and Gruber and Koszegi (2001)). Part of the reason may be that aggregate estimates
                                                 17
include smuggling across state lines, but part of the reason may also be measurement error in

micro-data on smoking.

       Yet, even if the true elasticity is -0.5, the implied effect of smoking on body weight

remains surprisingly large. By our estimates, at a true elasticity of -0.5, reducing smoking by a

pack a day would lower the odds of obesity by 15%, which is still a very large effect relative to

the observational literature.




                                       Part V: Conclusions

       Smoking and obesity are the two largest (at least partially) self-imposed health risks

facing Americans today. The notion that there is a tradeoff between these risks, with lower

smoking causing more weight gain, is the type of “common knowledge” that has in fact found

relatively little support in the literature. We provide such analysis in this paper and are unable to

detect any evidence that higher cigarette taxes, which lead to lower smoking, also lead to higher

weight. The existing study purporting to find such a relationship is not robust to reasonable

changes to the specification, and neither our approach nor theirs yields results of plausible

magnitudes.

       We therefore find, in agreement with the medical literature, that there is no evidence for a

large weight effect from smoking cessation. Our finding does not, however, rule out a moderate-

sized effect. Future research to ascertain such smaller effects must use research designs which

yield much more precise inferences about the effects of smoking cessation on weight gain.

Notes: T-statistics in parentheses. Standard errors are corrected to allow for grouped error terms at the state level.
The two columns provide the regression results for the two alternative dependent variables employed: BMI and
OBESE (BMI >= 30). Fixed effects for state and month/year combinations employed in all regressions. Only those
respondents under the age of 65 are included in the regressions. Observations in each regression are weighted by the
corresponding BRFSS sampling weight.

Notes: Results correspond to the regression coefficients for the cigarette price (or tax) variable. Column 1 provides
the published coefficients from Chou et al. In column 2, we present the results from our replication of the model
employed by Chou et al.. In column 3, we modify our replication model, replacing quadratic time trends with a full
set of year/month dummies. In column 4, we modify the model used in column 3 to replace cigarette price with
cigarette tax. In column 5, we present the results from our basic model. Finally, in column 6 we add state-specific
linear time trends to our basic reduced form model.
