                                           ABSTRACT

Employers have been launching phased retirement programs to help workers navigate the transition
from work to retirement more effectively. This paper examines the experience of the phased
retirement system for tenured faculty in the University of North Carolina system. After phased

retirement was introduced, there was a sizable increase in the overall separation rate in the system.
A multinomial logit model of the retirement decision as a function of pension incentives, employee

performance, demographics, and campus characteristics is developed. The key empirical result is
that the odds of entering phased retirement are strongly and inversely related to employee
performance, as measured by recent pay increases.

         In its simplest version, the life cycle theory of labor supply predicts that workers

gradually cut back labor hours as the rewards from continued work decline and the time

horizon over which retirement assets can be consumed shortens. This prediction has

not been consistent with actual hours profiles of many retiring workers, who shift

instantaneously from a full-time, year-around schedule to zero hours. This pattern of

retirement has been facilitated in part by corporate retirement policies that require

workers to resign before they can be eligible for pension benefits. Thus, many workers

must quit their current full-time job and seek other employment if they wish to reduce

weekly hours of work instead of completely leaving the labor force.

         Recently, employers in some sectors have become more interested in retaining

older workers. Reasons for this change in attitudes include an increase in the relative

productivity of older workers, the overall shortage of skilled labor, and slower growth of

the labor force. Some firms have begun to experiment with phased retirement plans that

allow workers to start receiving pension benefits while they continue to work part-time.

This encourages older workers to remain on the job part time instead of completely

retiring. Workers entering phased retirement may be required to relinquish some of the

claims on continued employment and provide the employer with increased employment

flexibility.

         Relatively little economic analysis has attempted to examine the objectives of

phased retirement programs and whether phased retirement plans have achieved these

goals. Key questions that need to be answered include:

         1.         How many workers elect to enter phased retirement?

         2.         In the absence of a phased retirement program, would phased retirees

                    have fully retired or remained on the job full-time?

         3.         How will the introduction of phased retirement affect productivity?
                                                                                              2


       Important public policy issues arise because pension regulations limit the options

available to employers in designing phased retirement programs. Before deciding

whether existing pension regulations should be amended to encourage the use of

phased retirement programs, it would be useful to have some rigorous, empirical

evidence on the effectiveness of phased retirement programs.

       As a first step, this paper examines the experience of a single organization with

phased retirement – tenured faculty in the University of North Carolina system.

University faculty are by no means representative of the overall labor force; they are

highly skilled and have self-selected into a career track with the prospect of lifetime job

security. However, they face the same optimization problem of how to balance labor

and leisure over the life cycle as every other worker. In addition, higher education is the

sector of the economy with the highest incidence of phased retirement programs.1 The

tenure system does not generally allow for part-time work. Thus, most phased retired

programs at universities require faculty to give up tenure in exchange for a fixed term

contract allowing for part-time work.

       Our analysis focuses on two main issues. First, how many faculty members

have chosen phased retirement and whether those selecting phased retirement are

doing so instead of continuing to work full-time or instead of retiring completely. This will

be examined by comparing retirement behavior before and after the introduction of

phased retirement, using both summary statistics and probit analysis. Second, how

does the provision of phased retirement affect faculty productivity? The answer to this

latter question depends on whether high or low productivity faculty are enrolling in

phased retirement and whether in the absence of this program, these employees would

have remained on the job or retired. Some preliminary evidence on these issues is


1
  A survey by Watson Wyatt (1999) found that 36 percent of the employers in the education
industry had phased retirement plans.
                                                                                                    3


reported in Ghent, Allen, and Clark (2001), which contains a descriptive analysis of

retirement patterns before and after the introduction of phased retirement.2 This paper

develops a multinomial logit model of retirement behavior which includes measures of

variables reflecting economic incentives to retire (e.g., pension backloading) and

measures of faculty productivity.



                          I. THE ECONOMICS OF PHASED RETIREMENT

         To understand how the introduction of a phased retirement plan affects labor

supply, consider a simple one period labor-leisure choice model.3 Assume that workers

have three choices in the absence of a phased retirement plan: (1) work full-time for H

hours in a career job and earn income Y with zero pension income, (2) work half-time at

another employer for 0.5H hours and earn Y’ with full pension income P, and (3) retire

from the career job and receive P. Let worker utility be represented by U=U(y, T-h),

where y = income, T = time endowment, and h = labor hours. Workers compare U1(Y,

T-H) to U2(Y’+P, T-0.5H) and U3(P, T) and select the option that yields the maximum

utility level.

         The desirability of part-time work depends on how much labor income must be

sacrificed to obtain a half-time hours reduction. For most workers we expect 0.5Y > Y’;

that is, the half-time salary at another employer would be less than half of the full-time

salary. This would happen because (1) specific human capital at the original job would

not be valued at the new job and (2) wage rates on part-time jobs tend to be lower than

on full-time jobs. The greater the income sacrifice needed to obtain a part-time work

schedule (Y-Y’), the lower the odds of working part-time.


2
  Kim (2003) examines the relationship between faculty productivity and the voluntary early
retirement programs in the University of California system in the early 1990s.
3
  For a more rigorous approach to the choice of full and part time work near retirement in a life
cycle context, see Gustman and Steinmeier (1986).
                                                                                                 4


        The probability of selecting either part-time work or full-time retirement is

influenced by employer retirement programs. An increase in the present value of the

pension benefits will be associated with a greater likelihood of both full and phased

retirement. Once a worker has accumulated the rights to a pension that meets or

exceeds half of his regular salary, phased retirement at half-pay allows him to receive

more income while working fewer hours while in phased retirement. Work and

retirement choices also are affected by accrual of pension benefits with continued full-

time employment. If an individual anticipates a sizable increase in pension income by

staying with an organization a few years more, then the likelihood of retirement is

expected to be quite lower. On the other hand, if pension benefits do not increase, or

even decrease, with continued work, the odds of retirement should be quite high.

        The phased retirement plan provided by the UNC system offers tenured faculty

the option of working half-time for half the full-time academic salary. For many faculty

this represents an increase in Y’, the amount of income they can earn half time. This

would have the usual income and substitution effects in a framework where there is a

continuous choice of hours. The higher part-time salary makes part-time work more

attractive. The labor-leisure choice of faculty who can earn half or more of their regular

academic salary by working half-time off campus would not be affected by the

introduction of this type of phased retirement scheme.

        If one expands the framework to life-cycle optimization, two additional issues

arise. First, the greater payoff to part-time work in the later stages of one’s career

lowers the marginal utility of income and thus increases the demand for leisure in all

stages of the life cycle. This partial effect would translate into earlier shifts to part-time

work and full retirement. Combining this effect with the incentive to substitute part-time

work for full-time work and full-time retirement noted previously, we can trace out the full

effects of phased retirement over the life cycle. The odds of working part-time in the
                                                                                              5


years preceding complete retirement unambiguously increase, whereas the timing of

complete retirement might be delayed (because of the greater incentive to work part-

time) or accelerated (because more income is generated for those who would have

worked part-time anyway).

       Second, one must be careful to distinguish between the adjustments that would

take place when phased retirement is introduced with enough lead time that workers can

fully adjust their lifetime labor-leisure choice decision versus the adjustments that would

take place when phased retirement is introduced unexpectedly and is available

immediately. In all likelihood there was a backlog of demand for phased retirement at

the time it was introduced in the UNC system, so one must be careful to examine more

than one year of data to be able to gauge its impact in a steady state.

       From an employer standpoint, there are two important issues associated with the

introduction of phased retirement: what happens to the retirement rate and what

happens to productivity? Phased retirement makes bridge jobs at other employers less

attractive, thereby increasing employee retention in terms of duration of employer

attachment. However, it also increases the odds that a worker will move from a full-time

to a part-time schedule, so that the impact on an hours-weighted indicator of mobility is

more difficult to determine. Empirically, employers would want to know the impact of

phased retirement on the total retirement rate and how that outflow varies by age,

experience, and quality of workers.

       The net effect on faculty productivity depends on two issues: who selects phased

retirement and does phased retirement shorten or lengthen employer-employee

attachments? If the probability of entering phased retirement is inversely related to

faculty productivity and phased retirement shortens job durations, then the introduction

of phased retirement enhances faculty productivity. Productivity effects vanish or

change signs under different assumptions about these two conditions.
                                                                                           6


       The implications from this discussion for empirical work are as follows:

•   Some employees will view the introduction of a phased retirement plan favorably.

    After a plan is introduced, the sum of the rates of full and phased retirement will

    exceed the rate of full retirement that prevailed beforehand.

•   The financial incentive for entering phased retirement depends on how the part-time

    salary offered under the plan compares to part-time salaries off-campus. The plan

    will be most attractive to those with the least attractive opportunities off-campus.

•   The introduction of a phased retirement plan could have important effects on faculty

    productivity; the direction of those effects cannot be predicted a priori.

•   The odds of entering phased retirement will be heavily influenced by pension plan

    characteristics.



               II. PHASED RETIREMENT PROGRAMS IN HIGHER EDUCATION

       Higher education is particularly well-suited for phased retirement programs

because of rising concerns about managing the age structure of the professorate

(Watson Wyatt Worldwide, 1999; William Mercer Company, 2001). The elimination of

mandatory retirement for tenured faculty in 1994 meant that faculty age 70 and older had

the right to remain on the job until they decide to retire. In addition, rapid aging has

dramatically altered the age structure of university faculties. In this new environment,

many colleges and universities have opted to provide older faculty with the additional

choice of part-time work. A recent survey conducted by the Committee on Retirement of

the American Association of University Professors indicated that of the responding

institutions, 35 percent of the Research and Doctoral institutions were offering formal

phased retirement plans and 29 percent of Masters and Baccalaureate institutions had
                                                                                                  7


adopted formal phased retirement programs. These plans were much more prevalent at

private institutions.

          Further examination of the responding institutions in the AAUP survey reveals

that phased retirement programs are more prevalent among institutions that have a

greater proportion of their faculty who are tenured and in the older age groups. For

example, 17 percent of institutions with less than 40 percent of their faculty tenured offer

phased retirement programs while the incidence of these plans is 27 percent when the

proportion of the faculty that is tenured is 40 to 60 percent. These rates can be

compared to 31 percent in institutions offering phased retirement when the tenure rate is

60 to 80 percent and 52 percent offer such plans when 80 percent or more of the faculty

is tenured. In addition, 18 percent of institutions with less than 10 percent of their faculty

age 60 or over offer phased retirement plans while roughly one third of those with more

than 10 percent of the faculty over age 60 have introduced phased retirement plans.

          In 1996, the Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina (UNC)

adopted a phased retirement plan that would allow older faculty with sufficient service to

reduce their workloads while remaining with the university.4 The objective of this

program was to provide faculty with a new employment option of remaining on the job

part time for a fixed period of time after their retirement. The program provided for a

tenured faculty member to relinquish tenure in exchange for a fixed term contract that

specified half-time work for half-time pay.

          Each of the 15 campuses in the UNC system that grant tenure was required to

implement a phased retirement program.5 To be eligible for the program, faculty must

  The UNC faculty aged rapidly between 1982 and 1999. During this period, the proportion of the
faculty aged 55 and older increased from 18.2 percent to 31.2 percent and the mean age of the
faculty rose from 44.5 years to 49.4 years (Clark and Ghent, 2000).
5
    The NC School of the Arts is also a member of the UNC system, but it does not award tenure.
                                                                                              8


be tenured. They also had to be age 50 with 20 years of service or age 60 with 5 years

of service at the same institution. Each campus was allowed to select the length of the

contract for its faculty; however, the program required a minimum length of one year and

a maximum length of five years. Twelve of the 15 institutions chose a three-year phased

retirement contract, two institutions chose a two-year contract, and one campus chose a

five-year phased retirement contract.

        Individuals who were considering entering the program negotiate their half-time

duties with their department chairs prior to accepting phased retirement. Duties could be

performed evenly across both semesters or the individual could work full-time one

semester and have no specific assigned duties the next semester. Persons in phased

retirement do not receive most employee benefits. If they begin their retirement benefits,

they are eligible for the same health insurance as active employees.6

        Using employment records for the years immediately preceding the introduction

of the phased retirement program and the first three years of experience with the

program, we are able to assess the determinants of phased retirement and the impact of

phased retirement on the rate of full retirement. A key question in this analysis is

whether phased retirees are individuals who would have been more likely to remain on

the job full time if the program were not offered or whether they would have been more

likely to retire in its absence.

        The data used in the analysis are based on the annual faculty censuses that

each campus is required to submit to the General Administration of the UNC system.

These are the employment records for all faculty employed as of September of the

specified year. Information on each person includes age, hire date, rank, gender, race,

tenure status, annual salary, and type of pension plan. The annual records are linked

across years so we are able to determine whether an individual remains in his or her

faculty position from one year to the next. The census data for the years 1994 until 2000

are employed in this study. The analysis is limited to faculty members who were eligible

to enter the phased retirement program. This means that the sample includes only

tenured faculty who were at least age 50 with 20 or more years of service or at least age

60 with 5 or more years of service.

        What would the employees selecting phased retirement have done had the

option not been available? Would they have worked fulltime or fully retired? In the three

years prior to the introduction of phased retirement, the retirement rate from UNC

institutions among eligible faculty age 50 was 8.7 percent. After the introduction of the

new retirement program, the total retirement rate (full retirement plus phased retirement)

increased to 10.4 percent in 1997-98, 11.3 percent in 1998-99, and 10.4 percent in

1999-20007. The percentage of faculty selecting phased retirement was 3.2 in 1997-98,

2.3 in 1998-99, and 3.0 in 1999-2000. The full retirement rates were 7.2 percent in

1997-98, 9.0 percent in 1998-99, and 7.4 percent in 1999-2000. During these years,

phased retirees represented 24 percent of all retirements from the UNC system. In

absolute numbers, about 70 faculty entered the phased retirement program each year

while around 225 fully retired.

        One might question whether this increase in retirement rates was caused by the

introduction of the phased retirement program or by other factors influencing the

incentives to remain employed in the UNC system. Because the phased retirement

program was launched across all campuses at the same time, there are no experimental

data that can be used to address this issue directly. Indirectly, however, full-time faculty

                                                                                          10


in the North Carolina Community College System (NCCCS) represent a reasonable

control group. They do not have a phased retirement option. Their decision to remain

employed will be influenced by the same budgetary and retirement system parameters

that face UNC system faculty. If there were an increase in the retirement rates for

NCCCS faculty taking place at the same time that phased retirement was introduced,

that would serve as evidence that other factors were contributing to the observed

increase in overall retirement rates. On the other hand, if the retirement rates for

NCCCS faculty remained unchanged, that would provide further evidence that the

phased retirement program had causal effects.

       Table 1 reports full and phased retirement rates for UNC system faculty and full

retirement rates for NCCCS faculty by year. The comparison between the two groups is

very striking. There is a permanent increase in the overall retirement rate for UNC

system faculty in the year when phased retirement was introduced. There is absolutely

no change throughout the period in the retirement rate for community and technical

college faculty. Given the fact that prospective salary increases and pension plan

parameters for the two groups are the same, it is hard to believe that the increase in

retirement rates for UNC system was caused by anything other than the phased

retirement plan.

       Further evidence that the phased retirement plan had causal effects is reported

in Ghent, Allen, and Clark (2001). Ghent et al. estimated two retirement probit

equations using data for 1997-99: one in which retirement was defined as full retirement

only and another in which retirement was defined as either full or phased retirement.

The same model was estimated for 1995-97, when full retirement was the only option.

Then two different across-sample pooling tests were conducted. The tests concluded

that the 1997-99 retirement probit with the dependent variable equal to one only if the

individual completely retired could be pooled with the 1995-97 data to estimate a
                                                                                           11


retirement equation. However, when retirement in 1997-99 was defined to be both

complete or phased retirement, the data could not be pooled. Assuming that the

estimated retirement equations were stable over time, this implies that the phased

retirees "fit better" when not counted as retired. Thus, the data indicate that the phased

retirees of 1997-98 more closely resembled faculty members choosing to remain full-

time in 1995-96 than those who chose to completely retire in 1995-96.



                                     III. EMPIRICAL MODEL

       How does the introduction of phased retirement affect the labor-leisure decision

of tenured faculty in the UNC system? How does faculty productivity change as a result

of those decisions? We use a multinomial logit model, where employees have three

options: work full-time (A), enter phased retirement (R), and enter full retirement (F).

The probabilities of employee i entering each of these three states are

                          Prob(Yi = F) = exp(βFxi)/(1+exp(βFxi)+exp(βpxi))

                         Prob(Yi = P) = exp(βPxi)/(1+exp(βFxi)+exp(βpxi))

                          Prob(Yi = A) = 1/(1+exp(βFxi)+exp(βpxi))

The coefficients from this framework are useful for determining which variables have an

impact on retirement decisions, but the entire set of coefficients must be transformed in

order to determine the impact of each variable. For instance, to examine the difference

in retirement odds between workers with 30 and 20 years of service, we calculate

predicted probabilities for the entire sample using actual values for all xi except years of

service, which will be set at 20 years for all employees and then reset at 30 years. The

difference between the two sets of predicted probabilities will indicate how a 20 to 30
                                                                                                    12


year difference in time employed affects retirement odds. Similar calculations are

performed to obtain the predicted impact of binary variables.8

           The retirement decision is modeled as a function of demographics (gender, race,

and age), pension incentives, employee performance, and unique variables that are

likely to be associated with the impact of phased retirement on the decisions of UNC

system faculty. Correlations between retirement and either gender or race (separate

indicators for African-Americans, Asian or Asian- American, and other nonwhites) could

reflect differences in either life expectancy or attitudes toward retirement. Binary

indicators of age are used to avoid arbitrary constraints on the relationship between age

and retirement and to capture any spikes in the retirement hazard.

           UNC faculty members hired since 1971 have had the option of enrolling in the

Teachers’ and State Employees’ Retirement System (TSERS) or in an optional

retirement program (ORP). Currently the ORP options include TIAA-CREF, Lincoln Life,

Fidelity Investments, and VALIC. TSERS is a defined benefit plan, with the benefit

formula equal to the product of a constant, years of credited service, and final salary

average. Employees are eligible for partial benefits when they reach age 50 and have

20 years of service9; for full benefits, at age 60 and 5 years of service or at 30 years of

service. Once an employee is eligible for partial benefits, the constant in the benefit

formula gradually increases by three to five percent for each additional year of service.

           To understand the impact of pension characteristics on retirement incentives, it is

useful to focus on pension wealth, pension accrual, and pension backloading. Pension

wealth at time t is the present value of the expected lifetime income from a stream of

pension income if one retires at time t. Higher levels of pension wealth should be

associated with a greater likelihood of retirement through pure wealth effects. Pension

accrual is the change in pension wealth between year t-1 and year t. Pension accrual is

typically positive in a plan such as the TSERS up through the age of normal retirement,

as the constant, years of service and salary average all increase with t up until that point.

In a defined contribution plan, pension accrual reflects the contributions into the plan by

the firm and the worker. Pension backloading arises in defined benefit plans because a

large percentage of the accruals take place in the five years or so before early or normal

retirement.10 It equals the difference between maximum pension wealth (across all

possible retirement ages) and pension wealth if one retires immediately. Pension

accrual and backloading should be associated with a lower likelihood of retirement; high

values of these variables indicate a financial incentive to delay retirement.

           For faculty in the TSERS, the pension benefit formula is used to construct

measures of these three pension variables. Pension wealth is calculated under the

assumptions of no post-retirement increases in benefits, a three percent discount rate,

and a maximum life expectancy of 100 years.11 Pension accrual is the change in

pension wealth that results if the employee works for another year; salary growth is

assumed to be two percent.

           Option value is used in some studies to measure pension backloading, but full

implementation of the model developed by Stock and Wise (1990) in a multinomial logit

framework is beyond the scope of this study. We experimented with the approach used

by Coile and Gruber (2000) where specific values of the risk aversion, discount rate, and

disutility of work parameters were assigned so that option value could be used as one of

the xi. However, when we calculated the option value measure used by Coile and

Gruber, it implied that for about half of the workers in our sample, utility would not be

maximized unless they worked at least another 20 years. With a mean age of 58.3 and

a maximum age of 75, we concluded that we would have to experiment with a much

broader range of utility function parameters in order to successfully apply that approach

over our sample.

       Instead we used an alternative measure of backloading developed by Coile and

Gruber called peak value. To calculate peak value, one must estimate pension wealth at

all future retirement dates. Peak value equals the difference between maximum pension

wealth at some future retirement date and pension wealth if an employee retires

immediately. It indicates how much can be gained in pension wealth by delaying

retirement.

       The full impact of pension incentives cannot be estimated for employees in ORPs

because our data set contains no information on their pension wealth and by design

there is no backloading. Pension accrual in a defined contribution plan is a function of

two variables: (1) employee and employer contributions to the plan and (2) the

investment performance of the assets in the plan. The latter component is not

observable in our data set, so we use pension contributions (12.84 percent of salary) as

our measure of accrual for those in ORPS. Pension contributions do not vary with age

or years of service in the North Carolina system. An indicator of whether an employee is

in TSERS or one of the ORPs is included in the model when the two samples are

pooled. This variable acts as a proxy for differences in pension incentives and for

differences in tastes and behavior associated with pension choice.12 Pension

backloading is set equal to zero for employees in ORPs as well as for those who would

have maximized their pension wealth by retiring in an earlier year. A binary variable is

                                                                                            15


included in the model to flag the latter set of individuals because they may very well

have preferences on labor-leisure choice that are quite distinct from the average worker.

       Current salary and years of service are included in the model as controls. Much

of the variation in pension incentives across individuals in TSERS reflects variation in

these two variables because they are part of the benefit formula. It would be

presumptuous to omit them from the model and then claim to have produced evidence of

the effects of pensions. Also, both salary and years of service could have independent

causal impact. The cost of entering phased or full retirement rises with salary; years of

service are an indicator of match quality.

       Two variables are examined to determine how faculty productivity changes with

the availability of phased retirement. There is no formal system of performance ratings

for UNC system faculty, although performance appraisals are conducted annually.

Faculty pay increases in the UNC system were given strictly on the basis of merit during

the sample period, so this is the most logical available measure of relative performance.

The mean pay increase for each faculty member over the previous three years of

employment is used in this study. The use of three years of data instead of one is

intended to smooth out noise factors, such as promotion or a transitory shock to

performance. We also include academic rank in the model as a performance measure.

In a sample of tenured faculty eligible for retirement benefits, full professors have

presumably been judged more productive than associate or assistant professors.

       It is natural to expect the response of the UNC system faculty to the availability of

phased retirement to vary with some unique features of the employer and its system of

human resource policies. A potentially important factor is teaching loads, which vary

across campuses depending on the mission of the university. Faculty workloads consist

not just of teaching, but also of research, service to the university, and service to the

community. Of these four dimensions, however, teaching effectiveness is the only one
                                                                                           16


where time allocation can be observed systematically and with short time lags. For the

optimizing shirker interested in on-the-job leisure, the risk of being penalized for cutting

back on time allocated to research and service is much lower than the risk for cutting

back on time allocated to teaching. As any dean or department head knows, poor

research productivity can be disguised for a while by explanations such as bad draws

from the referee lottery or long lags needed for an ambitious project.

       Other faculty on research-oriented campuses may seek the ability to shift time

away from teaching toward research. In disciplines where grants and contracts are not

widely available, phased retirement would be valuable to faculty seeking extra time for

scholarly pursuits. The structure of colleges and departments varies so much across the

15 campuses that it was impossible to develop reliable indicators of such disciplines in

our data.

       Faculty on teaching-centered campuses have much less ability to substitute on-

the-job leisure for work on research. Put alternatively, a 50 percent reduction in teaching

loads buys much more free time on teaching-centered campuses than on those which

place a greater emphasis on research. This would lead us to expect phased retirement

to be less attractive to faculty in Research I universities (UNC-Chapel Hill, NC State)

than other campuses, which fall into the categories of Doctoral, Masters, and

Baccalaureate.13

       Summary statistics for the variables used in the analysis are reported in

Appendix Table 1. Although there is widespread concern about a rising share of

professors age 70 and older, it should be noted that faculty in this age group represent

less than two percent of a sample that excludes all faculty under 50. In fact, only 8.4

   Other campuses in the sample by Carnegie classification are Doctoral I and II (UNC-
Greensboro, East Carolina), Masters I (Appalachian State, Fayetteville State, NC A&T, NC
Central, UNC-Charlotte, UNC-Pembroke, UNC-Wilmington, Western Carolina) and Baccalaureate
I and II (UNC-Asheville, Elizabeth City State, Winston-Salem State).

percent of the faculty in the sample are over age 65. Over half of the sample is enrolled

in TSERS, and those faculty members have mean pension wealth of $436,651 if they

retired immediately. Pension backloading, the difference between maximum expected

future pension wealth and pension wealth if they retire now, is rather sizable (mean

$56,253 for TSERS faculty) compared to pension accruals (mean $8,585 for the entire

sample, mean $6,877 for TSERS faculty).

       The last two columns of Appendix Table 1 show how full and phased retirement

rates vary by sample characteristics. Both rates rise with age. The full retirement rate

spikes after age 59, 61, 64, and 69.14 The first spike corresponds with eligibility for full

benefits in TSERS; the middle two with eligibility for early and normal Social Security

benefits. The spike at age 69 may reflect peer pressure to leave by age 70, despite the

elimination of mandatory retirement at that age. The phased retirement rate spikes after

ages 58, 64, and 70, reflecting many of these same factors.

       Women have higher full retirement rates than men, but phased retirement rates

for men and women are not very different. Nonwhites have lower phased retirement

rates than whites, but higher full retirement rates. Both full and phased retirement rates

are remarkably higher for faculty in TSERS than those in ORPs, possibly reflecting self-

selection. Faculty who have not reached the rank of full professor have higher full and

phased retirement rates than full professors. Full and phased retirement rates are lower

on the two Research I campuses than on the other 13 campuses in the UNC system.



                                    IV. EMPIRICAL RESULTS


       Three samples are examined in the empirical results: the entire sample, a

subsample limited to workers in the defined benefit plan (TSERS), and a subsample
                                                                                             18


limited to workers in defined contribution plans (ORPs). There are three reasons for

splitting the sample by type of pension plan: (1) a measure of pension wealth and an

independent measure of pension accruals are only available for those in TSERS; (2)

examining TSERS participants by themselves permits a cleaner estimate of the impact

of pension backloading; and (3) self-selection by workers into TSERS and ORPs implies

that the coefficients for each group need not be the same.

        Predicted retirement odds derived from the estimated coefficients are calculated

at the sample means for all other variables in model and are reported in Table 1 along

with their levels of significance. The results in Table 1 are based on the entire sample,

except for those pertaining to pension backloading, which are based on the TSERS

sample.15 The most important result in Table 1 is that both full and phased retirement

odds decrease sharply with employee performance, measured in terms of average pay

increase over the last three years. Compare two professors, one who received no pay

raise for three years and the other with an average raise of eight percent (roughly twice

the amount budgeted for raises during the sample period). The professor who received

no raise has a 10.3 percent chance of fully retiring and a 4.3 percent chance of entering

phased retirement. The professor who averaged an eight percent raise has a 5.9

percent chance of fully retiring and only a 1.7 percent chance of entering phased

retirement.

        What does this mean for faculty productivity? Recall the finding from section 3

that those who select phased retirement more closely resemble active employees than

those selecting full retirement. Because faculty who receive low pay increases are much

more likely to enter phased retirement than faculty earning sizable pay raises, the

introduction of phased retirement is apparently accelerating the rate at which low-

14
  Retirement rates are calculated by comparing faculty rosters in September of year t-1 to
September of year t. The age variable refers to age in year t-1.
                                                                                           19


performing faculty separate from the university. As for the other measure of employee

performance, there is no difference in the rates at which full, associate, and assistant

professors enter phased retirement. However, associate and assistant professors are

much more likely to fully retire than full professors, so the net effect of the entire

selection process is consistent with productivity enhancement.

          Phased retirement is much more attractive on campuses where the main mission

is teaching than on those where the main mission is research. On Research I

campuses, the model predicts that 1.6 percent of faculty enter phased retirement,

compared to 3.2 to 4.0 percent on other campuses. This is consistent with phased

retirement providing a greater increase in free time on campuses with heavy teaching

loads. Full retirement rates also are lower in research-oriented than teaching-oriented

campuses.

          Not surprisingly, pension incentives come into play in faculty retirement

decisions. Faculty in TSERS are much more likely to enter phased retirement than

faculty in ORPs. The predicted phased retirement rate for faculty who selected the

defined benefit plan is 3.8 percent, compared to 1.6 percent for faculty in defined

contribution plans. Full retirement rates also are higher in TSERS. These patterns

reflect the greater reward to continued work in ORPs; for most employees in TSERS,

pension wealth is maximized once they reach their early 60s.

          Pension backloading plays an important role in the decision to enter phased

retirement. The odds of entering phased retirement for a person with no pension

backloading (i.e., someone who has passed the age where his pension wealth is

maximized in TSERS) are 5.8 percent. Those odds plummet to 1.0 percent for someone

who stands to gain an additional $100,000 in TSERS by working additional years.



15
     Complete multinomial logit results are reported in Appendix Table 2.
                                                                                          20


Pension backloading is also associated with lower retirement odds of full retirement, but

this effect could not be measured with precision.

       The other two pension variables have modest to zero effect on retirement

decisions. Pension accrual is unrelated to the odds of full retirement. The results for

pension accrual and phased retirement are conflicting; there is a significant positive

correlation for the entire sample but when the sample is limited to those in TSERS, the

coefficient stays the same but is estimated with much less precision. Pension wealth

has no correlation with full or phased retirement. This is not entirely surprising, as

pension wealth is but one of many sources of assets that can be used to finance

consumption during retirement.

       As for the other variables, age has the expected effect on retirement decisions;

the hazard rates implied by the model estimated over the entire sample correspond

closely to the sample means shown in Appendix Table 1. Figure 1 reports the predicted

hazard rates from separate multinomial logit models estimated by type of pension plan.

Predicted full retirement rates for those in the defined benefit plan were consistently

higher than the rates for those in the defined contribution plan, but there was no

difference between the two groups in the pattern of retirement spikes. Predicted phased

retirement rates for those in defined benefit and defined contribution plans were roughly

equal through age 63, but at age 64 and above the predicted probability of entering

phased retirement was somewhat higher for those in the defined contribution plan than

for those in the defined benefit plan. This indicates that the estimated difference in

phased retirement rates between those in defined benefit and defined contribution plans

in Table 1 is largely attributable to failure to interact age and type of pension plan.

       Women are more likely to fully retire than men, but there is no gender difference

in the odds of phased retirement. African-Americans, Asians and Asian-Americans have

lower full and phased retirement odds than whites in the multinomial logit results. The
                                                                                            21


fact that African-Americans have higher full retirement rates in the raw data must reflect

differences in other variables in the model. The odds of full retirement increase with

years of service and salary, but the odds of phased retirement are unrelated to these

variables.



                                            V. CONCLUSION

       This paper has examined the response of UNC system faculty to the introduction

of a phased retirement plan. The overall rate at which eligible workers elect to leave full-

time employment with the university increased significantly, accompanied by a small

decrease in the rate at which workers enter full retirement. Based on observable

characteristics such as age, salary, years of service, and job characteristics, faculty

members entering phased retirement more closely resemble those remaining in full-time

jobs than those entering full retirement.

       The productivity impact of this increased outflow of faculty depends on whether

those entering phased retirement are more or less productive than the average faculty

member. On this point, the evidence is unambiguous – the odds of entering phased

retirement are strongly and inversely related to employee performance, as measured by

recent pay increases. Faculty members also are more likely to enter phased retirement

when they have heavy teaching loads and when they are near the age-service level

where their pension wealth is maximized. Presuming that junior positions now open up

more quickly, universities have a greater opportunity to address concerns about an

aging professoriate.

       On balance, the introduction of phased retirement in the UNC system seems to

have been a plus from both employee and employer perspectives. Phased retirees now

account for slightly more than one-fourth of all flows out of the full-time faculty, indicating

that a sizable number of faculty members clearly appreciate having more degrees of
                                                                                         22


freedom in making time allocation decisions. The university system is now getting

advance warning about employee decisions to fully retire. Fears that the best and

brightest faculty might leave academe more rapidly have thus far been unfounded.

        An important caveat about these findings is that they apply to a workplace

environment where workers are extremely independent and have lifetime job security.

Workers who do not have the equivalent of academic tenure still have to balance time at

work and away from work, so it is quite possible that the share of workers electing

phased retirement reported here would be comparable across many types of jobs.

However, to the extent that nonacademic employers can directly control the employee

productivity through other mechanisms, our results on phased retirement and

productivity may be limited to the situation at hand. By providing the first solid evidence

on the impact of introducing a phased retirement option, this study provides a foundation

for further work in this area.

Note: omitted age category is 50-52 for entire sample, 50-54 for defined benefit sample,
and 50-58 for defined contribution sample. Ages 69 and 70 are combined into a single
category in the defined contribution sample. The binary indicator for bachelor-level
universities could not be estimated for the defined contribution sample because no one
in that category elected phased retirement.
