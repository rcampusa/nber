This paper studies empirically the effects of financial crises on international trade. The major

findings are that banking crises had a negative impact on imports but a positive impact on exports

in the short term, whereas currency crises decreased imports in the short term and stimulated exports

in the longer term.

1        Introduction

     The world suffered three major financial crises in the last ten years, namely, the

European Monetary System (EMS) crisis in 1992-1993, the Mexican crisis in

1994-1995 (which spread to a number of South American countries) and the Asian

crisis in 1997- 1998. Economists usually believe these crises were the results of weak

economic fundamentals, e.g. declining foreign reserve, increasing foreign debt, capital

account and current account deficits, government fiscal deficit and so on.

     Obviously, a current account deficit can be a very important factor because, other

things being equal, it increases foreign debt, decreases foreign reserves and weakens

confidence in the exchange rate of the domestic currency. Almost all countries that

suffered financial crises had faced rising current account deficits before the crises

occurred. So such deficits are widely regarded as an important factor of financial crises.

     International trade links play an important role in the so called "contagious effect",

i.e., a crisis in one country causes a new crisis in another country with relatively good

fundamentals. Glick and Rose (1999) provided some analysis of the relationship

between trade and contagion; while Forbes (2001) went further to construct some

statistics measuring the importance of trade linkages in transmitting crises.

   Since most economists agree that international trade is one of the important factors

in explaining financial crises, it seems natural and logical to ask the reverse question:

what are the effects of financial crises on international trade? Surprisingly, little

research on this subject has been done. Perhaps the reason is that the answer appears to

be obvious. Conventional wisdom would predict that a financial crisis, by bringing

about a recession in the macro economy, would lead to a drop in imports. Exports,

however, may rise because of both a decline in domestic demand and devaluation of the

domestic currency. A weakening or collapse of the financial system, in particular the

banking system, however, might weaken the country's export capability. So the

aggregate effects of a financial crisis on the macro economy are unclear. This paper

tries to ascertain whether the ambiguity can be resolved empirically.

   We divide all the past financial crises into two types: banking crisis and currency

crisis. These two different types of crises had different attributes and different effects

on international trade. This paper begins by analyzing theoretically the effects of

banking and currency crises on international trade. Then it uses bilateral trade data,

macroeconomic data and geographic data to test the theoretical predictions. Overall, the

empirical results provide support for the theoretical predictions.

   This paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it provides a theoretical

framework for understanding the impact of financial crises on international trade and

the channels of crises transmission through trade. Second, it estimates the effects of

banking crises and currency crises on imports and exports. The estimated results can be

used to predict the impact of financial crises on trade, thus providing useful information

for risk management to policy makers.

   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews previous

works on the relationship between international trade and financial crisis. Sections 3

and 4 analyze the effects of banking crises and of currency crises on trade respectively.

                                            2
Section 5 describes the data and methods used to estimate the effects of these crises.

Section 6 reports the results of empirical estimation and statistical testing. Section 7

concludes.

2         Literature Review: Trade and Financial Crises

    Economists pay attention to the role played by trade in financial crises for two

reasons. First, trade imbalance has been shown to be one of the important factors that

trigger financial crises. Current deficits may decrease foreign reserves. As Krugman

(1973) pointed out, a currency crisis is more likely to happen in an economy which does

not have enough foreign reserves. Second, financial crises may be transmitted through

trade linkages from an affected country to others despite the latter's relatively good

fundamentals. In explaining such contagion effects, economists have tried to identify

the channels through which contagion was spread. As trade is the most obvious

economic linkage between countries, much research has been devoted to this

connection. While the importance of trade imbalance in triggering crises is widely

accepted, there is no agreement on the importance of trade in transmitting financial

crises.

    Eichengreen and Rose (1999) used a binary-probit model to test whether bilateral

trade linkages transmitted crises between industrial countries between 1959 and 1993.

They found that the probability of a financial crisis occurring in a country increased

significantly if the country had high bilateral trade linkages with countries in crises.

They concluded that trade was an important factor. Glick and Rose (1999) conducted a

similar analysis with more countries between 1971 and 1997 and obtained a similar

result. Forbes (2000) used company's stock market data to study the importance of trade

in financial crises transmission and his result also showed that trade played an

important role.



                                           3
   However, other papers have provided different answers to the problem. For instance,

Goldfajn (1998) thought that trade was unimportant in the East Asian Crisis because the

direct bilateral trade volumes between these economies were very small. Masson

(1998), analyzing the Mexican crisis and the Asian crisis, obtained similar results.

   All the papers that analyzed the relationship between trade and financial crises

ignored the reverse question: how did financial crises affect international trade? We

argue that the effects of financial crises on trade are a precondition for discussing

whether trade transmits crises. If financial crises do not affect countries' imports and

exports at all, how can financial crises be transmitted through the trade channel? So,

before we analyze the importance of trade in transmitting financial crises, we need to

clarify the effects of financial crises on international trade. As pointed out above, little

work has been done on this topic to date. It seems there is a belief that financial crises

only affect countries' imports and exports through changes in the exchange rates. Since

the effects of exchange rates have already been thoroughly analyzed before, it may

seem that there is no need to study the question. However, this view may not be correct.

   A devaluation of a national currency will increase the volume of exports and reduce

the volume of imports. Classic international trade theory shows that a devaluation

improves the trade balance if the Marshall--Lerner condition is satisfied. Since in a

financial crisis a country usually experienced a devaluation of its national currency, the

same analysis would apply, i.e., the affected countries' imports will decrease but their

exports will increase after the crises.

   Furthermore, financial crises (including currency crises, banking crises or both)

could also affect trade through channels besides the exchange rate. Reinhart (1999)

pointed out that financial crises usually caused capital account reversal ("sudden stop")

and triggered an economic recession. Mendoza (2001) showed that in an economy with

imperfect credit markets these sudden stops could be an equilibrium outcome. The

                                             4
economic recession reduces not only domestic demand, but also total output and export

capability, whereas capital outflow forces the country to increase export. Thus, whether

exports increase or decrease after financial crises is unclear without further analysis.

    Before we analyze how financial crises affect the crisis countries' imports and

exports, let us first define financial crises. Eichengreen and Bordo (2002) have

provided definitions of currency crises and banking crises:

    "For an episode to qualify as a currency crisis, we must observe a forced change in

parity, abandonment of a pegged exchange rate, or an international rescue. For an

episode to qualify as a banking crisis, we must observe either bank runs, widespread

bank failures and suspension of convertibility of deposits into currency such that the

latter circulates at a premium relative to deposits (a banking panic), or significant

banking sector problems (including but not limited to bank failures) resulting in the

erosion of most or all of banking system collateral that are resolved by a

fiscally-underwritten bank restructuring."

    The above definitions are adopted in this paper. In next two sections, we analyze the

effects of banking crises and currency crises on the macro-economy and trade.

3       Impact of Banking Crises

    A classical framework of bank runs was developed by Diamond and Dybvig (1983).

Let us recapitulate the key elements of their model. Agents are endowed with goods

which can be invested in a long term project or stored without costs. The long term

project is profitable but illiquid, i.e., if investors do not liquidate the project before it

matures, its return is greater than the initial investment; however, if the project is

liquidated before it matures, the fire sale return is less than the initial investment. Each

agent can be impatient or patient with fixed probabilities, but there is no aggregate

uncertainty, i.e., the total number of impatient agents is fixed and known by all agents.



                                             5
At the beginning, agents do not know their own types but must decide if they will invest

in the project. After they have invested (or have decided not to invest) but before the

project matures, each agent realizes his/her own type. Impatient agents must consume

immediately whereas patient agents do not consume anything until the project matures.

Agents' types are private information, so even if each agent knows his/her own type,

other people do not know.

   On the one hand, if an agent does not invest in the project but turns out to be patient,

then he/she has missed a profitable investment opportunity. On the other hand, if he/she

invests in the project but turns out to be impatient, he/she will have suffered a loss. In

this case, he/she has to liquidate the long term investment before it matures.

   Agents can improve their utilities by pooling risk through the creation of a bank. All

agents deposit their goods in the bank. Depending to the number of impatient agents,

the bank sets aside a part of deposits as reserves and invests the rest in the project.

When agents realize their types, impatient agents withdraw their deposits from the

bank's reserves and patient agents wait for the project to mature. After the project

matures, the bank distributes the return of the project to patient agents. By way of

pooling risk through the bank, impatient agents do not suffer fire sale losses and patient

agents can enjoy the benefits of the project.

   However, there is a problem because agents' types are private information. Patient

can pretend to be impatient and withdraw their deposits before the project matures.

Normally, they have no incentive to do so because withdrawing early decreases their

utilities. However, patient agents may wish to withdraw their deposits if there is panic.

When that happens, the bank's reserves will not be enough to meet the agents' demand.

The bank has to liquidate the long term project before it matures, but it cannot meet the

withdrawal if all patient agents try to withdraw because the fire sale return of the project

is less than the initial investment. The result is a bank run and some agents get nothing

                                             6
back.

   The above is the classical framework of bank runs. It does not analyze the effect of

bank runs on imports and exports. We extend this model to feature international trade

by making four additional assumptions.

   1. We assume that agents belong to two categories: local agents and foreign agents.

Local agents are endowed with local goods and foreign agents are endowed with

foreign goods. Both foreign and local agents may be patient or impatient with the same

probability. Both local and foreign goods can be bought and sold in the international

market.

   2. The long term project needs both foreign and local goods as inputs, and it

produces local goods. As the aggregate investment increases, the investment demand

for local and foreign goods also increases. For simplicity, we assume that foreign

agents' deposits are less than the investment demand for the foreign good. So the bank

always has to export some local goods for the sake of importing foreign goods.

   3. Foreign agents only consume foreign goods, and local agents consume both local

and foreign goods. The returns that agents receive from the bank are local goods, so

they need to exchange a part or all of the return for foreign goods in the international

market.

   4. There are overlapping generations. When the project matures, a new generation of

agents appears. Like the previous generation, they deposit their goods in the bank and

the bank invests deposits in a new long term project. We assume that the number of

local agents is fixed but the number of foreign agents depends on the experience of the

previous generation. If no bank run occurs in the previous generation, the number of

new foreign agents will be the same. Otherwise, the number of new foreign agents will

decrease, i.e., capital inflow decreases after a bank run.

   We can analyze the impact of banking crises on imports and exports under the above

                                            7
assumptions. If a bank run occurs before the project matures, all agents withdraw their

deposits. Due to the illiquidity of the project, only some of them can get their deposits

back. On the average, agents suffer losses. All foreign agents (with out a bank run, only

impatient foreign agents) leave the economy bringing with them the withdrawal. After

the banking crisis, capital inflow decreases. So banking crises affect international trade

through three channels.

   1. Income channel. If a bank run occurs, the bank has to liquidate the long term

investment before it matures and all depositors suffer some losses. With a lower income,

local agents' demand for foreign goods goes down. Through this channel, both imports

and exports decrease during and after banking crises.

   2. Foreign capital flow channel. In the absence of bank runs, patient foreign agents

withdraw after the project matures, but the withdrawal would be offset by an inflow of

new investment made by the next generation of foreign agents. However, a bank run

causes them to withdraw early and also reduces new foreign investment in the future.

So banking crises can stimulate exports during crises but reduces them after crises.

   3. Investment demand channel. As aggregate investment decreases, the input

demand for foreign goods drops. So banking crises have negative longer term effects on

imports through this channel. On the other hand, as foreign investment decreases, the

economy must export more local goods to import foreign goods as investment input. As

a result, banking crises will simulate exports after crises.

   The real world is more complicated than that highlighted in the above theoretical

framework. For instance, developed countries usually may be able to save their banking

systems when banking crises occurred, so net capital outflow might not happen. As a

second example, some less-developed countries (e.g., some African countries) are

unsuccessful in attracting a lot of foreign capital, so the impact of capital flow would be

insignificant during banking crises. As a third example, several Latin American

                                             8
countries (e.g., Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela) stopped repaying foreign debt during

debt crises in 1980s, so the amount of net foreign capital outflow would be less than that

suggested by the theoretical analysis.

4       Impact of Currency Crises

    Currency crises often occur due to one of two reasons: run away fiscal deficits or

external shocks. We analyze them in turn. As Krugman (1973) pointed out, if a

government cannot control its budget deficit, it has to finance the deficit by printing

money, thus triggering currency depreciation. The currency crises in Brazil, Mexico

and Argentina would be a case in point.

    An external shock (may be a currency crisis in another country) may cause the

demand for local products to decrease in the international market. If the economy's

exchange rate remains unchanged, it must experience a price deflation, which is often a

painful process because cutting prices is difficult, and cutting the civil servants' salary

may be particularly challenging. During a price deflation, firms usually suffer losses

while unemployment rises. To minimize the social costs, the government may choose

to give up the fixed exchange rate regime. A case in point would be the experience of

Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan and Singapore before and during the Asian financial crisis.

These economies faced competition in their export market from China, and the

devaluation of the Japanese Yen in 1996 worsened their trade position further. They

discovered that their cost structures were too high to support their currencies, so they

had to give up the fixed exchange rates despite their relatively good fundamentals. The

Thai government gave up its fixed exchange rate in July 1997, triggering the Asian

financial crisis. Even through Hong Kong's currency board was maintained, it paid a

heavy price in the form of price deflation and fiscal deficit.

    During a currency crisis, the exchange rate would be more uncertain. Importers and



                                            9
exporters are exposed to greater exchange rate risk, and may choose to reduce their

business to reduce their exposure. As a result, currency crises may have negative

impacts on imports and exports in the short term.

   In the longer term, the market equilibrium is gradually restored. However, imports

and exports may not return to the original level because a currency crisis can produce

persistent impact on imports and exports through three channels.

   1. Income channel. This channel exists if a crisis is triggered by external shocks. As

the demand for local products declines, the consumer's income falls. So both imports

and exports decline.

   2. Substitution effect channel. This channel exists if a crisis triggered by external

shocks. As the relative price of local products decreases, consumers tend to increase

their consumption of local product and decrease their demand for foreign goods, so

both imports and exports decrease.

   3. Wealth channel. Regardless of whether a currency devaluation is caused by a

fiscal deficit or an external shock, consumers always suffer wealth losses due to money

holdings, forcing consumers to decrease their consumption. As consumers' demand for

foreign goods decreases, imports decrease; as their demand for local product decreases,

other things being equal, the economy is able to export more.

   If a devaluation is expected, consumers can reduce losses by reducing their money

holdings. They can exchange domestic currency for foreign currency before the

devaluation and then reverse the process after the devaluation. If the cash-in-advance

constraint holds, their consumption would decrease during the devaluation as they

reduce their money holding in anticipation of the devaluation. As a result, imports

decrease and, if the price elasticity of demand for exports is larger than unity, the value

of exports increases in the short term. After the devaluation, however, consumptions

may return to the original level. So expected devaluations will have only short term

                                            10
impact on imports and exports.

    However, according to Eichengreen and Bordo (2002), currency crisis often

occurred when governments abandoned their fixed exchange rates suddenly. The

Mexico crisis was a good example. Before the abandonment of its fixed exchange rate,

interest rate of Peso was relative low and the market did not predict the devaluation. In

short, most currency crises were unexpected, and thus the impact on imports and

exports through the wealth channel would be larger than if the crises were expected.

5       Data, Crises, and Estimation Model

    Having analyzed in theory the effects of banking crises and currency crises on

foreign trade, let us use real world data to test the above theoretical predictions.

    The data include bilateral export value from 1981 to 1998 as contained in World

Trade Database; GDP, population and exchange rate data between 1979 and 1998 as

contained in the International Financial Statistics; distances, common land border, the

number of the landlocked countries and the number of the island countries as contained

in Frankel and Rose (2002)'s database. Eichengreen and Bordo (2002) have provided a

list of financial crises found in the major economies (Table 1). We use the same list in

our analysis because the included countries are sufficiently representative.

    **** Table 1 here ****

    We show the frequency of currency crises and banking crises in Figure 1 and 2,

respectively. There were 128 currency crises between 1980 and 1998. As shown in

Figure 1, the number of currency crisis peaked in 1982, 1986 and 1992, with more than

10 crises each year. In 1982, the debt crisis occurred in many Latin American countries,

and five Latin American countries had currency crises. In addition, six other countries

experienced currency crises due to high US interest rate. In 1986, there were 13

currency crises in both developed and developing countries, spreading over Asia,



                                            11
Africa, Europe, North and South America. In 1992, many European countries quit EMS

under speculative attacks. In 1997 and 1998, several Asian countries that had stable

exchange rates for a long time, such as Malaysia and Korea, experienced currency

crises, even though the frequency of currency crises was not significantly higher than

the average level

   **** Figure 1 here ****

   **** Figure 2 here ****

   According to Eichengreen and Bordo (2002)'s definition, currency crises do not

always manifest themselves as currency devaluations. For instance, the Swedish Krona

did not depreciate in 1992 but Sweden's central bank had to rely on an international

rescue effort to defend its currency. Therefore, we regard that as a currency crisis. In

contrast, while the Hong Kong dollar was attacked in 1997 and 1998, there was neither

devaluation nor international rescue. Therefore, we do not classify that as a currency

crisis. We classify currency crises that ended with devaluations as "successful"

currency crises, and the others as "unsuccessful" currency crises. According to these

definitions, 113 currency crises were successful and 15 were unsuccessful.

   There were 53 banking crises between 1980 and 1998. From Figure 2 we can see that

in 1981, 1987, 1994 and 1998, there were more than five crises each year. These peaks

of banking crises were close to the peaks of currency crises.

   If a banking crisis and a currency crisis occur in a country in the same year, we

regard that as a "twin crisis." There were five twin crises during 1980-1998. This

definition is not perfect, because it ignores some cases in which that banking crisis and

currency crisis occurred closely but in subsequent calendar years.

   We use bilateral trade data to test the theoretical predictions because we would like

to isolate external effects that vary across countries. For example, if a country and its

main trading partner fall into financial crises at the same time, the country's exports and

                                            12
imports are affected by both internal and external shocks. However, we would not be

able to include the external shock as explanatory variable if we use their aggregated

(across countries) trade data. The use of bilateral trade data allows us to include the

importing and exporting countries' crisis dummies as explanatory variables, thus

avoiding biases caused by inappropriate use of dummies in analyzing aggregate trade

data.

   The gravity model is widely used to estimate bilateral trade value. The basic idea is

that trade between any pair of countries is positively related to their economic sizes, but

inversely related to the distance between them. Some other factors, such as common

land border, can also affect bilateral trade value. This methodology has proven to be

successful in explaining variations in bilateral trade. We extend the gravity model by

including crisis variables. The regression equation to be adopted is as follows.


        logexport t,i,e     logexport t1,i,e    1 X t,i,e   2 Yt1,i,e   3 Yt2,i,e
                            4 C t   5 C t1   6 C t2  C    t  t,i,e


where exp ortt , i , e is exports from country e to country i at time t. As trade relationships

take time to build and to break, we allow for the underlying continuity of trade over

time by including log(exp ortt −1, i , e ) as an explanatory variable. X t , i , e is a set of

macroeconomic variables that affect trade between country i and e at time t. Based on

the gravity equation framework, X is taken to include the following variables: igdp ,

the log of GDP of the importing country; egdp , the log of GDP of the exporting

country; ipop , the log of the population of importing country; epop , the log of the

population of exporting country; dis , the log of the distance between importing and

exporting countries; comland , a common land border dummy equal to 1 if the trading

countries have a common land border and 0 otherwise; nland , the number of trading



                                                      13
countries being landlocked (i.e., 0, 1 or 2); nisland , the number of trading countries

being islands countries (i.e., 0, 1, or 2); C is constant term; idevt = log iext − log iext −1 ,

the rate of devaluation of the importing country's currency relative to US dollar, where

iext is the exchange rate ( measured in domestic currency/ US dollar) of the importing

country's currency at time t ; edevt = log eext − log eext −1 , the rate of devaluation of the

exporting country's currency relative to US dollar.

   Since a currency devaluation has both short term and longer term effects, the

explanatory variables Yt −1, i , e and Yt − 2, i , e include the first and second lag of the

devaluation variables, namely, lagidev , lagedev , lag 2idev and lag 2edev .

   To capture the possibility of time trends, we also include time t as an explanatory

variable.

    Ct , Ct −1 and Ct − 2 are crisis dummy variables and their first and second lags. Ct

includes bit , bet , cit and cet , the banking crisis dummies of the importing and

exporting countries, and the currency crisis dummies of the importing and exporting

countries, respectively.

    bit = 0 if country i does not fall into a banking crisis at time t;

         1 otherwise.

    cet = 0 if country i does not fall into a currency crisis at time t;

         1 otherwise.

   We analyze how financial crises affected foreign trade over a period of three

consecutive years. The effects on trade during the crisis years are regarded as "short

term" and the effects on trade one and two years after crises are regarded as "longer

term." We do not consider lags in excess of two years because the major crises were not

more than three years apart. For example, the EMS crisis (1992-93), the Mexican crisis


                                              14
(1994-95) and the Asian crisis (1997-98).

6         Estimation Results and Statistical Tests

    We divide the data into two groups: 1982-1990 and 1991-1998, and estimate

separately regressions for each period. This allows us to compare the effects of

financial crises in different periods.

Devaluation

    Before we examine the impact of financial crises, let us check the behavior of the

gravity model with a lagged dependent variable and rates of devaluation, i.e.,

    log(exp ortt , i , e ) = λ ⋅ log(exp ortt −1, i , e ) + θ1 X t , i , e + θ 2Yt −1,i ,e + θ3Yt − 2,i ,e + C + γ ⋅ t + ε t , i , e

where X t , i , e includes igdp , egdp , ipop , epop , dis , comland , nland and nisland .

The devaluation variables are either omitted or included.

    The estimation results when the devaluation variables are omitted are reported in the

first two columns of Table 2. The model's fit is relatively good. In both periods, R2 is

greater than 0.93. Most coefficients are significant and their signs are consistent with

theoretical predictions of the gravity model. An unstable result is time trend: it was

significantly positive during 1982-1990 but significantly negative during 1991-1998.

Since the volume of trade for all countries are expressed in U.S. dollars, the changing

value of U.S. dollar over time may provide some clues. The value of the U.S.

consumers' price index (CPI) increased by 41.5% during 1982-1990, but by 22.6%

1991-1998. So even if the time trend of the real value of exports were the same, the time

trend of exports measured in current US dollars could be different.

    Other differences between the two periods include the coefficients of ipop , epop ,

comland and nland . Although the signs of the coefficients for these population

variables in both periods are negative, the absolute values decreased significantly in


                                                                  15
1990s. The absolute values of the coefficients of comland and nland in 1991-1998

were higher than those in 1982-1990.

   **** Table 2 here ****

   Next, we add the rates of devaluation and their lags idev , exdev , lagidev , lagedev ,

lag 2idev and lag 2edev as explanatory variables. The results are reported in last two

columns of Table 2.

   The signs of all the newly added explanatory variables are identical in both periods.

To understand the effects of devaluation, we draw impulse response functions in Figure

3.1 and 3.2 by considering devaluations of 50%, or equivalently by setting idev and

edev equal to 0.4055.

   **** Figure 3.1 here ****

   **** Figure 3.2 here ****

   In Figure 3.1 and 3.2, either in 1980s or in 1990s, devaluations had negative impact

on imports. However, the impact was short-term. Except for the effects on GDP,

imports almost fully recovered in the second year after the devaluation. In contrast, the

impact of devaluations on exports was somewhat more complicated. In the year of

devaluation, exports decreased, but a year later, exports rebounded significantly, only

to decrease again in the second year after the devaluation.

   The results are consistent with the theoretical predictions. If a devaluation is

expected to occur, then consumers reduce their cash holdings to avoid loss, decreasing

consumption, decreasing imports and increasing exports in the short term. After the

devaluation, consumption rebounds so imports and exports return to the original level.

The decrease in exports in the devaluation year may be due to the low price elasticity of

exports in the short term, but the result that the longer term exports are less than the

original level is hard to explain because it would be questionable whether the price



                                           16
elasticity of demand for exports would remain less than unity two years after

devaluation.

6.2    Adding Crisis Dummies

   Now let us add financial crisis dummies to the regression equation. First, we include

banking crisis dummy and currency crisis dummy separately. The results are reported

in Table 3.

   **** Table 3 here ****

   The first two columns of Table 3 show that the impact of banking crises was unclear

between 1982-1990. The short term effects on imports and exports were insignificant,

and the longer term effects were negative but not always significant. The results for

1991-1998 were more significant. Imports decreased significantly in all three years.

Exports increased in the crisis years but fell back in the first year after banking crisis.

   Impulse response functions induced by the banking crisis dummy are presented in

Figure 4.1 and 4.2. We focus on the results for 1991-1998 in Figure 4.2. The impact on

imports not only was negative but also tended to decrease further.

   **** Figure 4.1 here ****

   **** Figure 4.2 here ****

   The last two columns of Table 3 show the effects of currency crises, and the impulse

response functions induced by the currency crisis dummies are showed in Figure 5.1

and 5.2. From the table and figures, we find that the effects on imports in the two

periods were very similar. In both periods, imports decreased in all three years.

However, the effects on exports in the two periods were somewhat different. In

1982-1990, there was a significant negative impact of currency crises on exports in the

short term (i.e., the coefficients of cet and lagcet −1 were significantly negative), and

the negative impact was mitigated but not reversed in the second year after crises. In



                                            17
stark contrast, the effects of currency crises on exports in 1991-1998 were significantly

positive in all three years.

   **** Figure 5.1 here ****

   **** Figure 5.2 here ****

   When all crisis dummies are included as explanatory variables, the results are

reported in Table 4. The results for banking crises are very similar to those obtained

above when currency crisis dummies were omitted (Table 3). In 1982-1990, the effects

of banking crises were insignificant except for the coefficient of lagbit . Figure 6.1

shows impulse response functions induced by the banking crisis dummies. In

1991-1998, imports decreased and exports increased significantly in the short term, and

both imports and exports decreased in the longer term. Comparing the impulse response

functions in Figure 6.2 with Figure 4.2, we find that after controlling for the effects of

currency crises, the accumulated impact of banking crises in the second year after crises

was negative.

   **** Table 4 here ****

   **** Figure 6.1 here ****

   **** Figure 6.2 here ****

   The results for currency crises are similar to those obtained above when banking

crisis dummies were omitted. In both periods, imports decreased in all three years. The

impact of currency crises on exports was significant except that during the crisis year in

1982-1990. The impulse response functions for the currency crisis dummy during the

two periods are given in Figure 7.1 and 7.2, respectively. In 1982-1990, exports

decreased in the short term and remained below the original level despite a subsequent

recovery. In 1991-1998, the short term effect on exports was insignificant and exports

exceeded the original level beginning in the first year after currency crises. After



                                           18
controlling the effects of banking crises, the impact of currency crises on exports was

insignificant during the crisis years. So the significantly positive coefficient of ce t in

Table 3 seems to be the result of omitting the banking crisis dummies.

   **** Figure 7.1 here ****

   **** Figure 7.2 here ****

   We summarize the theoretical predictions and empirical results about the impact of

banking crises and currency crises in Table 5.1 and 5.2, respectively. Because the

model includes GDP and devaluation as explanatory variables, the effects of the crisis

dummies capture the effects of crises through channels other than economic recession

or currency devaluation. Theoretical analysis predicts that exports increase during

banking crises due to foreign outflow, and in the longer term changes in exports depend

on the aggregate effect through the foreign capital flow channel and the investment

demand channel; imports would decrease due to reduction in investment demand.

   **** Table 5.1 here ****

   **** Table 5.2 here ****

   In 1982-90, the empirical results for banking crises do not support the theoretical

predictions. In particular, there was no increase in exports during banking crises.

Perhaps the theoretical predictions were inappropriate for this period because many

developing countries stopped repaying foreign debts when they struggled with the

financial crises. Furthermore, the amount foreign capital flow into less developed

economies was relatively modest.

   The empirical results for 1991-1998 were broadly consistent with theoretical

predictions. The negative longer term effect of banking crises on imports is as predicted.

Although the theories predict the short term effect on imports to be insignificant, the

empirical negative impact on imports during crisis years may be due to the use of



                                            19
annual data (as opposed to quarterly or monthly data), which might have been

influenced by the longer term effects. The positive impact on exports in the short term

is consistent with the theoretical prediction about the effect of capital outflow. The

results that exports decreased in the longer term (the second year after crisis) implies

that the negative effect via capital flow channel overwhelmed the positive effect

through investment demand channel.

   Theoretical analysis predicts that currency crises had negative impact on imports

both in the short term (due to market chaos) and the longer term (due to wealth loss plus

substitution effect if crisis was triggered by external shocks). The short term effect on

exports are negative, but the longer term effect was ambiguous because the positive

effect via the wealth channel ran counter to the negative effect via the substitution effect

if the crisis was triggered by external shocks.

   Comparing the empirical results of currency crises with the theoretical predictions,

we discover three phenomena. First, consistent with theoretical predictions, the impact

of currency crises on imports were negative in both the short term and the longer term.

Second, the short term effect via market chaos channel in 1991-1998 was weaker than

that in 1982-1990, so exports decreased significantly in crisis years in 1982-1990 but

did not change significantly in 1991-1998. Third, in 1982-1990, exports after the crisis

recovered but still remained below the original level. We are not certain whether it was

due to a weakening of the short term effect or if the longer term effect had kicked in. In

contrast, in 1991-1998, exports increased significantly after currency crises, implying

that the impact via the wealth channel overwhelmed the impact through the substitution

effect channel. Generally, the empirical results in both periods are broadly consistent

with theoretical predictions.

6.3    Twin Crises, Successful and Unsuccessful Crises

   Let us check for the effects of twin crises by adding a twin crisis dummy

                                            20
tct = bit × cit and its first and second lags. Clearly tcit = 1 if and only if both bit and cit

are equal to 1.

   The estimation results are listed in Table 6. Most coefficients of the twin crisis

dummy variables are insignificant even though the values of the coefficients are not

small in relative terms.

   **** Table 6 here ****

   As we pointed out above, currency crises may be "successful" or "unsuccessful".

Since currency devaluations did not occur in unsuccessful currency crises, their impact

could be different from that of successful crises. We separate the currency crisis

dummies into two more refined groups of variables: sc stands for a successful currency

crisis (i.e., both currency crisis and devaluation happen); fc stands for an unsuccessful

currency crisis (i.e., a currency crisis without devaluation). The results are reported in

Table 7. Since most currency crises were successful, it is not surprising that the

coefficients of sc are close of those of c in Table 4. We find that the longer term

effects of unsuccessful currency crises were unclear: almost all coefficients of lagfc

and lag 2 fc are insignificant. However, the short term effects of unsuccessful crises in

the two periods were different. In 1982-1990, imports did not change significantly but

exports decreased significantly after an unsuccessful currency crisis. However, in

1991-1998, an unsuccessful currency had negative effects on imports but positive

effects on exports. Most of the other coefficients were not affected by the separation

into two different currency crisis variables.

   **** Table 7 here ****

6.4    How large are the effects on trade

   Since the variables are expressed in logarithmic terms, we can compute the size of

the effects from the regression results contained in Table 5 and using the impulse


                                              21
response functions in Figure 6 and 7. In 1991-1998, a country's imports on average

would decline by about 9.7% during the year in which a banking crisis occurred, by

13% in the first year after crises, by 14.5% in the subsequent year; exports would

increase by about 8.8% during the crisis year, by 5% in the first year after crisis, but

decrease by 2% in the second year after crisis. The country's imports would drop by

about 4.3% during the year in which a successful currency crisis occurred, by 9.7% and

12.4% in the subsequent two years, respectively; exports would increase by about 0.5%

(insignificant) during the crisis year, by about 5% and 9% in the two subsequent years

after crises, respectively. The results show that the impact of financial crises on

international trade was very strong.

7       Conclusions and Directions for Further Research

    We have analyzed how financial crises affected international trade in the last two

decades, an important question largely ignored by the literature. Our theoretical

analysis predicts that imports will decrease during and after a banking crisis, whereas

exports will rise during but fall after the crisis. Theoretical analysis predicts imports and

exports will fall during currency crises but the effect after the crisis depends on the

source of external shocks. By estimating a model of bilateral trade between 50 countries

over a period of 19 years with real world data, we have found that the empirical results

are generally consistent the theoretical predictions, especially in 1991-1998. The

empirical results also show that after currency crises exports increased more

significantly in 1991-1998 than that in 1982-1990. That may be a clue of "contagious

crisis" in the last decade.

    This paper has focused on the value of trade, but an alternative measure would be the

volume of trade. In addition, the impact of financial crises on different tradable goods

may be different. It would be interesting to explore whether the relationships between



                                             22
trade and financial crisis varied systematically across different products. For instance,

products that enjoyed a comparative advantage versus those that suffered a comparative

disadvantage.
