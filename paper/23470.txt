                                           ABSTRACT

We propose a technique for assessing robustness of behavioral measures and treatment effects to
experimenter demand effects. The premise is that by deliberately inducing demand in a structured
way we can measure its influence and construct plausible bounds on demand-free behavior. We
provide formal restrictions on choice that validate our method, and a Bayesian model that
microfounds them. Seven pre-registered experiments with eleven canonical laboratory games and
around 19,000 participants demonstrate the technique. We also illustrate how demand sensitivity
varies by task, participant pool, gender, real versus hypothetical incentives, and participant
attentiveness, and provide both reduced-form and structural analyses of demand effects.

1    Introduction
A basic concern in experimental work with human participants is that,
knowing that she is being experimented on, the participant may change
her behavior. Specifically, participants may try to infer the experimenter’s
objective from their treatment, and then act accordingly (Rosenthal, 1966;
Zizzo, 2010). For instance, participants who believe the experimenter wants
to show that people free-ride in public good games might play more selfishly
than they otherwise would. Thus, instead of measuring the participant’s
“natural” choice, the experimental data are biased by an unobservable ex-
perimenter demand effect. Demand effects pose a threat to external valid-
ity, because participants would make different choices if the experimenter
were absent, and shroud the interpretation of treatment effects.
    The core idea of our paper is that one can construct plausible bounds
on demand-free behavior and treatment effects by deliberately inducing ex-
perimenter demand and measuring its influence. For example, in an effort
task, we tell some participants “you will do us a favor if you work more
than you normally would,” and others “you will do us a favor if you work
less than you normally would.” Under the assumption that any underly-
ing demand effect is less extreme than our manipulations (in a sense that
we will formalize), choices under these instructions give upper and lower
bounds on demand-free behavior, and by combining bounds from different
experimental treatments we can estimate bounds on treatment effects.
    We begin with a simple Bayesian model of decision-making that moti-
vates our approach. In our model an experiment defines a mapping from
actions to utility. The experimenter is only interested in measuring the
“natural” action that maximizes the participant’s utility as derived from
the experimental payoffs. However, the participant is also motivated to
take actions he perceives will “please” the experimenter by conforming to
her research objectives. He tries to infer those objectives from the design
features and distorts his action accordingly, biasing the experimenter’s es-
timates. Our demand treatments attempt to manipulate those beliefs to
identify an interval that contains the natural action. We remain agnostic
about why the participant wishes to please the experimenter; motives may
include altruism, a desire to conform, a misguided attempt to contribute


                                     2
to science, or an expectation of reciprocity from the experimenter (Orne,
1962).
    We provide an extensive set of applications of the method. We conduct
seven online experiments with approximately 19,000 participants in total,
in which we construct bounds on demand-free behavior for 11 canonical
games and preference measures.1 In each game we employ positive and
negative “demand treatments” which tell participants that they will “do us
a favor” if they choose a higher or lower action than they normally would.
    Responses to these demand treatments are substantial and vary across
tasks. The difference in average (standardized) behavior between our pos-
itive and negative demand treatment groups ranges from approximately
0.25 standard deviations for incentivized real effort to 1 standard deviation
for trust game second movers. In an application to treatment effect esti-
mation, we also derive bounds on the real effort response to performance
pay. The bounds we obtain exclude zero, but are quite wide, ranging from
a 0.25 to a 1.35 standard deviation increase in effort. Overall, the results
suggest significant potential for bias due to demand effects.
    Nevertheless, it is reasonable to think that explicitly asking subjects
to “do us a favor” is a strong manipulation relative to realistic demand
effects in typical experiments. Theory implies a trade-off in applying our
method. “Strong” demand manipulations provide reliable but wide bounds
on demand-free behavior, because they shift participants’ beliefs a lot even
if the underlying influence of demand is small. Many researchers will be
satisfied with weaker, less conservative manipulations that yield tighter in-
tervals. In another series of experiments, we employ demand treatments in
which we simply signal an experimental hypothesis to participants, with-
out explicitly demanding that they conform to it. Specifically, we tell them
“we expect that participants who are shown these instructions will [work,
invest, . . . ] more/less than they normally would.” We find a much more
moderate response to these treatments, and consequently obtain much nar-
rower bounds, ranging from around 0.1 to 0.3 standard deviations.

   1
     Specifically, we study simple time, risk and ambiguity preference elicitation tasks,
a real effort task with and without performance incentives, a lying game, dictator game,
ultimatum game (first and second mover), and trust game (first and second mover).
Our data come from US-based Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) participants and a
US nationally representative online panel.

                                           3
    Our approach invokes a weak form of the “no defiers” assumption famil-
iar from estimation of local average treatment effects (Angrist and Imbens,
1994). Specifically, we require that when we demand a higher action not
“too many” participants choose a strictly lower action, and vice versa. We
provide evidence supporting this assumption with a within-participant ma-
nipulation in which we measure the same participants’ actions first without,
then with our demand treatments. Under slightly stronger assumptions,
this design enables us to classify participants as compliers or defiers. We
find that only around 5 percent of our participants are strict defiers that
respond in the opposite direction to our treatments. We discuss how such
within designs can be used to extract additional information about natu-
ral actions, correct the bounds for defier behavior, and reduce the cost of
applying our method.
    Next, following the basic approach of DellaVigna and Pope (2016), we
illustrate how our demand treatments can be used in conjunction with a
structural model to obtain unconfounded estimates of structural parame-
ters, measure the representative participant’s value of conforming to the
experimenter’s wishes, and predict demand-free choices. We estimate for
the effort task that the value of pleasing the experimenter is equivalent to
increasing the monetary incentives offered by around 20 percent.
    Finally, we examine several moderators of sensitivity to experimenter
demand. First, we find that women respond more to our demand treat-
ments than men. Second, surprisingly, we find little evidence that sensitiv-
ity to our demand manipulations varies between incentivized and hypothet-
ical choice. Third, we find some evidence that more attentive respondents
responded more strongly. Fourth, we compare behavior between two par-
ticipant pools—Amazon MTurk workers and a US representative online
panel—and find very similar responsiveness.
    We contribute to the small literature discussing experimenter demand
effects (Shmaya and Yariv, 2016; Zizzo, 2010), demand characteristics (Orne,
1962), and obedience to the experimenter (Milgram, 1963). List (2007) and
Bardsley (2008) argue that behavior in the dictator game is to a large de-
gree an artefact of the experimental situation, showing that adding the
option to take money in a dictator game dramatically reduces giving.
    We also contribute to the literature which examines the effects of anonymity

                                     4
on social behavior in the laboratory (Barmettler et al., 2012; Levitt and
List, 2007; Hoffman et al., 1996, 1994). Barmettler et al. (2012) find no
evidence that experimenter-participant anonymity affects behavior in stan-
dard social preference measures, while other studies document that non-
anonymity in the lab can increase pro-social behavior (List et al., 2004).
We also relate to work that explores the principal-agent relationship be-
tween experimenter and participant (Chassang et al., 2012; Shmaya and
Yariv, 2016).
    Third, our paper contributes to the literature discussing whether lab
behavior generalizes to the field (Levitt and List, 2007; Harrison and List,
2004). List (2006) finds that behavior in the lab environment can be at
odds with behavior in the field, which could be due to differences in demand
effects in the lab setting.
    Fourth, we relate to the growing literature on the effects of social
pressure on economic, and social behavior, for example, charitable giv-
ing (DellaVigna et al., 2012) and voting (DellaVigna et al., 2017; Gerber
et al., 2008).2
    The paper proceeds as follows: in Section 2 we set up a simple the-
oretical model of experimenter demand that motivates our approach. In
Section 3 we describe the data and our experimental design. In Section 4,
we present the main experimental results and structural estimates. In Sec-
tion 5 we examine heterogeneous effects. Section 6 concludes. An extensive
set of web appendices provides additional results and theory.


2       Theory
We model a decision-maker (he) who has preferences over the outcomes
induced by his action a ∈ R in an experiment. a can be continuous or
discrete, but for simplicity we focus on the case of continuous actions with
a natural ordering (more/less effort, investment, giving). The analysis
extends naturally to the case where a is the probability of a binary choice.
While throughout the analysis we treat a as the choice of a representative
agent, it is straightforward to reinterpret as a population or group mean
    2
     This literature is also linked to work on moral suasion and pro-social behavior
(Dal Bó and Dal Bó, 2014).

                                         5
action, and our conditions as applying to average actions.
    In the absence of demand effects, the optimal action is simply a func-
tion of the decision-making environment. We index environments by ζ ∈ Z,
where ζ captures aspects including participant characteristics (e.g. male/female,
student/representative sample), setting (e.g. lab/field, online/in-person),
experimental treatments, the content and framing of information provided
to participants, and so on. Given ζ, the optimal “natural” (experimenter-
absent) action is a(ζ).
    The experimenter (she) is interested in either i) measuring a specific
action a(ζ) (e.g., the level of giving out of an endowment), or ii) a treat-
ment effect a(ζ1 ) − a(ζ0 ) (e.g., the effect of incentives on effort provision).
Unfortunately, her task is complicated by experimenter demand. Knowing
that he is a participant in an experiment, the decision-maker changes his
action according to his belief about the experimenter’s wishes or objectives.
Instead of a(ζ), he chooses action aL (ζ) where L signifies the presence of a
“latent”, unobserved experimenter demand influence. The influence could
increase or decrease a: aL (ζ) R a(ζ). We define the latent demand effect
in environment ζ as the difference aL (ζ) − a(ζ).
    While nonzero latent demand automatically biases estimates of mean
actions, it does not necessarily bias estimates of treatment effects. The logic
of a randomized experiment is to induce orthogonal variation in a treatment
so as to estimate its influence purged of confounds. If the influence of latent
demand is orthogonal to the treatment, the treatment effect is not biased.
To see this, note that the treatment effect can be decomposed as follows:

  aL (ζ1 ) − aL (ζ0 ) = a(ζ1 ) − a(ζ0 ) + [aL (ζ1 ) − a(ζ1 )] − [aL (ζ0 ) − a(ζ0 )] (1)
                        |      {z    } |           {z       } |          {z       }
                       Effect of interest   Latent demand in ζ1   Latent demand in ζ0


    The first term on the right-hand side is the treatment effect of inter-
est. The second and third capture the potential bias due to experimenter
demand. If both demand effects are equal they cancel and the treatment
effect is identified, but they may not cancel, either because the participant’s
inference or his response to a given inference varies with ζ.

Example 1. Consider two variants on the classic Dictator game, in which
the participant is told to choose what fraction of $10 to give to another


                                             6
participant. In variant 0, she is told that the recipient is aware that the
choice is taking place, while in variant 1 they are unaware (for instance,
the money will just be added to a show-up fee). In both scenarios, absent
any motive for pleasing the experimenter she would prefer to give $4, so
the true treatment effect is a(ζ1 ) − a(ζ0 ) = $0. However, in variant 0 she
infers that the experimenter wants her to be generous, so she gives $5,
while in variant 1 she infers that the experimenter wants her to be selfish,
so she gives zero. Then aL (ζ0 ) − a(ζ0 ) = $1 and aL (ζ1 ) − a(ζ1 ) = −$4, so
aL (ζ1 ) − aL (ζ0 ) = −$5 and we spuriously identify a treatment effect that
is in reality a demand effect.


2.1    Demand treatments
We now assume that the experimenter has at her disposal a particular kind
of treatment manipulation which we call a demand treatment. Negative
demand treatments deliberately signal a demand that the decision-maker
decrease his action, inducing a− (ζ), while positive demand treatments de-
mand an increase and induce a+ (ζ). For illustrative purposes we assume
for now that there exists just one type of positive and negative demand
treatment, and discuss treatments that differ in intensity below.
    Our first substantive assumption is a basic monotonicity condition:

Assumption 1 (Monotone demand treatment effects). a− (z) ≤ aL (z) ≤
a+ (z), ∀z ∈ Z.

   Assumption 1 requires that a deliberate attempt by the experimenter to
demand an increase in the action does not decrease it, and vice versa. It has
a natural counterpart in the literature on local average treatment effects
(Angrist and Imbens, 1994): the assumption rules out “defier” behavior
whereby participants demanded to increase their actions, decrease them,
and vice versa. While this is a strong assumption, we note that we only
require it to hold for average actions, which is weaker than the standard
no-defiers assumption. Moreover, Assumption 1 is testable (for average
behavior) at t = ζ because we can test whether a− , aL and a+ are correctly
ordered. We perform this test for some of our applications, discussed below.
   Our next assumption is central to our bounding exercises, and simply


                                      7
amounts to assuming that the demand treatments are capable of bounding
the natural action of interest:

Assumption 2 (Bounding). a− (ζ) ≤ a(ζ) ≤ a+ (ζ).

  Assumption 2 allows us to bound estimates of mean actions and treat-
ment effects. It implies the following:

                        a(ζ) ∈ [a− (ζ), a+ (ζ)]                                    (2)
              a(ζ1 ) − a(ζ0 ) ∈ [a− (ζ1 ) − a+ (ζ0 ), a+ (ζ1 ) − a− (ζ0 )]         (3)

This assumption therefore delivers the central result than we can use demand-
inducing treatments to obtain bounds on mean actions (equation 2) and
treatment effects (equation 3).
    These bounds are the main objects of interest for our analysis, but for
some purposes we may wish to be able to make comparative statements
about demand in different environments. Although the latent demand ef-
fect is unobservable, the sensitivity of behavior to demand treatments may
be informative about it. Now we provide an assumption that enables us to
make such statements.

Definition (Sensitivity). Sensitivity is the difference in actions under pos-
itive and negative demand treatments: S(ζ) = a+ (ζ) − a− (ζ).

Remark 1. In addition to bounding the natural action, assumptions 1 and 2
jointly imply that sensitivity S(τ ) provides an upper bound on the magni-
tude of the latent demand effect: S(ζ) ≥ aL (ζ) − a(ζ) .3 This fact enables
us to use sensitivity S(ζ) to make statements of comparative ignorance, in
the sense that if S(ζ1 ) > S(ζ0 ) there is more scope for large latent demand
effects under ζ1 than under ζ0 (or equivalently, our bounds on a(ζ1 ) are
wider than those on a(ζ0 )).
   However, as sensitivity only gives us an upper bound on the latent
demand effect, it could be that the true latent demand effect is larger
under ζ0 . Our third assumption, Monotone Sensitivity, allows us to make
comparative statements about magnitudes.
    Proof: Assumption 1 gives aL (ζ) ∈ [a− (ζ), a+ (ζ)] while assumption 2 gives a(ζ) ∈
     3

[a (ζ), a+ (ζ)]. Taken together this implies aL (ζ) − a(ζ) ≤ a+ (ζ) − a− (ζ).

Definition (Comparison classes). A comparison class Z C ⊆ Z is a set of
environments for which Monotone Sensitivity holds for all z ∈ Z C .

Assumption 3 (Monotone Sensitivity). S(z) is strictly increasing in aL (z) − a(z)
for all z ∈ Z C .

    This assumption allows us to make comparative statements about la-
tent demand effects between environments. Natural candidates for com-
parison classes include environments that differ only in a small number
of attributes. For instance, an experimenter might be interested in test-
ing whether demand effects are larger in one participant pool compared
to another, or under one incentive scheme compared to another.4 We de-
rive some comparison classes below in the more structured context of our
Bayesian model.5
    Finally, we describe how demand treatments might be used to extract
estimates of a true treatment effect of interest. If the researcher is willing
to assume i) monotone sensitivity, and ii) that the latent demand effects
under ζ1 and ζ0 have the same sign (i.e, aL (ζ1 ) − a(ζ1 ) ≥ 0 ⇔ aL (ζ0 ) −
a(ζ0 ) ≥ 0), then, if the following difference-in-differences condition holds:
(a+ (ζ1 ) − a− (ζ1 )) − (a+ (ζ0 ) − a− (ζ0 )) = 0 , aL (ζ1 ) − aL (ζ0 ) identifies the
true treatment effect. Even if the condition does not hold, it can be used to
sign the bias due to demand. Suppose the condition is positive, implying
S(ζ1 ) > S(ζ0 ). Monotone sensitivity then implies that aL (ζ1 ) − a(ζ1 ) >
 aL (ζ0 ) − a(ζ0 ) . Then, knowing the sign of the latent demand effect under
ζ1 enables the researcher to sign the bias due to experimenter demand: If

   4
      A necessary condition for comparisons to be interesting is that actions are measured
in the same units. Translating actions into a common scale (for example, “standardizing”
the data to measure actions as multiples of the standard deviation) is one way to achieve
this. An environment can belong to multiple comparison classes, and all comparison
classes may be singletons.
    5
      Some experimenters might be willing to assume monotone sensitivity without
bounding. In that case the demand treatments can be informative about the scale
of experimenter demand in environment ζ without bounding the true action (e.g. it
could be that S(ζ) is some fixed proportion of aL (ζ) − a(ζ) ). Then, a natural use of
S(ζ) is to provide information about “how bad” experimenter demand would have to
be to threaten a certain interpretation of the data. She might compute objects like
m = aL (ζ) − α /S(ζ) in order to make statements like “latent demand would have to
be m multiples of S(ζ) to be consistent with a(ζ) = α.” Analogous approaches exist for
bounding bias due to sample selection or violation of the exclusion restriction in IV, eg.
Conley et al. (2012), Nevo and Rosen (2012) and Altonji et al. (2005).

                                            9
aL (ζ1 ) − a(ζ1 ) > 0 the experiment overestimates the treatment effect of
interest, if aL (ζ1 ) − a(ζ1 ) < 0 it underestimates it.


2.2     Bayesian model
In this section we provide a simple model of a decision-maker who is subject
to demand effects, so as to provide intuition for our main assumptions and
precise conditions under which they will or will not hold.
    The environment ζ determines the mapping from actions a ∈ R into
outcomes or distributions over outcomes, over which the decision-maker has
preferences. We compactly describe his payoff from action a in environment
ζ by v(a, ζ) where v captures both the payoff structure (mapping from
actions to outcomes) and preferences (mapping from outcomes to utility).
We assume that v is strictly concave and differentiable, so the natural
action a(ζ) solves v1 (a(ζ), ζ) = 0.

Example 2. Effort provision: A risk-neutral decision-maker chooses effort
a. Effort is rewarded by a piece-rate ζ and the cost of effort is c(a). Then
v(a, ζ) = ζa − c(a) and a(ζ) = c0−1 (ζ).

2.2.1    Latent demand

Demand enters preferences as follows. Upon observing the experiment and
treatment, the decision-maker makes an inference about an unobservable
parameter, h ∈ {−1, 1}. If h = −1, he believes the experimenter benefits
from him taking low actions, while if h = 1 he believes she benefits from
high actions.6 His preference for pleasing the experimenter is captured by
a preference parameter φ, which we allow to depend upon ζ, having in
mind that φ might depend on the identity of the experimenter (e.g. the
decision-maker might have different attitudes toward a researcher and a
firm) or decision-maker (e.g. women might have different attitudes than
men). φ(ζ) might also vary with other environment features such as the
salience of the potential benefit to the experimenter or how important the


   6
     We think of the decision-maker perceiving the experimenter’s preference over his
actions directly, preferring actions toward one or other extreme, rather than the exper-
imental outcomes outcomes induced by those actions.

                                          10
participant believes his actions are in achieving the experimenter’s objec-
tives. We remain agnostic about why the participant wishes to please the
experimenter; possible motives include altruism, a motive to conform, or
a belief that he will ultimately be rewarded for doing so. See e.g. Orne
(1962) for discussion.
    We assume utility is separable in payoffs and demand, in the following
form:

                       U (a, ζ) = v(a, ζ) + aφ(ζ)E[h|ζ]                       (4)

where E[h|ζ] = P r(h = 1|ζ)×1+P r(h = −1|ζ)×(−1) = 2P r(h = 1|ζ)−1.
The optimal action aL (ζ) solves:

                          v1 (aL (ζ), ζ) + φE[h|ζ] = 0                        (5)

so aL (ζ) = a(ζ) ⇔ φE[h|ζ] = 0. There is therefore no demand confound
if either a) the decision-maker assigns equal likelihood to the preferred
action being high or low (E[h|ζ] = 0), or when he does not care about the
experimenter’s objectives (φ = 0).
    We assume that the decision-maker’s prior over h is h0 = 0, so in the
absence of any new information about h he chooses a(ζ). The relation
between actions and beliefs is captured by daL (ζ)/dE[h|ζ] = −φ/v 00 (a, ζ),
which has the same sign as φ.
    We model the decision-maker’s learning about h as follows. The en-
vironment ζ includes a signal hL (ζ) ∈ {−1, 1} which the decision-maker
believes is a sufficient statistic for h, i.e. it contains all of the information
in ζ about h, so E[h|ζ] = E[h|hL (ζ)]. He believes that with probability
pL (ζ), the signal is correct (hL = h) and with probability 1 − pL (ζ), it
is pure noise (hL = , where  equals negative or positive one with equal
probability). We impose that pL (ζ) ∈ [0, 1), so the latent demand signal
can never be perfectly informative.7 It is straightforward to see (and we
show in the Appendix) that:

                           E[h|hL (ζ)] = hL (ζ)pL (ζ)                         (6)

   7
     This assumption avoids the possibility that both latent demand and the demand
treatment are seen as perfectly informative, but contradictory.

                                       11
    The decision-maker’s belief depends on the experimental treatment in
two ways. First, the treatment determines the sign of hL (ζ), i.e. whether
it induces a belief that the experimenter wants a high or low action. This
determines the direction of the latent demand effect. Second, the strength
of the latent demand effect depends on pL (ζ), which measures the informa-
tiveness of the signal to be about h. 8
    In an effort to reduce demand confounds it is common practice to ran-
domize treatments between participants and ensure participants are not
informed about treatments that they are not exposed to. Intuitively this
makes it harder for them to form conjectures about the experimental objec-
tive, thereby reducing the strength of learning and reducing its correlation
with the treatment variation. In our notation, information about other
treatments enters into ζ and would affect both hL and pL .

2.2.2    Demand treatments

We now assume that the experimenter has the option to send a “demand
treatment” signal hT ∈ {−1, 1, ∅}, which is either positive (hT = 1), nega-
tive (hT = −1), or no signal (hT = ∅). These signals deliberately direct the
decision-maker toward a high or low action by changing his belief about
h. We assume that if the experimenter does not send a signal (no demand
treatment), the decision-maker does not update his belief about h, i.e. he
does not draw any inference from the absence of a demand treatment. This
assumption is reasonable as at present demand treatments are rarely used
in experiments.
    We maintain throughout that ζ (and hence hL (ζ), pL (ζ) and φ(ζ)) does
not depend on the demand treatment, i.e. receiving a demand treatment
does not change the decision-maker’s interpretation of the maintained ex-
perimental environment or their motive for pleasing the experimenter, in-
stead the demand treatment is interpreted purely as informative about
the direction of the experimenter’s objective. Formally, we assume that
ζ(hT ) = ζ, ∀ζ. This assumption will be stronger for some demand treat-
ments and environments than others, and is an important consideration in

   8
     As an aside, we note that the setup nests “natural field experiments” (Harrison and
List, 2004) that induce no demand because the participant does not know they are in
an experiment.

                                          12
the selection of appropriate demand treatments.9 If this does not hold then
bounding may fail because the demand treatments alter the natural action
itself: a(ζ(∅)) ∈
                / [a(ζ(−1)), a(ζ(1))]. In section 2.3.6 and the appendix we
extend the model to allow φ to depend upon hT (i.e. the demand treat-
ments change the motive for pleasing the experimenter) and show that the
bounding condition remains unchanged.
    The decision-maker believes that hT is informative about h: with prob-
ability pT , hT equals h, and with probability 1 − pT it equals η, which
takes values negative and positive one with equal probability. η and  are
believed to be independent (we return to this assumption below). Based
on hT , the decision-maker updates his beliefs about h. We show in the
Appendix that the Bayesian posterior is:

                                        hL (ζ)pL (ζ) + hT pT
                   E[h|hT , hL (ζ)] =                                      (7)
                                        1 + hL (ζ)pL (ζ)hT pT

    Thus, if hL (ζ) = hT , the demand treatment reinforces the participant’s
belief, while if the signals have opposite signs they offset one another.

2.2.3   Assumptions

We now provide the formal connection from the Bayesian model to the
assumptions outlined in Section 2.1.
    First, Assumption 1 (monotone demand treatment effects) states that
a positive demand treatment increases the action (relative to no demand
treatment) and the negative demand treatment decreases it. In the Bayesian
model the conditions for this relationship to hold are φ(E[h|hT = 1, hL (ζ)]−
E[h|hL ]) ≥ 0 and φ(E[h|hT = −1, hL (ζ)] − E[h|hL ]) ≤ 0. It is straightfor-
ward to see (and we show in the Appendix) that except for the trivial case
pT = 0, these conditions are satisfied if and only if φ ≥ 0, i.e. the partic-
ipant has a weak preference for pleasing the experimenter (and therefore
does not “defy” the perceived demand).

Proposition 1. Assumption 1 (monotone demand treatment effects) holds
for all pT if and only if φ ≥ 0.

   9
    For example our “do us a favor” treatments may be unsuited to an experiment
studying altruism toward the experimenter.

                                        13
    Second, Assumption 2 (bounding) states that the demand treatments
provide bounds on the true action. In the Bayesian model, the action is
larger or smaller than a(ζ) when φE[h|hT , hL ] R 0. Given that φ ≥ 0 by
Assumption 1, we need E[h|hT = 1, hL ] ≥ 0 and E[h|hT = −1, hL ] ≤ 0.
This is obviously guaranteed if hT and hL have the same sign, so we simply
need to check whether it holds when the demand treatment and latent
demand are in opposite directions, i.e. E[h|hT = 1, hL = −1] ≥ 0 and
E[h|hT = −1, hL = 1] ≤ 0. Given our restriction pL (ζ) < 1, inspection of
(7) reveals that these conditions hold if and only if pT ≥ pL (ζ), i.e. the
decision-maker perceives the demand treatment as at least as informative
about h as the latent demand signal.

Proposition 2. Assumption 2 (bounding) holds if and only if pT ≥ pL (ζ).

   Finally, Assumption 3 (monotone sensitivity) states that within a com-
parison class Z C of environments, differences in sensitivity are informative
about differences in underlying latent demand. Since latent demand and
sensitivity can vary for multiple reasons, there is no simple condition that
guarantees when this assumption will and will not hold. In Appendix C.4
we work out the following cases:

  1. We show that monotone sensitivity holds when variation in demand
     effects is driven by differences in the strength of preference for pleasing
     the experimenter, φ.

  2. We analyze monotone sensitivity when variation in demand effects is
     driven by differences in the utility function, v, deriving specific condi-
     tions when v is additively or multiplicatively separable and providing
     examples.

  3. We show that monotone sensitivity holds for variation driven by inat-
     tention to experimenter demand.

  4. We show that monotone sensitivity does not hold in general for vari-
     ation driven by differences in beliefs.

We use these findings when interpreting our results on heterogeneity.

2.3     Discussion and extensions
2.3.1   “Strong” and “weak” demand treatments

As shown above, the bounding assumption holds when pT ≥ pL (ζ). Thus
far we have assumed that there is only one demand treatment (with a
positive and negative variant), but in reality there are many different ways
to signal a desire for high or low actions. How should the experimenter
choose?
    Observe that the width of the bounds [a− (ζ), a+ (ζ)] is increasing in
pT .10 Therefore the tightest bounds, subject to satisfying the bounding
condition, are obtained when pT = pL (ζ). In other words, we want the
“least informative” demand treatment, conditional on it being more infor-
mative than the latent signal. Thus, there exists a trade-off between the
informativeness of the demand signal and the tightness of bounds: one can
use demand treatments that strongly signal the experimenter’s objective,
giving confidence in the (wide) bounds obtained, or use more subtle ma-
nipulations to obtain tighter bounds, at the risk of failing to bound the
true action or treatment effect.
    In our applications, we use two demand treatments. The first, “strong”
treatment explicitly tells participants what we wish: “You will do us a
favor if you [. . . ] more/less than you normally would.” The second, “weak”
treatment hints at a hypothesis, but does not explicitly tell the participant
what we want them to do: “We expect that participants who are shown
these instructions will [. . . ] more/less than they normally would.” We view
the first treatment as being more informative about the experimenter’s
wishes (i.e., carrying a higher pT ) than the second, therefore generating
more reliable but wider bounds.

2.3.2   Fewer demand treatments

It may not always be necessary to construct two-sided bounds. One such
case is when the researcher has a strong prior about the direction of la-
tent demand. For example, if they believe aL (ζ) < a(ζ) they might use

                                                               −2
  10
    Proof: dE[h|hT , hL ]/dpT = hT 1 − hL2 pL2 1 + hL pL hT pT      , which has the
same sign as hT , so a+ is increasing and a− decreasing in pT .

                                        15
only a positive demand treatment and construct bounds [aL (ζ), a+ (ζ)]. Al-
ternatively, they may only be interested in one bound. If they only wish
to obtain a lower bound on a treatment effect a(ζ1 ) − a(ζ0 ), they might
measure only a+ (ζ0 ) and a− (ζ1 ).

2.3.3   Discrete actions

The analysis easily extends to discrete and possibly un-ordered actions,
such as accepting/rejecting a contract, selecting a lottery from a choice list
or choosing bundles from a menu. Typically the experimenter will then
be interested in the probability that a given option is chosen, and may be
concerned that this probability is influenced by participants’ beliefs about
what the experimenter wants them to choose. Demand treatments can
be readily constructed to manipulate those beliefs and obtain bounds, for
instance telling participants “you will do us a favor if you (do not) choose
option j.”

2.3.4   Heterogeneity

Thus far we assumed a representative agent and made assumptions about
his behavior. However, the approach naturally extends to the case where
participants are heterogeneous and the experimenter is interested in average
behavior or average treatment effects. If our non-parametric assumptions
1 and 2 hold for all agents individually, then we can simply reinterpret the
natural action a and observed actions aL , a+ and a− as representing mean
behaviors and our approach remains valid. Intuitively, if we can bound all
individuals’ natural actions, then we also bound the mean of those actions.
    An important source of heterogeneity is in participants’ beliefs about
the experimenter’s wishes, whereby Ei [h|hL ] takes on different values for
different individuals i. This could be because pLi (ζ) (perceived precision of
the signal) varies across individuals, hLi (ζ) (perceived direction of demand),
or both. However, since the bounding condition depends only on pT ≥
pL (ζ) and not the direction hL , provided the inequality is satisfied each
individual’s natural action will be bounded by a− and a+ and the average
natural action is bounded. A simple sufficient condition that guarantees
bounding is pT ≥ maxi pLi (ζ).


                                      16
2.3.5   Defiers

Our monotone demand treatment effects assumption requires that there
are no “defiers” who do the opposite of what they believe the experimenter
wishes. In the model, such individuals possess a φ < 1. Bounding then
fails for these individuals, because a− ≥ a+ . However, we may still be able
to bound population average behavior if the number of defiers and their
responsiveness are relatively small.
    To illustrate, we focus on the special case where preferences v and beliefs
E[h|hL ], E[h|hT , hL ] are identical for all individuals. In other words, all
participants believe they know what the experimenter wants, but vary in
their desire to conform. This means that the natural action is the same for
all individuals and given by the solution to v1 (a(ζ), ζ) = 0. We label the
beliefs H L , H + and H − . We further restrict preferences to be quadratic in
actions, so v1 (a, ζ) = b − ca where b and c are constants that may depend
on ζ. Normalizing c to equal 1, the natural action is equal to b for all
individuals, while the action when beliefs equal H is b + φH. We therefore
have:

     EaL = b + H L Eφi       Ea+ = b + H + Eφi        Ea− = b + H − Eφi

Monotone demand treatment effects is satisfied on average if EeL ∈ [Ea− , Ea+ ],
which holds if and only if Eφi ≥ 0. Therefore, testing for monotone de-
mand treatment effects is equivalent to testing whether φ is positive on
average. Bounding will hold provided H + Eφi ≥ 0 and H − Eφi ≤ 0, which
follows if pT ≥ pL (ζ) and Eφi ≥ 0.
    This case is simple because of the quadratic preferences assumption,
which implies that compliers and defiers respond symmetrically in oppo-
site directions. More generally we would require conditions on the joint
distribution of preferences and beliefs such that that the response by the
compliers “outweighs” that of the defiers.

2.3.6   Extension: learning about φ

A possible interpretation of our demand treatments is that they signal
not only the direction of the experimenter’s objective, but the salience or


                                      17
intensity of her preference over objectives. In appendix C.5 we extend
the model to incorporate this feature, allowing φ to depend upon a belief
about the “importance” of the objective. We assume that the decision-
maker responds more strongly to experimenter demand when they believe
that complying with the objective it is more important, and that this belief
depends both on latent demand and the demand treatments. We show that
the key condition for bounding is still pT ≥ pL , but that demand treatments
that are perceived to signal more importance generate wider bounds.

2.3.7    Extension: richer beliefs and correlated signals

Researchers sometimes give experimental participants instructions like “there
are no right or wrong answers” or “we are only interested in what you think
is the best choice.” Such instructions can be naturally thought of as a
demand treatment that attempts to demand participants choose the nat-
ural action, a(ζ). It is straightforward to analyze such treatments in our
framework. In Appendix C.6 we extend the model to allow h to take three
values: {−1, 0, 1}, where h = 0 captures the case where the experimenter
wants the participant to choose the natural action.
    We show that unless the demand treatment is perceived as fully infor-
mative (pT = 1), signaling hT = 0 does not induce the participant to take
the natural action, i.e. a0 (ζ) 6= a(ζ). The intuition is that such a treatment
does not eliminate all of the influence of latent demand – the decision-maker
views both signals as informative and weighs them against one another,
therefore the posterior belief lies between 0 and E[h|hL ].11 However, be-
cause signaling hT = 0 moves actions toward the natural action it can be
informative about the direction of latent demand. We also show that in an
alternative formulation with non-independent signals, where participants
perceive the demand treatments to contain the same information as latent
demand but less noise, signaling hT = 0 does elicit the natural action.
    In sum, demanding the natural action is not guaranteed to obtain
bounds that contain the natural action, while a pair of sufficiently strong
positive and negative demand treatments does.

  11
      One interpretation of latent influences in this model is “implicit” influence – the
participant is not fully aware of the influence of latent demand and therefore unable to
fully ignore it.

                                           18
2.4      Inference
The theory tells us how to measure bounds on actions and treatment ef-
fects. Since these objects can be estimated experimentally, we may also
wish to perform inference on the bounds themselves, or on the underlying
parameters contained by the bounds. In Appendix C.7 we show how to do
this, following Imbens and Manski (2004). We also provide a Stata pack-
age that allows calculation of demand-robust confidence intervals for mean
behavior and treatment effects.


3        Sample and experimental design
We conducted seven experiments in total to test the method and to provide
estimates of demand sensitivity on a wide range of experimental tasks. We
conduct all of our experiments online, primarily because the very large
number of treatments would be infeasible to implement in the laboratory.12
We purposefully designed the experiments to maximize comparability. For
all experiments except the effort task, choice sets are similar in that they
can be expressed as real numbers from 0 to 1; we pay the same show-up
fee; use a similar subject pool, mode of collection (online experiments with
MTurk and online panel), and response mode (sliders); and stake sizes are
as similar as possible.13
    In Table 7 we summarize the key design features of each experiment.
We describe the sample, which games were used, which demand treatments
we employed, and whether choices involved real stakes or were hypotheti-
cal. More details on the experimental designs and the exact experimental
instructions can be found in the pre-analysis plans, as well as the experi-
mental instructions in the online appendix.14




    12
      One might surmise that demand effects are more difficult to induce in online set-
tings, which provide greater anonymity than in-person lab settings. Our bounds might
therefore be underestimates. We leave to future work to compare demand effect bounds
in online and in-person lab settings.
   13
      For the effort task, we replicated the design of DellaVigna and Pope (2016). The
primary differences are a higher show-up fee and a different response mode (effort).
   14
      The online appendix is available at nber.org.

                                          19
3.1     Participant populations
We conducted six experiments with approximately 16,000 participants on
Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and one experiment with 3,000 respon-
dents using a representative online panel of the US population. MTurk is
an online labor marketplace that is frequently used by academics to recruit
participants for experiments. It is attractive because it offers researchers a
large and diverse pool of workers that have been shown to be more attentive
to instructions than college students (Hauser and Schwarz, 2016).
    To participate in our MTurk experiment, people had to live in the U.S,
have an overall approval rating of more than 95%, and have completed
more than 500 tasks on MTurk. We excluded prior participants when
recruiting for experiments 2, 3 and 7. However, in experiments 5 and 6, we
had essentially exhausted the active participant pool, and to avoid undue
delays in recruitment we therefore allowed prior participants to take part.15
    Most workers on MTurk are experienced in taking surveys, which is
a potential threat to the external validity of our results (Chandler et al.,
2014). We therefore conducted one additional experiment using a repre-
sentative online sample, whose participants are less experienced with social
science experiments.16 This sample of 3,000 respondents is representative
of the US population in terms of region, age, income, and gender.


3.2     Preanalysis plans
Each experiment is described in a preanalysis plan (PAP) posted online
prior to launch.17 Each PAP outlines the analysis for an individual exper-
iment. For brevity and ease of exposition, in this paper, we pool the data,
i.e. present and compare all tasks side by side, rather than experiment by
experiment. However, the analysis follows what was pre-specified, with a



  15
      Our results are virtually unchanged by the exclusion of respondents that completed
more than one of our experiments; results available upon request.
   16
      We collect data on this sample through an online survey in collaboration with
the market research company, Research Now. This provider has been used in previous
research, for example by Almås et al. (2016).
   17
      The pre-analysis plans were posted on the on the Social Science Registry and can

few minor exceptions.18 In addition, online appendix E presents all of the
pre-specified analyses for each experiment.


3.3      Summary statistics
The experiments were run between May 2016 and May 2017. In Tables
A.40 to A.46 in the online appendix, we provide details on the sample
characteristics of our respondents from both MTurk and the representative
sample. In addition, in Tables A.32 to A.38 in the online appendix, we
present the pre-specified balance tables for all of these experiments. Table
A.43 highlights that respondents from the online panel are representative
of the US population by gender, income, age, and region, and in terms
of other observables, such as education and race. Attrition was low, with
less than 2 percent of participants dropping out of our experiments on
average. Importantly, there was no differential attrition across the different
demand treatment arms. Tables A.14 and A.15 in the online appendix
summarize attrition rates at the game level for the strong and weak demand
experiments, respectively.


4        Applying the method
4.1      Bounding natural actions
Our first set of experiments attempts to measure the upper and lower bound
of behavior using our strong demand treatments, which explicitly tell par-
ticipants they will “do us a favor” by taking a higher or lower action than
normal. Our respondents complete one of the following games: a dictator
game, an investment game (to measure risk preferences; (Gneezy and Pot-
ters, 1997)), convex time budgets (to measure time preferences; (Andreoni
and Sprenger, 2012)), a trust game (first mover or second mover; (Berg et
al., 1995)), an ultimatum game (first mover or second mover; (Güth et al.,
1982)), a lying game (Fischbacher and Föllmi-Heusi, 2013), a measure of

    18
     For example, in experiment 1 we prespecified three pairwise tests for differences in
behavior between the dictator, risk and time tasks. Expanding to eleven tasks would
entail 55 such tests, which seems excessive and which we therefore do not conduct.
However, the results are available upon request.

                                           21
ambiguity aversion based on the risk preference task, and a real effort task
(DellaVigna and Pope, 2016).
    As an example, in the dictator game, participants in the positive de-
mand condition are given the following message: “You will do us a favor if
you give more to the other participant than you normally would”.19 Par-
ticipants in the negative demand condition receive the following message:
“You will do us a favor if you give less to the other participant than you nor-
mally would.” In Table 8, we describe the key design features and demand
instructions for each game.
    For a subset of games,20 we also measure behavior in a no-demand
condition in which participants receive no demand manipulation, to test
Assumption 1, monotone demand treatment effects. In addition, in the
dictator game, convex time budgets, and the investment game, half of our
respondents made choices for real stakes, while half made hypothetical
choices for the same stake sizes. For the remaining games, all choices are
incentivized.
    Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2 summarize the response to the strong
demand treatments for each of the games, restricting the sample to MTurk
respondents and incentivized choices. In Panel A of Table 1, we show
the unconditional mean actions in the different demand treatment arms.21
Our objects of interest are mean behavior in the positive demand condition,
a+ (ζ), mean behavior in the negative demand condition, a− (ζ), and mean
behavior in the no-demand condition, aL (ζ).
    In Panel B of Table 1, we display our sensitivity measure (a+ (ζ)−a− (ζ))
for each of the 11 games, in both raw and z-scored units.22 Behavior is
responsive to our strong demand treatments across tasks, and sensitivity is

  19
      Our instructions are close to the ones used by Binmore et al. (1985): “You will
be doing us a favor if you simply set out to maximize your winnings”. Deutsch et al.
(1967) employ a similar approach, telling participants “I want you to to earn as much
money as you can regardless of how much the other earns”. Such instructions have been
criticized precisely because they risk of inducing experimenter demand (Thaler, 1988;
Zizzo, 2010).
   20
      The dictator game, convex time budgets, the investment game, and the two real
effort tasks.
   21
      For most of the games the action set lies between 0 and 1; if not we rescale the
action space to the [0, 1] interval.
   22
      We z-score our outcome variables at the game level, using the mean and s.d. for
the negative demand group (Kling et al., 2007).

                                         22
significantly different from zero in all tasks. Sensitivity is particularly high
in the dictator game, for second movers in the trust game and ultimatum
games, and for unincentivized effort.
    In Panel C of Table 1, we examine the monotone demand treatment
effects assumption: a+ (ζ) ≥ aL (ζ) ≥ a− (ζ). We estimate the following
equation, in which P OSi takes value one for people in the positive demand
condition and value zero otherwise, and where N EGi takes value one for
people in the negative demand condition and value zero otherwise:

                      ZYi = π0 + π1 P OSi + π2 N EGi + εi                          (8)

    As can be seen in Panel C of Table 1, we find support for the assump-
tion. In all cases the positive demand treatment increased actions, and the
negative treatment decreased them on average. In most cases the differ-
ences are statistically significant.

                      [Insert Table 1 and Figures 1 2]


4.2     Bounding treatment effects
In our real effort experiment, which replicates a subset of the treatments
in DellaVigna and Pope (2016), participants earned points by alternately
pressing two keyboard buttons for 10 minutes. In one treatment arm, re-
spondents were told that their score “will not affect [their] payment,” while
in the second they received one cent per 100 points. For some participants
we added our demand treatments to these instructions, telling workers “you
will do us a favor if you work harder/less hard than you normally would.”
We can apply our method to estimate bounds on the treatment effect of
performance pay on effort provision.23
    Panel A in Figure 3 and Panel A in Table 2 summarize the sensitivity of
effort to our strong demand treatments, and how this sensitivity depends on
incentives. We find that individuals who receive no bonus are substantially
more sensitive to our demand treatments.

  23
     In addition to these main treatment arms, 250 additional individuals completed the
“no demand condition” for a reward of 4 cents per 100 points. This treatment arm is
used in the structural estimation below.

                                          23
    Panel B in Figure 3 and Panel B in Table 2 display the conventional
treatment effect (aL (1) − aL (0), where “1” and “0” correspond to the reward
per 100 points), the upper bound of the treatment effect (a+ (1) − a− (0)),
and the lower bound of the treatment effect (a− (1) − a+ (0)). The bounds
we estimate are quite wide, ranging from 0.25 to 1.35 standardized units.
However, the lower bound (0.25) is statistically significantly different from
zero. This implies that even if behavior in the unincentivized condition
is biased by extreme negative latent demand (i.e. a(0) = a+ (0)), while
behavior in the incentivized condition is strongly positively biased (i.e.
a(1) = a− (1)), we can still support the conclusion that incentives increase
effort.

                     [Insert Table 2 and Figure 3]


4.3    Tighter bounds with weak demand treatments
While the bounds we obtain using the strong demand treatments satisfy the
monotone demand treatment effects assumption, they are wide, meaning
that we cannot rule out many possible values for a(ζ). We therefore conduct
additional experiments to obtain less conservative bounds, at the cost of a
less plausible bounding assumption.24
    Our weak demand treatments take a similar form to the strong treat-
ments, but rather than explicitly reporting an objective (“you will do us a
favor”), we simply reveal an experimental hypothesis to the participants,
without demanding that they act to confirm it. For example, in the in-
vestment game, participants were told that “We expect that participants
who are shown these instructions will invest more/less in the project than
they normally would,” with the phrasing modified accordingly for other
tasks. Table 9 describes design features and the demand instructions for
each game.
    As before, for a subset of games (the dictator and investment games), we
collect data without the demand treatment to test for monotone demand
treatment effects. In addition, for the dictator game and the investment


  24
     We employed weak demand treatments in experiments 2, 4, 5 and 6. A more
detailed description can be found in Table 7.

                                     24
game, half of our respondents’ choices are incentivized, and half hypothet-
ical. For all other tasks all choices are incentivized.
     We present results from the MTurk experiments with weak demand
treatments and incentivized choices. In Panel A of Table 3 we display the
unconditional means in the different demand treatment arms. In Figure
2 we plot these values with confidence intervals. Our objects of interest
are mean behavior in the positive demand condition, a+ (ζ), mean behavior
in the negative demand condition, a− (ζ), and mean behavior in the no-
demand condition, aL (ζ).
     Panel B of Table 3 and Figure 1 display the sensitivities by game,
(a (ζ) − a− (ζ)).25 For convex time budgets, the effort tasks, the lying
   +

task, and the trust game first mover, we find sensitivities to weak demand
below 0.10 standard deviations.26 We find stronger responses (between
0.20–0.25 standard deviations) for the dictator game, the ultimatum game
second mover, and the trust game second mover. Sensitivity in the invest-
ment game under risk and uncertainty, as well as for the ultimatum game
first mover, is approximately 0.17 standard deviations.
     In Panel C of Table 3 we examine the monotone demand treatment
effect assumption, finding that most demand treatments have the correct
sign and are significant. We estimate a small negative effect of the positive
demand treatment in the investment game, and a small positive effect of
the negative treatment in the dictator game, though neither estimate is
statistically significant.

4.4     Confidence intervals
We compute confidence intervals for (a) the bounds themselves, and (b)
for the parameters contained by those bounds (an action or treatment
effect), following Imbens and Manski (2004). Confidence intervals for the
parameter are slightly tighter than for the bounds, which reflects the fact

  25
      We again z-score our outcome variables at the paradigm-incentive level, using the
mean and s.d. for the negative demand group (Kling et al., 2007).
   26
      Our minimum detectable effect sizes range from between 0.20 to .34 standard de-
viations.

that the parameter cannot lie at both bounds simultaneously.27 In Table
A.4 we present confidence intervals for all 11 games, and in Table A.5 we
present confidence intervals for the treatment effect in the effort experiment.
Details on how confidence intervals are computed are given in the online
appendix C.7.


4.5     Structural estimates
Under additional parametric and identifying assumptions, our demand
treatments permit structural estimation of demand-free model parameters
(v), as well as φ and the latent demand beliefs. Knowing v allows the re-
searcher to make predictions about behavior in demand-free environments.
Knowing φ allows them to quantify the importance of experimenter demand
relative to v. Measuring beliefs can enable them to diagnose and eliminate
the sources of latent demand effects. We illustrate how structural estima-
tion can be performed using the real effort experiment. Because demand
effects can be easily incorporated in the model of DellaVigna and Pope
(2016) (DP), we can exactly follow their approach to structural estimation.
    In their experiment, DP estimate the following utility function (ex-
pressed in our notation):

                              v(a) = (s + ζ)a − c(a)                              (9)

The action a is effort, measured in points on the task, c(a) is a cost of effort
function, ζ is a piece rate, and s is an intrinsic motivation parameter —
workers may work for no pay because they enjoy the task. DP solve the
first order condition and estimate the model parameters using nonlinear
least squares (NLLS).28
    Adding demand to this utility function gives:

                U (a, ζ) = (s + ζ + φ(ζ)E[h|hT , hL (ζ)])a − c(a)                (10)



  27
      But for a coverage correction derived by Imbens and Manski, the 1 − α confidence
interval on the parameter corresponds to the 1 − 2α interval on the bounds.
   28
      They also employ a minimum distance estimation procedure. We stick to NLLS for
brevity.

                                         26
with corresponding first-order condition

                  s + ζ + φ(ζ)E[h|hT , hL (ζ)] − c0 (a∗ (ζ)) = 0                  (11)

DP consider two alternative forms for c: First, a power function c(a) =
ka1+γ /(1 + γ), yielding optimal effort equal to:
                                                                  γ1
                                  s + ζ + φ(ζ)E[h|hT , hL (ζ)]
                              
                     ∗
                    a (ζ) =                                                       (12)
                                              k
Second, an exponential form c(a) = k exp(γa)/γ, with corresponding effort
level:
                              s + ζ + φ(ζ)E[h|hT , hL (ζ)]
                                                          
               ∗       1
              a (ζ) = log                                           (13)
                       γ                  k
    We have seven treatment groups in total: neutral treatments with piece
rates equal to 0 cents, 1 cent, and 4 cents per 100 points on the task;
and positive and negative strong demand treatments in the 0 and 1 cent
groups.29 However, we have 13 parameters in total: s, k, γ, φ(0), φ(1),
φ(4), pL (0), pL (1), pL (4), hL (0), hL (1), hL (4), and pT .30 We therefore need
to impose some further restrictions.
    First we assume that φ is fixed: φ(0) = φ(1) = φ(4) = φ. In other
words, varying incentives do not change the participants’ desire to please
the experimenter. Second, we assume pT = 1. By assumption this is
not justified for our weak demand treatments, so we focus on the strong
treatments, where the assumption is more plausible. This assumption
implies that E[h|hT , hL ] = hT . We are therefore able to identify φ, s,
γ, and k just using the four demand treatment groups. Third, since
E[h|hL (ζ)] = pL (ζ)hL (ζ) ∈ [−1, 1], we can treat it as a single parameter
whose sign identifies hL and whose magnitude identifies pL (ζ). We are left
with seven parameters, s, k, γ, φ, pL (0)hL (0), pL (1)hL (1), and pL (4)hL (4),
and are therefore exactly identified. We additionally estimate a specifica-
tion in which we restrict latent demand to depend only on whether mone-

  29
      We also collected data using weak demand treatments, but we do not use it in
this analysis a) because it was collected in a separate experiment and b) because as we
explain below, for estimation we need to impose the parameter restriction pT = 1, which
we do not believe is satisfied in the weak treatments.
   30
      In principle pT might also vary with ζ and hT . Our model presented above rules
this out by assumption.

                                           27
tary incentives are present, i.e. pL (1)hL (1) = pL (4)hL (4), in which case we
are overidentified.
    While we estimate the same model as DP, the identification comes from
a different source. Under the assumption of no latent demand (as in DP),
s, γ, and k are identified from the three neutral treatments. When latent
demand is present, the model parameters are identified from the demand
treatments, and the neutral treatments identify the latent demand beliefs.
This also means that for our purposes the neutral treatment with four cent
incentives is not necessary for identification of the core parameters.
    We follow DP in estimating equation (12) in logs and equation (13) in
levels, using nonlinear least squares.31 Estimation results are presented in
Table 4. Columns 1–3 correspond to the power cost function and columns
4–6 to the exponential cost function. In each case we first mirror DP by
estimating s, γ, and k using only the neutral treatments, assuming that
there is no latent demand.32 Second, we include all treatment groups and
impose that latent demand depends only on whether monetary incentives
are present. Third, we allow latent demand to differ across all three in-
centive levels. Coefficients s and φ are measured in cents per 100 points.
Therefore, s = 1 is interpreted as intrinsic demand playing an equivalent
role to an incentive of 1 cent per 100 points, while φ = 1 means that a
worker who is certain the experimenter wants high effort works as if her
incentives were increased by 1 cent per 100 points, relative to someone who
does not know the experimenter’s wishes.
    Our first finding is an important potential role for experimenter de-
mand. Our estimates of s and φ are quite large and of similar magnitude
in all specifications, taking values equivalent to 0.2–0.5 cents per 100 points.
Assuming a value of φ of around 0.25 would imply that switching from ex-
treme negative to extreme positive demand (a change in E[h|hL ] from −1
to 1) increases effort by as much as increasing the incentive by 0.5 cents per

  31
      Since the piece rates are per 100 points, we follow DP in rounding scores to the
nearest 100. See the online appendix D for further details of the estimation.
   32
      The parameter estimates we obtain are quite different from those of DP. One pos-
sible explanation is that DP estimate their main specification from 0, 1, and 10 cent
treatments, while we use 0, 1, and 4 cents, which may discipline the curvature of the
effort cost function less. Additionally, while we like they recruited our participants on
MTurk, our experiments were conducted some time after theirs, so the participant pool
may have changed somewhat.

                                           28
100 points. Our estimates of E[h|hL ] are mostly negative, consistent with
latent demand decreasing effort (though in the exponential cost case we
estimate a positive value in the 1 cent treatment). However, the estimates
are noisy and typically not significantly different from zero. We also esti-
mate that in the 4 cent treatment, E[h|hL (4)] ≈ −6.5, which contradicts
the theory (beliefs should lie in [−1, 1]), though we note that −1 lies well
within the 95% confidence interval. We do not have demand treatment
groups who were paid 4 cents, so the effort cost function is extrapolated
out of sample to this group, which may help explain the poor fit of the
model.
    Our second finding is that allowing for demand can be quantitatively
important for other parameter estimates. This is most noticeable when
comparing the estimates of s when we do and do not allow for demand
effects; the estimates are an order of magnitude smaller in the latter case
(columns 1 and 4). Our estimates imply a negative latent demand effect
which is instead attributed to low intrinsic motivation.
    Finally, the structural estimates enable us to go beyond bounding to
back out predicted demand-free behavior. To do this we plug our parameter
estimates back into the first order conditions, fixing E[h|hL ] = 0. Results
are presented in table A.3 in the online appendix. Since most of our esti-
mated latent demand effects are negative, predicted demand-free effort is
usually higher than observed effort, sometimes considerably so.

                            [Insert Table 4]


4.6    Measuring defiance
Valid bounds on average behavior require that there are not “too many”
defiers: individuals who try to do the opposite of what they believe the ex-
perimenter wants. This is an identifying assumption in our basic approach
which randomizes participants into different demand treatments, exposing
them to either a positive, negative, or no demand treatment. Our seventh
experiment is designed to assess the reasonableness of the assumption, by
collecting within-participant data on behavior first without, and then with
a demand treatment. Intuitively, by observing who increases and who de-
creases their action in response to a positive demand treatment, we can

                                    29
identify who is a complier and who is a defier. Note that in this sense,
our setup differs from the “potential outcomes” framework, in which defier
behavior is usually unobservable.
    The structure of the experiment is as follows. Participants (N = 1002)
on MTurk are told that they will complete two tasks and that they will
be paid according to the choice made in one of them, selected by chance.
Half play the dictator game twice, and the other half the investment game.
They first complete the task without any demand treatment. Then, they
complete the same task again, but with the addition of the strong posi-
tive or negative demand treatment. We thus have four groups, split by
dictator/investment game and positive/negative demand treatment in task
2.
    The model implies a simple interpretation of the data. Participants
observe the first task, form a belief about h, and make a choice. They then
observe the second task with the demand treatment, update their belief,
and make a new choice depending on φ. Strict compliers, with φ > 0,
will increase their action relative to task 1, strict defiers with φ < 0 will
decrease it, and those with φ = 0 should take the same action in both tasks.
We do however caution against over-interpreting the data, for two reasons.
First, in the theory we assume that the environment ζ, and therefore the
natural action, a(ζ), is independent of the demand treatment, hT . This
is a stronger assumption in our within design that reveals to participants
that the response to hT is itself part of the analysis, and could change their
interpretation of ζ.33 Second, it might matter that participants have made a
prior choice, either out of a concern for consistency (reducing responsiveness
to our demand treatments) or a motive to either reveal or conceal their
defier/complier identity.
    Our main findings are presented in Figures 4 and 5, which show the dis-
tributions of the changes in behavior between tasks 1 and 2. Only about
5 percent of our respondents are strict defiers. About 30 percent do not
change their behavior at all in response to our strong demand treatments,

  33
     We suspect that this is not a serious concern in practice: participants presumably
infer that our interest is in showing people respond to our demand treatments by chang-
ing their actions in task 2 relative to task 1. Compliers who wish to conform to this
objective would then increase their action while defiers would decrease their action, thus
we would arrive at the correct complier/defier classification.

                                           30
while the remaining 65 percent respondents strictly comply with our de-
mand treatments. The proportions are similar for the dictator and the
investment game. These findings suggest that there is very little defiance
in practice, in support of our method.
     Table 10 mirrors our prior results, presenting mean actions and sensi-
tivities estimated from the within design, alongside the equivalent objects
from the earlier experiments (using incentivized choices from MTurk partic-
ipants). Interestingly, the sensitivities estimated from the second stage of
the within design are very similar in magnitude to those from the between
design, and if anything slightly larger.34 This suggests that the concerns
about the within design outlined above may not be serious in practice. It
also suggests that researchers may be able to simply and relatively cheaply
obtain bounds using within-participant demand treatments, avoiding the
need to recruit new subjects.
     We also highlight several other potential uses of the within-participant
data. First, they can be used to construct “defier-robust” bounds. For de-
fiers, a(ζ) ∈ [a+ (ζ), a− (ζ)], so if the proportion of compliers is c we can con-
struct defier-robust bounds equal to [cE[a− (ζ)|φ ≥ 0] + (1 − c)E[a+ (ζ)|φ <
0], cE[a+ (ζ)|φ ≥ 0] + (1 − c)E[a− (ζ)|φ < 0]]. The “defier-robust” bounds as
well as the standard bounds are displayed in Table A.2. Second, our as-
sumption that pL (ζ) < pT ≤ 1 guarantees that those with φ 6= 0 will change
their action in response to a demand treatment. Thus, participants who do
not respond at all reveal that φ = 0, in which case aL (ζ) = a(ζ), i.e. we can
identify the natural action for these participants. Third, researchers might
be intrinsically interested in comparing the observable characteristics and
behavior of compliers and defiers.


4.7     Beliefs
In each experiment, after participants had completed the relevant task,
we collected simple, unincentivized belief data. Specifically, we asked two
questions. First, we asked “What do you think is the result that the re-
searchers of this study want to find?” and second, “What do you think
  34
     We also analyze the behavior of compliers and defiers separately, in Table A.1 in
the online appendix, comparing the average change in action between task 1 and 2 for
each group separately.

                                         31
was the hypothesis of this research study?” Responses were binary: par-
ticipants could respond that they thought the objective/hypothesis was
either a high or low action. The main purpose of these belief measures was
a manipulation check, to ascertain that participants’ beliefs responded as
expected to the demand treatments.35 Naturally, these measures may be
subject to their own demand bias.
    A natural interpretation of the belief responses is that participants re-
port a high belief if their posterior E[h|hT , hL ] is positive, and a low belief
if negative, so the average response tells us the fraction of participants with
high beliefs.
    Results for incentivized MTurk respondents are presented in Tables
A.10, A.11, A.12, and A.13 (in the online appendix). They confirm that our
treatments moved average responses in the anticipated direction. For ex-
ample, in the dictator game, 65% of the strong positive demand treatment
group reported that the researchers “want to find that on average people
give a large share of the $1 to the other person” (alternative: “small”).
Under the strong negative demand treatment only 24% gave this response.
The corresponding figures are 54% and 23% for the weak demand treat-
ment.
    Overall, the levels of beliefs and magnitudes of shifts in beliefs are sim-
ilar for the strong and weak treatments.36 This result implies that both
treatments were successful in fixing the sign of participants’ posteriors, and
that therefore bounding holds for both treatments.
    A final use of the belief data is as an alternative (not pre-specified)
measure of attentiveness: we can classify as attentive those participants re-
porting the “correct” belief about the experimental objective in response to
our demand treatments. A.5 shows that sensitivity to our strong demand
treatments is high — around 1 standard deviation — among participants
considered attentive by this measure. Sensitivity for inattentive partici-

  35
      While in principle once could collect richer belief measures and incentivize re-
sponses, we opted for this simple approach because asking for fine-grained beliefs about
our own motivations seemed quite unnatural, and because there was no objective truth
against which to score. Techniques do exist for belief scoring without an objective truth,
e.g. Prelec (2004).
   36
      In some cases, the weak treatments shifted beliefs by more than the strong treat-
ments, though note that not all strong and weak treatments were conducted in the same
experiments.

                                           32
pants is close to zero and never significant.


5         Heterogeneity
Does sensitivity to demand treatments vary with design and participant
characteristics? In this section, we examine heterogeneous responses to our
strong and weak demand treatments by whether choices are incentivized
or hypothetical, gender, attentiveness, and participant pool (MTurk vs.
representative online panel). Whether or not this heterogeneity can be
interpreted as informative about differences in underlying latent demand
(e.g., whether greater sensitivity among one gender reflects a greater influ-
ence of latent demand for that gender) depends upon whether Monotone
Sensitivity holds for the subset of environments under consideration, i.e.
whether they belong to the same comparison class. We show in Appendix
C.4 that variation in incentives, attention, and the preference for pleas-
ing the experimenter, φ (which may differ by gender or participant pool),
plausibly form valid bases for comparison classes.


5.1         Incentivized vs. hypothetical choices
In the dictator game, investment game, and the convex time budgets that
we conducted on MTurk, we randomly assigned participants to make ei-
ther hypothetical or incentivized choices. In what follows, we test whether
making an incentivized rather than a hypothetical choice affects partici-
pants’ response to our strong demand treatments. To do so, we regress our
standardized outcome variables, pooled across games, on a demand treat-
ment indicator, P OSi , taking value one for people in the positive demand
condition and value zero for people in the negative demand condition; an
indicator Mi , taking value one for the incentive condition; and their inter-
action:37

                  ZYi = β0 + β1 P OSi + β2 Mi × P OSi + β3 Mi + εi          (14)




    37
         We standardize the outcome variable at the game-incentive level.

                                             33
Results are presented in Figure 4 and Panel B of Table 5. Interestingly,
participants making hypothetical or incentivized choices responded very
similarly to experimenter demand.38 This result is somewhat surprising,
since deviations from the natural action are presumably less costly in hy-
pothetical choice. Possibly this finding reflects that even our incentivized
choices involve relatively low stakes, and it is possible that we would see a
difference at higher stakes. Our results relate to previous work examining
the effects of incentives on behavior in the lab (Camerer et al., 1999).
    However, we note that in the effort experiment we do see lower sen-
sitivity when effort is incentivized than when unincentivized (note that
unincentivized effort is conceptually different from hypothetical choice).39

                                  [Insert Figure 6]


5.2     Gender and attention
We measure participant gender and attentiveness in all tasks. We define
a participant as attentive if they passed an attention screener at the be-
ginning of the task.40 To examine heterogeneous responses to our strong
demand treatments by these variables, we estimate the following equation:

                ZYi = β0 + β1 P OSi + β2 Hi + β3 Hi × P OSi + εi                      (15)

where Hi is the dimension of heterogeneity of interest.
    First, we test whether the normalized sensitivity to experimenter de-
mand differs for men and women using a dummy, M alei , taking value one
for males.41 As can be seen in Table 5 and Figure 7, which show data

   38
       As we discuss in section 2, we can meaningfully compare effect sizes across the re-
spondents making incentivized choices rather than hypothetical choices if the monotone
sensitivity assumption holds. In Appendix C.4, we show that this is the case if utility
is additively or multiplicatively separable in incentives.
    39
       In the model in section 4.5, effort is additively separable in incentives, satisfying
the condition for Monotone Sensitivity in Appendix C.4.
    40
       The screener presents participants with a paragraph of text that appears to direct
them to select their preferred online news sources from a list, but concealed in the text
is an instruction to ignore this possible interpretation and instead choose two specific
options. The assumption is that attentive respondents read the question and follow the
concealed instruction, while inattentive respondents do not.
    41
       We normalize the outcome variable at the game level.

                                            34
from incentivized MTurk respondents, we find that females respond more
strongly to the strong demand treatments than males.42,43

                                 [Insert Figure 7]

    As we show in Appendix C.4, if the difference in sensitivity is driven by
differences in willingness to please the experimenter, then it is indicative
of stronger latent demand effects for females. However, males and females
might also hold different beliefs about the experimental objective, in which
case Monotone Sensitivity would not hold.44
    We also examine whether respondents who did not pass an attention
screener at the beginning of our experiments respond differently to our
demand treatments from respondents who passed. Table 5 and Figure 8
show higher sensitivity among attentive MTurkers, but this effect is not
significant and noisily measured as only 10 percent of our MTurk sample
were inattentive.45

                        [Insert Figure 8 and Table 5]

However, in the representative online panel we have enough variation to ex-
amine heterogeneous effects by attention with sufficient statistical power.
As can be seen in Table A.26, we find evidence that participants who
passed the screener were significantly more sensitive to the demand treat-
ments than those who did not. The estimated difference between attentive
and inattentive respondents from the representative sample is quite similar
to that of MTurkers. If we pool the data from MTurk and the representa-
tive online panel, we find significantly different sensitivities to our demand
treatments by attention. As discussed in the online appendix C.4, variation
in sensitivity generated by inattention to experimenter demand satisfies the


  42
      Our finding is related to the large literature on gender differences in preferences
(Croson and Gneezy, 2009).
   43
      We find similar results for the representative online panel, as can be seen in Table
A.7.
   44
      Using the belief measure described in section 4.7, we do not find any evidence that
males and females in the no-demand condition hold different beliefs, nor do they update
their beliefs differently in response to the demand treatments.

   We also examine heterogeneous responses to the weak demand treat-
ments, though we have less power to detect differences because of the lower
overall sensitivity to these treatments. We find no significant differences in
sensitivity by incentives, attention, gender, education or experience. These
results are summarized in Tables 6 and A.9.


5.3     MTurk vs. representative online panel
Some experimental social scientists are concerned that MTurk workers are
experienced research participants and may behave differently to a more
representative participant pool. Moreover, MTurkers need to maintain a
high “approval” rating and may therefore be especially motivated to please
the researcher (Berinsky et al., 2014).48
    To address such concerns, and to test an additional dimension of het-
erogeneity, we replicated the MTurk dictator game and investment game
experiments with a representative online survey panel, whose participants
are less experienced experimental participants. We randomly assigned re-
spondents to either a positive weak demand treatment, a negative weak
demand treatment, a positive strong demand treatment, a negative strong
demand treatment or no demand treatment. All of our respondents’ choices
in this experiment were incentivized, and the stake size was the same as in
the MTurk experiment.
    In Table 5 and Figure 9, we test for differences in sensitivity in both
the pooled dictator and investment games, and for each game separately.
Representative panel participants responded more strongly in the risk game
and less strongly in the dictator game (significant at 10%); the pooled test

  46
      Consistent with our model, the belief data suggest that attentive respondents up-
date their beliefs about the experimental objective more strongly in response to our
demand treatments.
   47
      We also examine heterogeneous sensitivities to our strong demand treatments along
two additional dimensions that we had not pre-specified, education and prior experience
with experiments measured by the number of HITs previously completed on MTurk. We
find no evidence that more experienced or more educated respondents react more to our
demand treatments. These results are summarized in Table A.8.
   48
      Recruiters on MTurk have the option to reject unsatisfactory work, and recruiters
can screen out workers with high rejection rates. However, we believe it is well-known
that researchers rarely reject work; we never did.

                                          36
finds a small and non-significant difference in sensitivity. Thus, MTurkers
are not differentially susceptible to experimenter demand.49


6        Conclusion
We propose a technique for assessing the robustness of behavior to exper-
imenter demand. We deliberately induce demand in a structured way to
measure its influence on behavior and to construct bounds on demand-free
behavior and treatment effects. We formalize the intuition behind explicit
demand treatments with a simple model in which participants in an ex-
periment form beliefs about the experimental objective and receive utility
from conforming to it. Bounds are obtained by intentionally manipulating
those beliefs.
    We find that behavior in eleven canonical economic games is quite sen-
sitive to our strong demand manipulations that explicitly signal an experi-
mental objective, generating bounds of up to 1 standard deviation in width.
Much tighter bounds are obtained using weak demand treatments in which
we signal only an experimental hypothesis. We expect that the latter are
a more realistic measure of the magnitude of demand effects in the typical
experiments. Since our method is vulnerable to “defiers,” individuals who
respond in the opposite direction to our manipulations, we conduct an ex-
periment to measure it, and find very low defiance rates of approximately
5 percent.
    We also show how to analyze demand effects structurally, following the
approach of DellaVigna and Pope (2016). Our estimates suggest a utility
from pleasing the experimenter roughly equivalent to increasing the mon-
etary incentives offered by 20 percent. We leverage the structural model
to extract predictions for demand-free behavior, or “natural actions” in our
terminology.
    49
      Respondents from MTurk and the representative online panel might exhibit differ-
ent willingness to please the experimenter, but they could also have different beliefs or
attentiveness. In line with the above finding that respondents from the online panel are
less attentive, they also updated their beliefs about the experimental objective less than
MTurkers. However, focusing on the subsample of attentive respondents from MTurk
and the representative online panel, we find that respondents from the representative
online panel update their beliefs more. This suggests that some of the variation across
groups is driven by differences in beliefs, and hence monotone sensitivity may not hold.

                                           37
    Finally, we find that females respond more to our strong demand treat-
ments than males, but no significant heterogeneous sensitivity to demand
by whether choices are incentivized, education, prior experience or the par-
ticipant pool. We find some evidence that more attentive participants
conform more to our strong demand treatments.
    Future work might employ similar treatments to study how to decrease
demand in experiments. Researchers could examine what features of the
environment, the experimenter, and the mode of data collection (e.g. online
vs. laboratory) influence demand effects.

     Notes: This figure uses MTurk data from the effort experiment with the strong demand treatments (experiment 3). Panel A
     displays mean behavior in the different demand treatment arms, disaggregated by the incentive condition, and its the 95 percent
     confidence interval. Panel B displays the upper and lower bounds of treatment effect estimates and their confidence intervals. In
     these demand treatments we reveal the experimental objective to our respondents.

                              Notes: This figure uses data from all MTurk experiments with strong demand treatments using real stakes. This
                              figure displays the sensitivity of behavior to our strong demand treatments for males and females separately across 11
                              standard experimental paradigms. The behavior in these treatment arms is z-scored at the game-level using the mean
                              and standard deviation in the negative demand condition. In the figure we display the average sensitivity at the game
                              level along with the 95 percent confidence interval. In these demand treatments we reveal the experimental objective
                              to our respondents.

from experiment 4 with the representative online panel. This figure displays the response
to our strong demand treatments separately for the MTurk sample and the representative
online sample. In the figure we display the average sensitivity at the game level along with
the 95 percent confidence interval of the sensitivity. In these demand treatments we reveal
the experimental objective to our respondents.

     Notes: This table uses data from all MTurk experiments with strong demand treatments using real stakes. In Panel A we display the
     unconditional means and standard errors of those means in the positive, negative and no-demand treatment arms respectively. In Panel
     B we present the raw and z-scored sensitivity of behavior to our demand treatments. In Panel C we display the sensitivity of behavior in
     the positive and negative demand condition compared to the no-demand condition. In the demand treatments we reveal the experimental
     objective to our respondents. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. False-discovery reate adjusted p-values are in brackets. The
     p-value of an F-test which tests for differences in response to demand across all games is 0.000. * denotes significance at 10 pct., ** at 5
     pct., and *** at 1 pct. level.

 Notes: In this table we use data the real effort experiment using
strong demand treatments (experiment 3). In Panel A we present the
sensitivity of effort to monetary incentives, our demand treatments
and interactions of the demand treatments and monetary incentives.
In Panel B we display the conventional treatment effects, the lower

     Notes: This table uses data from all MTurk experiments with weak demand treatments using real stakes. In Panel A we display
     the unconditional means and standard errors of those means in the positive, negative and no-demand treatment arms respectively.
     In Panel B we present the raw and z-scored sensitivity of behavior to our demand treatments. In Panel C we display the sensitivity
     of behavior in the positive and negative demand condition compared to the no-demand condition. In the demand treatments we
     reveal the experimental hypothesis to our respondents. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. False-discovery rate adjusted
     p-values are in brackets. The p-value of an F-test which tests for differences in response to demand across all games is 0.063. *

Notes: This table uses data from the the real effort experiments on MTurk with strong
demand treatments. Coefficients s and φ are measured in cents. s measures the respondents
intrinsic motivation. φ measures the monetary equivalent of acting according to the exper-
imental objective for a worker who is certain about the experimenter’s objective. γ is the
estimate of the cost curvature (inverse of the elasticity of effort) and k is the scaling param-
eter. hL (0)pL (0) measures latent demand in the no-incentive condition. hL (> 0)pL (> 0)
measures latent demand in the 1-cent and 4-cent incentive conditions. hL (1)pL (1) measures
latent demand in the 1-cent incentive condition. hL (4)pL (4) measures latent demand in the
4-cent incentive condition. Robust standard errors in parentheses. * denotes significance at

     treatments by design characteristics, i.e. whether our respondents’ choices are incentivized or hypothetical. In Panel B we display heterogeneous
     treatment effects by respondent characteristics, namely by gender, attention and whether our respondents come from MTurk or a representative
     sample. The variable male takes value one if our respondent is male and zero otherwise, attention takes value one if our respondent correctly
     completed the screener and zero otherwise. The variable representative sample takes value if our respondent comes from a representative sample
     and zero when they come from the MTurk sample. In the strong demand treatments we reveal the experimental objective to our respondents.

Notes: This table summarizes the key design features of each of the experiments. In exper-
iment 5 for convex time budgets we only employ the weak demand treatments, while for all
other games we employ both strong and weak demand treatments. In experiment 2 we also
have an additional incentive treatment arm in which respondents receive four cents per 100
tasks in which we do not induce any additional demand.
