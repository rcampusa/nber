                                          ABSTRACT

Using the mass closure of development zones in 2004 as a natural experiment, we examine the
causal effect of development zones on firm level TFP in China. The difference-in-difference
estimator shows that on average, loss of development zone policies results in 6.5% loss of firms'
TFP. Locational heterogeneity is important. Within 500 kilometers from the three major seaports
in China, closure of zones reduced firm-level TFP by 9.62%, whereas closure of zones farther
away did not show significant effects. Market potential and local within-industry spillover effects
can explain much of this locational heterogeneity. We conclude that China's strategy of using
development zones as a place-based policy to encourage inland development may have led to
spatial misallocation.

                                  I. Introduction

  Balancing regional development while simultaneously taking advantage of a
market base is a problem faced by all countries with massive populations and vast
territories. However, a basic characteristic of the global economy is that economic
activities always agglomerate in a few areas, no matter the distances between
countries or within a specific country (World Bank, 2009). Faced with the
disparities of regional development, many countries turn to place-based policies to
promote the development of less developed regions. In China, the government also
launched similar place-based policies in different regions, which allows us to focus
on interregional differences that determine the effectiveness of place-based policies.
If place-based policies do not help improve productivity in lagging regions that are
geographically disadvantaged, moving resources to there may cause spatial
misallocation for the whole country.
  From the 1980s onward, more and more development zones (kaifaqu) with
similar preferential policies were implemented all over China, and their role
changed from a development and reform experiment to promoting regional
economic growth. This is typically the objective of these place-based polices. As
Wang (2013) demonstrates, development zones exert positive effects on the
development of their host cities, but these positive effects decline with the passage
of time. In the future, locations targeted by new place-based policies may become
substitutes for former targets (Busso et al., 2013), and this may help to explain
Wang's (2013) findings on the fading effects of development zone policies.
  In this study, we focus on the role of geography in making place-based policies
effective. As argued by Glaeser and Gottleib (2008), the most effective method of
implementing placed-based policies is to encourage the flow of resources into
locations with high productivity and high elasticity of productivity with respect to
agglomeration. However, in China, the location of development zones is strongly
influenced by the central government, which gives high priority to regional balance.




                                           3
Since 1990, more and more newly designated development zones have been located
in inland China. The reason why the Chinese government was willing to build
development zones in economically lagging areas is straightforward: they hoped to
promote the economic development of inland areas by replicating the policies used
in coastal areas, and thus achieve national balance in regional development.
However, there are major concerns about whether governments are able to pick the
best areas in which to implement place-based policies (Glaeser and Gottleib, 2008).
Competition between local governments can improve the efficiency of these
policies at the national level (Moretti, 2011), but such competition-based
mechanisms may take a long time to produce positive results, especially in a
country like China where serious market distortions exist.
  In this study, we use the massive administrative closure of development zones
between 2004 and 2006 as a natural experiment to identify the causal effects of
development zone policies on manufacturing firms' total factor productivities
(TFP). In that movement, about 70% of the development zones (mostly in the
coastal area) were closed, and development zones were more used to encourage
inland growth. Our empirical analysis shows that the average effect of development
zone closures on treated firms' TFP is negative. Moreover, we find that
geographic heterogeneity does exist: the magnitude of zone closures' effects is
smaller if the city is located farther away from three major seaports: Shanghai,
Hong Kong, and Tianjin. Significantly, when the distance from these cities is
large enough, the negative effects of development zone closures disappear. Our
analysis shows that cities closer to the sea enjoy greater market potential, which
helps firms exposed to preferential policies improve TFP through scale
economies. We also provide evidence that firms enjoy local spillover effects
from other firms in the same industry and city. Thus, when coastal areas lose
output after development zone closure, the effect on TFP is magnified because
of local spillover effects. In a nutshell, place-based policies lead to spatial
misallocation, since preferential policies do not work as well in geographically



                                         4
disadvantaged areas as they do in the coastal region. This also explains why
more recently established development zones, opened in inland areas, have not
been as successful as have those opened previously.
  There are several econometric challenges to reliably estimating the effects
of place-based policies (Neumark and Simpson, 2015). Our contributions in this
study are       three-fold. First,    we   use    a   natural     experiment   based   on
development zone closures in China to obtain a difference-in-difference (DD)
estimate of the effects of development zones on firm-level TFP. This addresses
the possible endogeneity of development zone policies, which poses a significant
challenge. The location of development zones and whether a firm is in a zone
may be correlated to either regional or firm-level characteristics. Our DD
estimation using the natural experiment has identified within-city and within-
industry effects of development zones that is more convincing than other existing
estimations.
  Second, most of the existing studies have examined the efficiency of
development zone policies using city-level data1 , but have neglected to explore
important forms of heterogeneity ­ particularly how the policies could be successful
from a regional perspective (e.g., Wang, 2013; Alder et al., 2013). Other empirical
studies of place-based policies have not explored why different place-based policies
may have positive effects (Busso et al., 2013; Bernini and Pellegrini, 2011; Ham et
al., 2011; Criscuolo et al., 2012; Freedman, 2013; Reynolds and Rohlin, 2014;
Givord et al., 2013; Mayer, Mayneris and Loriane, 2017) or why these effects may
have been insignificant (Crozet et al., 2004; Bronzini and de Balsio, 2006; Elvery,
2009; Neumark and Kolko, 2010; Hanson, 2009; Hanson and Rohlin, 2013). There
are, however, several exceptions. Besides Wang (2013) who found the sequential


  1
      An exceptional firm-level study is conducted by Schminke and Van Biesebroeck (2013),

who studied the effects of development zones on firms' exports.




                                              5
heterogeneities of zones' effect in China, Kolko and Neumark (2010) found that
enterprise zones with different policies may exhibit different effects. However, as
argued by Neumark and Simpson (2015), one of the most important questions is
where place-based policies may or may not work; however, existing literature lacks
evidence on the specific conditions that make place-based policies successful.
Although Briant et al. (2015) found that zones that are more isolated show less
positive impact, they only focused on the role of the relative position of a specific
zone in an urban area. In order to bridge this gap, our study explores how the
efficiency-improving effects of development zones depend on their economic
geography in a whole country. Our finding is quite cynical and disappointing. In
particular, the lagging areas that the place-based policies aim to help may lack
precisely what is needed for the policies to be successful: market access and local
spillover effects.
  Third, we add a regional perspective to the literature on the misallocation
literature. As Hsieh and Klenow (2009) documented, both the Chinese and Indian
economies have suffered significantly from misallocation of economic resources.
Recent studies have attempted to explore the institutional reasons of misallocation.
For instance, Brandt et al. (2013) found that ownership structure is an important
factor because inefficient state-owned firms are favored in the financial market,
whereas the more efficient private sector faces discrimination. Other studies focus
on frictions from the regional level, such as overall heterogeneity in city level
characteristics (Desmet and Rossi-Hansberg, 2013; Behrens et al., 2017), or
particular individual frictions such as city level constraints on housing supply
(Hsieh and Moretti, 2019) and heterogeneity in state tax rates (Fajgelbaum et al.,
2019), as sources of spatial misallocation. We assume that discretional place-based
policies may contribute an important source to spatial misallocation. Lu and Xiang
(2016) observed that after 2003, inland-favoring policies and the deterioration of
allocative efficiency occurred simultaneously. In this study, we provide a spatial




                                          6
perspective on the misallocation of economic resources. Our empirical findings
show that development zones are more efficient in coastal China. However,
beginning in 2003, development zones were closed in eastern China, and the
opening of new development zones became biased in favor of inland areas, which
deteriorated the interregional allocation efficiency of economic resources. This
explains why China's allocative efficiency has worsened since 2003 as it
corresponds to when China started to use development zone policies to favor the
industrial development of inland China (Lu and Xiang, 2016).
  The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. In part 2 we provide the
historical background of development zone policies, paying special attention to the
2004-2006 closing of development zones in China. Part 3 introduces our data and
identification strategies, and in part 4 we measure the average effect of development
zone closures on firms' TFP. Part 5 describes the analysis of why the effectiveness
of development zones differs across regions. Part 6 discusses some concerns and
implications of our findings. Finally, we conclude the study by discussing the
implications of place-based policies in part 7.

                            II. Historical Background

                      A. Introduction of Development Zones

  China's development zones are successors of special economic zones that were
first implemented in the 1980s as part of the economic reform and open-door
strategy. In 1980, China opened Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen, and
designated these four cities with the status of special economic zones. In 1984,
China opened 14 other coastal port cities, which were then given the right to set up
economic and technological development zones. In 1985, China opened the
Yangtze River Delta, the Min-Zhang-Quan Delta, and Zhuhai to development. In
1988, the entire Hainan province became a special economic zone. In 1990, the
State Council approved the opening of Shanghai and started the development of the



                                           7
Pudong New District. Prior to 1990, national-level development zones were only
set up in coastal areas. Since 1991, however, the establishment of national-level
zones has gradually shifted to the central and western regions (Wang, 2013), which
coincides with development zone policies assuming the task of balancing regional
economic development.
  It is worth noting that, in addition to national-level development zones, there are
many provincial-level development zones. Indeed, before 2003 development zones
could be approved by lower-level governments. The development zones approved
by provincial and below-level governments were often created to boost the local
economy, but, by law, such development zones were supposed to conform to the
land use planning proposed by the central government. In China Development
Zones Audit Announcement Directory (2006 edition), national ministries admit the
legitimacy of only three categories of provincial-level zones: provincial economic
development zones; provincial high-tech industrial parks; and provincial special
industrial parks.
  Development zones attract firms through preferential policies, institutional
autonomy, better infrastructures, and government services (Zeng, 2011). The most
important preferential policies consist of three categories: tax concessions, cheap
land, and banking convenience. Government services provided by zones include
(among others): accounting services, legal services, business planning, marketing,
import-export assistance, skills training, and management consulting (Zeng, 2011).
Some of these conveniences enjoyed by former development zone firms would not
be affected by the closure of zones. For example, infrastructure would not be
affected if they do not change their locations. However, other conveniences, such
as tax concessions, banking convenience, and government services, would be
reduced with the closure of zones.

                B. "Zone Fever" and the Closure of Zones in 2004

  Ever since the early stages of the open-door strategy, intense competition has
existed between local governments in attracting FDI through the building of
development zones, leading to so-called "zone fever." In order to attract more
investments, local governments competed to construct development zones. This
caused a rapid expansion of built-up areas throughout China, and caused all kinds
of conflict in the process of land expropriation.
  In July 2003, the Ministry of Land and Resources, along with several other
relevant departments of the State Council, announced the clearing of development
zones. On July 18, the General Office of the State Council released an emergency
notice that suspended the approval of all types of development zones. At the end of
December, a document was issued detailing the rules of how to clear development
zones approved by different levels of government. According to this document, no
matter by which level of government a development zone had been approved, it
could be affected in this round of clearing. The document also stated that zones
approved by the State Council would not be closed, but could be impaired in terms
of area viability. The zones approved by provincial governments could be closed
or reduced in area size. The most affected zones were those approved by branches
of the State Council, branches of provincial or lower-level governments. Most
development zones were closed, while some were promoted to provincial-level
zones after being merged with nearby zones. From 2003 to 2006, the number of
zones over the entire country was reduced from 6,866 to 1,568, or by 77.2%, while
planned areas of all zones were compressed from 38.6 thousand square kilometers
to 9,949 square kilometers, or by 74.0%. The most significant number of closures
occurred between the end of 2003 and June 2004, a half year period during which
the number of development zones was reduced by 4,813 and planned areas were
compressed by 24.6 thousand square kilometers. This accounted for about 70% and
64.5%, respectively, of the total number and area of all development zones, and




                                           9
represented 90.8% and 85.9%, respectively, of the entire reduced number and area
of zones between 2003 and 2006.2
  The mass closure of zones between 2004 and 2006 provides us with an
opportunity to identify the precise role of development zones in affecting firm
performance. Whether or not a firm is able to enter a development zone is subject
to several selective practices; however, the closure of a development zone is largely
exogenous to the firms located therein. Significantly, in the next section of this
study we show that affected firms in closed zones and the remaining development
zone firms do not differ significantly in TFP, and that they followed parallel trends
in TFP before the closure movement. During the same period of time in which
development zones began to be closed (2004-2006), development zone policies
became biased toward inland areas in an effort to balance regional development.3
Lu and Xiang (2016) documented that in regions more than 500 km away from
major seaports, the share of development zone firms in the national total increased
significantly in 2004. The land supply, controlled by the central government
through the construction land quota system (under which a centrally-distributed
land quota is required for converting agricultural land to non-agricultural uses) also
became biased toward inland development (Lu and Xiang, 2016; Liang, Lu, and
Zhang, 2016; Han and Lu, 2017).

                                III. Data and Identification

                  A. Data Sources and Construction of Key Variables

  The main data sets used in this study were extracted from China's Annual Survey
of industrial firms from 2000 to 2007. The database contains all state-owned and

above-scale (sales more than 5 million Yuan) non-state-owned industrial firms. The
firms in the data set account for about 90% of all industrial output. The information
contained in the database includes basic information such as the firm code, the
number of employees, ownership, location, and the main financial indicators
included in the balance sheet of the firm. In this study, we attempted to identify
how development zones affect firms' TFP. We focused on TFP because it is the
key to sustainable growth and competitiveness in the market. Therefore, the two
basic tasks of our study were: (1) identification of development zone firms and (2)
estimation of firm-level TFP.
  Identifying Development Zone Firms--The development zones that were closed
in 2004 cannot be traced to any official records or documentation. Fortunately, in
our database, the firms' address information included keywords which allowed us
to distinguish between different development zones. In the firm-level database, the
detailed location information of a specific firm contains six variables: (1) town
(xiang, zhen), (2) village or street and doorplate number (cun, jie, menpaihao), (3)
sub-district office (jiedaobanshichu), (4) neighborhood committee (juweihui), (5)
address (dizhi), and (6) street (jiequ). We identified whether a firm was located in
a development zone by searching through the six variables mentioned above for 17
keywords that indicated the existence of any kind of development zone. Such terms
included yuanqu, a Chinese word which means "zones" and may be in the addresses
of any kinds of Chinese development zones; a group of words including kaifa,
jingkai and jingji, which mean "development" or "economic development" and
indicate that the firms may be located in national-level Economic and
Technological Development Zones or provincial and lower-levels of development
or economic development zones; a group of words including gaoxin, kejiyuan,
chuangyeyuan, touziqu, huojuyuan and huojuqu, which are often used to describe
zones where high/new-technology or newly-invested firms are supposed to located;
another group of words including gongyeyuan, chanyeyuan, gongyequ and




                                          11
gongyexiaoqu, which are used to name industrial zones; and the final group of
words including baoshui, bianjing and chukoujiagong, which mean "bonded
zones", "border (economic cooperation zone)" and "export processing zones"
respectively.
  To ensure that the measurement error was minimized, we compared our results
with the official documents. Using our definition of development zone firms, for
those firms that existed in both 2003 and 2004, the number of development zone
firms in 2003 was 16,633, with only 6,148 of those firms remaining in 2004. The
other 63% of development zone firms changed to non-development zone firms. The
percentage of the firms that lost development zone policies was very close to the
officially declared percentage of closed development zones during 2003 and 2004
(which is about 70% and 64.5%, respectively, in terms of total number and area of
the development zones). Considering that the closed development zones were
relatively smaller, our definition of development zones is plausible.
  Next, we calculated the regional distribution of the development zone firms. As
Figure 1 shows, the share of development zone firms in the eastern provinces fell
sharply in 2004. We also calculated the share of development zone firms within
500 km of a major seaport, and again saw a sharp decline in development zone
firms in 2004. This finding is consistent with the officially declared policy that
development zones would be used as policies that favor inland provinces.

   Estimating         Firm-Level          TFP--Regarding                firm     productivity,          a    popular
measurement is TFP, which is estimated by using the OP method (Olley and Pakes,
1996). This method considers the influence of TFP on firm investment decisions,
and the influence of firms' investment decisions and TFP on their survival
probability. Thus, this method resolves the two-way causality and sample selection
problems that parametric and non-parametric methods are faced with.
   Relevant to our estimation of TFP, two specific points need to be clarified. First,
the output we employed in the estimation of TFP is value-added and it is calculated
by using the input-output method. Our estimation process builds upon the TFP
estimation used by Brandt et al. (2012). For instance, we used officially-reported
price deflators, while Brandt et al. (2012) constructed deflators by using the
nominal and real output reported by the firms. For the price deflators of inputs, we
used input-output tables from 1997, 2002, and 2007, while Brandt et al. (2012) only
used a table representing one year, and thus ignored any changes that occurred over




                                                            13
time. We also carefully constructed firm-level capital stock.4 Second, we estimated
the output elasticity of capital, labor, and intermediate inputs for each 2-digit
industry separately, thus allowing for variation of output elasticity of inputs among
industries. Importantly, this method did not affect our empirical results because all
of the regressions provided below control for industry-fixed effects.

                              B. Identification Strategies

  Our strategy to identify the causal effects of development zones on firms' TFP's
was to use the mass closure of development zones during 2004-2006 as an
exogenous shock to firms that had been in development zones. By studying the
mass closure of development zones in this time period, we identified the change in
TFP when a firm's status changed from a development zone firm to a non-
development-zone firm, compared to the change in TFP of development zone firms
not affected by the shock. This provided a DD (difference-in-difference) estimation
for the average treatment effect on treated firms (ATT) affected by development
zone closures. Specifically, our regression model is:

(1) !"# = % + '()*+("  +-(*)2003 + 12"# + 34(! + 45678 + 9++" + :);< 
!*+) + ="# >>>


  The subscripts i and t represent firms and years, respectively. In our main results,
the dependent variable, !"# , refers to firms' TFP. ()*+(" is a dummy variable
indicating whether at the end of 2003 a firm was in a zone that was soon to be
closed. +-(*)2003 is a time dummy variable that equals 1 when observations
occurred between 2004 and 2007. 2"# refers to a vector of firm-level and city-level
control variables. We also included city, industry, year, and firm-fixed effects

     We do not report the lengthy procedure here in the interest of brevity. An appendix is
available upon request.




                                             14
(denoted as>34(!, 45678, 9, and +" , respectively). An interaction term of year and
province-fixed effects is controlled for unobserved provincial specific trends.
Essentially, we used a fixed effect model for regression in order to control for firm-
level fixed effects.
    The definition of treated firms can be divided into three categories. First, as
mentioned above, we used keywords to identify whether a firm was a development
zone firm in a specific year. Then we searched our sample for firms that existed in
both 2003 and 2004. We defined a firm to be treated if it was a development zone
firm in 2003 but not in 2004 (given that its location did not change between 2003
and 2004). To exclude the effect of entering and exiting zones for treated firms, we
only included observations of firms that were continuously in a development zone
up until 2003, and then continuously no longer in a development zone after 2004.
For example, if a treated firm entered a development zone in 2003 and then re-
entered a development zone in 2005, then only 2003 and 2004 observations for this
firm were included in the regressions.5
    Besides the DD specification, we controlled the variables that were likely to be
correlated with both a development zone's likelihood of closure and a firms' TFP.
First, we controlled for a firms' age (age), which was obtained by using the firms'
actual operation years divided by 100. Second, we controlled for the ownership of
firms by using a group of dummy variables (SOE, HMT, and FDI) that represent
firms' largest shareholders (government, investors from Hong Kong, Macao, and
Taiwan, and investors from foreign countries, respectively). The reference group is
local non-SOEs.



5
  We find in our data that nearly half (7248 in 14793) of the firms that left the development
zones reentered zones in 2006. The reason may be that after the 3-year zones clearing process,
local governments, with strong economic growth incentives, relaxed the expansion of
development zones. This assumption coincides with the fact that in 2006, the number of
development zone firms in our database is more than doubled as in 2003, while both in 2004
and 2005, the number of zone firms is smaller than in 2003.




                                              15
  An important issue when using a DD specification is the construction of control
groups, for which we used firms that did not change their status before or after 2003.
Therefore, we had three alternative control groups. The first control group consisted
of firms that were development zone firms in both 2003 and 2004; the second
control group consisted of firms that were non-development-zone firms before and
after 2003; the third control group is a combination of the above two groups.
However, it is important to note that firms that never entered zones may be
systematically different from those that entered development zones. Therefore, for
common support consideration, the first control group is more ideal, although we
checked the robustness of our results using alternative reference groups. Another
issue concerning common support consideration is that in our sample, some cities
do not have treated firms or control-group firms, meaning that there are no
counterparts for comparison within the same city. These observations are excluded
as a robustness check. "
  Neumark and Simpson (2015) summarized the specific econometric challenges
of reliably estimating the effects of place-based policies. The first challenge is
measuring local areas where policies have been implemented and the subsequent
economic outcomes of implementing those policies. The second challenge is the
construction of control groups. The third challenge is identifying the effects of
specific policies when areas are subject to multiple simultaneous interventions. The
fourth challenge is accounting for displacement effects: place-based policies may
attract factor in-flow from or create positive spillover to non-targeted entities or
areas, which will increase the difficulty of constructing an unaffected control group.
The last challenge is studying the effects of discretionary policies targeting specific
firms. Using the keywords-searching method mentioned above, we were able to
overcome the first measurement issues. Using the mass closure of development
zones in 2004 as a natural experiment, we can alleviate the concerns outlined in the
second and third challenges. For the displacement concern, we find that in our




                                           16
sample the trend of TFP of the control group does not change before and after 2004,
which means that the control group firms are hardly affected by the closure of zones.
Moreover, as mentioned in section 2.1, the fact that former development zone firms
will no longer enjoy tax concessions, banking conveniences, and government
services, enabled us to separate those factors from conveniences that will not
change after the closure of zones (such as better infrastructure).

             IV. Treatment Effects of Development Zone Closures

           A. Treatment Effects of Development Zone Closures on TFP

  Table 1 reports the regression results of the DD estimation. In column 1, we did
not control for industry and city-fixed effects, or provincial time trends. All of these
factors were controlled in the subsequent four columns of Table 1. In column 3, we
controlled for the age of firms and a group of ownership type dummy variables. All
three estimations show that the closure of development zones had a negative effect
on firms' TFP.
  In the course of this study, we became worried that the closure of development
zones might be because of systematic differences that exist between the treatment
and control groups. Therefore in column 4, we used a matching-DD model to check
whether our results were reliable. The matching procedure consisted of two steps.
First, we ran a probit model to predict the probability of each firm remaining in a
development zone after 2004 (based on the firms' characteristics in 2003). Among
these characteristics were: TFP, main sales revenue, profit, accumulated profit
(beginning with the first year a firm became a development zone firm), employment,
VAT payable, age, number of years in a development zone (until 2003), distance
to the nearest major seaports (Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Tianjin), ownership type
dummy variables, 2-digit industry dummy variables, and city dummy variables.
Second, we did 1-1 matching using the nearest neighbor method in the treatment
group for each of the control group firms (without replacement). Column 4 shows



                                           17
the treatment effect is slightly smaller using the 1-1 matched sample. In column 5,
we estimated the model using the reduced sample that excludes observations in
cities where there were no treatment or control firms.
   The coefficients on treat×after2003 are significantly negative in all 5 columns
with similar coefficients. That is to say, compared with firms that were not directly
affected by the 2004-2006 development zone closures, treated firms suffered from
less growth (or larger declines) of TFP. Conversely, the negative effects caused by
zone closures means that firms in development zones had experienced positive
effects.
   In Table 1 and the remaining FE estimation results, the coefficients of the control
variables are not informative because most of the control variables (except for the
age of the firms) do not exhibit large enough temporal variation. For example, only
a small fraction of firms changed their ownership types. Therefore, we will not
report or discuss the coefficients of the control variables.

 B. Policy Change and Firm Size Change along with Development Zone Closures

   Because TFP changes are the outcome of firms' input-output changes resulting
from zone closures, we wanted to know whether the closure of zones really meant



                                                            18
that there would be concrete policy changes and how firms' input-output decisions
changed along with possible policy changes. Development zones in China may
offer a bundle of preferential policies for the firms located inside. Among these
policies, subsidies and favorable loans may not be enjoyed as much since firms are
no longer regarded as development zone firms. In our data, we observed subsidies
and interest expenditures received by firms, which enabled us to examine whether
zone closures really changed the preferential policies enjoyed by development zone
firms. The results are exhibited in Table 2.

   In Table 2 we constructed three variables in order to capture preferential policy
changes. The first is a dummy variable, subsidized, indicating whether a firm was
subsidized in a specific year; the second is the logarithm of the value of subsidies
received by firms; the third is also a dummy variable, loan dummy, indicating
whether a firm borrowed from banks (which equals 1 if a firm's interest expenditure
was above zero in a specific year). Unfortunately, we do not know the amount of
the loans. The results in Table 2 show that although the possibility of being
subsidized and borrowing from banks is not significantly reduced, the average
amount of subsidies received by development zone firms declined by about 9.5%
after the zones were closed. In industrial policy literature, the effects of subsidies




                                                             19
are mixed, and whether subsidies improve target firms' performances depends on
numerous other conditions (see" Harrison and RodrÌguez-Clare, 2009). Here, we
argue that if the subsidies can relax firms' financial constraints, their TFP can be
improved through a scale economy. Consequently, the closure of zones may result
in a smaller scale and lower efficiency in affected firms.
   Subsidies are one of the resources that can affect firms in development zones;
however, subsidies are limited compared to the production scale of firms. The
sample mean of subsidies is 133 thousand yuan, while that of value-added is more
than 28,000 thousand yuan. It is unfortunate that other resources, such as favored
loans and services provided by management committees, cannot be observed in our
data; however, we can directly examine whether development zone closures have
a significant effect on firms' production scales. In Table 3, we used value-added
as the measure of production scale. We also used gross output values as a reliability
check.

    Column 1 and column 2 show that zone closures significantly reduced firms'
value-added by about 7.7% and reduced firms' gross output value by 4.8%.
Columns 3 and 4 show that from the input side, the downsizing of the output scale
is mainly associated with the decrease of labor employed. Capital stock was also
reduced, but insignificantly. Overall, after the closure of development zones, the
treated firms suffered more value-added loss than input reduction, thus lower TFP
growth.



                         C. Short-Term Effects of Development Zone Closures

   An empirical fallacy in using a long period sample for DD estimation is that the
longer the period of time after receiving treatment, the more likely that the treated
and controlled groups trend differently. Therefore, it is useful to test the short-term
effects of zones closures. The results are listed in Table 4.

   In Table 4, two points are noteworthy when comparing the short-term and long-
term effects of zone closures. First, the direction and significance of estimated
treatment effects on TFP, value-added, and factor inputs change little. Second, the
estimated treatment effects are smaller in absolute value in Table 4 than in Tables
1 and 3, but the differences are very small.

                                             D. Parallel Trend Test

   Here we test whether parallel trends hold if controlling for the full set of control
variables. In Table 5, we estimated the differences of TFP, value-added, and total
output between treatment groups and control groups in each year. The reference
year is 2003 (the year before mass zone closures). In terms of TFP, value-added,
and total output, the gaps between treatment groups and control groups in 2000,
2001, and 2002 did not significantly differ from those in 2003. Thus the pre-
treatment parallel trend assumption holds.

       V. Geographic Heterogeneity, Market Access, and the Effects of
                                Development Zones

  TFP is essentially a measurement of input-output efficiency. If scale economies
exist, firms' outputs may grow more rapidly than their inputs when they benefit
from development zone policies. Since China's manufacturing sector is highly
export-dependent, the distance to major seaports largely determines a city's
international transportation costs. Coastal regions that have more cities and higher
population densities also enjoy greater international and domestic market access
compared to inland areas. Locational differences result in a huge gap between
coastal and inland China in terms of economic agglomeration. From the central
planners' perspective, interregional gaps in economic agglomeration justify their
efforts to promote the development of inland areas using policies that have been
successful in coastal areas. However, as argued by Glaeser and Gottleib (2008), the
location of where these policies are implemented is highly significant in terms of
the overall success of place-based policies. In China, because of existing
differences in geographical conditions and economic agglomeration, the success
seen in coastal areas may not necessarily be duplicable in inland areas. This section
examines the geographic heterogeneity of the effects of development zones, and
then explores the mechanisms.

                           A. Geographic Heterogeneity

  We examine the heterogeneous effects of development zones on firms' efficiency
by three different specifications: (1) We split the full sample of firms into two parts
according to whether a firm is located in a city within or beyond 500 kilometers
from the nearest major seaport. The distance to the seaports also represents the
regional heterogeneity in development zone policies before and after 2003, as
shown in Figure 1. (2) In order to confirm the reliability of our analysis on
geographic heterogeneity, we split our sample into coastal and inland provinces and



                                           23
repeat the regressions. (3) We interact the the distance to the nearest major seaport
with the treatment dummy variable and the post-2003 dummy variable.
   Before presenting the regression results, we show the trend of TFP difference
between the treatment groups and control groups of the above two subsamples (see
Figures 2 and 3). In Figure 2, from the subsample of firms located within 500 km
from the three major seaports, it is evident that the pre-treatment common trends of
TFP hold ideally for the treatment and control groups. However, in Figure 3, from
the subsample of firms located beyond 500 km from the three major seaports, it is
evident that the TFP trends of the treatment and control groups show significant
between-group differences, both before and after 2003. These two figures jointly
show that development zone policies only improve TFP in the "within 500 km"
areas.

   In Table 6, we formally analyzed how development zones' effects on firm-level
TFP vary with geography. In columns 1 and 2, we ran subsample regressions for
firms in cities within and beyond 500 km from the nearest three major seaports.
Columns 3 and 4 repeat the analysis, but divide the samples into eastern and inland
groups. The results show that only the coastal areas experienced TFP loss when
zones were closed. In column 5, we interacted the distance from the city to the
nearest major seaports (distport) with the treatment effect (treat) variable, and
after2003 dummy. The results show that the negative effects of zone closures
become smaller in magnitude as the distance from major seaports increases.

   Based on the results of column 5, we drew Figure 4 to demonstrate the marginal
effect of zone closures and the 95% confidence intervals. The coefficient of the
treatment effect changes from negative to positive at about 500 km from the major
seaports. This justifies our division of subsamples using the cutoff point of 500 km.
In column 6, we created a dummy variable, d500, in order to indicate whether or
not a city is within 500 km from the nearest major seaports. Then we interacted this
variable with the treatment effect variable and the after2003 dummy. The
coefficient of treat×after2003×d500 is highly significant, showing that the
difference of treatment effects within and beyond 500 km from the major seaports
is significant.6

     We also examined geographic heterogeneity using only the 2003 and 2004 panels. The results still indicated that only
regions close to the major seaports experienced negative effects with the closure of development zones.

 B. What Causes the Geographic Heterogeneity of Development Zones' Effects?

  After identifying the geographically heterogeneous effects of development zones
on firms' TFP, the remaining question to be answered is: Why do similar policy
measures have different impacts across regions? When reviewing the literature of
place-based policies, one of the most attractive features of such policies is the
exploitation of agglomeration externalities (Neumark and Simpson, 2014). In
China, while cities in different locations do share a common institutional
background, the market conditions and economic opportunities vary significantly.
As China's coastline is relatively short compared to the overall size of its territory,
and only the eastern portion of the country faces the sea, the locational advantages
from participating in the global economy are highly correlated with the distance of
cities and regions to the major seaports. Moreover, coastal regions also have larger
populations which constitute a greater domestic market. As such, we formally test




                                                  27
whether the geographic heterogeneity of development zones directly contributes to
underlying market condition differences. To do so, we constructed a city-level
market potential index as a measure to capture market opportunities of firms in
different cities. The market potential index is constructed as follows:

                                                  B    B
                               ?:@ = FG@ D C + D E
                                                  EC   EE




where

  In constructing market potential, ?:@ , P denotes city-level GDPs that are
collected from the Chinese City Statistical Yearbook. 6@F denotes the distance
between city pairs (measured by the distance, in kilometers, between the city halls
of each city). +)*+@ denotes the area of a city (measured by its jurisdiction area in
squared kilometers).
  Coastal China is characterized by greater market potential obviously, but it is
also a region characterized by greater market competition and a larger share of
private sector firms. These effects must be controlled in order to determine whether
market potential plays an independent role in geographic heterogeneity. The
intensity of city-industry-level competition faced by firms is captured by the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI).

                                             28
the percentage of the number of non-SOEs in the total number of firms at the city-
level. Because we want to capture the cross-sectional variances of cities in different
locations, all three variables above were constructed using data from 2003. All three
variables are divided by sample median, and then placed in logarithmic form.
   Table 7 illustrates the correlation matrix between the distances to major seaports
and the three variables that capture the differences between cities. As expected, the
three variables are correlated with the distance to major seaports. The greater the
distance from major seaports, the lower the market potential, along with decreases
in the share of non-state-owned sectors and levels of competition.

     In order to empirically test whether the treatment effect of zone closures varies
with the three geography-related variables, we interact each of the three variables
(mp, hhi, and nonSOEr) with the ()*+(" and +-(*)2003 dummies. Table 8 shows
that market potential does matter. In column 1, the coefficient of the interaction
term treat_after2003_mp is significantly negative. This means that the market
potential of a city helps a development zone improve its firms' TFP. In Figure 5,
the simulation based on regression results from column 1 also shows that the effect
of zone closures on firm-level TFP changes with market potential. Development
zones (or their closures) only affect firms' TFP in cities with high market potential.
In column 2, we added the interaction terms with hhi and nonSOEr. Both results

unchanged.

  Although the results in the first two columns of Table 8 show that market
potential itself does affect the effects of development zones on firm-level TFP,
whether existing market potential differences among regions helps to explain the
locational heterogeneity of zones remains a problem. In columns 3 and 4, we
control for the heterogeneous effect of zone closures with respect to both distance
and market potential simultaneously. Compared with column 5 of Table 6, the
coefficient of" treat×after2003×distport is smaller in absolute value and not
significant after controlling for market potential. Moreover, the results change little
whether or not we controlled for HHI and non-SOE rates. These two results confirm
that market potential constitutes a major factor that helps to explain how location
matters in terms of zones' effects on firms' TFP.

 C. Geographic Heterogeneity of Development Zone Closures on Firms' Scales

  Market potential helps firms increase productivity through scale economies,
which, in turn, constitute a possible mechanism for development zones' closure to
affect firms' TFP. If this is true, then the geographic heterogeneity of zones' effects
on firm size will be similar to that on firms' TFP, meaning that development zone
closures will experience downsized firms in coastal areas but not in inland areas.
To be consistent with section 4, we use value-added and factor inputs as dependent
variables to determine whether geographic heterogeneity exists. The results are
reported in Table 9.
  In Table 9, it is evident that the geographic heterogeneity of the effects of zones
on firms' scales does exist. In locations that are closer to the three major seaports,
the negative effects of zone closures on both firms' value-added and employment
are greater in magnitude, regardless of whether we use continuous or dummy
variables to measure the distance to major seaports. However, the same pattern does
not apply to the results when dependent variables are the real value of firms' fixed
assets. In agreement with the results displayed in column 4 of Table 3, the




                                           31
underlying reason for this result may be that it is harder for firms to adjust their
fixed assets than labor. Moreover, the geographic heterogeneity of the effect of
zones on firms' scales is similar to that on firms' TFP. In columns 1 and 3, the
turning points of the marginal treatment effect on value-added and employment
(with respect to distance to major seaports) are both around 600 km, which is very
close to the turning point of TFP in Figure 4. The results in columns 4 and 5, which
measure the distance to seaports using dummy variables, also show patterns similar
to those in Table 6, where we tested the geographic heterogeneity of zone closures'
effects on firms' TFP.

    If the coastal area lost in production significantly after zones' closure, while
firms enjoy within-city and within-industry spillover effects, the coastal area's loss
in TFP can be further explained.

                                  VI. Discussion

A.! Whether taking away a development zone is the same thing as the opposite of
                                    putting one in

  There may be concern that a successful development zone may affect long term
performance of firms, and after the removal of preferential policies, the positive
effect will remain instead of fading away. If this were the case, then the negative
effect of the closure of zones may indicate the overall failure of China's
development zone policy, not the opposite.
 To address this concern, we need to clarify the channels of how DZs affect firm
level TFP. We assume the main channels through which we find the negative
effects of zone closures are cost reductions and scale economies. Zones may reduce
firms' costs through subsidies/tax holidays, financial support, cheap land, better
government service, and better infrastructure, the last of which is ruled out in the
settings of this paper because infrastructure improvement is already done when
development zones were put in and will not go away. Except for infrastructure
improvement, other channels of cost reduction are bound with DZ-firm identity,
and will be taken away when development zones are closed. Although the physical
investments are not reduced by former DZ-firms after the closure of zones (as
showed in Table 4 and Table 9), probably because of high adjustment costs, former
DZ-firms may reduce their scale of output and adjust their employment accordingly
because of raised costs caused by closure of zones, reducing TFP through the scale
economy mechanism.
  Among the possible channels of cost reduction of DZs, we found evidence of a
negative effect of DZ closure on the amount of subsidy received by former DZ-
firms. The effects of DZ closure on the chances of getting loans from banks or
receiving subsidies from the government, and on income tax burden turned out to
be insignificant (in Table 2 and Table 10). However, we fail to find any method to




                                         33
examine the channel of cheap land and better government service of zones, which
may be more important in encouraging firms to grow larger.

results in smaller output of former DZ-firms measured using value-added or gross
output value (in Table 3 and Table 9), and after controlling for value-added, the
effect of DZ closure on TFP turned to be insignificant (in Table 11). Furthermore,
we found that closing zones does not change firm-level administrative expenses in
spite of the output reduction. Thus, on average, closing zones increases general
and administrative expenses per unit output (in Table 12).

    B.! What is the implication for relocation of zones based on the empirical
                                         findings?

  Under the assumption that the negative effect of closing zones implies a positive
effect of development zones more generally, the pattern of geographic
heterogeneities of zone closure we found in Section V may suggest that it is
worthwhile to relocate more zones to coastal China than to inland China. However,
there are still two concerns. First, zones may have spillover effects on non-
development zone firms, so that zones in coastal China may not definitively surpass
inland zones even if they do have larger positive effect on development zone firms.
Second, there may be other market failures ­ e.g., labor mobility costs preventing
labor from leaving the interior and moving to the coast ­ that makes it necessary to
sacrifice efficiency to gain equality.
  In response to the concern over spillover effects, we examined the effect of zone
removal on local non-DZ firms. The results show that removal of both coastal and
inland zones positively affect the number, total employment, fixed assets and total
value-added of non-DZ firms at the county/district-industry (2-digit) level (see
Table 13). We also examined how zone removal affects the weighted average TFP
of local firms. The results show that zone removal does not have a significant effect
on non-DZ firms' TFP for coastal regions, but does have a positive effect for inland
regions (see Table 14).
  Recognizing the policy goal of regional equality through establishment of more
development zones in inland China, we argue that it is necessary to consider the
trade-off between enhancing labor mobility and using place-based polices to
promote the development of left-behind regions. Considering the institutional
obstacles to free labor mobility in China ­ i.e., the hukou system, which is costly
both in terms of efficiency and equity ­ we argue from a long-term development
perspective that it is far from necessary to use policy tools that will promote equity
at the price of efficiency.

                                                  VII. Conclusion

   In this study, we used data from the 2000-2007 Chinese Industrial Firms Survey
database in order to study the effects of a specific place-based policy (i.e.
development zones) on firm-level TFP and its corresponding geographic
heterogeneity. To alleviate the possible endogeneities of missing variables and
reverse causalities, we made use of a policy shock that occurred between 2004 and
2006, during which more than 70% of development zones were closed. The results
(using difference-in-difference specifications) showed that on average the closure
of zones reduced firm-level TFP by 6.5% on treated firms, and that the downsizing
of firms can harm the efficiency of scale economies. Moreover, using the distance
to the nearest major seaports (Shanghai, Tianjin or Hong Kong) we found that
location matters significantly in terms of the efficiency of development zones: the
greater the distance from major seaports, the smaller the negative effects of zone
closures. By examining our results from an alternative perspective, we found that
on average development zones are helpful in terms of firms' efficiency, but this
positive effect only exists in regions close to major seaports. Furthermore, we found
that market potential differences explain the geographically heterogeneous effects




                                                               38
of zone closures. In other words, place-based policies only improve firms' TFP in
places with high market potential.
  Our empirical findings shed light on the location choices of place-based policies.
In locations with low market potential caused by disadvantageous geography,
place-based policies are not efficient. Furthermore, the overall allocative efficiency
of economic resources is lessened if place-based policies are biased toward regions
with lower market potential. Unfortunately, bias in placed-based policies is
occurring in China, and explains (from a regional perspective) why China's TFP
growth has been slowing down. In a large country like China, if the resources could
be re-allocated by market forces across regions, the efficiency of the whole
economy would be greatly improved.
