                Estimated Trade—Off s Between Unemployment
                               and Inflation



                               ABSTRACT


            Three models of price and wage behavior are estimated and tested

in this paper. Model 1 is one in which the long—run trade—off between unem-

ployment and inflation is in terms of price levels; Model 2 is one in which

the trade—off is in terms of rates of change; and Model 3 is one in which

there is no long—run trade—off. The evidence favors Model 1 over Models 2

and 3. The comparison between Models 2 and 3 is inconclusive. The short—run

trade—offs are greater for Model 1 than for Models 2 and 3. The fact that

Model 3 did not do particularly well is evidence against the Friedman—Phelps

proposition of no long—run trade—off.

I.   Introduction

          An important question in macroeconomics is the size of the trade-

off between unemployment and inflation.     I have been asked by the organ-

izers of this symposium to consider this question, and so this is yet

another paper on the trade-off issue. Given an econometric model of price

and wage behavior, it is straightforward to compute the trade-off, The

key problem is finding the model that best approximates the unknown struc-

ture, and this problem is the focus of this paper.

          Three models of price and wage behavior are considered. The first,

Model 1, is the one contained in my macroeconometric model of the United

States (Fair (1984)). The second, Model 2, is one that is closer to what

might he considered the standard" model in the literature. The third, Model

3, is one in which there is no long-run trade-off between unemployment

inflation. Model 3 is Model 2 with a certain restriction on the coeffi-

cients,

          The paper is organized as follows. Some methodological issues are

discussed in Section II. The models are presented and estimated in Sec-

tion III and tested in Section IV. The unemployment-inflation trade-offs

implied by each model are presented in Section V. Section VI contains

a general evaluation of the results and a discussion of their consequences

for macroeconomic policy and research.



II. Some Methodology

       It will be useful to present a few of my views about macroeconomic

research before launching into the specification of the equations. The

first issue concerns how much information one expects to get out of macro

time series data. Consider, for example, the question of which demand

variable to use in a price or wage equation. My experience is that macro

data are not capable of discriminating among many different measures of

demand. Similar results are obtained using such variables as the overall

unemployment rate, the unemployment rate of married men, various weighted

unemployment rates, various output gaps, and various nonlinear functions

of these variables.1 It is also difficult to discriminate among alterna-

tive lag distributions for the explanatory variables, a point made by

Griliches (1968) many years ago and one that still seems valid.

       If one feels, as I do, that macro data contain a fairly limited

amount of information, the obvious procedure to follow in econometric work

is to keep the specifications simple. If the data cannot discriminate

among alternative detailed specifications, there is no sense in making

detailed specifications in the first place. One should also avoid making

strong inferences from results that are sensitive to alternative specifi-

cations that the data may not be able to discriminate among. This is an

obvious point, but it is perhaps worth emphasizing. In particular, note



'See, for example, the discussion in Fair (1978), pp. 176-180, and in Fair
(1984), pp. 128-129.
that one should be wary about making strong conclusions regarding the
validity   of a model's long-run properties. This is because long-run prop-

erties are likely to be sensitive to alternative lag distributions, which

are in turn likely to be difficult to discriminate among.

         The approach of keeping macro specifications fairly simple is at

odds with the approach of Robert Gordon and George Perry, two of the lead-

ing figures in the field of price and wage behavior. Gordon's specifica-

tions are characterized by the use of high order polynomial distributed lags with

long lag lengths, the use of detailed dummy variables, and considerable

work in the construction of many of the explanatory variables. One reason

that Gordon's specifications change so much from year to year is probably

that they are too detailed to be supported by the data. New data seem

to imply a change in specification when in fact no specification for a
                                    '2

given   year is really supported.        Perry's specifications are also usually

somewhat involved, especially with respect to the choice of the demand

variable and the use of dummy variables.3 It will be clear in what fol-

lows that my   specifications   are simpler than those of Gordon and Perry,

and one should keep in mind my reason for this difference.

        Another view I have about macroeconomic research is that there have

been too few attempts to test one model against another. One reason there

is currently so much disagreement in macroeconomics is probably that there



   minor but illustrative example of Gordon's changing specifications con-
cerns the use of dummy variables for the Nixon control period. In Gordon
(1980) one dummy variable is used, which is .67 for 1971 III - 1972 IV,
-1.0 for 1974 II - 1975  I,
                          and 0.0 otherwise. In Gordon and King (1982)
two variables are used. One is .8 for 1971 III - 1972 II and 0.0 other-
wise; and the other is .4 for 1974 II and 1975 I, 1.6 for 1974 III and
1974 IV, and 0.0 otherwise.


See, for example, the specifications in Perry (1980).
                                                                           4




has been so little testing of alternative specifications.    I developed

a few years ago a method for testing alternative models (Fair (1980)),

and this is the method that I have used in this paper to compare the three

models of price and wage behavior. One of the premises upon which this

method is based is that all models are at least somewhat misspecified.

An important feature of the method is that it accounts for the effects

of misspecification in making the comparisons across models.



III. The Three Models

Model 1

          Model 1 is the model of price and wage behavior in my U.S. model.

The following is a brief discussion of it. A more complete discussion is

contained in Fair (1984). Firms in the theoretical model are assumed to

set prices and wages in a profit-maximizing context. They have some monop-

oly power in the short run in their price and wage setting behavior.

Raising their prices above prices charged by other firms does not result

in an immediate loss of all their customers, and lowering their prices

below prices charged by other firms does not result in an immediate gain

of everyone else's customers. There is, however, a tendency for high-price

firms to lose customers over time and for low-price firms to gain customers.

Similar statements hold for wages. Firms expect that the future prices

and wages of other firms are in part a function of their own past prices

 and wages. Since a firm's market share is a function of its price rela-

 tive to the prices of other firms, its optimal price strategy depends on

 this relationship. Expectations of firms are in some cases determined in

 fairly sophisticated ways, but none of the expectations are rational in the

 Muth sense. Firms do not know the complete model, and their expectations
                                                                           5




can turn out to be incorrect.

       There are five main decision variables of a firm in the theoretical

model. In addition to the firm's price level and wage rate, the variahies

are the firm's production, investment, and demand for employment. These

decision variables are determined by solving a multiperiod maximization

problem. The predetermined variables that affect the solution to this

problem include (1) the initial stocks of excess capital, excess labor,

and inventories, (2) the current and expected future values of the inter-

est rate, (3) the current and expected future demand schedules for the

firm's output, (4) the current and expected future supply schedules of

labor facing the firm, and (5) expectations of other firms' future price

and wage decisions.

       The transition in macroeconomics from theoretical models to econo-

metric specifications is usually difficult, and the present case is no

exception. The aim of the econometric work is to try to approximate the

decision equations of the firms that result from the solutions of the maxi-

mization problems. The empirical work for the price and wage equations

consisted of trying the variables listed above, directly or indirectly,

as explanatory variables. Observed variables were used directly, and un-

observed variables were used indirectly by trying observed variables that

seemed likely to affect the unobserved variables. The main unobserved

variables are expectations.

       I will not review here the work that led to the final estimated

equations. This is discussed in Fair (1984), pp. 126-131. The final

estimated equations are presented in Table 1. The equations are in log

form. The explanatory variables in the price equation include the price

level lagged once, the wage rate inclusive of employer social security

taxes, the price of imports, and the unemployment rate lagged once. The

unemployment rate is taken to be a proxy for the current and expected

future demand schedules for the firms' output. For the work in Fair (1984)

an alternative measure of demand was used, which was a measure of the real

output gap. As noted in Section II, a variety of demand variables work

about equally well. The unemployment rate was used in this paper in order

to make the trade-off calculations in Section V somewhat simpler. The

other three variables in the price equation are taken to be proxies for

expectations of other firms' price decisions. Increases in the lagged

price level, the wage rate, and the price of imports are assumed to lead

to expectations of future price increases, which in the theoretical model

lead to an increase in current prices.

       The explanatory variables in the wage equation include the wage

lagged once, the current price level, the price level lagged once, a time

trend, and the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate is taken to be a

proxy for the current and expected future supply schedules of labor facing

the firms. The lagged wage variable and the current and lagged price var-

iables are taken to be proxies for expectations of other firms' wage de-

cisions. Increases in these variables are assumed to lead to expectations

of future wage increases, which in the theoretical model lead to an increase

in current wages. The time trend was added to account for trend changes

in the wage rate relative to the price level. The inclusion of the time

trend is importallt, since it helps identify the price equation. Aside

from the different lags for the unemployment rate, the time trend and the

lagged wage rate are the only two variables not included in the price equa-

tion that are included in the wage equation.4


4There is one slight difference between the wage equation here and the
                                                                                        8



          Before discussing the estimates, a constraint that was imposed on

the real wage rate needs to be explained. It does not seem sensible for

the real wage rate (W/P) to be a function of either 1V or Pt sep-
arately, and in order to ensure that this not be true, a constraint on the
coefficients    of the price and wage equations must be imposed. The relevant

parts of the two equations are


(1)            log    =
                          l   log I-1 +      2    log W +


(2)            log W =    l   log W1 +       2    log Pt + y3 log t-l +



From these two equations, the equation for the real wage is



(3)            log    -   log P =       -             -

         Three sets of estimates of Model 1 are presented in Table 1. The

estimation technique for the first set is two stage least squares (2SLS),

and the estimation technique for the second and third sets is three stage



one in Fair (1984). The same price deflator is used in both equations here
(the private nonfarm deflator), whereas a different price deflator is used
in the wage equation in Fair (1984) (the private deflator, both farm and
nonfarm). This difference is not important in the sense that the data can-
not discriminate between the two, and the simpler snecification was used
here for ease of interpretation.

least squares (.SLS).       The restriction (4) is imposed for the third set,

but not for the first and second. The endogenous variables in the price

equation are log Pt and log W ,               and the endogenous variables in the

wage equation are log W ,        log   Pt ,     and         URt is taken to be

an endogenous variable even though no equation is specified for it in this

paper. It is an endogenous variable in my U.S. model. The first stage

regressors that were used for the estimates are discussed in the notes to

Table 1. The basic set of variables referred to in the notes consists of

34 variables. These are the main predetermined variables in my U.S. model.

The 2SLS estimated residuals were used for the estimation of the covariance

matrix of the error terms that is needed for the 3SLS estimates. The cor-

relation coefficient for the error terms in the two equations was -.299.

       The data base used in Fair (1984) was updated through 1984 I for

the results in this paper. The estimation period for all the equations

in Table 1. is 1954 I - 1984 I, which is a total of 121 observations.

       The three sets of estimates of Model 1 are quite close, and there

is little to choose among them. The coefficient restriction (4) is clearly

supported by the data. The value of the 3SLS objective function was -96.471

for the unrestricted estimates and -96.567 for the restricted estimates,

for a difference of only .096. This difference is asymntotically distri-

buted as      with one degree of freedom, and the .096 value is far below

the critical x2 value at the 95 percent confidence level of 3.84.

       Model 1 differs from traditional models of wage and price behavior

in a number of ways, and it will be useful to discuss two of these differences.



5All calculations for this paper except for those in Section V were done
using the Fair-Parke program. The Park (1982) algorithm was used to com-
pute the 3SLS estimates.
                                                                          10




First, most price and wage equations are specified in terms of rates of

change of prices and wages rather than in terms of levels. Given the

theory behind Model 1, the natural decision variables seemed to be the

levels of prices and wages rather than the rates of change, and so this

was the specification used. For example, the market share equations in

the theoretical model have a firm's market share as a function of the ratio

of the firm's price to the average price of other firms. These prices

are all price levels, and the objective of the firm is to choose the price

level path (along with the paths of the other decision variables) that

maximizes the multiperiod objective function. A firm decides what its

price level should be relative to the price levels of other firms. The

use of levels instead of rates of change has important consequences for

the long-run properties of the model. This is discussed in Sections V

and VI.

          Second, most price equations are postulated to be mark up equations,

where little or no demand effects are expected. Wage equations are postu-

lated to be the ones where demand effects are most likely to exist. Model

1 is to some extent the reverse of this. The unemployment rate has a

larger coefficient estimate (in absolute value) and is more significant

in the price equation than in the wage equation. Also, the coefficient

estimate of the wage rate in the price equation is too small to be inter-

preted as a mark up coefficient. The theory behind the price and wage

equations is not a mark up theory, and so there is no reason to expect the

estimated equations to have properties of mark up equations. The equations

do not appear to have such properties.

v1odel 2


           As just noted, price and wage equations are typically specified

in terms of rates of change of prices and wages rather than in terms of

levels, and price equations are typically specified to be mark up equations.

This specification has been used for Model 2.      I tried a number of equa-

tions that seemed consistent with this specification. The final equations

are presented in Table 1.

           The equations for Model 2 are in log form. The quarterly change

in price is a function of the quarterly change in price lagged once, of

the four-quarter change in the wage rate lagged once, and of the two-

quarter change in the import price deflator lagged once. The quarterly

change in the wage is a function of the four-quarter change in the price

level lagged once and of the unemployment rate. These equations are con-

sistent with the interpretation of the price equation as a mark up equa-

tion and of the wage equation as the one in which demand effects appear.

The unemployment rate appears in the wage equation but not in the price

equation. It was of the wrong sign and not significant when included in

the price equation (both the current rate and the rate lagged one quarter

were separately tried). The following is a discussion of some of the ex-

perimentation behind the choice of the final equations.

           The data seemed to support the use of the four-quarter change in

the wage lagged once in the price equation. When the four one-quarter

changes, log WtJl +       d)    —   log Wti(l +   d1)   ,   I   =   1, 2, 3, 4
were used in place of the four-quarter change, the coefficient estimates

and t-statistlcs were: .139 (2.33), .144 (2.41), .181 (3.00), and .120

(1.97). These coefficients seemed close enough to warrant simply using

the four-quarter change. Neither the one-quarter change unlagged nor the
                                                                         12




one-quarter change lagged five quarters was significant when included with

the other four one-quarter changes. Similarly, the data seemed to support

the use of the two-quarter change in the price of imports lagged once.

When the one-quarter changes lagged once and twice were used in place of

the two-quarter change, the coefficient estimates and t-statistics were:

.0674 (3.20) and .0477 (2.03).

       The quarterly change in the wage rate lagged once was not signifi-

cant when added to the wage equation. The t-statistic was only -.49.

The use of the four-quarter change in the price in the wage equation was

supported less than was the use of the four-quarter change in the wage

in the price equation, but the four-quarter change in the price was used

in the wage equation anyway. When the four one-quarter changes were used

in place of the four-quarter change, the coefficient estimates and t-sta-

tistics were: .249 (2.22), .126 (1.07), —.017 (-0.14), and .352 (2.94).

       Two sets of estimates of Model 2 are presented in Table 1. The

estimation techniques for the first set are ordinary least squares for the

price equation and 2SLS for the wage equation. The estimation technique

for the second set is 3SLS. There are no endogenous explanatory variables

in the price equation. The unemployment rate in the wage equation was

taken to be an endogenous variable. The two sets of estimates are very

close. The correlation coefficient for the error terms in the two equa-

tionswas only .030, and so very littlewas gained by using 3SLS. Comparing

the single-equation fits with those for Model 1, the price equation has

a larger standard error (.00404 versus .00377) and the wage equation has

a smaller standard error (.00565 versus .00581).

Model 3

            As will be seen in Section V, there is a trade-off between the un-

employment rate and inflation implicit in Model 2. There is, however, a

restriction that can be placed on the coefficients of Model 2 that implies

no long-run trade-off. Model 3 is Model 2 with this restriction imposed.

The restriction is as follows. Let -j =                                         log I_ - log '-i-1 and
        =   log               -

wage equations of Model 2 as

there is no long-run trade-off, and this is the restriction that was imposed

on Model 3.

            The estimates with this restriction imposed are presented in Table

1. The equations were estimated by 3SLS, where URt was treated as an
                                                                             14




endogenous variable. The value of the 3SLS objective function was -116.669

for the unrestricted estimates and -128.525 for the restricted estimates,

for a difference of 11.856. Again, this difference is asymptotically dis-

trwbuted as x2 with one degree of freedom. The 11.856 value is consider-

ably above the critical       value at the 95 percent confidence level of

3.84, and so the restriction is not supported by the data. The single equa-

tion fits for the price and wage equations are .00415 and .00578 for the

restricted estimates, which compare to .00404 and .00565 for the unrestricted

estimates.

        Given the coefficient estimates of Model 3 and given an assumption

about the long-run value of Z ,        one can compute the value of the unem-

ployment rate (say UR* )     for   which inflation neither accelerates nor

decelerates. Under the assumption that the long-run growth rate of d

is zero and that the long-run growth rate of the import price deflator is

7.0 percent at an annual rate, the value of UR* is 6.25 percent. This

value is simply computed by solving the equation 0 =      Z +      +

for   UR .   The long-run rate of change of the price level that corresponds

to this value of UR is 3.39 percent at an annual rate. The corresponding

growth rate for the nominal wage is 5.06 percent, and the corresponding

growth rate for the real wage is 1.62 percent.



IV. A Comparison of the Models

        Although the single equation fits are available from Table 1, these

fits are not the appropriate criterion for comparing the models. Among

other things, they do not test for the dynamic accuracy of the models and

they do not account in an explicit way for the possible misspecification

of the models. The method in Fair (1980) can be used to compare models,
                                                                                       15




and this method is used in this section to compare the three models.

       The method accounts for the four main sources of uncertainty of

a forecast: uncertainty due to 1) the error terms, 2) the coefficient

estimates, 3) the exogenous variables, and 4) the possible misspecifica—

tion of the model. Because it accounts for these four sources, it can

be used to make comparisons across models. In other words, it puts each

model on an equal footing for purPoses of comparison. Exogenous variable

uncertainty is not a problem in the present case because each model has

the same exogenous variables, namely d and                   .    Therefore,   exog-

enous variable uncertainty has not been taken into account: both d

and PIMt have been assumed to be known with certainty. The following

is a brief outline of the method except for the part pertaining to exog-

enous variable uncertainty.


The Method

       Assume that the model has m stochastic equations, p unrestricted

coefficients to estimate, and T observations for the estimation. The

model can be nonlinear, simultaneous, and dynamic. Let S denote the

covariance matrix of the error terms, and let V denote the covariance

matrix of the coefficient estimates. S is mxm and V is pxp . An

estimate of S ,   say   S ,   is   (l/T)U(J' ,   where   U is an mxT matrix
of estimated errors. The estimate of V       ,   say     ,       depends on the esti-
mation techniciiie used. Let &     denote a p-component vector of the coef-
ficient estimates, and let    u denote an in-component vector of the error

terms for period t

       Uncertainty from the error terms and coefficient estimates can be

estimated in a straightforward way by means of stochastic simulation.
                                                                          16




Given assumptions about the distributions of the error terms and coeffi-

cient estimates, one can draw values of both error terms and coefficients.

For each set of values the model can be solved for the period of interest.

Given, say, J trials, the estimated forecast mean and estimated variance

of the forecast error for each endogenous variable for each period can

be computed. Let 7itk denote the estimated mean of the k-period-ahead

forecast of variable i ,     where   t is the first Deriod of the forecast,

and let           denote the estimated variance of the forecast error.   itk
            itk
is simply the average of the J predicted values from the J trials, and

°itk is the sum of squared deviations of the predicted values from the

estimated mean divided by J

          It is usually assumed that the distributions of the error terms and

coefficient estimates are normal, although the stochastic-simulation pro-

cedure does not require the normality assumption. The normality assump-

tion has been used for the results in this paper. Let u be a particular

draw of the error terms for period t ,      and let ct be a particular draw

of the coefficients. The distribution of u is assumed to be N(O,S)

and the distribution of cx is assumed to be N(c,V)

          Estimating the uncertainty from the possible misspecification of

the model is the most difficult and costly part of the method. It requires

successive reestimation and stochastic simulation of the model. It is

based on a comparison of estimated variances computed by means of stochastic

simulation with estimated variances computed from outside-sample (i.e.,

outside the estimation period) forecast errors. Assuming no stochastic-

simulation error, the expected value of the difference between the two

estimated variances for a given variable and period is zero for a correctly

specified model. The expected value is not in general zero for a misspecified
                                                                                         17




model, and this fact is used to try to account for misspecification.

       Without going into details, the basic procedure is to estimate the

model over a number of different estimation periods and for each set of

estimates to compute the difference between the two estimated variances

for each variable and length ahead of the forecast. The average of these

differences for each variable and length ahead provides an estimate of the

expected value. Let djk denote this average for variable I and length

ahead k .     Given   d.
                       ik   ,   the   final step is to add it to              .   This
                                                                        itk
sum, which will be denoted               ,   is   the final estimated variance.

Another way of looking at dik is that it is the part of the forecast-

error variance not accounted for by the stochastic-simulation estimate.6


The Results

       Table 2 contains the results. The values in the a rows are sto-

chastic-simulation estimates of the forecast standard errors based on

draws of error terms only. The values in the b rows are based on draws

of both error terms and coefficients. The results are based on 500 trials

for each of the two stochastic simulations.7 The simulation period is

1982 II - 1984 I. In terms of the above notation, the b-row values are



6Strictly speaking, ik is not a measure of the misspecification of the
model (for the k-period-ahead forecast of variable i ).                Misspecification
can affect the stochastic simulation estimate of the variance
and d.k is merely the effect of misspecification on the total variance
not reflected in °itk           For purposes of comparing the models, it does
not matter how much of the misspecification is in                  .    The variance
that is used for comparison is the total variance, tk

7The 3SLS estimates of each model were used for these simulations, includ-
ing the 3SLS estimates of S and V .     The errors in Table 2 are in units
of percent of the forecast mean. See the discussion in Chapter 8 in Fair
(1984) for the exact way in which the percentage errors are computed.

values of       .   Each model consists of three equations: the price equa-

tion, the wage equation, and an identity determining the real wage (W/P)

       For the misspecification results each model was estimated and sto-

chastically simulated 37 times.8 For the first set, the estimation period

ended in 1974 IV and the simulation period began in 1975 I. For the second

set, the estimation period ended in 1975 I and the simulation period began

in 1975 II. For the final set, the estimation period ended in 1983 IV

and the simulation period began in 1984 I. The beginning quarter was 1954 I

for all estimation periods. The length of the first 30 simulation periods

was eight quarters. Since the data set ended in 1984 I, the length of the

31st simulation period, which began in 1982 III, was only seven quarters.

Similarly, the length of the 32nd period was six, and so on through the

length of the 37th period, which was only one quarter. For each of the

37 sets of estimates, new estimates of V and S were obtained. Each of

the 37 stochastic simulations was based on 200 trials.

       The results produced for the one-quarter-ahead forecast for each

of the three endogenous variables 37 values of the difference between the

estimated forecast-error variance based on outside-sample errors (i.e.,

the squared forecast errors) and the estimated forecast-error variance

based on stochastic simulation. The average of these 37 values was taken

for each variable. In terms of the above notation, this average is d.1

where the i refers to variable i and the I refers to the one-quarter-


8Because the OLS-2SLS and 3SLS estimates of Model 2 were so close for the
results in Table 2, the OLS-2SLS techniques were used for the successive
reestimation for Model 2.  Estimating a model 37 times by 3SLS is expensive,
and for Model 2 it seemed unnecessary to do this. The estimate of V for
the OLS-2SLS techniques was assumed to be block diagonal for purposes of
the stochastic simulation draws. Both Models 1 and 3 were estimated 37
times by 3SLS.

ahead forecast. The total variance for the one-quarter-ahead forecast

of variable j is             +          which in terms of the above notation
                       iti       ii ,

is         .   For the results in Table 2, t is 1982 II, and the d-row value

for 1982 II for each variable is the square root of             .   The calcula-

tions for the two-quarter-ahead forecasts are the same except that there

are   only 36 values of the difference between the two estimated variances
for each variable. Similarly, there are only 35 values for the three-
quarter-ahead    forecast, and so on.

        The d-row values in Table 2 can be compared across models. For

both the price level and the nominal wage, Model 1 is the clear winner.

It has the lowest standard errors for all the periods except for the one-

quarter-ahead forecast of the price level, where the standard error is

.50 for Model 1 and .49 for Model 3. By the end of the eight quarter hori-

zon, the differences in the standard errors are fairly large. For the

price level the eighth quarter standard errors are 2.94 for Model 1, 4.51

for Model 2, and 3.67 for Model 3. For the nominal wage the errors are

2.10 for Model 1, 2,95 for Model 2, and 3.28 for Model 3. With respect

to Model 2 versus Model 3, Model 3 does better for prices and Model 2 does

better for wages.

         The results for the real wage are closer. Model 1 is the best for

the first six quarters; the models essentially tie for the seventh quarter;

and Models 2 and 3 are better than Model 1 for the eighth quarter. In

general the results are fairly close, and there is no clear cut winner,

V. Properties of the Models

Unemployment-Inflation Trade-offs

       For each model it is straightforward to compute the trade-off be-

tween the unemployment rate and inflation. A simulation is first run using

a particular value of the unemployment rate, and then another simulation

is run using another value. The differences in the predicted values from

the two simulations are the estimated trade-offs. The results of this

exercise are presented in Table 3. The first simulation for each model

began in 1984 II, which means that the initial conditions through 1984 I

were used. The simulation was allowed to run for 140 quarters. An unem-

ployment rate of 7.8 percent was used for all future periods. The annual

rate of growth of the import price deflator was taken to be 7.0 percent.

The rate of growth of the employer social security tax rate (dt) was

taken to be zero throughout the period. The second simulation for each

model differed from the first only in the unemployment rate that was used.

The unemployment was lowered to 6.8 percent for all future periods for this

simulation. The results in Table 3 are the differences between the two

simulations.

       As can be seen, the models have quite different long—run properties.

For Model 1 the one percentage point drop in the unemployment rate leads

to an eventual rise in the price level of 5.15 percent and in the wage

level of 4.81 percent. The real wage falls slightly (by .32 percent).

At the end of the first year the price level is .60 percent higher; at

the end of the second year it is 1.30 percent higher; and at the end of

the fourth year it is 2.38 percent higher, which is about half way to the

final increase of 5.15 percent. Not counting the first quarter, the in-

crease in the rate of growth of the price level falls from .88 in the second

           Initial conditions were the actual values through 1984 I.

           The import price deflator was assumed to grow at an annual rate of 7.0
                                                                                   percent throughout the period.

quarter, to .80 in the fourth quarter, to .68 in the eighth quarter, to

.48 in the sixteenth quarter, and to zero after 140 quarters. A similar

pattern holds for the nominal wage.

       For Model 2 the one percentage point drop in the unemployment rate

leads to an eventual increase in the rate of change of the price level of

.95 percent. The eventual increase in the rate of change of the nominal

wage is 1.16 percent, and the eventual increase in the rate of change of

the real wage is .19 percent. The price and wage levels are, of course,

ever increasing. After 140 quarters the price level is 34.74 percent higher,

the nominal wage is 44.35 percent higher, and the real wage is 7.14 per—

cent higher. At somewhere between 30 and 40 quarters the price level be-

comes 5.15 percent higher, which is the long—run total for Model 1.

       It is interesting to compare the first few quarters for Models 1

and 2. The rate of inflation is initially much larger for Model 1 than

for Model 2. After eight quarters the price level is 1.30 percent higher

for Model 1 compared to .53 percent higher for Model 2. The rate of in-

flation for Model 1 falls from .88 in the second quarter to .68 in the

eighth quarter. For Model 2 the rate of inflation rises from .07 in the

second quarter to .48 in the eighth quarter. There is thus much more of

a short run trade-off for Model 1 than for Model 2. The rates of inflation

cross at quarter 11, where they are .60 for Model 1 and .61 for Model 2.

After quarter 11 the rate of inflation rises to .95 for Model 2 and falls

to zero for Model 1. The price levels cross somewhere between quarters

20 and 30.

       Consider now the results for Model 3. The unemployment rates of

6.8 and 7.8 percent are above the non decelerating rate of 6.25, and so

for both simulations the rate of inflation is decelerating. Although not
                                                                         24




shown in Table 3, the rate of inflation becomes negative in quarter 18

for the simulation in which the unemployment rate is 7.8 percent. By

quarter 140 the rate of inflation is -20.96 percent. The differences in

Table 3 for Model 3 are thus differences between two decelerating paths.

It is interesting to note that the differences for the first few quarters

for Model 3 are not all that different from the differences for Model 2,

although they are somewhat higher for Model 3.


Effects of a Change in Import Prices

       One can also examine how the models respond to a change in import

prices. Again, two simulations can be run, one using one set of values

for future import prices and one using another. The results of this exer-

cise are presented in Table 4. The first simulation used an annual rate

of change of import prices of 7.0 percent, and the second used a rate of

8.0 percent. The initial conditions were the same as those for the simu-

lations in Table 3. An unemployment rate of 7.8 percent was used for these

results.

       The increase in the rate of change of import prices led to an in-

crease in the rate of change of prices and wages for both Models 1 and 2.

For prices the long—run effect is .69 for Model 1 and .38 for Model 2.

For wages the two numbers are .43 and .27. The long—run rate of change

in the real wage fell in both cases. The fall was larger for Model 1 than

for Model 2 (- .25 versus -.11). Although the long—run properties differ

somewhat, the short—run properties of the two models are quite close, as

can be seen from examining, say, the first eight quarters in Table 3.

The short—run results for Model 3 are also fairly close to those for Models

1 and 2. The long—run results for Model 3 are, of course, vastly different.

VI. General Remarks

Long-run Trade-offs

         The two key questions regarding the long-run trade-off between un-

employment and inflation are 1) whether there is any trade-off and 2) if

there is one, whether it is in terms of the level of prices or the rate

of change of prices. The results of comparing the three models in Section

IV indicate that Model 1 is more accurate than Models 2 and 3, and so from

these results one would conclude that there is a trade-off and that it

is in terms of the level of prices. If the choice is merely between Models

2 and 3, the results are inconclusive.9

         Although Model 1 does seem to be the best approximation of the three,

the results must be interpreted with considerable caution. As noted in

Section II, macro data have a difficult time discriminating among alterna-

tive lag distributions, and alternative lag distributions can have large

effects on the long-run properties of a model. One should clearly put

much less weight on the long-run properties of the models than on the short-

run properties (say, up to eight or twelve quarters ahead),

         One may at first be surprised to think that the trade-off between

unemployment and inflation may be in terms of the level of prices rather

than the rate of change, but there is no theoretically compelling reason

to rule out the level trade-off without testing the two possibilities.

As noted in Section III, it seems natural, given my theoretical model, to



91n future work it may be possible to provide a better test of Model 2
versus Model 3. The comparisons in Section IV were only for forecasts
up to eight quarters ahead. It can be seen from Table 3 that the main
differences between the two models occur after eight quarters. It may
thus be possible to get more conclusive results by using a forecast hori-
zon longer than eight quarters. No attempt was made to do this in this
study.
                                                                       27




specify the price and wage equations in level terms. In general, there

seems no reason to expect that a permanent shift in demand will neces-

sarily lead to a permanently higher rate of change of prices and thus to

an ever increasing price level. At the least, this issue seems open to

empirical test, and the tests in this paper provide support for the prop-

osition that the trade-off is in terms of levels.

       Another point that should be kept in mind about Model 1 is the

following. One might argue (I think correctly) that it is not sensible

to expect that the unemployment rate could be driven to, say, 1.0 percent

without having any more effect on prices than on their levels. (The same

argument could even be made for Model 2 regarding the rates of change of

prices.) There are clearly unemployment rates below which it is not sen-

sible to assume that any of the three models provides a good approximation.

Any attempt to extrapolate a model beyond the extremes of the data is

dangerous, and this seems particularly true in the case of price and wage

equations.

       I sometimes try to account for the nonlinearities in price responses

that one expects to exist as the unemployment rate approaches very low

levels by using as the demand variable in the price and wage equations

some function of the unemployment rate (or other measure of demand). These

functions approach infinity or minus infinity as the unemployment rate

approaches some small value. This means that as the unemyloyment rate

approaches this value, prices approach infinity. In a complete model of

the economy, prices can never be driven to infinity, and so this approach

effectively bounds the unemployment rate from below. The problem with

this approach is that the data generally cannot discriminate among altern-

ative functional forms, and so any choice is somewhat arbitrary. The
                                                                        2




approach that I have taken in this paper is to keep the specification simpi)

by merely using the level of the unemployment rate as an explanatory var-
iable. The consequence of this is that one should not extrapolate the

equations much beyond the range of the historical data.


Real Wage Responses

         The experiments in Tables 3 and 4 have consequences for the long-

run   level   and rate of change of the real wage. Some of the long-run real

wage properties of the models may not be reasonable. To see tillS,    con-
sider a variable, denoted SHRII ,     which is defined to be the ratio of

after tax profits of the firm sector to the wage bill of the firm sector

net of employer social security taxes.'° The mean of this variable for

the 1954 I - 1984 I period is .109, with a maximum value of .136 in 1979 III

and a minimum value of .066 in 1983 I. The variable has essentially no

trend throughout this period. A regression of SHIfl on a constant term

and time trend for this period yields a coefficient estimate of the time

trend of - .000084, with a t-statistic of -1.91. This coefficient multi-

plied by 121, the number of observations, yields -.010, which is the esti-

mated trend change in SHRITI      This is a fairly small change over the 30

year period.

         A fall in the level of the real wage of one percent leads to a rise

in SURF of approximately .0075. If a given experiment with the price

and wage equations results in a large change in the long-run level of the

real wage, this may imply values of SHRF that are considerably beyond

the historical range. If so, this may call into question the long-run

properties, since there may be forces at work (not captured by the


10
   SHRII is a variable in my U.S. model. See Fair (1984) for the precise
definition of it.
                                                                        29



equations) keeping SHRII at roughly a constant level in the long run.

The unemployment rate experiments in Table 3 show that Model 1 is fine

in this regard (the long-run level of the real wage changes very little),

but that Model 2 is not. The results for Model 2 show that the level of

the real wage is ever increasing, although at a fairly slow rate. After

140 quarters the level of the real wage is 7.14 percent higher, which

implies a fall in SHRTI of approximately .0075    7.14 =   .054.   This is

about five times larger than the trend change over the 121 quarters be-

tween 1954 I and 1984 I.

       The import price experiments in Table 4 show that both Models 1

and 2 have ever changing real wage levels, in this case ever falling real

wage levels. The fall is larger for Model 1 than for Model 2.      I think

the problem here is the following. Over the sample period there has been

a certain trend change in the price of imports. The coefficient estimates

of the price and wage equations are based on this trend. In the case of

Model 1 the key coefficient estimate is the estimate of the time trend

in the wage equation. Given that the coefficients estimates are based

on this trend, it is not necessarily sensible to run an experiment in which

the rate of change of the price of imports is permanently changed without

also changing the coefficient estimate of the time trend in the wage equa-

tion to adjust for this trend change. A similar adjustment should be made

to one or both of the constant terms in Model 2. With these adjustments,

the models would still show an increase in the rate of changes of prices

and wages in response to the increase in the rate of change of the price

of imports, but the coefficient adjustments could be made to show no change

in the real wage in the long run.

Policy Options

       There is little more to be said about policy options that is not

obvious from the results in Table 3. If one believes that Model 1 is the

best approximation, the trade-offs can be read from the results for Model

1. The cost of a fall in the unemployment rate of one percentage point

is an increase in the price level of 1.30 percent after 8 quarters. If

Model 2 is chosen, the cost is an increase of .53 percent after 8 quarters.

If one's horizon is 20 quarters, the estimated cost is about the same for

both models: 2.80 percent for Model 1 and 2.57 percent for Model 2. After

20 quarters the estimated costs from the two models diverge rapidly, and

this is where the most uncertainty lies. For Model 1 there is an increase

in the price level of 5.15 -   2.60   =   2.55 percent left. For Model 2 there

is an increase in the rate of change of prices of .95 - .81 = .14 left.




Consequences for Macroeconomic Research

       One of the important results of this paper is that the no long-run

trade-off model, Model 3, does not appear to be as good an approximation

to the economy as does Model 1. The comparison with Model 2 is inconclu-

sive, although it is certainly not the case that Model 3 dominates 'Iode1 2.

This result has important consequences for macroeconomic research. Eco-

nomists with such diverse views as Tobin and Lucas seem to agree with the

Friedman—Phelps proposition that there is no long-run trade-off between

unemployment and inflation. (See Tobin (1980), p. 39, and Lucas (1981),

p. 560.) Lucas (1981) points out in his review of Tobin's (1980) book

that most of the recent developments in macroeconomic theory have been

motivated by the problem of reconciling the natural rate hypothesis of

Friedman and Phelps with an adequate treatment of output and employment
                                                                     31




fluctuations.   I think Lucas is right in arguing that Tobin cannot accept

the proposition of no long-run trade-off and at the same time accept short-

run propositions that do not imply the Friedman-Phelps proposition in the

long run. The long run is simply a sequence of short runs.

       Where I think both Tobin and Lucas have missed the mark is in so

readily accepting the Friedman-Phelps proposition. The evidence in this

paper suggests that this proposition may not be true, and at the least

the validity of the proposition is highly uncertain. It seems unwise to

me to have based more than a decade of macroeconomic research on such a

proposition. The present results suggest that more thought should be given

to the possibility that the concept of a natural rate of unemployment is

not a useful one upon which to base a theory)1




      theory upon which my macroeconometric model is based does not use
the concept of a natural rate of unemployment. See Fair (1984), in par-
ticular pages 15-16 and 90-91.
