           Currency Baskets and Real Effective Exchange Rates



                                ABSTRACT



     With the major currencies continuously moving (if not floating
freely) against each other, a country that does not choose to float
must decide what to peg to. If it pegs to the SDR it floats against
all currencies. Thus in the system begun in the early 1970s the very
concept of a fixed exchange rate is unclear. In this situation many
countries have chosen to peg their currencies to a basket, or a weight-
ed average of other currencies.

     The analysis of this paper is focused on fluctuations in real ex-
change rates. We first show that pegging to a currency basket is the
same as holding constant a real effective exchange rate that uses a
specific set of weights depending on a chosen policy target. We also
show the weights that correspond to particular targets for stabilization
policy.

     Next we discuss several problems involved in choosing and computing
optimal weights or the equivalent real effective rate. It is shown that
the index formula itself aggregates countries that are in a currency
area, so that monetary authorities should use weights based on trade
with countries rather than on currency denomination of trade.

     Finally, we report on an initial empirical investigation of pegging
practices in Greece, Portugal, and Spain. These are all countries that
have moved to basket pegs, with geographically diversified trade. We
present initial estimates of the implicit weights in their baskets, and
find that all three countries experienced real appreciation relative to
the basket during the l970s.

        Currency Baskets and Real Effective Exchange Rates


1. Introduction and Sunry.

   With the major currencies continuously moving (if not floating freely)
                                         does not choose to float must decide
against each other, a country that

what to peg to. If it pegs its currency to one of the major currencies,

It floats against the others. If it pegs to the SDR it floats against

all currencies. Thus in the system begun in the early 1970s the very

concept of a fixed exchange rate is unclear.

    In this situation many countries have chosen to peg their currencies
                                          of other currencies. This trend was
to a basket, or a weighted average

noted by Arthur Lewis in his Per Jacobssen lecture at the IMP:

      "It is now the conventional wisdom that the currencies of

      the developed countries should float, but the currencies of

      the less—developed (LDC5) should not; that is to say that

       each LDC should choose a more developed country (MDC) as a

       partner ——   or the SDR —— and tie itself in a fixed
       relationship.t' (Lewis, 1977, p. 33).


 Since the SDR weights are not particularly relevant for any single

 country,   many countries   compose their own     basket.

     Generalized floating (or dirty floating) raises problems of

 measurement. What is meant by "the" exchange rate in a floating,

 multiple—CurrencY world? The answer that has appeared in the literature

 is an "effective" exchange rate, which is generally 50e.rade—veighted

 index of changes in the home currency price of various foreign currencies.

                                                 rates. These are based
The IMF now publishes data on effective exchange

on the IMP's multiple exchange rate model (MERN), described by Artus and

Rhomberg (1973). It will be shown in this paper that this is only one

       In an earlier paper (Branson—Katseli (B—K)

conference in Stockholm in 1978, we derived weights for currency baskets

that would eliminate the effects of other countries' nominal exchange

rate fluctuations on various home—country policy
                                                    targets. There we

considered the problem of choosing a currency basket in the presenèe of
                                             holding prices constant. In this
third—country exchange—late fluctuations,

 as holding constant a real effective exchange rate that uses a specific
                                                 target. We also show that
 set of weights depending on the chosen policy

 the optimal weights of the earlier paper can be used for currency baskets
                                                    .The underlying model of
 defined across real exchange rate fluctuations.

 trade prices and quantities is similar to the one in B—K (1981) and is

  summarized in Appendix 1.

        The model of section 2 differs from others in the recent literature

 in two respects. First, a partial equilibrium approach is adopted as

 opposed to the general equilibrium model of Flanders and llelpman (1979).

 This affects the exact composition, but not the general form of the weights.
                                                                     3.




Second, we derive weights that insulate policy targets from third—country

real   exchange—rate fluctuations. The alternative in the literature is to
adopt a variance—minimiziçig approach for a portfolio or a vector of targets.
Examples are Flanders and Helpman (1979), de Macedo(1979), and Lipschitz
and   Sundararajan    (1980). They derive weights which differ from ours in

form, being functions of the variance—covariance structure of movements

in   real exchange rates.
          In   sections 3 and 4 we discuss several problems involved in choosing

and computing optimal weights or the equivalent real effective rate.

In section 3 it is shown that the index formula itself aggregates countries

that are in a currency area, so that monetary authorities should use weights

based on trade with countries rather than on currency denomination of trade.

In section 4 optimal weights are combined with a crawling peg against the

basket.

          Finally,   in section 5 we report on an initial empirical investiga-

tion of pegging practices in Greece, Portuga1, and Spain. These are all

countries that have moved to basket pegs, with geographically diversified

trade. We present initial estimates of the implicit weights in their baskets,

and find that all three countries experienced real appreciation relative to

the basket during the 1970s..

      The objective of this section is to extend our previous work

where the weights Wj remain to be chosen. NotIng that the bilateral

exchange rate of the home country 0 against country I (Ti) can be decomposed

into the home country price of an arbitrarily chosen numeraire, r, and the

numeraire price of the currency i, J, the numeraire can be factored out

of the Index in (1) as follows. Substitute Jr for              and add and

subtract       to obtain



                   —
Since the weights sum      to   unity, the real exchange rate vis—a—vis the

numeraire can be factored out to give


                                    —        +
         (2)      I        (r +
                                        p)         + q1


In   equation (2) the first term represents the home—country real exchange

rate against the numeraire, and the second term is the weighted sum of the

numeraire's real rate against all other countries.

         Nov consider a policy rule that moves the nominal exchange rate

against the numeraire r to hold I constant:

                                                                             7.




Thi8 policy rule both stabilizes the effective real exchange rate I

defined   by w1 and pegs the real rate in terms of the numeraire to the
currency      basket across all N currencies (including the numeraire) defined

by the same weights w1 .       Thus if the home—country real exchange rate

vis—a—vis     the numeraire is held equal to the basket real exchange rate
defined by a given set of weights w1, the         real effective exchange rate

defined by those weights is held constant.

       The weights w1 in equation (3) can be chosen to insulate one of a

number of targets from movements in third—country           exchange rates vis—a—vis
the numeraire.        Examples of such targets from B—K (1981) are (a) the

terms of trade X'm        , (b) the   balance of payments       —
                                                                    PM   ,   and   (c)


the price ratio of traded and non—traded goods. In principle, these optimal

basket weights may be calculated for a variety of policy targets. Flanders

and Helpman (1979) and Lipschitz and Sundararajan (1980), for example, derive

optimal basket weights for some of these as well as other policy targets.

       The policy targets can, in turn, be expressed as combinations of

trade prices and quantities as shown In B—K (1981). In Appendix 1 changes

in trade prices and quantities are expressed as functions of movements in

(a) the home country's real exchange rate against the numeraire, r+

and (b) the numeraire's real exchange rate against third countries,

   +      +      •   These can be combined to give an expression for movements

in the chosen target variable which can in turn be set equal to zero to

solve for the weighting scheme w        that   insulates that particular combination

       Balance of Trade Weights.

       The balance of trade is given by BT = p,X — pmM•        If we index


and    to unity initially, so           m = 1,   differentiation of this expression

for the trade balance yields


       (4)        dBT =    (p    ÷ X) X — (      ÷ M) M


Here X and M are the initial levels of trade. SubstItution from equations


A.lO — A.13 from Append'x (1) for p, p, X, and H gives us the following

expression for the change in the trade balance, in home currency terms:



       (5)        dBT =       (X — H)   ;
                          +     (Xk(l + s) — Mk' (1 + d)] (r +       —



                          +Xk      (l+s)      tj (J1+q1_q)

                          —     Mk' (1 + d)                —

                                               1(J1
The first term is the effect of home price changes with a given initial

balance; the second term gives the effect of changes in the real exchange

rate against the numeraire; the term in brackets is the Marshall—Lerner

condition. The last two terms give the effects of changes in third—country

real exchange rates on export and import values, respectively.
                                                                                          9.



             To obtain the weights for the currency basket that would stabilize

    the trade balance, we set dBT = 0 in (5), and solve for the real effective

    exchange rate index:

               *     A        A                                      A        A       A

                                                                  w1(J1


    with   weights w given by
                                                        —
                                            Xk(l+5)a      Mk'(l+d)81
    (7)                                         Xk(l+s) — !1k'(1+d)

    These are the same as the balance—of—trade weights (37) in B—K (1981),
    and are essentially the same as the IMF's effective MERN weights.           If
    initially      X =   N,   the result of (6) for the real exchange rate against
    the    numera ire N is given by



                                  r+qP0_ Ew(J+q_q)
    The nominal rate should be moved to make movemen in the real rate equal

    to movement in the weighted average of third—country real rates, with

    weights given by (7). These define a currency basket stabilizing the

    balance of trade; they also define. an effective rate I with reference

-
    to    stabilizing the trade balance.

     Terms—of—trade weights.

       We could derive weights insulating the terms of trade

from third—country real exchange rates from equations (A.lO) and (A.12)

in Appendix 1. However, given the balance—of trade weights in (7),

we can proceed more directly. Assume X = N initially, and eliminate

quantity effects from the balance—of—trade weights by assuming

s = d       0 .    Then those weights become the terms—of—trade weights
 x   m




       (8) W1=
                    k-k
These are the same as (28) in B—K (1981), and they define a currency bas-

ket or effective rate that would stabilize the terms of trade. As noted
in   B—K (1981),   in the small—country case where k = k   =   1,   exchange—rate

policy cannot influence the terms of trade; weights (18) are relevant

only when k k.


      Weights stabilizing the relative price of traded goods.

        Equation (7) gives weights for a currency basket aimed at stabi—

lizing the trade balance. These are essentially defined as weights for

"the" effective exchange rate in the IMP     literature.   See, for example,

Artus—Bhomberg (1973). On the other hand, as early as 1976, Stanley Black

derived weights aimed at stabilizing the relative price of traded vs non—

traded goods. These define an alternative effective exchange rate

oriented toward relative prices.

In B—K (1981), the Black weights were shown          to   be the small—country

case of a more general scheme, as we now see.


        Movements in the price of traded goods can be written as


           pT =zp

where      and    are weights of exports and imports in total trade in

value terms, and z +           =1   .    Substitution   from equatior (A.l0) and

(A.12) in Appendix 1 for p and p yields



       (10) T = p0 + (zk + zmk)(r + q — p0)

                    +   zkZcj(Ji + q1 —

Movements in the price of non—traded goods are given b domestic cost cQn—

These   are the same as B—K (1981), equation (32), and they provide an

effective exchange rate or currency basket stabilizing the relative price

  fluctuate. In the small—country case, these simplify to total

  trade weights:


        w —   z a + z L3.

  These are Black's (1976) preferred weights.


       The weighting expressions in equations (7), (8), and (12) give

  alternative weights for currency baskets, or definitions of real effective

  exchange rates, for alternative targets of exchange—rate policy. The

 Important points here are that, (a) as in our earlier work [B—K (1980,1981)],

 each weighting system defines an effective exhcnage :ate that corresponds

 to a chosen target, but (b) the weights here,as opposed to the model in

 B—K (1980, 1980),are used to define an index across real exchange rates.

 Even though the analysis is a straightforward extension of the earlier model

• it is an important extension in that it permits us to consider the cases of

 PPP and of independent variations in prices and exchange rates as extreme

 cases of one general framework. Next we turn to some comments on the

 application of weighting schemes in the exercise of exchange—rate policy.




                                                                                 r

3.   Issues in calculating optimal weights.

     The weighting schemes of section 2 use trade weights ct and

and they are aggregated to the point where each country has a single

import—competing price disturbance q1 and all countries have the same

elasticity of demand d for one export good. Two kinds of questions

have been raised in considering how to apply any of these schemes.

One is whether trade weights or currency weights are appropriate. The

second is how to disaggregate, in general across commodities. Two ex-

amples of the disaggregation question are whether to use trade or current

account weights, and how to adjust for the commodity composition of ex-

ports across, e.g., agriculture, mining, manufacturing. In this section

we will consider these two kinds of questions in turt..


     Trade shares vs currency shares.

     Up to this point, we have noted the small—country special case in

passing. But we have left for separate discussion a problem that general—

ly appears as one of two seemingly different questions. These are as

follows: (1) How should trade weights be modified if trade is denominated

in a world currency? For example, Zambia's copper exports are stated in

sterling as determined on the London metal exchange. (2) Should we not

use shares of currency denomInation in the     and B weights, rather than

direction of trade? The first question was first raised at a seminar at

Columbia University, April 19, 1978. The second was raised in Lipschitz (1979)

 and again in discussions at the Finance Ministry in New Delhi, and the Monetary

 Authority of Singapore, January 9 and 28, 1980. Here we show that these questions

 are essentially the same, that they are really the question of the smallness of thu
                                                                      14.



countries, and that they are already answered in the formulation of the

real exchange rate in the weighting schemes of section 2.

     Consider first the question of using currency area weights in-

stead of trade weights in the calculations. Suppose a subset R of the

third countries denominate their trade with the home (zero) country in

dollars, as an example. Then it seems intuitively plausible to argue

that those countries should be included In a "dollar area," and that

their weights should be combined with that of the U.S. in calculations.

This is not quite correct, though.

     The true importance 3f the fact (if, indeed, it is a fact) that a

country h prices Its trade in dollars is the implicit assumption that

country h's prices move with U.S. prices, adjusted for the movements in

h's dollar exchange rate, 3h• This is the asthimption that h is a small country

relative to the United States. In this case the real exchange rate of h

vis—a—vis the U.S. is constant, and the term h +           —   in   the weighting

calculations is zero.


     The implications of this for the use of the weighting schemes can be

seen by concentrating again on the example of the export price index for

country zero from Appendix 1:




    (13) 'o —      + k(r +      —         + kZa1(J +   —
                                    p0)


     Suppose the U.S. dollar is chosen as numeraire, so N is the U.S. Con—

aider first a case in which all other country's prices are independent
                                                                       15,

of the U.S. Then a          impulse will raise p, by



                                 =
       xO kq + kEa1(_q)


The summation in the third term      of   (13) runs across all N countries. Thus

the q impulse is entered with a weight of unity in the term giving the real

exchange rate of the home country against the numeraire, but it is taken out

              N—i
with a weight E a1 by the term giving movement in third—country real exchange
                  1
rates. Thus the weighting scheme itself gives a lone           impulse a weight of


aN.
       Now consider a case in which some subset of H countries

(1,..,h,..,H) have prices that move with the dollar, so that for each of

these the real exchange rate vis—a—vis the dollar is constant. This is the

case in which the h countries are small relative to the U.S., and one

would wish to integrate them into a dollar currency area. Now the effect

of a        impulse on      is given by



                      N—i                      H
              kq + k Z a1() = k(aN         +
        x       N
                      H+1                      1




       Thus the aggregation of countries that are truly in a currency area

in the sense that their real exchange rates are constant vis—a—vis each
                                                                        16.

other is accomplished by the weighting index. If countries price their

trade in the same currency, but their prices move independently, they

will not and should not be aggregated. But if       their   prices move together,

they   automatically will be.
        The problem of a country which is selling a commodity priced in a
nuineraire on the world market is essentially the same. If copper trades
at   one world price, then all the relevant q1 for    a copper exporter will
move together, and be aggregated by the indexes into one world market.

At this level, the appropriate aggregation is again automatically achieved by

the index. The real problem for a commodity exporter will come with com-

modity disaggregation within the importing countries. This takes us to

the disaggregation question.

       Levels of disaggregation.


        While the indexes of equations (A.lO) —   (A.13) will perform the aggreatinn
of the world market for a single—commodity exporter, they do not take in-

to account the probability that in each country i, the demand price for

the commodity moves somewhat independently of the average import—competing

price. This example raises one question of disaggregation. The formulas

in equations (A.1O) —   (A.13),    and the subsequent weighting schemes, treat

each country i as importing a single good with demand elasticity d •          To
                                                                  x
implement the weighting schemes ideally, one would want to use for
q the internal demand      prices   in country I for the particular exports

and imports of the home country zero, and apply to them the appropriate

disaggregated elasticity and share parameters. Thus for a country ex-

porting only copper, one would ideally use movements in copper prices in

the various I countries, combined with estimates of elasticities relevant




                                                                                       I.
                                                                              17.




for copper, and the exporter's trade shares. This would then give the

correct index for that country's p ,     etc.,   and the proper calculation

of weights.

     Another major example of the disaggregation issue is the choice be-

tween current account and trade shares for        and     .   The effective

weighting schemes of the IMF [see, for example Artus and Rhomberg (1973)1,

and the portfolio weights of Kouri and de Macedo (1978) and de Macedo

(1979) use current account shares.


        In general, we would expect the services components of the current

account to have different elasticities than the trade component. For

example, if migrant workers determine the value of thiir remittances in

terms   of   foreign exchange, k is effectively unity. If they fix the value

in terms of their home currency, k is effectively zero. Thus ideally, the

shares should be current account shares, and the elasticities should be

averages of the trade and services components. Consistency would suggest

not using trade elasticities with current account shares.

     The broad point here is that the formulas of section 2 are

highly aggregated, with elasticities implicitly given as weighted av-

erages of the relevant trade and services components. One can obtain a

first aggregate approximation for the weighting schemes by using trade

or current account shares       and    and the corresponding average elas-

ticities. But more precise calculation would require appropriate dis—

aggregation of both shares and elasticities.
                                                                                18.




    4. Adjustment of the real exchange rate and     choice   of optimal weights.

         The optimal weighting schemes of section 2 give alternative sets of

    weights for real exchange rates which have the following property: if the

    home country real exchange rate vis—a—vis the nutneraire follows the

    path of the real basket rate, effects of third—country fluctuations in

    real rates will not affect the chosen target. Thus if the nominal rate

    r is manipulated to maintain



         r+_P0=_zw1(J+q1_q)
    with the appropriately—chosen weights w, the target is insulated from

    movements in real rates (J + q —

         In   the case of the balance—of—trade weights, this movement in the

    real rate will maintain trade or current account balance, depending on

    whether the w1 include trade or current account weights. On the other

    hand the terms—of—trade weights and the weights stabilizing the ratio

    of prices of traded and non—traded goods            will   not in general

    meet a balance—of—payments target. If those weights are chosen, there

    will still remain the need for adjustment of the real rate relative to

    the basket to hold the balance of payments near its target. One way to

-   achieve this adjustment would be to adopt a crawling basket peg such as

               +    -
                        p0
                             -
                                 Iw(J +   -    +   F(B,R),


    where B Is the balance on current account or overall payments, and R is

    reserves. This is the real—rate equivalent of the basket crawl

    formula (4) in B—K (1981).




                                                                                      r

    The adjustment function F in equation (14) gives the speed at which

cators would include flows such as the current—account balance, or

such as reserves relative to a target level. These are represented by

B and R, respectively, in (14).    The optimal weighting of these indicators

is analyzed in Branson—de Macedo (1980).

     Since adjustment of the real effective rate, perhaps using a crawl
                                             balance, it would seem sensible

weighting schemes will then stabilize the chosen target around the trend

dictated by the necessary adjustment of the real effective rate.

5. Application to exchange—rate experience in Southern Europe.

     Three countries in Southern Europe, Greece, Portugal, and Spain,

have experimented with versions of basket pegs since exchange rates

began to float in the early 1970s. In this s'ection we briefly ex-

amine their experience, to see whether their choice of weights roughly

conforms to the analysis above. We begin with a brief description of

their experience. Next we discuss choice of targets for these countries,

and finally we examine the evidence.


Experience since 1971.

     Following the breakdown of the Bretton—Woods system of fixed parities,

Greece, Portugal, and Spain each sought to pursue a more flexible ex-

change rate policy. Given the fact that the major currencies exhibited

substantial fluctuations vis—a—vis each other, pegging the exchange rate

to any single one of them meant substantial nd continuous realignments

vis—a—vis the others. Since all three countries have geographically

diversified trade (see Table 2 below), this implied that each would ex-

perience analogous tnovemnts in the home—currency price of traded    cotrimod—


ities if not of the terms of trade.


     As early as the third quarter of 1971, Spain and Portugal abandoned

the dollar currency area and followed he Deutsche mark (DM) in its upward

trend against the dollar. This continued until the middle of 1975 when

both countries, hit by rising prices and appreciating effective real

exchange rates, started devaluing in nominal terms vis—a—vis both hard

currencies. The escudo's devaluation against the dollar has continued
                                                                              22.




    since; the devaluation against the DM halted around the end of 1979.

    The Spanish authorities, probably sensitive to the inflationary conse-

    quences of further nominal devaluations against as major a trading

    partner as Germany, reversed that trend at the third quarter of 1977

    and attempted to stabilize the rate around 36 !esetasfDN. This lasted

    approximately until the end of 1979.

         Greece followed the dollar in its downward movement vis—a—vis the

    other hard currencies for a much longer period than either Spain or

    Portugal. The rate was held at 30 drachina/dollar until the middle of

    1975 when a basket peg was adopted and the drachnia started devaluing

    vis—a—vis the basket. It is only towards the end of the decade, with

    rapid inflation of import prices and the CPI, that the rapid depreciation

    vis—a—vis the European currencies was slowed. This policy shift was also

    prompted by increased trade prospects with the European Community (EC)

    in light of the imminent entry   into   the EC, and the expected movement

    towards harmonization of monetary and exchange rate policies.

         The experience of the three countries during tte 1970's can be thus

    subdivided into three roughly comparable periods. In the first period,

    mid—1971 to mid—1975, Spain and Portugal maintained rough parities
-
    vis—a—vis the Deutsche mark and appreciated substantially vis—a—vis the

    dollar; in the case of Greece the opposite held true. In the second per-

    iod which lasted to 1977 III in the case of Spain, and    until   the end of

    1979 in the other two countries, all three countries experienced substan-

    tial effective nominal devaluations vis—a—vis all major trading partners.
                                                                         23.




Since that time, monetary authorities have attempted to maintain rough

parities with the European currencies.


Choice of targets for the currency basket.

     Currency baskets aimed at stabilizing three different policy targets

were discussed in section 2 above. The targets are the trade balance,

the terms of trade, and the ratio of the price of traded goods to non—traded

goods T'N Which target would be most appropriate for Greece, Portugal,

and Spain?

     In section 4, we argued that the effective real exchange rate can

be varied to meet a balance of trade target. This implies movement of

the home—currency real rate against the numeraire relative to the basket

real rate, as illustrated in equation (14). In Table 3 below, we see

that over the 1970s the effective real rate appreciated, on average, in

all three countries. In Table 4, we see that at least in the cases of

Portugal and Spain, there is evidence that the effective real rate was

responsive to an external balance target. Thus the choice of weights

for the currency basket itself comes down to terms—cit—trade vs

weights.

     Exchange—rate policy can affect the terms of trade only in countries

with non—zero net market power; (k —.   k)   in equation (8) must be non—zero.

In Branson—Katseli (1980) we estimated indexes of market power on the

export side and the import side for 101 countries. [See B—K (1980,

pp. 62—67)]. Greece, Portugal, and Spain have relatively low values

of the market power index, suggesting that the small—country assumption

may be a good approximation in these cases. Thus the terms—of—trade

weights in equation (8 )   are probably not appropriate.

    In Tables3 and 4 we show the results of regression estimation of

the weights in equation (14) in section 4 above. The dependent variable

                                                country's real exchange rate
is the quarterly percentage change in the

relative to the U.S. dollar, r + q5 — p0        .    The independent variables

                                     real exchange rates of the dollar a—
are the percentage changes in the

gainst the other major currencies, J.    + q — q         (ius); thus the signs

of the coefficients should be negative. The implicit U.S. weight is

one minus the absolute value of the sum of the estimated weights for

i/US; w = 1     1w .    In   Table 3 a constant term is included for the
       us           1
average movement of the real effective rate over the period; a negative

coefficient indicates real appreciation. In Table 4 we add the level

and rate of change of net foreign assets, F and F, as indicators of

external balance.

     In general, the equations for Portugal and Spain seem reasonable;

those for Greece are more difficult to interpret.          This is probably due to

the fact that Greece's currency basket was defined across nominal rather

than real exchange rates. As has been shown in Katseli (1981), in the

case where the basket is defined across nominal rates, the estimated weights

are roughly the same as those of Table 3 but the explanatory power of the

regression is markedly higher (R2 —     .28).       In Table 3, all the constants are

negative, indicating real appreciation relative to the basket.          In Table 4,

 the level of net foreign assets has a significant negative coefficient for

Spain, and both F and F seem to play a role in Portugal.

     The patterns of coefficients giving currency weights permit us to draw

 several tentative but interesting conclusions

     1. The estimated weights seem reasonable as a description of

 actual experience. They do not, however, correspond particularly closely

 even to our T'N weights.

     2. Over the whole period of the l970s the weight of the dollar in

 the basket was markedly higher in the case of Greece than in either

 Portugal or Spain. This Is hard to explain in terms of the Greek trade

 shares (Table 2) but can be understood in light of the inertia of the

 early period and preoccupation of the Greek authorities with balance of

 payments considerations.

       .   The weight of the Deutsche, mark is highest in
                                                          the case of
 Portugal (.63). Here again the explanation is
                                                   probably historical rela-
 tionships and possibly a domestic inflation
                                               target. Maintaining a re-
latively stable rather than declining
                                         home—currency value of emigrant
remittances might also be an important aspect of that choice.

      4. In all three cases the share of the Italian lira
                                                              is quite high.
This probably reflects the preoccupation with competitive export posi-

tions in third markets.                                 p



      5.   For all countries there was a nominal devaluation and real

appreciation of their currency relative to the basket. The nominal de-

valuation was strongest in Portugal (8   percent   on an annual basis) com-

pared to Greece (approximately 4 percent) and Spain (less than one percent). [Katselj

(1981)]. On the other hand, the real appreciation vis—a—vis the basket

was strongest in the case of Spain (around 4 percent).
                                                                                      30.




                 6. Inclusion of the current account balance and the level of foreign

         assets as potential determinants of the adjustment vis—a—vis the basket

         seem to improve both the Spanish and Portuguese results. This is esp-

         ecially true for the stock of foreign assets, which proves to be an im—
    -



         portant    determinant of the authorities' reaction to third—country exchange

         rate movements. Inclusion of these two variables seems to make little

         difference in the case of Greece.



                These results suggest a general pattern: confronted with inflation-

        ary pressures in the mid 1970's from both domestic and foreign origins,
•



        the monetary authorities in all three countries attempted to safeguard

        .their competitive position internationally through a process of nominal

        effective devaluations. These policies produced only a relatively small

        real effective exchange rate appreciation in the face of domestic infla-

        tion rates which at least in Spain and Portugal exceeded 20 percent by

        1977.


                Thus by the end of the 1970s these countries found themselves caught

        in the classic dilemma associated with exchange—rate policy, namely the

        conflict between balance—of—trade and domestic inflation targets. The

        econometric evidence,however sparse, seems to suggest that in small open

        economies the effects of exchange rate movements on the price ratio of

        traded to non—traded goods is higher than the effect on the terms of

        trade. The experience of these countries in the l970s and the switch in

        policies in the early 1980s seem to substantiate that claim.
                                                                      31.




Appendix 1: A log—linear trade model with real exchange rates.



    In this section a simple partial—equilibrium model is developed that

.provides the framework for the choice of weights for currency baskets or

effective exchange rates. The model is essentially the same as that

developed in Branson—Katseli (B—K, 1981), section IV. There independence

of movements in exchange—rates and price levels was implicitly assumed.

Here the model is developed in terms of real exchange rates. It is a log—

linear supply—and—demand model for exports and imports which Includes the

exchange rate as the translator between home and foreign prices. We begin

with the simple two—country version, and then disaggregate to many countries

and a numeraire.

    Movements in aggregate trade prices and quantities.

    Let us begin by concentrating on the export side. Export supply prices

are assumed to be stated in home currency units p, while foreign import

demand prices are given in foreign exchange units q. The supply function

is written as


(A.l)    lnp lnp +      11nX


Here p Is a shift parameter representing the domestic cost of production
of exportables and s is the price elasticity of export supply. We assume

that p is also the home—currency cost of production of import substitutes

and non—tradëables. Equation (A.1) gives export supply X as a function

of the relative home—currency supply price p/p. The demand function

giving the foreign currency price of exports is
                                                                                                      32.




(A.2)             lnq ].nq + d'lnX.

Rere q is a shift parameter representing the domestic cost of production

of import—competing goods in the foreign country, and export demand depends
                                                                                                      of
on the relative price                           Again, we assume that q is also the cost
production of exports in the foreign country.                             For the analysis in a case

where domestic costs of production in the various sectors move differently,

    see B—K (1981). The exchange rate e links                             and q:


    (A.3)         p — eqs.
    Substitution of (A,3) -into (A.2) for q and total differentiation yields

    the expressions for percentage changes in export prices and quantities:


    (A.4)
                        —   k   (e + q) + (1 —           k);,
    (A.5)


    where k d/(d —                      0   <   k   <    1.     As noted in B—K (1980, 1981), k is

    an index of market power on the export side. In the small—country case

    dx +-oandk+1.
        The analogous model on the import side yields the equations for per—

    centage changes in import prices and quantities:


     (A.6)         'm
                        —   k'(e     + q) + (1 —         k');,
-
     (A.7)         M —               + q —
                            k'dm(e

    where    k'                  —
                                     d1);
                                            0 <     k'   <    1.   Again, k' is an index of market

    power on the import side; for a small country where s +                             , k'   + 1.
                                                                                33.




      DisaggregatiOn to many countries.

      To disaggregate the model, we consider a world of N + 1 countries,

O,...,N. Country zero is the home country, whose exchange—rate policy we

are analyzing. Country N is the numeraire, arbitrarily chosen. Countries

j (   — L,...,j,...,N    —   1) are the other (non—home, non-numeraire) countries
in the system. The index i runs        across   all countries other than the home

country, including the numeraire, thus i —        j,   N.

      The home—country price index p in equation (1) is now p0. The import—

competing price in country i's demand function is q           and the export—

supply price of country i is             The bilateral exchange rate of the home

country 0 against country i is            in units of currency zero per unit of

currency i. This can be decomposed into the home country price of the

numeraire r, and the numeraire price of the currency i, J:


(A.8)           Ti Jr.
      For gxposition, we focus on disaggregation of movements in the export

price p0; disaggregation of X0, p0, and M0 follow easily by analogy.

With export weights given by ci, e and q in the p equation

(A.4) are the aggregates

          N

           1.




          Na
          l
      q — Za1q


The disaggregated expression for p is now
                                                                            34.

                                                           k)p0.


This is precisely the same as equation (24) in B—K (1981), with slight

.changes in notation.    The analysis there proceeded in terms of nominal

exchange rates. Here we wish to continue in terms of movements in real

exchange rates.

    First, let us add and subtract the change in the numeraire's import—

competing price        in the second term of (A.9):

Now, remembering that Zc&           1, we can re—group the terms on the right—

hand side into movements in real exchange rates:




(A.lO)          PxO P0 + k(r + 'N —          + kEcx(J + q —


The first term on the RUS      of   (A.10) is the change in the domestic (zero—

country) export supply price due to changes in domestic cost conditions.

The second term is the change in the home—country real exchange rate against

the numeraire, using export prices. The third term sums the change in the

numeraire's real exchange rate against all countries other than the home

country, including the numeraire (country N), again using demand prices

for exports of the zero country.

     Several properties of (A.lO) for               are worth noting:
                                                                                       35.




    1. If the home country is small, k — 1 and p0 drops Out of

         (A.lO); p depends only on world prices and exchange rates.

    2. An increase in the demand price                     in any one of the j (non—

         numeraire, non—home) countries clearly raise p by                     —

         proportional to j's share in home—country exports. The increase

         in             also raises the numeraire's real exchange rate vis—a—vis j.
               qj
    3. An increase in the demand price in the nuineraire country alone

         raises                         =         symmetrically to all the other countries.
                               by

         This results from the summation of the third term in (A.l0) across

         all i              l,...,N. Thus the formulation in (A.l0) is completely

         symmetric across all non—home countries, with the numeraire chosen

         arbitrarily.

    The disaggregation of the expressions for X, p and H, and their state-

ment in terms of real exchange rates, follow analogously to the develop-

ment from equation (A.4) for                   to (A.l0) for xO The disaggregated

version of (A.5) for the change in exports is

country's real exchange rate against the numeraire, and the term

(J + q —            is   the real exchange rate of the numeraire against country I

(including the numeraire), using the prices relevant for country zero's

imports.

     Equations (A.l0) —      (A.13) give the expressions for changes in export
and import prices and quantities in terms of movements in home prices and

real exchange rates.
