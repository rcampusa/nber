              THE INTERGENERATIONAL MOBILITY OF IMMIGRANTS




                                        ABSTRACT


       This paper analyzes the intergenerational mobility of immigrants. Using the

1940-1970 Censuses, the study reveals an important link between the earnings of immigrants

and the earnings of their American-born children. Although there is some regression towards

the mean, the earnings of second-generation Americans are strongly affected by variables

describing economic conditions in the source countries of their parents. Current immigration

policy, therefore, determines not only how immigrants perform in the labor market, but also
determines tomorrow's differences in the labor market experiences of American-born ethnic

groups.

I. Introduction

    In 1970, 4.8 percent of the population was foreign-born, and 11.8

percent was native-born with foreign parentage (U.S. Bureau of the Census,

1975, p. 116). The economic impact of immigration depends both on how

immigrants adapt to the labor market and on the adjustment process

experienced by their offspring. The traditional perception of this inter-

generational adjustment is vividly depicted by the melting pot metaphor:

over the course of two or three generations, immigrants are transformed from

a collection of diverse national origin groups into a homogeneous native

population.1 Beginning with Glazer and Moynihan (1963), modern sociological

research argues that this metaphor does not correctly portray the ethnic

experience in the United States. These studies instead suggest that many of

the cultural and economic differences among immigrant groups are transmitted

to their children, so that the heterogeneity found among today's immigrants

becomes the heterogeneity found among tomorrow's ethnic groups.

    In contrast to the voluminous literature analyzing the economic impact

of immigrants, little is known about the labor market performance of their

American-born children.2 The studies of Carliner (1980) and Chiswick (1977)

compare the earnings of inunigrants with those of second- and third-

generation Americans using the 1970 Census cross-section. Both studies find

that the earnings of second-generation workers are larger than those of the

first and third generations. Although this is an interesting and

provocative fact, existing research ignores the relationship between the

national origin differentials found among immigrants and the differences
                                            2



found among the ethnic groups that make up subsequent generations.

    Despite the relative disinterest in the economic mobility experienced by

immigrant households, a growing literature attempts to model inter-

generational mobility in the context of dynastic households that care about

the welfare of their children, and that transfer funds to and make human

capital investments in their offspring (Becker, 1981; Becker and Tomes,

1956; Becker and Barro, 1988), In addition, a number of empirical studies

reveal that the relationship between the earnings of fathers and sons

exhibits substantial regression towards the mean across generations.4

       This paper analyzes the intergenerational mobility experienced by

immigrants    in the context of an economic model of immigration. As long as
skills are partly transferable across generations, the type of selection
that    characterizes the   skill   composition of the immigrant flow will be
reflected in their children. Thus the source-country        characteristics that

determine    national-origin wage differentials (Borjas 1987) should also play
a role in determining the wages of second-generation ethnic Americans.

       The empirical analysis uses the Public Use Samples of the decennial

Censuses available between 1940 and 1970. The evidence indicates that

although there is some regression towards the mean, the average earnings of

a second-generation ethnic group are strongly influenced by the earnings of

the corresponding first-generation national origin group. In addition, the

data are consistent with the theoretical implication that source country

characteristics are an important determinant of the earnings of both first-

and second-generation Americans.

II. Framework

    First-generation workers reside in country x and consider migrating to

country y (for concreteness, the United States). The log-income

distributions facing these workers in the two countries are given by:




          log w1 —          + 17V1                                 (1)




          log w1 —          +                                      (2)
                     TMyl       v1


where w and w are the incomes in the source country and in the United
       xl     yl
States, respectively. The parameter p1 is the population mean of the

income distribution in the source country for the first generation, while

the parameter     is the mean income faced by this generation in the United

States if all persons in the source country choose to migrate. Note that,

in general, the parameter yl will differ from the mean income of U.S.

natives. Moreover, because of the dispersion in skills among national

origin groups, the parameter p1 will also differ among these groups. The

continuous random variable v1 measures individual-specific deviations from

mean incomes in the first generation and has a finite variance.

    The functional form in (1) and (2) assumes that v1 determines individual

earnings in each of the two countries-, up to a factor of proportionality.

This is equivalent to assuming that earnings are perfectly correlated across

the two countries. The factor-loading parameter vj can be interpreted as the

rate of return to skills in the source country (relative to that in the

United States), or alternatively as the ratio of the standard deviation in
                                                       4


earnings between the source country and the United States.

    Assume migration costs (C) are a constant fraction of the individual's

earnings in the source country (i.e., r —                                   If the first generation's
                                                             C/w1).
objective is to maximize their own income1 the index function guiding the

immigration decision is given by:



       I —
              log(w1/(w1+C))                 yl -           - ir)   + (1 -                    (3)


Immigration occurs if I > 0. Define the immigrant flow to be positively

selected when it has above-average skills (E(v1 I                       I    > 0) > 0), and

negatively selected when it has below-average skills [E(v1 I                          I   > 0) C 01.

Equation (3) implies that the immigrant flow is positively selected when i C

1, and negatively selected when q > 1. Skilled workers choose to reside in

countries that offer relatively higher payoffs for their skills.5

    Skills are transmitted from generation t-l to generation t (t > I)

according to the Markov equations:



          vxt —        a
                           xt
                                +6v
                                  x x,t-l
                                          +€ xt                                               (4)




          v
              yt
                   —   a        +5v            +c                                             (5)
                           yt         yy,t-l      yt


where v1 gives the skill variable for persons in the th generation in

country j, and the parameters S and S                      lie between zero and one. The

random variables c              and         have zero means and finite variances, are
                       xt              yt
distributed independently of skills, and are uncorrelated over time.

    The parameters describing the extent to which skills are transmitted
                                             5



across generations        and         may differ across countries, and these

differences capture the extent to which societies are "open" or "closed."

The United States, for instance, is usually considered to be an open

society. The parameter             would be expected to be small, and there would be

substantial regression towards the mean in earnings across generations.

    Equations (4) and (5) imply that a self-selected migration flow in the

first generation alters the skill composition of the populations in both the

United States and the source country for many subsequent generations.

National origin groups that do well in the U.S. labor market in the first

generation will tend to do well in subsequent generations. Similarly, the

offspring of national origin groups that do poorly will tend to do poorly.

    This result is derived from a sim1e model where the first-generation is

selfish in the sense that it does not consider the economic impact of its

migration decision on future generations. Suppose instead that parents care

about the utility of their children.6 In the presence of perfect capital

markets, the separation theorem implies that a necessary condition for

maximizing dynastic utility is that the first generation's migration

decision also maximizes "dynastic income," the present value of the income

stream accumulated by the dynasty.

    First-generation workers know that the earnings generation process for

the th generation is described by the earnings distributions:




          log        —         ÷                                          (6)
                         Mxt


          log Wyt —
                         yt + Vyt
                                                     6



where p        and p        measure the mean incomes that will be observed in the
          xt           yt
generation; and t           is   the relative price of skills in the source country,

assumed constant across generations. Mean incomes                               and     vary across

generations because the assimilation process could affect future earnings

opportunities in the United States for subsequent generations, or because of

international differences in rates of economic growth.

    Maximization of dynastic utility re4uires that individuals in the first

generation compare dynastic incomes across the two countries. because the

incomes of future generations depend on the stochastic shocks in the skill

transmission process (                and e), which are not observed by the economic

agents in the first generation, the immigration decision for risk-neutral

workers is guided by the comparison of expected incomes. Workers in the

first generation choose whichever income stream has the highest expected

value, net of migration costs. As a first-order approximation, workers

migrate to the United States when:



                                 q(l. +   r   - 6
                       1 -                               > 8                             (8)
                                  (1 +    r   -     v1



where r is the (generational) rate of discount, and 8 is a constant.

    Consider initially the case where 6 —                  &       •   so that the twocountries
                                      x                        y
exhibit the same extent of regression towards the mean in earnings.

Equation (8) indicates that positive selection will be observed when C l

and that negative selection will be observed otherwise. These are precisely

the implications of the simpler one-generation model.

    Suppose now that & s 6. To understand the role played by differences
                                       7



in the skills transmission parameter, consider the case where skills are

equally rewarded in the two countries (i.e.,    — 1).    Equation (8) indicates

that highly skilled workers will choose to reside in the country with the

highest 6, where their skills are easily transferable to their children. In

contrast, unskilled workers have little to lose by moving to a country where

skills are not easily transferable to their children, and where the earnings

opportunities of future generations are basically determined by random

shocks from the   distribution. Thus the United States is likely to attract

highly-skilled workers from countries that have relatively more open

economies and unskilled workers from closed economies.

    There is a widespread perception that there is more intergenerational.

mobility in the United States than in most other countries. This suggests

that economic conditions in the United States are particularly appealing for

unskilled workers in the source 'countries, even in the absence of any

international differences in the rate of return to skills. Because of the

scarcity of data, however, this interesting proposition cannot be

systematically tested. Moreover, the available (though limited) evidence

suggests that "the overall pattern of social mobility appears to be much the

same in the industrial societies of various Western countries," including

the United States (Lipset and Bendix, 1959, p.l3).

    In view of this finding, accounting for the altruistic behavior of

parents does not alter the key insight provided by the simpler one-

generation model. The relative rate of return to skills in the source

country determines the type of selection that characterizes both the

immigrant population     their   ethnic offspring, Of course, the practical

importance of this insight depends on the value of the parameter 6y' As
                                       S



will be seen in the empirical work below, however, the degree of

 transmission in the United States is sufficiently strong so that the

earnings determination process for second-generation Americans greatly

resembles that experienced by the first.



III. Data and Descriptive Analysis

    The empirical analysis uses the Public Use Samples of the four decennial

censuses available between 1940 and 1970. Each of these censuses (unlike

post-1970 censuses) has the important feature that they report the

birthplace of the respondent, as well as the birthplace of the respondent's

parents. The decennial Censuses for 1940, 1950, and 1960 are a 1/100 sample

of the population, while the 1970   Census   is a 2/100 sample.7

    The study is restricced to men aged 25-64 in each of the Censuses, who

worked in the civilian sector in the year prior to the Census, were not

enrolled in school, and were not self-employed.5 These data allow the

precise identification of two generations of Americans: the first

generation, composed of the sample of individuals born in a foreign-country;

and the second generation, given by the sample of persons who were born in

the United States, but had at least one parent born in a foreign country.

The generation of the remaining individuals, who had both parents born in

the United States, cannot be determined exactly, but for simplicity they

will be denoted as "third-generation" Americans. Throughout the analysis,

the population of third-generation Americans includes all natives with

American-born parents, regardless of racial or ethnic origin.

    The top panel of Table I reports the average (log) wage rates for first-

and second.generation Americans in each of the Censuses. These data are

differenced from the average values observed in the sample of third-

generation workers. The table also reports the summary   statistics    for a

number of immigrant cohorts. The 1940 and 1960 Censuses permit the

identification of two waves: those who arrived in the five-year period

prior to the survey, and those who have been in the U.S. longer than five

years.9 The 1970 Census permits the identification of additional waves.

    The data reveal the well-known decline in earnings (relative to third-

generation Americans) among successive immigrant cohorts (Borjas. 1985). In

1940, the typical immigrant who has been in the U.S.   fewer   than five years

earned 1.6 percent more than a third-generation American. This slight wage

advantage declines to -9.1 percent in 1960 and to -13.2 percent in 1970.

    Each of the Census cross-sections indicates that the second generation

has higher earnings than the first and than the third. In 1970. second-

generation workers earned 11 percent more than the first, and 3 percent more

than the third. As Carliner (1980) and Chiswick (1977) note, it seems that

second-generation Americans earn more than both their parents and their

children. This conclusion, however, is premature. In any Census cross-

section, the family ties among the three generations identifiable in the

data are tenuous. At the time of the survey, many members of the first-

generation have just arrived in the United States and have no native

descendants yet employed in the U.S. labor market, Second-generation

Americans of working age can only be descendants of immigrants who have been

in the country for at least two or three decades. Therefore, as long as

cohort differences among first-generation workers are important, and as long

as these differences are partially transmitted to their children, the

comparison of first- and second-generation earnings in a cross-section
                                       10


provides   a misleading portrait of intergenerational mobility.

    Similarly, the persons who can be identified as members of the "third-

generation" are a motley collection of various ethnic groups whose presence

in the United States may date 30 or 40 years, or more than 100 or 200 years.

It is also unlikely that these so-called third-generation workers are direct

descendants of the immigrants enumerated in the Census cross-section. After

all, this would require that working-age immigrants have American-born

grandchildren who are also of working age. Obviously, because of these data

problems, it is difficult to infer anything about the intergenerational

mobility experienced by the third-generation in the United States.

    The Census data, however, do allow the study of economic mobility

between the first and second generations. These comparisons, however, must

be designed so as to ensure that the immigrants are the parents of the

second-generation Americans identified in the Census. A number of

alternative methodologies are available. For example, in any single Census

cross-section, immigrants who have been in the United States for a

sufficiently long period of time (and hence can have American-born children

of working age) can be compared to second-generation workers.

    The 1940, 1960, and 1970 Censuses permit the contrast of the earnings of

second-generation workers with those of immigrants who have been in the U.S.

longer than five years. Although this is a crude method of ensuring

familial links across generations, the earnings advantage of second-

generation workers over their "parents" declines substantially (to about 3-6

percent) in the 1960 and 1970 Censuses after this correction is made.

    A similar result can be drawn from intercensal comparisons of first- and

second-generation workers. These comparisons increase the likelihood that
                                         11


the two    generations   are linked through family ties. The data in Table I

indicate that first-generation workers present in the 1940 Census earn about

lB percent more than third-generation workers, while first-generation

workers in the 1950 Census earn about 11 percent more than third-generation

workers,    The data also show that the children of these immigrants, namely
the second-generation workers in the 1960 or 1970 Census, earn only about 15
to   17 percent more than the third generation. There is only a slight

improvement, and perhaps even a decline, in the relative earnings of the

second-generation as compared to the firstj°

     The bottom panel of Table I continues the descriptive analysis by

presenting the relative wage differentials after controlling for differences

in observable demographic characteristics, including education, age, marital

status, and metropolitan residence.11 The (log) wage regressions are

estimated separately for each generation in each Census. The predicted wage

of the various generations is calculated using the means of the demographic

variables observed in the sample of immigrants. The adjusted differentials

indicate that there is little improvement in relative earnings between the

first and second generations. In fact, the immigrant population in 1940 has

higher adjusted earnings than comparable second-generation workers in 1960

or 1970. The data thus hint at the possibility of some regression towards

the mean between the first and second generations.

     The intercensal linkage between parents and children can be further

improved by focusing on workers in specific age groups. For example, the

children of immigrants aged 25-44 in 1940 are likely to be relatively young

in 1970, while the children of immigrants aged 45-64 in 1940 are likely to

be relatively older in 1970.12 Table 2 presents both unadjusted and

adjusted wage differentials among the various generations for groups aged

25-44 and 45-64 in 1940 and 1970. The (log) wage of young immigrants in

1940 (relative to young third-generation workers) is .20, while the relative

wage of their children in 1970 (many of whom would be aged 25-44 in 1970) is

.16. Similarly, older immigrants in 1940 earned about 12.8 percent more

than older third-generation workers, while their children earned about 14

percent more than older-third generation workers in 1970. Therefore,

refining the data so as to provide a better linkage between parents and

children across Censuses does not alter the implication of the descriptive

analysis. There is little increase (and there may well be a slight decline)

in relative wages between the first and second generations.



IV. National Origin and Jncenenerationaj Mobility

    Studies of immigrant labor market performance have found substantial

dispersion in relative earnings among national origin groups (Borjas. 1987).

These skill differentials among national origin groups are likely to be

partially transmitted to their ethnic offspring. Table 3 begins the

analysis by reporting the earnings of first- and second-generation workers

(relative to the earnings of third-generation Americans) for a large number

of national origin groups in the 1940-1970 period. The ethnicity of second-

generation Americans is determined from the father's country of birth

(unless only the mother is foreign-born, in which case it is determined from

the mother's country of birth)J3

    The source countries listed in the table are the ones which contain

sufficient observations of both first- and second-generation Americans in

the data. In each Census, the analysis is restricted to the national origin

groups which contain at least 25 observations in both the first- and second-

generation samples. In the 1940 Census, this sample restriction leads to 23

source countries (located mostly in Europe) which account for 97 percent of

the immigrant population. The selected countries listed in the table,

therefore, almost exhaust the national origin groups that could be used to

analyze the intergenerational mobility of immigrants.

    Table 3 reveals substantial dispersion among ethnic groups in the

earnings of second-generation Americans. In 1970, for instance, second-

generation Americans of British ancestry earned about 20.8 percent more than

third-generation Americans, while second-generation Canadians earned 11.4

percent more, and second-generation Mexicans earned 16.1 percent less.

    To assess the extent of intergenerational mobility, it is useful to

contrast the (relative) earnings of immigrants in 1940 with the (relative)

earnings of second-generation Americans in 1970. The strong relationship

7.0   percent   increase in earnings potential across generations that is common

to all national origin groups. One plausible reason for this upward "shift"

in the earnings profile is that second-generation Americans are not only

better educated, but also go through the American educational system, which

employers presumably value more than the schooling system of other

countries. In addition, second-generation Americans are more likely to be

proficient in English, better informed about opportunities in the U.S. labor

market, and less tied to old neighborhoods and ethnic enclaves. It is not

surprising, therefore, to find that second-generation Americans experience a

common improvement in their earnings opportunities.

      Second, there is some regression towards the mean across generations,

This regression towards the mean, however, is not sufficient for national

origin to become a trivial determinant of the earnings of second-generation

Americans. In particular, the estimate of the coefficient 6 in equation (9)

is .45. This magnitude implies that even after three generations, the

earnings of third-generation ethnic groups depend on the earnings of their

immigrant grandparents. Finally, the earnings of first-generation national

origin groups explain a large fraction of the variance in the earnings of

second-generation ethnic groups (the R2 is .69).15

      A potential problem with the analysis is that the data contain an

important outlier, Mexico. Both Mexican immigrants and their children

perform very poorly in the United States. This single observation could, in

principle, be driving many of the results. Row 2 of Table 4 reestimates the

regression after omitting the Mexican national origin group. Although the

estimated transmission coefficient declines somewhat (to .36), it is

apparent that this single observation is not responsible for the link
                                     IS


between the earnings of first- and second-generation Americans.

    Additional problems arise because the independent variable, the relative

wage of immigrants, may be improperly defined. In particular, the result

that all national origin groups experience a common increase in earnings

across generations is obtained from regressions which do not account for the

assimilation process experienced by the first generation. It is possible

that if the second-generation wage were related to the wage of fully

assimilated immigrants, the improvement across generations would disappear.

    This measurement problem, however, is unlikely to be the source of the

positive intercept in the regressions. After all, the regressions in Table

4 use the 1940 earnings of immigrants as the independent variable. Over 9.8

million immigrants entered the United States between 1911 and 1930, but only

half a million entered during the 1930s (U.S. Immigration and Naturalization

Service, 1989. p. 1). Therefore, almost all immigrants enumerated in the

1940 Census have been in the United States for more than 10 years, and are

likely to have experienced substantial assimilation.

    Moreover, using the 1970 Census1 it is possible to estimate the relative

wage of immigrants who arrived in the United States prior to 1950, and who

have been in the country more than 20 years. I calculated this statistic

for each of the 32 national origin groups listed in Table 3. The

relationship between the 1970 wage of second-generation workers and the 1970

wage of this early immigrant wave is given by:




   z — .0698  + .5144 z ,       — .511,    No. of Observations —   32,   (10)

where     is the wage of the th generation (relative to that of the third).

and the t-ratios are reported in parentheses. The regression coefficients

in (10) are remarkably similar to those presented in the first row of Table

6.   It seems unlikely, therefore, that problems in defining the immigrant

wage are responsible for the common improvement across generations.

     It is also   of interest to determine if   the same degree of inter-

generational   mobility   is observed between the earnings of demographically

comparable first- and second-generation Americans. The adjusted earnings

(relative to the earnings of third-generation workers) are predicted from

regressions estimated for each generation by Census and national origin

group (and are evaluated at the means of the variables observed in the

sample of immigrants). The regressors included education, age (and age

squared), marital status, and metropolitan residence.

     Row 3 of Table 4 reports the estimate of equation (9) using these

adjusted differentials. The earnings of immigrants are an important

determinant of the earnings of their children, even after controlling for

differences in demographic characteristics between the groups. The

estimated & declines to .27, and the constant term declines to 6.6 percent.

The variation in the adjusted earnings of first-generation national origin

groups explains over half of the variation in the adjusted earnings of

second-generation ethnic groups.

     Rows 4.7 of Table 4 report regression estimates where the (relative)

earnings of second-generation workers aged 25-44 (or 45-64) in 1970 are

related to the earnings of similarly-aged immigrants in 1940. As noted

earlier, this comparison provides a better link between parents and children

in intercensal comparisons. The regression estimates are quite similar to
                                            17



those reported above. For instance, in the wage regression for younger

workers (row 4) the intercept is 6.9 percent and the slope is .5, while in

the wage regression for older workers (row 5) the intercept is 9.2 percent

and the slope is .4.

      Finally, the remaining rows of Table 4 investigate if the earnings of

second-generation workers in 1970 are related to the earnings of any other

immigrant group, not just the group observed in 1940 which is presumably

composed of their parents. Consider the regression model:



             (1970) —   a+6   z1j(l94O) +   P z(197O) +                     (11)



Equation (II) generalizes (8) by relating the 1970 earnings of second-

generation workers to the earnings of their immigrant fathers, as well as to

the earnings of immigrants present in the United States in 1970.

      Rows 8-13 of Table 4 report the estimated parameters. The variable

measuring the 1970 earnings of immigrants is never significantly different

from zero, and has little effect on the remaining coefficients. Therefore,

the available data indicate that the earnings of second-generation workers

are much more heavily influenced by the earnings of their parents than by

the   earnings of current immigrants from the same source country. This
finding suggests that the intercensal comparisons used in this paper provide
a   useful methodology for analyzing economic mobility between first- and

second-generation Americans.

      In sum, the regressions reported in Table 4 suggest two substantive

conclusions. On average, second-generation Americans experience an increase

in economic well-being relative to their parents that is not experienced by
                                       18



the third generation. This intergenerational shift increases earnings by

about 7 percent between the first and second generations. In addition,

there is a strong link between the earnings of first and second generation

workers. The intergenerational transmission parameter is sufficiently high

so that the labor market performance of immigrants will have long-ten

effects on the U.S. economy. In effect, immigration policies that alter the

skill level of the immigrant flow will also partly determine the skill level

of their children and grandchildren.



V. Source Country Characteristics and Earnings

    The regressions reported in Table 4 do not directly test the

implications of the theoretical framework presented in Section II. A more

direct test pursues the insight that the same source country characteristics

determine the earnings of both immigrants and second-generation workers.

    To assess the importance of source country characteristics, the wages of

first- and of second-generation Americans (relative to the wage of third-

generation workers) are related to a number of country-specific variables,

including the country's (log) per capita CNP, the extent of income

inequality in the country's income distribution, a dummy variable indicating

if the country lists English as an official language, and the distance of

the source country from the United States.16 My measure of income

inequality in the source country is given by the ratio of income accruing to

the top 10 percent of the households to the income accruing to the bottom 20

percent of the households, A key prediction of the model is that immigrant

earnings are lower if the source country has relatively high payoffs to

skills. As long as skills are partially transmitted across generations, the
                                       19


income inequality variable should have a negative impact on the earnings of

both first- and second-generation workers.

      Regressions (1) and (2) of Table S show the impact of source country

characteristics on the wages of immigrants and their children. The adjusted

and unadjusted (relative) wages used in the regression are obtained from the

1970 Census.17 The "second-stage' regressions are then estimated using

generalized least squares. The data indicate that immigrant earnings are

higher if the group originates in a high-income country or in a country that

has English as an official language, and are lower if the group originates

in a country with substantial inequality in the income distribution (though

this effect is significant only in the regression that uses unadjusted
             18
earnings).

      Table S also documents that these source country characteristics
determine the earnings of second-generation ethnic groups in roughly the
same way. The children of immigrants earn more if their parents originated
in   high-CM? countries or in countries where English is an official language.

These effects, however, disappear once differences in demographic

characteristics are controlled for. More important, the income inequality

variable has the same qualitative impact on the earnings of first- and

second-generation Americans. In particular, second-generation workers whose

parents originated in countries with substantial income inequality, and were

therefore more likely to be negatively selected, have lower earnings than

other ethnic groups.

      The variables used as regressors in Table S measure relevant source-

country characteristics circa 1970. In principle, the per-capita income and

income inequality variables that determine the 1970 earnings of second-

generation workers are those chat guided the migration decision of their

parents, and not those observed in the source country in 1970. These data,

however, are not available for most source countries prior to World War II.

The regressions for second-generation workers1 however, were reestimated

using alternative measures1 such as the 1950 per-capita ON? in the source

country, with little change in the results. Moreover, as regression (3) of

Table S indicates, the results are unaffected when the equation for second-

generation workers is reestimated in the subsample of countries that did not

undergo a Communist revolution. The omission of Communist regimes from the

sample deletes the countries where the income distribution is likely to have

changed the most over the last few decades, and reduces the measurement

error in the income inequality variable.

    Finally, regression (4) of Table 5 reestimates the regression for the

second generation after including the relative income level of their parents

(in addition to the source country characteristics), The inclusion of

parental income significantly reduces the impact of both the ON? and the

income inequality variables. Source-country characteristics, therefore,

affect second-generation earnings mostly through their impact on the skill

level and earnings of immigrants, although this finding must be interpreted

with some caution because of the small number ef observations and the

multicollinearity among the variables. I should also note that this

conclusion is unchanged if the regressions (results not shown) are estimated

in the samples of first- and second-generation workers aged 25-44 or 45-64.

    The available data allow one additional test of the theoretical

framework. In particular, the theory implies that increases in the size of

the immigrant flow (due perhaps to low per-capita incomes or migration
                                           21



costs) dilute the intensity of the selection. In other words, if the

immigrant flow is positively selected, an increase in the size of the

immigrant flow should be associated with lower average U.S. earnings.

Conversely, if the immigrant flaw is negatively selected, an increase in the

size of the immigrant flaw should be associated with higher average U.S.

earnings.

    Consider the following regression model:




  log w —     +             + a2                                             (12)
                  a1                            + a3 °i + c,



where wi are the 1970 earnings of first- or second-generation workers

originating in country i;          is the fraction of the source country's

population that migrated to the United States; ris a dummy variable set to

unity if the source country has a more unequal income distribution than the

United States and zero otherwise; and a is the income inequality variable

used earlier. The theory implies that a1 > 0, a2 C 0. and a3 C 0.

    Table 6 presents the estimated earnings regressions for both first- and

second-generation workers. In analyzing the earnings of immigrants in 1970,

the variable p is defined as the ratio of the number of immigrants present

in the United States in 1970 to the 1970 source country's population.

Because the earnings of second-generation workers should mirror the

selection that characterized the migration of their parents, the regression

on the 1970 earnings of second-generation workers defines p as the ratio of

the number of immigrants present in the United States in 1960 to the 1940

source country's population.

    The inequality variable has a negative and significant effect on the

earnings of both first- and second-generation workers in this alternative

specification of the model (see regressions (1) and (2)]. The sign pattern

of a1 and a2, however, is only partly consistent with the theory. For

instance, the larger the immigrant flow from a country with an egalitarian

income distribution, the lower the earnings of both first- and second-

generation workers. Increasing p in countries with more income inequality

than the United States, however, does not have a significantly positive

effect on earnings.

    The additional    columns presented in Table 6 present alternative
specifications of    equation (12). As before, the results for the second

generation are very sensitive to the introduction of parental earnings. The

inclusion of the 1940 earnings of immigrants (which itself is only

marginally significant) greatly reduces the impact of the other variables in

the equation. In addition, expanding (12) to include other source country

characteristics (such as per-capita GNP and English language) generally

reveals that the source country characteristics are more important than the

interaction terms between income inequality and the size of the immigrant

flow (see regression (3) in Table 6).

    Overall, the results in Tables S and 6 suggest that ethnic wage

differentials can, to some extent, be understood in terms of the national

origin   differences documented in immigrant labor market performance. In
particular, the same source country characteristics that determine economic
success for first-generation Americans are important determinants of the
economic   success of their children.




                                                                               4.

VI. Summary

    This   paper presented an analysis of the intergenerational mobility of

immigrants. As long as skills are partly transmitted across generations,

the sane types of selection that characterize the immigrant flow are likely

to characterize their offspring. Hence the same source country

characteristics that are such crucial determinants of the labor market

experiences of immigrants will influence the experiences of their children.

In effect, current immigration policy determines tomorrow's differences in

the labor market experiences of U.S. -born ethnic groups.

    The empirical analysis used the four decennial Censuses available

between 1940 and 1970. These data allow the precise identification of two

generations of Americans, and indicate a significant relationship between

the earnings of the first and second generations. The data also suggest the

existence of regression towards the mean across generations. Nevertheless,

the analysis indicates that the wage of second-generation ethnic groups

crucially depends on the wage of the first-generation national origin group.

In addition, the evidence reveals that the earnings of second-generation

Americans are strongly affected by variables describing the economic

Opportunities available in the home of their ancestors.

    I. See Gordon (1964) for a presentation of the assimilation hypothesis,

    2. See, for example, Borjas (1985, 1987, l990a), Ghiswick (1978), Jasso

and Rosenzweig (1986).

    3. Coldberger (1989) presents a critical appraisal of these models.

Additional theoretical studies of intergenerational mobility include Conlisk

(1974), Loury (1981).

    4. See Atkinson (1981), Behrman and Taubman (1985), and Hauser, Sewell,

and Lutterman (1975)

    5. A number of generalizations of the model are possible. For

instance, it is easy to allow for variable migration costs. The key results

unaffected as long as the correlation between migration costs and earnings

is not "excessive." Second, alternative host countries can be introduced.

Individuals would then compare the gains from migrating to the United States

with the gains from migrating to other countries. Under some simplifying

assumptions, this model generates a sorting where there is a positive

correlation between the average skills of persons choosing a particular

country and the rate of returns to skills in that country. Finally, the

model can be expanded to allow for remigration. Such remigration arises

when potential migrants are uncertain about earnings opportunities in the

United States, and actual economic conditions here are inferior to those
                                     25


available in the source country. It can be shown that return migration

increases the intensity of the selection process. In particular, it is the

"marginal" immigrants who are most likely to return to the source country.

    6. Applications of the dynastic approach include Becker (1974) and

Becker and Barro (1989).

    7. The 1940 and 1950 Censuses report some of the key variables only

for the "sample line" respondents. In the 1970 Census, a 1/100 random

sample is used for the third generation. Otherwise, all available

observations are used in the study, subject to the qualification that they

satisfy the sample restrictions and that valid data are reported.

    S. This sample selection introduces biases into the analysis, but the

inclusion of non-workers or of the self-employed would require the use of

non-robust selectivity-correction techniques, or the adjustment of self-

employment incomes to make them comparable to salaried wage.

    9. These data are obtained from the respondent's answer to the

question of where he was residing five years prior to the Census. If the

respondent is foreign-born, and if he resided abroad at that time, I assume

that he migrated to the United States in the five-year period. These data

are not available for the 1950 Census.

    10. Note that these intercensal comparisons are contaminated by period

effects. The discussion implicitly assume that period effects (i.e., the

impact of business cycle fluctuations on the log wage) are the same for

first, second, and third generation workers, so that relative wages are

invariant over the cycle. Little is known, however, about the sensitivity

of the earnings of various ethnic groups to business cycle fluctuations.

    II. The typical immigrant enumerated in the 1940 Census obtained his
                                      26



schooling in a western European country, while the typical immigrant in 1970

probably obtained his schooling in Latin American or Asia. The content and

transferability of schooling obviously differs across countries. The

secular trend in the standardized wage differentials between second

generation workers and immigrants reported in Table 1. ignores differences in

schooling quality across immigrant cohorts.

    12. For instance, if most children are born while their parents are in

their 20s, men aged 45-64 in 1940 would have children aged 15-44 at that

time. By 1970, these children would be aged 45-74. In the empirical

analysis, I experimented with alter-native age groups, as well as with using

the limited year-of-migration data available in the 1940 Census to better

match parents and children. These additional specifications led to

essentially identical results.

    13.   It would be of interest to determine if the extent of

intergenerational mobility depends on whether both parents are foreign-born.

and if so, on whether both parents have the same national origin. I have

not pursued these questions in this paper.

    14. The regressions are estimated using generalized least squares to

account for the fact that the dependent variable is only an estimate of the

true variable. The correction had little impact on the estimated parameters

or standard errors.

    15. My estimate of & is at the higher end of the range usually reported

in the literature. Becker and Tomes (1986) survey the available estimates

and find that they range between .2 and .4. The higher value presented in

this paper is partly due to the aggregation within national origin groups

This aggregation probably reduces the amount of measurement error (Solon,
                                          27


1990). Moreover, even in the absence of measurement error, the estimates

from the aggregate regression and the typical individual-level regression

will differ. It is well known (Lewis, 1986, p.24) that the aggregate

regression estimates parameters from the micro regression model:



               — a +
                       1         + 2 (l) +              (Fl)


where Yjj(2) represents the earnings of second-generation person i in ethnic

group j; Yjj(l) represents the earnings of his father; and Yj(l) gives       the

mean earnings of the father's ethnic group. Hence the expected earnings of

people who have similarly-skilled parents, but who come from ethnic groups

with different average skills will differ. In effect, (Fl) provides a

particular specification for an ethnic-group fixed effect in earnings (see

Borjas. 1992, for a more detailed discussion of this model). Equation (9)

can be derived from (Fl) by aggregating within ethnic groups. The estimate

of 6 in Census data, therefore, is the sum of coefficients fi1+$2 (in an

appropriately weighted regression). Note that the predicted earnings of the

son of the average father in any ethnic group depends on the sum fi1+fi2.

    16.   These data, with the exception of the English language variable,

are discussed in detail in Borjas (1987). The English language variable is

obtained from Paxton (1988).

    17. The regressions were also estimated for other Census years, as well

as on a pooled data set. The 1970 estimates are representative of the set

of results obtained from these alternative specifications.

    18. The per-capita CNP     variable   plays two roles in the analysis.

First, it is likely that the skills of immigrants originating in higher per-
                                     28


capita GNP countries are more easily transferable to the U.S. labor market,

generating a positive correlation between immigrant earnings and per-capita

incomes in the source country. In addition, changes in both per-capita CNP

and distance alter the size of the immigrant flow and affect the intensity

of the selection process. This theoretical insight is discussed below.
