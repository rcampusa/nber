Local Academic Science Driving Organizational Change:
The Adoption of Biotechnology by Japanese Firms

NBER Working Paper No. 7248
July 1999
JEL No. O31, L11, 65

                                               ABSTRACT

          The local academic science base plays a dominant role in determining where and when
biotechnology is adopted by existing firms or -- much more frequently -- exploited by new entrants in the
U.S. In Japan this new dominant technology has almost exclusively been introduced through organizational
change in existing firms. We show that for the U.S. and global pharmaceutical business -- biotechnology's
most important application -- the performance enhancement associated with this organizational change is
necessary for incumbent firms to remain competitive and, ultimately, to survive. Japan's sharply higher
organizational change/new entry ratio compared to the U.S. during the biotech revolution is related to
Japan's relatively compact geography and institutional differences between the higher-education and
research funding systems, the venture-capital and IPO markets, cultural characteristics and incentive
systems which impact scientists' entrepreneurialism, and tort-liability exposures. Both local science base
and pre-existing economic activity explained where and when Japanese firms adopted biotechnology, with
the latter playing a somewhat larger role. De no v a entry was determined similarly as if entry and
organizational change are alternative ways of exploiting the scientific base with relative frequency reflecting
underlying institutions. While similar processes are at work in Japan and America, stars in Japan induce
entry or transformation of significantly fewer firms than in the U.S. and preexisting economic activity plays
a greater role. We find no such significant difference for entry of keiretsu-member and nonmember firms
within Japan.

                           The Adoption of Biotechnology by Japanese Firms

                               by Michael R. Darby and Lynne G. Zucker


        Geographically localized knowledge -- especially academic-derived knowledge -- plays a

major role in the geographic distribution of American industry.1 In the United States, professors are

often involved in start-up firms, but Japanese institutions discussed below largely precluded this role

during the biotechnological revolution in Japan. Even significant consulting relationships with incumbent

firms were difficult or illegal for Japanese professors. This paper shows that, nonetheless, the local

availability of the best academic scientists remains an important determinant of the speed with which

existing firms adopted the new dominant technology, although the magnitude of the effect is less than in

the U.S.

        Adoption of modern biotechnology requires profound organizational change in the R&D

function and is necessary for performance improvement or even survival in industries in which

competitors are adopting the new dominant technology. Biotechnology is best understood as an

"invention of a method of inventing" analogous to the development of hybrid-seed technology (Zvi

Griliches 1957). In most applications (genetic engineering), genes from one organism are inserted in

cells from another organism (of the same or different species) and the resulting new organism is grown

and reproduced. Thus, biotechnology can "merely" increase the speed and precision of traditional

cross-breeding or produce more novel life forms such as, for example, easy-to-grow bacteria which

produce human insulin.

        These invented organisms or their products may serve directly as inputs into the productive

process (as in pharmaceuticals, food, beer, and other fermentation-based products) or serve as R&D

tools (e.g., producing particular receptors as targets to identify promising drug candidates in

pharmaceutical discovery). For firms whose profits depend on discovery of new and better drugs,




                                                   1
seeds, yeasts, and the like, adoption of modern biotechnology often required a profound change in

power relations and relevant scientific base. For example, pre-biotech drug discovery was dominated

by chemists at both bench and managerial levels with biological sciences playing a subsidiary role at

best. Adoption of biotechnology at a major U.S. pharmaceutical firm entailed massive hiring of

outstanding biological scientists for both functions and forcing out over a short time those scientists --

whose prior discoveries were paying for the new hires -- who could not work effectively with the new

technology (Zucker and Darby 1997, pp. 435-436). Thus, adoption of biotechnology by an existing

firm simultaneously represented and required radical organizational change to obtain the performance

improvement which could provide ongoing competitive advantage in some industries or, in other

industries, avoid ongoing competitive disadvantage and ultimately exit.

        Section I demonstrates quantitatively the major performance-enhancing significance of the

radical organizational change inherent in adoption of biotechnology to incumbent-firm survival in the

U.S. and global pharmaceutical industry, the new technology's most important area of application to

date. Section II reports findings of extensive Japanese fieldwork which identified institutional differences

between Japan and the United States which have promoted Japanese organizational change relative to

replacement of existing firms by new firms in comparison to the U.S. In Section III, we show that the

timing and location of these organizational changes appear to be driven by the prior development of a

local science base -- measured by publications of outstanding "star" bioscientists in local universities --

as opposed to simply reflecting the prior distribution of economic activity. Section IV examines the

relative importance of local science base to organizational change in existing firms and entry of new firms

attempting to use the new technology to capture market share from the existing firms. Keiretsus have

played a significant role in the Japanese economy; we examine whether keiretsu membership promoted

or retarded this form of organizational change in Section V.           Section VI examines the relative

importance of local science base to organizational change in existing firms and entry of new firms in




                                                     2
Japan versus in the United States. We summarize our results and draw conclusions in Section VII. An

extensive Data Appendix completes the paper.



       I. The Performance-Enhancing Significance of Adopting Biotechnology: Survival



        Michael L. Tushman and Philip Anderson (1986) have argued that major technological

discontinuities originating outside the established industry are threatening to the incumbents, who

thereafter often exit, unable to keep up with the new technology outside the scope of their knowledge.

Indeed, Rebecca Henderson (1993) has pointed to "Underinvestment and Incompetence as Responses

to Radical Innovation" by incumbent firms. Examining the pharmaceutical industry, Zucker and Darby

(1996a, 1997) have argued that while there is support for this pessimistic view of the survival of

incumbents faced with an external technological breakthrough, a sizable number of these firms have

been able to successfully transform their methodology of drug discovery to the point that they are in that

regard difficult to distinguish from the most successful dedicated biotechnology firms. In this section, we

present new evidence of the substantial performance-enhancing significance of adopting biotechnology

in terms of increased probability of survival of the firm.

        Major pharmaceutical firms carry out five distinct, important activities: drug discovery, clinical

testing, obtaining regulatory approval, manufacturing drugs, and marketing drugs.                 Biotechnology

profoundly alters drug discovery and may affect manufacturing as well. An industry leader will perform

all these activities well, but there is little scope for the other activities if drug discovery is not done well.

Indeed membership in the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA --

formerly known as Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association or PMA) requires an active program of

drug discovery.2 Since biotechnology has dramatically increased the productivity of drug discovery

activities by replacing more or less random screening of compounds with cloned targets, smart drug




                                                        3
design, and other advances, we expect that the probability a firm will survive the radical restructuring of

the industry in response to the innovation depends on the degree to which it has successfully adopted

the new technology.

        We operationalize our measure of adoption of biotechnology by examining whether any of the

firm's scientific publications are authored by a "star scientist" writing either as or with an employee of the

firm. We use star scientists to mean one of the 327 top-producing genetic sequence discoverers

identified and validated for biotechnology entry or adoption and for subsequent firm success in Zucker,

Darby, and Brewer (1998) and Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong (1998). We assume based on our prior

field work that any major pharmaceutical firm which has converted its drug discovery has the resources

to identify and hire or at least work with one of the top scientists in the field at the bench level.

        Our principal survival test is based on the 38 members of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers

Association in 1975 for which we could find CUSIP numbers either for themselves or their ultimate

parent. The founding discovery for biotechnology was made by Cohen and Boyer in 1973 and the first

firms began to use biotechnology in 1975 or 1976; so this list provides a reasonable basis for identifying

the incumbent firms at the time of the technological discontinuity. Essentially all these firms applied

chemistry-based drug-discovery technologies in 1975. Fifteen of these 38 firms survived in the sense

that the firm continued to 1999 as an independent firm (or division or subsidiary of the 1975 parent) or

the dominant partner in any merger. There is a slight ambiguity in how to treat the Upjohn case which

entered into an equal merger with Pharmacia of Sweden to form Pharmacia and Upjohn, but we count

this as a clear survival case since the merged company is in the process of moving its global

headquarters from "neutral" London to New Jersey.

        As indicated in the first three lines of panel A of Table 1, only 16 or 42.1 percent of these 38

firms have survived the past 24 years. However, among firms adopting biotechnology to the extent of

developing star ties, 12 or 80.0 percent of 15 adopting firms survived, while only 4 or 17.4 percent of




                                                       4
the 23 firms without ties managed to survive. The χ 2(1) statistic for the hypothesis that the difference in

survival rates is due to chance is 14.6 implying a p-value much less than 0.001. Thus it appears that

adoption of biotechnology was so performance-enhancing in drug discovery that non-adopters were

effectively forced from the field by adopting incumbents (and new entrant dedicated biotechnology

firms).

          George Baker has argued that this apparently strong finding could be the spurious result of two

independent processes in which those that happen to survive longer will have more years in which their

scientists might write in collaboration with a star scientist. This hypothesis is not borne out by the data,

however. The fourth and fifth lines of panel A show that the average exit rate per year for firms which

do not then have star ties is double that for firms that have then written with stars. Annual observations

on exit rates -- the ratio of firms exiting in the year to their numbers at the beginning of the year -- are

plotted in Figure 1 according to whether the firm did or did not have any prior star ties at the beginning

of the year in question. We note that the exit rate of firms with ties exceeded the exit rate of firms

without ties in only one year, and is generally much smaller. The significance level of this difference in

mean exit rates depends on the dating of the ties: by year of publication or, as we have argued

elsewhere (Zucker and Darby 1996b), some two (or more) years earlier when the work was actually

done and the firm must have already adopted biotech drug discovery. Even allowing for a two year

publication lag, which reduces (increases) the per year exit rate for firms with (without) star ties by

increasing (decreasing) the number of years in the denominator, the significance level for a one-sided

difference in means test is only 0.06.

          Fortunately, we can obtain more precise estimates of the effects on firm survival of biotech

adaption as indicated by star ties by estimating Weibull loglinear survival models.3         In the results

reported in Table 2, the two variables considered to effect the survival probability are whether the firm

in the current year is marked as adopting biotechnology by having worked with a star and whether the




                                                     5
firm was listed as among the top 20 firms in the world in terms of drug discovery in 1981-1982

(discussed below). Regardless of whether the Top-20 variable is included in the model and regardless

of whether a two or zero year publication lag is assumed, the probability of survival is increased at

better than the 0.05 significance level in years in which Has-ties marks the firm as having adopted

biotechnology.

        We also examined the survival of the world's 20 leading companies in the development of new

drugs in 1981-1982 as identified by the California Department of Commerce (1986), extending our

previous analysis of these firms in Zucker and Darby (1996a). This set of firms has the advantage of

being international (9 American based, 1 British, 2 French, 3 German, 2 Japanese, and 3 Swiss) but the

disadvantage that most (70 percent) of these outstanding, science-based firms did adopt biotechnology

(as indicated by star ties) and 90 percent of these 20 firms survived from 1982 to 1999. Fortunately,

since sample size and the rarity of exit prevented our obtaining stable Weibull estimates, the Baker

argument does not apply in this case: All the firms that were ever tied to a star had published results

with stars by 1992, indicating adoption likely occurred at the latest in 1990; the two exits occurred in

1995 and 1996, long after all the firms we count as adopting biotech drug discovery had done so.

Although the significance of the difference in means tests is a bit shy of conventional levels, we can rely

on the contingency table χ 2 test to reject at the 0.025 level the hypothesis that prior adoption of biotech

drug discovery did not affect survival.4

        We conclude that the quantitative evidence supports the everyday observation of industry

experts such as Dr. Francois L'Eplattanier (in 1995 as head of R&D for Ciba of Switzerland): "Genetic

engineering is absolutely essential for us. If we were not active in genetic engineering, we would be out

of the game entirely by the beginning of the next century."5 So far, eighty three percent of the 23 PMA

members of 1975 which we identified as failing to adopt biotechnology successfully have exited with

one and three quarters year left until 2001.

       II. Why Did the Japanese Biotech Revolution Occur via Organizational Change?



        Over 1993-1998 we have done fieldwork involving interviews with nearly 100 university and

research-institute scientists, executives and scientists at Japanese biotech and financial firms, and

government officials. The purpose of the fieldwork was to better understand the industry and its

constraints in order to develop hypotheses for quantitative analysis, not to test any hypotheses per se.

        Our respondents identified a number of structural differences between Japan and the United

States, differences which they primarily saw as impediments on the Japanese side explaining the lag of

their industry behind that in the U.S. (A particularly well organized version of the consensus Japanese

view was provided for use in our discussions by one of our respondents and appears as Appendix

Table A.) From our reading and observations, we have identified several other factors that may affect

the process of entry of new firms and adoption by incumbent firms. We shall discuss what appear to be

the key underlying differences after summarizing what is known about the industry and its scientific base

in the two countries.



Science Base and Its Commercial Application

        As indicated previously, there is a unified data base (GenBank) reporting all genetic-sequence

discoveries. The GenBank accession number is normally required by editors as a condition of

publication, and scientific and commercial incentives for demonstrated priority ensure that scientists

promptly report their discoveries.6 There is no such universe to provide a frame for identifying the firms

exploiting the new biotechnology by commercially applying the breakthroughs in recombinant DNA and

other basic technologies. In our terminology, biotech-using firms are either newly-formed "entrants" or

pre-existing "incumbents". Depending on the directory or directories a researcher uses, for example,




                                                    7
there are between 500 and perhaps 2500 biotech-using firms in the U.S. alone. Using a more stringent

definition of whether the enterprise is actually involved in using the breakthrough technologies, Zucker,

Darby, and Brewer (1998) dated the inception of 751 U.S. biotech-using firms from 1976 to April

1990. As used here "inception" refers to the formation of biotech-using entrants and the initial adoption

of biotechnology by incumbents. For larger incumbents, this initial adoption of biotechnology frequently

occurs in particular identifiable subunits or subsidiaries -- the proverbial "skunk-works."

        We have attempted to apply a similar definition to biotech-using firms in Japan, and have

identified 368 biotech-using firms either born or beginning use of biotechnology between 1975 and

1989 inclusive as described in Data Appendix A.1. We are not confident that the definitions are strictly

comparable, nor is a simple count of biotech-using firms our preferred measure of the total activity in the

area. Unfortunately, however, many entrants are nonpublic and report very little information while most

incumbents do not report information with sufficient detail to distinguish between activities involving

traditional technologies and the new biotechnologies.

        In the U.S. data, Zucker, Darby, and Brewer (1998) could definitively classify only 661 of their

751 biotech-using firms, 511 as entrants and 150 as incumbents, with the remaining 90 biotech-using

firms lacking data to classify or (in 18 cases) being problematic joint venture cases. For Japan we did

not have the ability to definitively investigate the origins of entrants and adopted a convention which we

believe overstates the frequency of true de nova entry and accordingly understates the frequency of

adoption of biotechnology by incumbent firms: Any biotech-using company with a founding date after

1974 is counted as an entrant while any company with an earlier founding date is counted as an

incumbent. On this basis we count 23 Japanese entrants and 345 incumbents. Thus, only 6.3 percent

of Japanese biotech-using firms are entrants compared to 77.3 percent (511/661) in the U.S. Based on

our fieldwork, we believe that most of these Japanese entrants are unidentified affiliates of incumbents or

groups of incumbents and that essentially all inceptions in Japan amount to organizational changes in




                                                     8
incumbent firms rather than true entry.7

        Figures 2 and 3 plot the number of stars ever active and the number of biotech-using firms born

up to early 1990 by the functional economic areas defined by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (for

short, "BEAs") for the U.S. and by prefectures for Japan. 8 We see in both the U.S. and Japan that

there is a high correlation in the locations of biotech-using firms and star scientists. Of course, this

apparent correlation cannot prove causation since it may reflect the effects on each of third factors such

as population or employment distribution which might determine where both stars and biotech-using

firms are located.



Geography

        The U.S. is characterized by a rich variety of patterns across the BEAs: Some large areas have

great universities and others do not, the same is true for medium and smaller regions. Nor do all great

universities, even those among the strongest in the biosciences, have similar numbers of star scientists as

we define them. All together, the U.S. geography provides us with sufficient variation to characterize as

a natural experiment. In Japan, people, firms, and universities are much more concentrated, particularly

in the Tokyo area and around Osaka and Kyoto in the Kansai. This makes it more difficult statistically

to distinguish the effects of stars and other measures of intellectual human capital from measures of

economic activity. Fortunately, we do have information not only on where stars have been active but

also when and thus are able to draw some conclusions where otherwise it might be impossible.

        The simple map in Figure 3 illustrates in a substantive as well as statistical way in which Japan's

geography might result in different impacts of local stars on regional development: With the population

and economy concentrated like a dumbbell along the Tokaido shinkansen line, few stars are located

more than three hours from some 90 percent of the existing firms. Thus, it is conceivable that Kyoto's

scientists could contribute actively to commercial applications of biotechnology at biotech-using firms




                                                    9
located in Tokyo and vice versa. These issues are particularly important in explaining inception into

biotechnology. Once we know the firms which are actively using the new technology, we can look at

specific linkages between stars and biotech-using firms to predict the success of those biotech-using

firms (see Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong 1998), but that is the subject of another paper.




Institutional and Cultural Differences between Japan and the United States

        As noted above, interview respondents acutely sense that Japan has lagged behind the United

States in creating and commercially applying their scientific base. They point to three main areas of

concern: (a) university structure, policies, and culture, (b) financial market support for venture firms,

and (c) cultural differences with respect to entrepreneurialism. We would add that Japanese firms have

faced a distinctly lower threat of product liability litigation.

University structure, policies, and culture

        Japanese respondents point to the hierarchal nature of Japanese universities with funding,

personnel, and laboratory space primarily allocated equally to each professor regardless of their current

or prospective research productivity as retarding the development of the scientific base. They also note

that it is illegal for national university professors, where essentially all the stars are located, to earn

additional labor income from firms or start a firm as is common in the U.S. However, a number of

respondents noted that those laws are widely evaded, ignored or otherwise worked around, but the less

secure property rights for professor-firm collaborations may interfere with their effectiveness.

Furthermore, cultural inhibitions on professor's entrepreneurial activity were said to reinforce the legal

bans on profiting from consulting with or starting a firm.

        A significant difference in treatment of patent rights between Japan and the U.S. is an important

institutional factor favoring more Japanese star-firm ties. In the U.S., if the underlying work is done at a




                                                        10
professor's university laboratory, a patent is normally assigned to the university although the inventing

scientist(s) may have significant shares of any income from the patent. In Japan, such a patent is almost

always assigned to the inventing scientist(s) who may make a donation to his university or department.9

Furthermore, top researchers sent (with funds for equipment and supplies) to stars' university

laboratories by firms as "students" are an important means of increasing the size of the laboratory since

professors cannot use research grants to increase staff because of lifetime employment at the

universities. Thus, in Japan star-firm joint work is customarily done in the star's university laboratory

while in the U.S. a star must physically go to a firm laboratory and establish a second team there to

secure full patent rights.

        These latter advantages apparently more than offset the deterrents to working with firms, and

Japanese academic scientists do so to a remarkable degree. In fact, 40 percent of Japanese stars at

some time in their publishing career up to 1990 either have published as or (much more frequently) with

an employee of a firm, a higher rate even than the 33 percent figure for the United States. Stars in

Japan and the U.S. show substantially more such ties than those in any other country.10 While the

quantity of collaborations between academic scientists and firms if anything favors Japan, it may be that

these ties are not as deep or significant to the firm as in the U.S. where the scientists are frequently

motivated by substantial equity interests in the firms with which they work.

Financial market support for venture firms

        There are about 1.3 million corporations active in Japan, which is nearly three quarters the

American rate of 3.5 million after adjustment for population differences. Despite the special deterrents

to starting biotech firms for reasons of university policy and cultural inhibitions (discussed below), clearly

some Japanese are willing and able to start businesses.

        Respondents attribute the capital market inhibitions to creation of venture firms as due to the

interaction of four distinct but reinforcing attributes of these markets: the lack of American-style venture




                                                     11
capital firms, the prohibition of initial public offerings (IPOs) for firms without an established record of

substantial profitability, the fact that the keiretsu will not buy small firms unless at distress prices, and the

lack of bank financing for risky ventures without collateral.

        About 120 venture capital firms exist in Japan, but they are all focussed in bringing established

small and medium sized companies to the point of making the IPO. These firms had assets of about

$5.5 billion by May 1993 with another $2.5 billion raised through sponsored partnerships. The largest

of these venture capital firms by far is Japan Associated Finance Co., Ltd. (JAFCO) with about $2

billion under management. However, there appear to be no U.S. style venture capital firms which will

finance a new biotech firm located in Japan for the first ten years or so before the firm either makes an

IPO or is sold profitably to a large firm.11

        The lack of venture capital firms financing start-up companies does not appear to reflect a

shorter horizon on the part of venture capital firms in Japan. In the United States, too, a typical venture

capital firm is looking to something like a ten year relationship. The difference is that American firms can

rely on making an IPO or profitable sale at a much earlier stage of development than in Japan. In effect,

the more complete American capital markets allow the venture capital firms to act farsighted because

they know that once substantial research and development results have been obtained, their investments

can be sold to other investors who will discount the future profitability to the present.12

        The Japanese capital markets and especially the Ministry of Finance did not accept IPOs for

firms which do not have a track record of proven profitability. The second section of the Tokyo Stock

Exchange for smaller companies requires a minimum before tax profit of ¥400 million ($3.6 million).

On the over-the-counter (OTC) market JASDAQ which began on October 23, 1991, the smallest

before tax profit reported by a firm making an IPO was ¥258 million ($2.3 million).13 Only in 1995

under pressure from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), was a second OTC

market established to permit high-technology companies without proven profits to go public, but the first




                                                       12
such IPO did not occur until 1996 (for an intranet software firm ATL Systems Inc.) and even in 1999

there are only one or two true venture biotech firms in Japan. Thus a Japanese IPO market which could

take biotech venture firms public before profitability is only now emerging and its absence in the 1970s,

1980s, and most of the 1990s, meant that there was no venture capital firms financing start-ups in the

golden age for biotech during the 1980s. In this way we see a vicious circle of no financing for start-ups

and no start-ups to lead the way as with the Genentech IPO in the U.S. in 1982.

        In principle, the large groups of Japanese companies (the keiretsus) could substitute for an

effective IPO market by bidding vigorously for the winners of an R&D race among independent venture

firms. Indeed, this is a common outcome of successful venture capital investments in the United States.

For reasons that are not clear to the authors, none of the respondents reported any such bidding and

indeed indicated that if firms were bought, it would be only at distress prices.14 Thus, one alternative

means of fostering bio-ventures in Japan was eliminated.

        Respondents also point to a lack of uncollateralized bank financing for risky ventures as a

deterrent to growth in new enterprises, in effect requiring all growth to be self-financed. While this

would seem to stretch out the period of growth relative to other countries, it seems unlikely to us that

bank financing would anywhere be a real alternative to venture capital firms.

        Japanese venture capital firms such as JAFCO have concentrated on financing American and

European bio-ventures and also on their strategic alliances with Japanese firms through joint ventures

and other mechanisms.

Cultural differences with respect to entrepreneurialism

        As alluded to above, many respondents commented on the differential status or honor given to

the professor relative to the individual involved in commerce. This social distance was compounded at

least through the early eighties by the radical or Marxist orientation of many students and some faculty in

the major universities.




                                                    13
        Several respondents also believed that business people do not want to reveal too much to

university faculty because the faculty highly value open communication and may not keep their findings

confidential until patent protection of intellectual property can be obtained.

        One respondent went so far as to say that firms looked to the universities primarily to supply

good Japanese brains. The demand for Japanese scientists, rather than scientists trained elsewhere,

probably stems in part from the value of the social network formed in the universities, providing early

and privileged access to new discoveries at the university where the scientist was trained. But there also

may be an element of Japanese discrimination against gaijin (foreigners) that leads firms to avoid hiring

non-Japanese whether because of prejudice or for fear that the foreigners will ultimately choose to leave

Japan and the firm.

        Other respondents suggested that the faculty's desire for honor and only covert relations with

firms reduced the firms' costs of obtaining Japanese academic research -- that providing honor through

creating foundations and institutes and perhaps making some informally agreed payments cost only a

tenth as much as explicit payments for academic researchers in the U.S. and Europe.15 On retirement

from the university, a professor who has maintained a close relationship with a company can become a

consultant to the firm or a member of its board -- but not an employee -- without losing honor.

        A second cultural factor which inhibits the creation of bio-venture firms in Japan is the national

career ideal of working for a single employer until retirement. Reinforcing this factor is the importance

of social contacts within organizations which make it hard for a newcomer to enter a firm from outside.

Thus, leaving a firm or university to start a new firm involves disrupting that firm-based or university-

based social network and possibly labeling oneself as different if not unstable. If the firms succeeds,

then there is probably a net gain on these dimensions to the individual, but biotechnology is inherently

risky with the prizes from a search for a new drug mainly going to whomever gets there first and can

raise enough capital along the way to keep the company afloat until there are some profits. If the new




                                                     14
venture ultimately fails, the founding scientists' career pattern is disrupted and it may be very hard to find

new lifetime employment or even to establish the social network within a new organization to be

successful.   Since lifetime employment is itself a culturally endorsed risk-avoidance strategy, the

downside risk of starting a new firm must seem enormous compared to scientists used to the American

system of employment often said to be based on the revolving door.16

        Compounding the difficulties of the potential venture firm are the general difficulties with entry of

new firms into the Japanese market place. These barriers to entry are well known and have been the

subject of numerous international trade negotiations. They work for natives in much the same way as

for foreigners and must deter biotech-using entrants as well. On the other hand, since the biggest

returns are in the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry where track record and personal ties also play

a major role in the United States, this factor probably should not be unduly stressed.

        A cultural preference for group or team activity as opposed to the American ideal of rugged

individualism may contribute to the relative evenness of allocation of funds within ranks at the national

universities and the aversion to differential rewards for differential performance. The same cultural

preference may restrain vigorous national competitions for scientific grants and the associated culture of

scientific entrepreneurship which seems to be a short step away from starting a new firm in the United

States. The Japanese government, nonetheless, is currently shifting national policy toward competitive,

peer-reviewed research funding. Scientists in both countries, moreover, rely on the same mode of

scientific production: the research team based in the laboratory of a distinguished senior scientist. It

remains for us to see how these teams differ.

        A final cultural trend in Japan is its eclecticism. One respondent noted a tradition of Japan's

sending people to other countries to learn their best practices starting 1000 years ago with China.

While the success of Japan in judging the best in foreign economies and cultures and incorporating it at

home -- often in improved form -- is legendary, it may also lead to overestimation of foreign superiority




                                                     15
in areas of innovation. We saw that Japanese firms and investors were eager to support the innovative

work done in America but less willing to support and rely on the unique breakthroughs of Japan's own

scientists. Sometimes Japanese firms ended up licensing applied technologies from the United States

that were based on Japanese basic-science discoveries -- just the reverse of many American's fear of

another VCR!

Threat of product liability litigation

         Although Japanese observers have not remarked on the threat of product liability litigation as

playing a role in the development of commercial applications of biotechnology, this may be because they

were searching for factors which have retarded that development in Japan relative to the United States.

Clearly, product liability has been, in contrast, a favorable factor for inception of biotech-using firms in

Japan.

         Viscusi and Moore (1993) demonstrate that higher liability exposure tends to reduce R&D

expenditures for innovative products, so this is a positive difference for adoption of biotechnology in

Japan. However, higher liability exposure works differentially for large and small firms since the most

that can be forfeited (beyond insurance) is the value of the company itself. The greater the potential

liability – as in the U.S. – the greater is the competitive advantage of carrying out risk innovation in small

rather than large firms. So the liability difference reinforces the university, financial, and cultural

explanations of why biotech-using firms are much more likely to be incumbents in Japan than in the U.S.



Conclusions on Why the Japanese Biotech Revolution Occurred via Organizational Change

         As a practical matter, the structure of the Japanese capital markets (particularly the inability of

firms without substantial accounting profits to go public) precluded the pattern of entrant formation seen

in the U.S. (see Kishimoto 1989 and Zucker and Darby 1994 for details). At the same time, the

structure of the universities has greatly reduced the number of potential founding scientist-entrepreneurs.




                                                     16
Thus, we understand why inception into commercial application of biotechnology in Japan has occurred

nearly exclusively through adoption of the technology by pre-existing firms (incumbents). An alternative

explanation is that the threat of product liability litigation was sufficiently severe in the U.S. that many

incumbent firms left the field open for new entrants. In any case, Zucker, Darby, and Brewer (1998)

show that in the U.S. the inception processes for entrants and incumbents are indistinguishable. We do

not have sufficient numbers of Japanese entrants to make a similar comparison, but it appears likely that

the effects of differential numbers of incumbents and entrants, if any, are on the comparative success of

Japanese biotech-using firms and not on their total numbers.17 We will explore the former issue in future

work and here restrict our concern to the latter.

        The structural differences between Japan and the U.S. raise questions as to whether the

significant impact on biotech-using firm inception of where and when star scientists are publishing --

observed in the U.S. at the BEA level -- were also present in Japan and, if so, to the same extent.

These questions are addressed in Sections III and IV below. Industrial groups known as keiretsus play

a prominent role in Japanese industrial organization that is not present in the United States. Their risk-

sharing and cross-financing aspects might have facilitated inception into biotechnology for keiretsu

member firms compared to others, a possibility examined in Section V.



                                   III. The Local Science Base and

                    Where and When Japanese Firms Adopted Biotechnology



        In this section we restrict our statistical analysis to incumbents -- firms already born as the

commercialization of biotechnology began in 1975. We do so to examine a pure case, but will proceed

in Section IV to examine inception for all Japanese biotech firms. Since we have already learned a great

deal about the process of biotech-using-firm inception in the United States, we follow Zucker, Darby,




                                                    17
and Brewer (1998) to the extent possible given the availability of data and the problems of

multicollinearity which arise within the more limited geography of Japan where many of the explanatory

variables used in the U.S. are highly correlated. Basically, we look to measures of intellectual capital

and to other economic variables to explain inception of firms, entering them in groups both to give an

idea of marginal contribution and stability of the prior coefficients.

        Given the directory nature of our firm data sources, we were concerned whether the reported

locations were the primary sites where biotechnology was done or merely the headquarters of the firm.

Accordingly, we searched the Science Citation Index for biotech-relevant publications by scientists at

each of the 368 Japanese biotech-using firms in order to correct instances in which corporate

headquarters rather than laboratory or plant locations were reported in our directory source. Where

another location was reported on a plurality of these publications, we used that location for the firm

instead of the one in the directory.18

        Analogous to Zucker, Darby, Brewer (1998), our data are in panel form for each of the 47

Japanese prefectures for each of the years 1975-1989 for a total of 705 observations. We are

attempting to explain counts of inceptions by biotechnology-using firms for each prefecture and year.

Since there are many zeroes among these non-negative integers, we estimate poisson regressions using

LIMDEP (Version 7.0).

        We measure intellectual capital both by counts of how many stars and their collaborators are

"active" in each prefecture in each year and also by the number of main professors and the total

resources for bioscience research institutes at major universities in the prefecture (see Data Appendix

A.2 for details). As in the U.S., the economic variables are total employment in the prefecture as a

measure of its size and average earnings in the prefecture as a measure of the skill level of its labor force

(see Data Appendix A.3 for details).19

        The first column (a) of Table 3 estimates a simple model of inception of incumbent firms into




                                                      18
biotechnology based on the numbers of active stars and collaborators by year and prefecture. In Japan,

stars have a strong positive effect and collaborators have a significant negative effect.20 As in the U.S.,

there appears to be a nonlinear relationship which is captured in the second column (b) of Table 3 by

adding the product of the number of stars and collaborators. This eliminates the negative direct effect of

collaborators and instead the negative interaction coefficient suggests that the more new people to

whom the stars are teaching the new technology the less is the effect of the stars on inception into

biotechnology. However, the significance of both collaborators and the star x collaborator interaction

term is unstable as the model is expanded to account for other resources in the area; so the influence of

collaborators may not be reliably determined from the limited geography of Japan. We believe that

geography's limits on the variation in Japanese conditions is the most likely explanation, in part because

when we experimented with artificially limiting the U.S. inception analysis data set to only California

BEAs, we found that similar instability resulted.

        The final column (e) of Table 3 presents the full model, in which stars (as always) have a

significantly positive effect on the probability of inception of biotech-using firms in the prefecture. Total

employment and average earnings also have highly significant positive effects. The coefficients of the

number of main professors and total research funding for bioscience labs in major university research

institutes are insignificant in the full model, in contrast to model (c) which includes all the intellectual

human capital variables only and in which they are both significant but have the wrong sign. We

explored the multicollinearity among these two variables and the economic variables a bit further by

dropping each in turn from models (c) and (e): We found that either the number of main professors or

total research funding is highly significant and positive in model (c) if entered alone but neither is

significant if entered alone in model (e) with the economic variables. Thus, the distribution of major

universities is such that, unlike the U.S., we cannot find any stable effect for them separate from the

areas in which they are located.




                                                    19
        The fourth regression (d) in Table 3 indicates that, unlike the U.S. results in Zucker, Darby, and

Brewer (1998) for the U.S., the explanatory factor of the economic variables alone is significantly

greater than that of the intellectual capital variables as a group (compare the log-likelihoods for columns

c and d). As in the U.S., where and when star scientists are active has a strongly positive and significant

independent effect on where and when biotech-using firms entered into biotechnology, and this effect is

always separate from and in addition to the effects of research support for university scientists and the

general economic conditions of the prefecture.

        Thus the Japanese data validate key qualitative conclusions in our previous work for the U.S.

alone on the role of individual star scientists in promoting inception of biotech-using firms in an area and

the regional economic development which they imply. The local presence of top-producing scientists

contributes to the transformation and expansion of the local industry through organizational change in

incumbent firms in Japan and also through new entrants in America.



                                      IV. The Science Base and

                Organizational Change in Incumbents versus Entry of New Firms



        We argued above that even the apparent Japanese entrants born after 1974 are in fact newly

created affiliates of incumbents. Comparing Tables 3 and 4, we see that the results are essentially the

same whether inceptions include all firms or only those born before 1975. This is consistent with the

view that all inception of biotechnology in Japan through 1989 occurred by organizational change in

incumbents rather than new entry. However, Zucker, Darby, and Brewer (1998) found that inception

of incumbents and entrants follow a very similar process for the U.S. Thus the lack of change in

coefficients moving from Table 3 to 4 might simply reflect similar processes governing births of

incumbents and entrants.




                                                    20
         In the following sections, where we examine the effect of keiretsu membership on inception and

compare Japanese to U.S. results, it is appropriate to consider all 368 biotech-using firms in the

statistical analysis.



                        V. Has Keiretsu Membership Promoted or Retarded

                                 This Form of Organizational Change?



         Keiretsus, large groups of related firms typified by cross-shareholding and financial relations

with a central bank, are generally viewed as a distinctive and important aspect of Japanese industrial

organization. One hypothesis is that members of a keiretsu are more likely to engage in risky, long-

horizon investments such as biotechnology because of their low cost of capital and implicit risk-sharing

arrangements and superior information network for monitoring innovation. An alternative hypothesis is

that management of keiretsu-member firms are more entrenched and less likely to be alert to new

innovations such as biotechnology. In this section, we examine whether their inception pattern in fact

differs significantly from that estimated for non-member firms.

         Since keiretsus are largely informal groupings, there is no generally agreed definition or listing of

which firms are members of which keiretsu. The situation is somewhat easier for vertical groupings

more analogous to American conglomerates in structure, but it is debatable whether those groups should

be counted as keiretsus at all. David Weinstein generously has provided us with the data set

constructed for Weinstein and Yishay Yafeh (1995) which lists member firms for four different

definitions of keiretsu: (a) The Big 6 are the DKB, Fuyo, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sanwa, and Sumitomo

horizontal groups. (b) The Big 8 are the Big 6 plus the Industrial Bank of Japan and Tokai groups. (c)

The Big 8 + Vertical definition is the broadest, combining firms that are members of vertical groups and

the Big 8 firms. (d) The Big 6 Presidents Club definition is the narrowest, including only the inner circle




                                                     21
of Big 6 firms whose CEOs belong to their group's Presidents Club.21

        Using in turn each of these four definitions of keiretsu memberships, we divided our inception

counts by prefecture and year into the number of inceptions by firms identified as members of a keiretsu

and the number of inceptions by all other firms. We replicated Table 4 for the member and non-

member counts separately for each definition, and also stacked the two count variables in a third

regression for ease in testing the hypothesis that the coefficients of each of the variables -- but not the

constants -- are the same in each regression pair.22 We do not include the constant terms in the test as

they will differ simply because keiretsu-member firms are relatively infrequent and thus should (as a

group) have a different, lower base frequency of inception. For each Keiretsu definition, from broadest

to narrowest, Table 5 reports the χ 2 statistics for these tests of equality for the coefficients of regression

forms (b) through (e) from Table 4 together with a memorandum of the share of keiretsu-member

inception to total inception into biotechnology.23 Of the 16 different regression-form and keiretsu-

definition combinations, in only one case does the χ 2 statistic indicate significant differences in regression

coefficients. This is about what is expected by chance, so we conclude that the keiretsu and non-

keiretsu coefficients are the same.

        In Figure 4 we plot the cumulative inception as a percentage of type-specific total inception for

keiretsu members and nonmembers separately. Note that a higher proportion of keiretsu members

appear to have entered early in the process than is the case for nonmembers. Since the underlying

processes are indistinguishable, these differences appear to be explained by subtle differences in

geographical distribution by membership category.24



              VI. Biotech Adoption and Entry in Japan versus in the United States.



        A particularly interesting question is whether the structural differences between Japan and the




                                                     22
United States result in detectible differences in the linkage between the science base and its

commercialization. Since it is difficult to find many variables which are strictly comparable across

countries, we must address this question with stripped down models which consider only the numbers of

stars and collaborators and total employment in the local area.25

        The first column (a) of Table 6 reports the results from a pooled Japan-US poisson regression

for biotech-using firm inception by year and area based on only a constant and the number of stars and

collaborators in each. In this simple model, the number of stars but not the number of collaborators has

a significantly positive effect on inceptions of biotech-using firms. In the remaining four columns of Table

6 we explore different models which include both the values of the variables for both countries and

those values interacted with JDUMMY where JDUMMY is 1 for Japanese observations and 0 for U.S.

observations. Thus, the interaction terms measure the additional impact of the variable in Japan

compared to the U.S. Therefore, the combined coefficients for Japanese stars and collaborators in

column (b) are 0.157 + 0.225 = 0.382 and 0.043 - 0.152 = -0.109, respectively. These differ from

the values in column (a) of Table 4 only because of rounding.

        Since on average Japanese prefectures have nearly twice as large populations as American

BEAs, the probability of an inception in a prefecture might well be larger on average than in a BEA, so

we want to test for structural differences that shift the coefficients of the variables in Japan relative to the

coefficients in the U.S. For an individual coefficient, whether the value of the JDUMMY interaction

coefficient is significantly different from 0 is an appropriate test if it is maintained that all the other

coefficients are in fact different. The χ 2 JDUMMY interactions = 0 statistic near the bottom of the table

reports the test of the hypothesis that there is no significant difference, except for the constant, in the

inception process between Japan and the U.S. (i.e., that all the coefficients of the interaction terms are

zero). In contrast to the similar analysis conducted in Section V above for members and non-members

of keiretsus, in every case this χ 2 statistic confirms that there are significant differences between the




                                                      23
processes in the U.S. and Japan. 26

        Considering first the full model in column (e), we see that stars and collaborators have weaker

effects on local developments -- as measured by biotech-using firm inceptions -- in Japan than in the

U.S. and that firms are more likely to enter in Japan where there is already more economic activity.

This is certainly consistent with the arguments presented in Section II above which suggest that there are

strong structural impediments in Japan to the deep involvement in commercialization characteristic of

many U.S. professors/scientist-entrepreneurs. The greater importance of agglomeration factors in

Japan, as indicated by the large coefficient on Total Employment x JDUMMY, may also reflect the

institutional structure in which biotech-using firms often get what collaboration they can with star

scientists at national universities by sending their employees to the stars' labs rather than the stars coming

to the firms. (Recall that in the U.S., it is in both the biotech-using firm's and the scientist's interests for

the university scientist to work at the firm in order to strengthen the case that the university does not

have a property interest in the results of the research.) If the biotech-using firm's employees are

working in the university lab, rather than vice versa, then it is less important that the biotech-using firm

be located locally to conserve the star's time.

        In columns (c) and (d), we see that even in the absence of internationally-comparable additional

university-based measures of intellectual human capital, counts of stars and collaborators and their

interaction alone make a somewhat greater marginal contribution as measured by increases in the log-

likelihood than does total employment in explaining the pattern of inception of biotech-using firms into

biotechnology in Japan and the U.S., with their combined explanatory power considerably greater than

either alone. This reflects the much greater relative importance of intellectual human capital in the U.S.

as compared to the importance of pre-existing economic geography in Japan.

        Figure 5 shows the cumulative densities of Japanese and American biotech-using firm inception,

where each is measured as a cumulative percentage of total inception for each country. 27 The patterns




                                                      24
are very similar with a relatively small lead on the part of Japan apparently explicable by differences in

definition of the start of the process with inception in Japan definitionally starting in 1975 and in the U.S.

definitionally starting in 1976. Note, however, in Figure 6 that biotech-using firm inception by non-

members of keiretsus virtually overlaps the U.S. pattern while inception by keiretsu members is

concentrated in relatively earlier years. Again, we cannot determine whether this reflects some anomaly

in reporting practices or whether it is a possible indication of a real timing difference in inception for

keiretsu member firms relative to non-member firms in Japan and firms in the United States.

        Given the relatively small coefficients on Japanese stars and collaborators reported in Table 6,

an important issue for future research and for policymakers is whether structural differences in Japan in

comparison with the U.S. have resulted in the under-utilization of the science base -- particularly the

intellectual human capital embodied in the stars and their collaborators -- in terms of its impact on

commercial development in Japan or whether instead these structural differences have only spread the

impact of stars on commercialization more widely throughout Japan.



                                    VII. Summary and Conclusions



        Times of radical technological change are perilous for incumbent firms -- particularly when that

change originates outside the firms’ technological competencies.           We have seen that incumbent

pharmaceutical firms over the last quarter century have had to adopt biotechnology or die, and that the

bulk of them in fact failed to survive. This illustrates that biotechnology so improved the performance of

those incumbents and new entrants who could master it that other established firms were no longer able

to compete effectively.

        In the U.S. many new entrants emerged and successful incumbents opened or bought facilities

near the academic centers where star scientists worked.           Thus, both organizational change and




                                                     25
replacement moved the geographic center of the affected industries.               In Japan, we learned that

institutional and geographic factors channeled the industrial transformation due to the biotechnological

revolution almost exclusively into organizational change of incumbent firms. In the latter half of this

paper we found that Japanese firms -- like their American counterparts -- have been significantly more

likely to adopt biotechnology at a time and place where academic star scientists are actively publishing.

So in Japan too the location of scientists making breakthrough discoveries has changed the overall

industrial geography as well as the technological identity of particular firms.

        This paper raises a number of questions for future research. Why did less than half of the

American publicly owned pharmaceuticals develop ties to star scientists when they were near necessity

for survival?    Is the absence of new entrants in Japan a major explanation of Japan's lag in

biotechnology relative to the U.S. or can incumbent firms change sufficiently to be equally effective? Is

the significantly smaller estimated effect of stars on inception in Japan a reflection of relatively less

utilization of the science base or merely that the effect is less geographically concentrated than in the

U.S.? In the U.S. close ties between academics and firms is symbiotic for science, with stars publishing

significantly more articles which on average are more highly cited during the time they work with firms.

In Japan this symbiotic process appears to be weaker both in terms of the strength of ties between

Japanese stars and firms and of the impact of those ties on star productivity. The causality is unclear

and could reflect the smaller resources mobilized for star research in Japanese star-firm ties or the stars’

rational expectations that the payoff will be less and so they are unwilling to become as deeply involved

as is typical in the U.S.

        We conclude that firms can engage in radical organizational change in response to a

technological breakthrough which threatens the survival of firms that cannot improve their performance

to meet the new competitive norms. Some observers may be more surprised by how many incumbent

academic scientists whether in an existing facility or through establishment of new facilities is

characteristic of transformation of incumbents in both the U.S. and Japan, basically repeating the pattern

observed for location and timing of new U.S. entrants. As any coach knows, great strategy can go only

so far in making up for a bench weak in personnel.



                                            Data Appendix



        All data on stars and their collaborators was derived from the universe in GenBank (1990), and

hand-pulled and coded records for each of the stars' articles therein as detailed in the Data Appendix to

Zucker, Darby, and Brewer (1994), which also provides conceptual and procedural background on the

variables detailed here.



A.1. Biotechnology-using firms

        Attempting to develop a data set comparable to the one we developed for the U.S., we started

by licensing a machine readable data base (North Carolina Biotechnology Center 1992). As with the

U.S. biotech-using firm data set, we added additional biotech-using firms based on their listings in

Bioscan (1989-1994). Next, we added additional biotech-using firms from Nikkei Biotechnology

(1990) based on lengthy discussion with Mr. Mitsuru Miyata (Editor-in-Chief) and Ms. Ikuko

Uchiyama (Staff Editor) of Nikkei Biotechnology which enabled us to distinguish firms actually using

the new technologies from those which were listed as a courtesy to subscribers hoping to improve their

stock price. Nikkei Biotechnology (1994) was used to fill in missing data. Finally, we searched each

entry of Nikkei Biotechnology (1990) for firms with research projects or products using recombinant

DNA technology.

        As noted, 93.7 percent of these 368 companies had founding dates prior to their inception into




                                                     27
biotechnology and so were classed as incumbents. Apparent response bias led a number of early

adopters to report 1975 as the date of inception, which we accepted as the earliest date of inception

even though it is doubtful that inception occurred before 1976 given the lag observed in applying the key

Cohen-Boyer discovery (Stanley Cohen, A. Chang, Herbert Boyer, and R. Helling 1973) in the U.S.

In four cases, very early incumbent adopters gave dates of inception before 1975, apparently referring

to earlier technologies; these were constrained to 1975.28 This gave us dates of inception for 333 firms.

For another 35 firms, no inception dates were available in any of our data sources. Since there was

valuable location data associated with the firms, we estimated the inception date of these firms by

drawing inception dates from the same distribution as recorded for firms in their prefecture with known

inception dates.

        Typically, these biotech-using firms were large enterprises with many locations and often the

headquarters address was listed as the biotech-using firm's location regardless of where biotechnology

actually was being applied. Akio Tagawa developed an ingenious method to locate biotech-using firms

by searching the Science Citation Index online by firm name for 1983-1993 to see where scientists

affiliated with each firm were writing bioscience articles. For those firms which could be thus located,

the most frequent location was designated the site of inception. Otherwise, the listed location was

retained.



A.2. Japanese University Research Resources

        Our university research resources information is taken from a comprehensive directory

published by the Japan Association for the Advancement of Science (Nihon Gakujutsu Shinkokai,

1990) which has listings for all of the scientific research institutions in Japan affiliated to universities. This

source, in addition to general information such as institute names, addresses, phone numbers, and year

of establishment, also contains very detailed information such as director names, numbers of




                                                       28
researchers, research divisions within institutions, researcher names, research objectives, and

information about research oriented resources. It is published yearly.

        We first collected information from this directory about all of the research institutes that perform

research in bioscience related fields, and compiled them. In particular, the numbers of full professors,

associate professors, assistant professors, and other researchers, as well as the total resources for each

relevant institute was recorded.

        The relative size and structure of Japanese research institutes is quite clear from the way in

which the entries are listed. Institutes generally are broken down into smaller research divisions, each of

which has a specific research agenda, and each of which is led by what we call a "main professor," who

is usually a full professor but often an associate professor. Thus, the number of main professors or

research divisions gives us a very good indicator of how large the universities' institutes are. Typically, it

would suffice to simply count the number of full professors who are affiliated to each institute, but in

many cases, there was no full professor, and so an associate professor was counted.             It is for this

reason that we have used a variable No. Main Professors which counts their number by prefecture, in

contrast to simply using "full" professor.

        We also collected information about the total amount of yearly resources for each of the

relevant institutes. This figure also is another measure of the relative size of the institutions. Because we

were concentrating on relative size of the institutions based on university and ultimately location of the

university by prefecture, we collected the information for the research institutes from the 1990 directory,

which includes information for the years 1987 and 1988.

        In the end, all of the data was combined and sorted based on the universities to which the

various research institutes belong, and the cumulative data is what we used for this study. Because we

were only interested in the top research oriented universities in the country, we used a minimum cut-off

of three main professors per university to qualify for the analysis, and all others were considered too




                                                     29
small to significantly contribute. Our variable Total Research Funding is the sum (in millions of yen)

across all such universities in a given prefecture.

        Note that both No. Main Professors and Total Research Funding have the same values for a

given prefecture for each year in the analysis, thus serving together as a type of modeled fixed effect

component in our regressions.



A.3. Japanese Economic Variables

        The main prefecture-level economic variables used are Total Employment (total employment in

the given prefecture in a given year) and Average Earnings (average earnings per employed person in

the given prefecture in a given year). These variables were obtained for the years 1975-1990. At the

sub-national level, we combined several sources to compile the necessary information for these

variables:   Policy Planning and Research Department, Minister's Secretariat, Ministry of Labour

(1975-1990), Statistics Bureau, Management and Coordination Agency (1976, 1981, 1986, 1991),

Asahi Shinbunsha (1975-1990), Kokuseisha (1988), and Bureau of Statistics (1991).

        Total Employment (in thousands) was listed irregularly in the various sources, and while there

was some overlap among sources which served for confirmational purposes, much of the information

was obtained through the above sources in different editions. In the end, we were able to obtain

consistent data only for the years 1975, 1977, 1979, 1980, 1985, 1987, and 1990. The remaining

years were filled in by interpolation from the obtained data.

        Average Earnings was calculated from the average cash earnings per worker per month over a

twelve month period for all of the 47 prefectures in Japan and compared for consistency to the national

average. Cash earnings is defined as the amount of money earned before deductions for income tax, for

social insurance contributions, for union dues, and for payment for goods purchased. Cash earnings

specifically include semi-annual bonuses, which in Japan are (or were) typically equivalent to another six




                                                      30
months' worth of income. The yearly cash earnings were divided by 12 to find the average monthly

cash earnings for each prefecture and year. Finally, we adjusted this amount for inflation by dividing by

the consumer price index for the central city of each of the prefectures in Japan for each year during the

period 1975-1990. The basic cash earnings data were found in successive annual editions of the

Yearbook of Labour Statistics during this period.

        We also experimented with a third economic variable, the Earnings/Price Ratio as an estimate of

the (all-equity) cost of capital. This figure is the inverse of the price/earnings ratio as reported in Nihon

Ginko Tokeikyoku (1975-1990) for the Tokyo Stock Price Index, or TOPIX, based on all First

Section stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

1. Evidence of geographically localized knowledge, often attributed to knowledge spillovers, is reported

by Adam B. Jaffe 1989, Jaffe, Manuel Trajtenberg, and Rebecca Henderson 1993, and Edwin

Mansfield 1995, Lynne G. Zucker, Michael R. Darby, and Marilynn B. Brewer 1998, and Zucker,

Darby, and Jeff Armstrong 1998.


2. This requirement excludes firms that specialize in low-cost manufacturing of generic versions of drugs

discovered by other firms once their patents have expired.


3. These models were estimated using LIMDEP, Version 7.0.


4. The 18 firms counted as surviving include not only the Upjohn case of an equal merger but also the

two Swiss companies that consummated an equal merger to form Norvartis. Even if we reduce the

population reduced to 17 firms after excluding the equal mergers, we can reject the hypothesis that

survival does not depend on adopting biotechnology at the 0.05 level.


5. As quoted in Clive Cookson (1995). Cookson reports that "[t]oday, genetic engineering is used

daily as a laboratory tool by every research-based pharmaceutical and biotech company."


6. Each genetic sequence entering GenBank for the first time is assigned a primary accession number

(our measure of a genetic-sequence discovery).


7. A number of respondents report that even apparent "venture firm" entrants in our data set (e.g.,

Hayashibara Biochemical and Nippon Gene) are more accurately characterized as continuations of and

subunits of long existing family firms which provided their financing rather than new dedicated

biotechnology firms comparable to the usual American form.
8. Prefectures are 92 percent larger than BEAs in population but only 16 percent as large in land area,

although some of the latter discrepancy is eliminated if the few BEAs comprising Alaska and the desert

southwest are excluded from the U.S. calculations.


9. The decision is made by a faculty committee. If the patent is not assigned to the professor(s) it goes

to the government in which case the Ministry of Finance does not return any income to the university or

department.


10. Copublication is generally agreed by scientists and executives to be an excellent indicator of

alignment of interests and was shown in Section I to be an important predictor of incumbent firm

success. Similarly, Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong (1998) show that copublication with stars is a

powerful determinant of (primarily entrant) firm success in California. Zucker and Darby (1999)

compare the frequency of star-firm ties across a number of countries.


11. These firms are sometimes involved with financing start-ups abroad as discussed below.


12. An alternative view of the Japanese situation is that the lack of start-up funding does not reflect

incompleteness of the capital markets. Such funding vehicles, on this view, are not necessary in Japan

because the keiretsu provide an efficient funding mechanism for new activities in a way which reduces

shareholder-manager agency problems. On this view, the numerous American venture capital firms are

due to American regulatory restrictions. We do not believe that this story holds up, however, since the

banking regulatory system in Japan is even more restrictive than in the United States, there are no

regulations preventing large American firms from establishing new sub-units to pursue new technologies,

and venture capital firms funding startups was also a feature of the incubation of the U.S. electronics

industry for which there were no significant liability issues (see footnote 6 above).
13. JASDAQ suffered from some early scandals which may have reinforced caution in standards for

IPOs.


14. Stock prices of the major conglomerates do seem to react to the reputed success of their biotech

subunits. On the other hand even remarkably profitable biotech-using subunits tend to be small relative

to the core businesses of their parents. For example, Kirin Brewery reportedly earned ¥23 billion in

1993 on two very successful pharmaceutical products, but stock prices declined with overall sales of

beer. Given the results in Section I above, these biotech subunits may play a vital role in determining a

firm's long-run success as the Japanese economy transforms from medium- to high-tech production in

the face of new competition in the globalized economy. Accordingly, we are puzzled by the general

belief by Japanese experts that the value of such subunits would not get reflected in competitive bids for

successful bio-ventures.


15. Recall, however, that Japanese industrialists appear to prefer dealing with American academic

researchers so there may be significant elements of the cost-benefit relationship omitted from the simple

cost comparison.


16. Note that the two university systems are similar in their reliance on an initial screening period

followed by lifetime tenure guaranteed by the university. However, the practice appears to be different.

U.S. faculty more often move -- with life tenure -- to other universities, and more often will resign

tenured university employment for untenured opportunities in firms or research institutes. Perhaps

significantly, in America only tenured university professors can take a leave of absence -- rather than

being forced to resign previous employment -- when they accept appointment as an official of the

federal government.
17. Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong (1998) present some evidence that entrants may be more successful

in biotech research than incumbents.


18. In empirical work not reported in detail here, we tried an alternative definition of inception based on

both the primary locations and any additional secondary locations where biotech-relevant research was

reported. The results were substantially similar, but more difficult to interpret since we had to supply

missing inception years for all the secondary locations.


19. Zucker, Darby, and Brewer (1998) also included a count of the number of venture capital firms in

the BEA eligible to finance start-up entrants, but such a variable would be uniformly 0 in Japan during

this period. In addition, we experimented in regressions not reported here with the (TOPIX) earnings-

price ratio as a measure of the nationwide cost of capital. This variable performed even more poorly

than in the U.S. case (see Zucker, Darby, and Brewer 1998) with perverse (positive) coefficients

wherever it was entered. We believe that this occurred because, varying by year but not prefecture, it

serves as a fixed effects proxy for the year and, in our sample, covaried positively with underlying

factors impacting positively on biotech-using firm inception. It is frequently argued that the managers of

Japanese firms are so insulated from stock-market pressure that the absence of a significant negative

effect is not entirely surprising.


20. Zucker, Darby, and Brewer (1998) report that both stars and collaborators have positive effects in

the corresponding model for the U.S. Differences between the U.S. and Japan will be explored in

Section VI below. Note, however, that in long-run poisson regressions (not feasible here because of

the smaller number of prefectures than U.S. BEAs) Zucker, Darby, and Brewer (1998) do find some

evidence of negative effects of the number of active collaborators.
21. The two broader definitions (b) and (c) were based on "Dodwell Marketing Consultants' Industrial

Groupings in Japan." The narrower definitions (a) and (d) were based on "Keizai Chosa Kyokai's

Keiretsu no Kenkyu (KNK)." (Weinstein and Yishay Yafeh 1995, p. 367.)


22. See Section VI below for details on the stacked regressions and associated Wald test as the

technique is applied to testing for equality of coefficients for inception in Japan and the U.S.


23. These stacked regressions are not reported in full since the coefficient estimates are identical to

those in the separate regressions, representative examples of which are reported in Table 5 below.


24. Alternatively, the differences which are visually apparent may not be statistically significantly so.

Further, these differences may reflect remaining differential reporting bias in which larger firms are more

likely to claim to have been doing biotechnology from the beginning since nearly 10 percent of keiretsu

firms report entering biotechnology in the earliest possible year.


25. In the United States we use functional economic areas (BEAs) as the local areas corresponding to

prefectures in Japan.


26. The χ 2 statistic is not reported for column (d) since in that case there is only one interaction term

and the significant coefficient for Total Employment x JDUMMY is sufficient to demonstrate structural

differences.


27. There are a relatively small number of incumbents in the U.S. for which secondary locations are

included among the biotech-using firms if separate inception dates could be obtained for inception at

each location.


28. Inception dates for incumbents are generally less reliable than for entrants, and this is especially so in
Japan where many firms declare themselves early adopters of biotechnology referring to older

fermentation and other production methods based on living organisms, and not to the "new"

biotechnology based on recombinant DNA, monoclonal antibodies, and other new techniques.

          Keiretsu membership is defined by comparing our firms with those listed as in a keiretsu of a
        particular type for four different definitions in a data set generously supplied by David E.
        Weinstein and described in Weinstein and Yishay Yafeh (1995). The Big 6 are the DKB,
        Fuyo, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sanwa, and Sumitomo horizontal groups. The Big 8 are the Big 6 plus
        the Industrial Bank of Japan and Tokai groups. The Big 8 + Vertical definition adds firms that
        are members of vertical groups. The Big 6 Presidents Club definition is the narrowest, including
        only Big 6 firms whose CEOs belong to their group's Presidents Club.
