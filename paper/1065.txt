                           The Short—Run Relation Between
                       Inflation and Growth in Latin America



                                     ABSTRACT

      This   paper investigates the relationship between monetary policy and growth

in five Latin American countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru).

The analysis focuses on the effects of expected and unexpected monetary growth

on output, and explicitly incorporates the relationship between fiscal deficits

and money creation in these countries. Open economy considerations are ex-

plicitly introduced into the analysis.

      Contrary to previous findings (Hanson, 1980), the results obtained in this

paper indicate that these countries exhibit very different behavior with respect

to the relationship between unexpected money and growth: While for Chile and

Brazil no evidence was found of a positive relation between monetary policy (ex-

pected or unexpected) and growth, for Colombia, Mexico and Peru a positive

relationship was found between unexpected monetary policy and growth.

     In analyzing the relationship between unanticipated monetary policy and

growth for a group of Latin American countries, using the approach of Lucas

(1973) and Barro (1977), James Hanson (1980, p. 987) concludes that for these

countries "[A]s a rule of thumb, ten percentage points of unexpected inflation

raise output about one percentage point above trend...". However, Hanson's

results are not robust and depend critically on the functions he uses to gener-

ate expectations of monetary growth. If more general monetary processes are

used, and open economy considerations are introduced into the analysis, Hanson's

results are substantially changed.

     The purpose of this note is to show that when a monetary process that ex-

plicitly incorporates the role of fiscal deficits is considered, Hanson's

general result ——   that   suggests an elasticity of .10 between output growth and
                                                          1/
unexpected money for all these countries —— does not hold.—       In particular, this

alternative monetary process indicates that these countries exhibit very dif-

ferent behavior with respect to the relationship between unexpected money and

growth. Furthermore, Lucas' (1973) proposition of an inverse relationship be-

tween the effect of (unexpected) monetary policy and the variability of the

money supply seems to hold for these countries. The paper also incorporates

into the analysis the fact that these countries are open economies, This is done

in three ways: (1) changes in the terms of trade are explicitly incorporated as

possible determinants of growth; (2) for the case of Mexico —— which maintained

a fixed exchange rate during most of the period —— unexpected domestic credit

is also used as the relevant policy variable; (3) the possibility that all these

countries are subject to common external shocks is incorporated explicitly in

the estimation procedure.--'

     Hanson's study is •based on the estimation of equations for Brazil, Chile,

Colombia, Mexico and Peru of the following type:

 where Y is the log of real output, DYt = (log              — log        and DMR is the

 unexpected change in the log of the quantity of money, Hanson tries several

 specifications for DMRt. Some of his best results are obtained when DltRt is

 replaced by actual changes in the quantity of money DMt (Hanson, Table 1),

 and when DMRt is defined as actual growth of the quantity of money minus past

 inflation ——          =        —          (Hanson, Table 4). Table 1 presents the re-
                DMRt       DM       DPt1
sults obtained from the estimation of equation (1) using these definitions of

DMRt. Even though the data used do not correspond exactly to Hanson's, the

results are very similar.-" These results were obtained, as in Hanson's paper,

using a narrow definition of money (M1). When a broad definition of money is

used, however, the results are similar. These results, together with pooled

estimations, constitute the base of Hanson's analysis. However, as is shown be-

low, once fiscal deficits and open economy factors are introduced, the similarity

across countries of output response to monetary changes reported in Table 1 tends

to disappear.


I. Fiscal Deficit and Monetary Growth in Latin America

    A well—known feature of developing countries in general, and Latin—American

countries in particular, is that money creation is an important source of

government revenue (see, for example, Harberger, 1964, 1978; Ffrench—Davis,

1973; and Baer and Beckerman, 1974). In this section, I present results ob-

tained from the estimation of monetary growth equations that incorporate ex-

plicitly the role of the fiscal deficit in money creation. Specifically, it is

assumed that in every period the growth of the quantity of money responds par-

tially to the current fiscal deficit, and to past rates of money creation:

 where DEF is the ratio of the fiscal deficit to the quantity of money in t—1.

 The resfduals obtained from the estimation of this equation    = DM   —   DM}
 are used in section TI as a measure of unexpected money.!

     Table 2 presents the estimates of (2) for these five Latin—Anerican

 countries. In most cases, k equals 3. For Chile, however, k equals 2, and

 for Peru k equals 4, to produce white noise residuals. In addition, for

 Mexico —— the only country in the sample that had a fixed exchange for most of

 the period —— an equation for domestic credit is also reported.—' As may be

 seen, in most cases DEFt is positive and significant. One might also note that

 in all cases, the F statistic indicates that the regression is significant at

 conventional levels. The Durbin—T4atson statistic, and analysis of the autocor—

 relation functions of the residuals using the Box—Jenkins (1976) procedure show

 that the residuals of these monetary equations are white—noise, indicating that

 they are appropriate candidates for the measure of unexpected money. An im-

 portant characteristic of the money equations presented in Table 2 is that,

when measured by the standard deviation of the prediction error, they outperform

 simple autoregressions and past inflation in predicting actual changes in the

money stock.-'


II. Monetary Shocks and Growth in Latin America

    This section re—examines the relationship between growth and unexpected

monetary policy in Latin America, using the residuals from the money supply equa-

tions reported in Table 2 as a measure of unexpected money. The possible role

of changes in the terms' of trade (DTOT) in these countries' growth is also in-

vestigated. For each country, the following equation was estimated:

justify the inclusion of lagged values of DMR in equation 3. First, as Barro

(1978, P. 553) has argued, lagged DtRs may capture the effects of unexpected

monetary shocks on stock variables (like capital) that are carried forward.

The inclusion of lagged values of DMR also pick up both short—run and long—

run effects of monetary shocks on growth. While y captures the short—run
                                      k
effect of unexpected monetary shocks,     y. captures the long—run effect of
                                      i=0
these shocks. This interpretation of the coefficients of lagged values of

DNR in an equation of the type of (3) has recently been suggested by Korinendi

and McGuire (1981). Furthermore, if the natural rate hypothesis is true,
k
E       should not be significantly different from zero.
1=0
      Equation (3) was estimated in two alternative ways. First, OLS were ap-

plied for each country, using the residuals from the monetary process equations

reported in Table 2 as measures of unexpected money. Second, equation (3) was

also estimated using Zeliner's (1962) seemingly—unrelated regression procedure

(SURE) for the cases of Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru for 1954—1974. Since

all these countries are open economies, and hence are subject to common external

shocks, the residuals (Es) from the growth equations for each of them could be

correlated. The use of this CLS procedure is superior to simply pooling the

different equations since it still allows for differences in the y.'s across

countries.

      The results obtained from the OLS estimation of (3) are reported in Table

3. Table 4, on the other hand, contains the seemingly unrelated regression re-

sults from the simultaneous estimation of equations (3.1), (3.3), (3.4) and (3.6)

 for Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. As one can see the results are very

 different across countries. For Brazil and Chile, no evidence was found of

 a significant effect of unexpected money on output growth. On the other hand,

 for Colombia, Mexico and Peru, some evidence of significant positive effects

 of unexpected money on growth was found. However, the significant coeffi-

 cients for unexpected money changes vary widely in both magnitude and lags.21

The results for Mexico are particularly interesting. While none of the y.'s

 is significant when unexpected changes in domestic credit are used, a posi-

tive, significant coefficient for       is found when M1 is used as the relevant

monetary aggregate. This is, to some extent, surprising, since one would expect

that in the case of a small open economy with fixed exchange rates, domestic

credit would be the relevant policy variable.1' The results presented j

Tables 3 and 4 also indicate that changes in the terms of trade are positively

related to output growth in these countries (0 is positive in all cases).

However, these coefficients are only significant at the conventional levels

for the cases of Chile and Nexico.


III. Money, Inflation and Growth in Brazil and Chile

      According to the discussion presented in the preceding section, for

Brazil and Chile, unexpected monetary changes have no effects on output growth.

These results, however, appear to be inconsistent with Hanson's findings ——

reported   in panel B of Table 1 of this paper. This inconsistency is more ap-

parent than real, and is due to the peculiar definition of unexpected money used
           11/
by Hanson.—      In order to investigate this problem further, I re—estimated

Hanson's equations without restricting the coefficients of DM and DPt1 to

be equal and opposite. The results for Brazil and Chile are:

         As may be seen, in both cases the coefficient of actual money changes is

not significant, while for Brazil the coefficient for past inflation is sig-

nificantly negative. Furthermore, for Brazil the restriction imposed by 1anson

of equality (with opposite signs) of the coefficients of DN and DPt1 is re-

jected at the conventional levels. When these results are looked at from this

perspective, they are perfectly consistent with our previous findings reported

in section II: in these highly inflationary countries, money growth (actual

and unexpected) has no effect on output growth. However, inflation tends to

have a significantly negative effect on growth in these countries.

    Financial Statistics. For Peru and Brazil, real GDP obtained from U.N.

    National Accounts was used. For Mexico, real CDP from ECLA,   as   re—

    ported in UCLAs Statistical Abstract of Latin America, was used. For

    Chile, data on real CDP taken from Ffrench—Davis (1973) was used.


2. Money (Ml and M2) and Domestic Credit: For Brazil, Colombia, Mexico

    and Peru, yearly averages constructed from the IFS raw data were used.

    For Chile, the series reported in Ffrench—Davis (1973) were used.


3. Prices: For Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, the data was taken from

    the IFS. For Chile, Ffrench—Davis series were used.


4. Terms of Trade: Taken from ECLA's "America Latina: Relacio de Te'rminos

   de Intercambio, 1928—1976".


5. Fiscal Deficit: For Brazil, Colombia, and Peru the data was taken from

    the IFS, For Chile, data from Ffrench—Davis (1973) was used. For Mexico,

    from Anuario Estadstico Compendiado (various issues).

                                       FOOTNOTES


1/On the relationship between money creation and fiscal deficits see, for
   example, Harberger (1964, 1978), Ffrench—Davis (1973), Aglieveli and Khan
   (1978) and Baer and Beckerman (1974). Hanson (1980), p. 975) acknowledges
   the importance of monetary emission as a source of government revenue in
  Latin America. However, he does not incorporate the fiscal deficit as an
   explanatory variable in his money supply processes,

•0n the relationship between growth and monetary policy in an open economy
  using a Lucas—Barro type of framework see Leiderman (1979), Blejer and
  Fernandez (1980) and Darby (1982). Barro (1978) also included a terms of trade
  variable in his study of the U.S. case. An alternative way of introducing open
  economy considerations is to include the growth of international reserves in
  the money supply equation. Results obtained using this formulation for the
  case of Latin America do not alter the results presented in this paper.


    have followed, as far as pQssible, the indications in Hanson's (p. 979)
  paper to construct my data. However, I have deliberately introduced some
  changes. In particular, I have used ECLA's data on GDP for Brazil and Mexico,
  since it is well known   that   the IFS data set contains serious flaws in these
  series for the earlier periods. In private communication, Hanson has indi-
  cated to me that his monetary data for Colombia was taken from the Banco de
  la Republica Bulletin. In this study, however, the monetary data for Colombia
  and other countries —— except Chile ——    are yearly averages constructed from
  the IFS data. See the Appendix for further details on the data. The non—
  significance of a1 for Colombia contrasts with Hanson's results. The reason
  for this is the different monetary series used.


     is important to note that the use of equations of this type to generate ex-
  pectations of money growth implicitly assumes that their parameters are stable
  through the period. The reason for this is that, as Barro (1977, p. 105—6)
  has pointed out, this procedure uses future information (not available at t—i)
  to generat the estimated ci parameters. If these parameters are not stable,

  however, a period by period sequential up—dating procedure should be implemented.

-'For all countries, equations for M1, N2 and domestic credit were fitted. How-
  ever, due to space considerations, only the "best" results —— as measured by
  the standard error of the regression ——    are reported in Table 2. For the
                                         —13—




   cases of Brazil, Colombia and Peru, the residuals from the domestic credit
   equations exhibited serially—correlated errors.

 -'With the exception of one case (Chile when three—period lagged inflation is

   used to predict money), these equations' predictive power outperforms those
   used by Hanson.

 'lt is important to note that the parameters of equations (2) and (3) are
   related, and that both equations could be estimated simultaneously imposing
   cross—equation restrictions. Results obtained using this approach for these
   Latin—American countries confirm the main conclusions presented in this paper.

 Chile was not included in the SURE estimations in order for the estimations
   to be based on a longer time period, Other sets of equations were also simul-
   taneously estimated using SURE. The results are not reported here due to
   space considerations. Equation (3) was also estimated in terms of levels.
   The results obtained support the conclusions presented in this paper.


     may be seen in Table 3, the null hypothesis that the ys are significant as
   a group cannot be rejected at the conventional levels, Also, for all coun-
   tries ——   except Peru —— the hypothesisi=O
                                             Z y = 0 cannot be rejected at the 5%
                                               i
   level.


--"Blejer and Fernandez (1980), in a study on Mexico that distinguishes between
   tradable and non—tradable goods, have found a positive effect of unexpected
   increases in domestic credit on non—tradables output.

'However, it may be noted that theoretically, under certain restrictive as—
   sumptions (expected money growth equals growth in nominal money demand, and
   expected rate of inflation equals past inflation), it is possible to relate
   (DN —    DPi)   to unexpected money growth.
