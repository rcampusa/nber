                                  ABSTRACT



     This paper examines six possible reforms of the U.S. personal income

tax system.   The paper evaluates the proposals by estimating the dynamic

analog to compensating variations using a medium-scale general equilibrium

model designed to allow a broad range of tax policies.          We find that pro-

posals to index the tax system for inflation tend to provide large welfare

gains, while other measures designed to raise the net-of-tax return to

capital are successful to the extent that they serve as ad hoc-offsets

for inflation or to the extent that they partially integrate the corporate

and personal income taxes.      Results also indicate that intertemporal and

interindustry efficiency gains are of comparable importance.           Finally,

results suggest that additional intertemporal welfare gains can be achieved

at the cost of a more regressive over-all tax structure.

     Economic research as well as popular attention has focused in recent

years on the intertemporal and interindustry efficiency distortions in

the U. S. tax system.    This paper estimates the welfare gains from proposals

intended to reduce distortions imposed by the present tax structure, and

notes the degree to which these gains derive from intertemporal or inter-

industry corrections.    Our model and results support three propositions.

First, the proper allocation of new capital is as crucial as the creation

of new capital itself.    Second, tax reform plans to index the system against

inflation are more potent in this combined task of increasing savings and

allocating investment efficiently than are ad hoc measures designed to en-

courage saving, such as interest income exclusions, capital gains exclusions

or pension liberalization.    Finally, larger welfare gains from removal of

intertemporal and interindustry distortions entail the cost of a less pro-

gressive tax structure, since high income groups tend to save a higher

proportion of their income.

     We examine six alternative plans which might be discussed in an ef-

fort to increase consumer savings through the personal income tax system

in the United States.    These plans attempt to affect savings through an in-

crease in the real rate of return either by direct tax cuts on savings or by

indexing tax rates against inflation.   The paper.presents estimates of static

and dynamic resource allocation effects for the six plans, and compares them

to results obtained in earlier work on the impacts of more sweeping reforms.

A medium-scale numerical general equilibrium model is used which integrates

the U. S. tax system with consumer demand behavior by household and producer

behavior by industry.

     The static or annual welfare measures are derived by comparing the

1973 base year to a single counterfactual equilibrium, and they concentrate

mostly on interindustry distortions.      Ranking the six plans by the size of·

the gain, results indicate that extensive inflation indexation of the U.         s.
tax system would yield the largest annual static efficiency gain, more

than $4 billion (1973 dollars).     Excluding 60% of dividends from the per-

sonal tax base would have an effect about half as large, while indexing

capital gains alone would further reduce the gain.     Proposals to exclude

70% of interest income from the personal tax base or to decrease the capital

gains inclusion to 30% augment welfare still less.     A plan to increase pen-

sion, Keogh, and IRA maxima and to expand their scope engenders fairly

small static welfare gains because they do not operate so as to decrease

interindustry distortions in the allocation of capital.

     Our dynamic measures of welfare gain are derived by comparing an en-

tire sequence of equilibria under the new-tax regime to the sequence gen-

erated from the 1973 tax regime.    It not only captures gains from reducing

capital misallocation, but also records intertemporal efficiency gains

from reducing the "double tax" on savings.     Dynamic effects exceed static

ones, and our analysis indicates that the extensive indexation plan     may
yield gains whose present value is approximately $200 billion, or about 1/2

of 1% of the discounted present value of an "expanded" income stream to the

U. S. economy after correction for population     growth.~1   The dividend ex-

clusion yields present value gains of about $100 billion, while the other

plans are less successful.   Plans differ in their distributional impacts,

although these findings depend on the nature of replacement taxes used to

preserve government revenues.     The size of dynamic resource allocation ef-
                                    - 3 -


fects are sensitive to the choice of the replacement tax, while static gains

are more robust.

     The relative magnitude of the gains involved depend largely on one's

perspective.   They could be treated as upper bounds, since the disequi1ib-

rium losses likely to be incurred are not captured in our model.       On   the

other hand, the size of the gains is reduced by our assumption that financial

policies do not change.      The best plans discussed here offer welfare bene-

fits approximately as large as those accruing with the complete integration

of the corporate and personal income taxes, as discussed in Fullerton, King,

Shoven, and Whalley (1980a and 1980b).

     At least four choices greatly influence the size of welfare gains and

the proportions of those gains derived from removal of interindustry and

intertempora1 distortions.      First, we employ 0,,4 for the uncompensated

savings elasticity with respect to the net rate of return.       Intertemporal

distortions would be greater, and hence their role more important, if this

elasticity were higher. 11     Second, we use .04 to discount future welfare

gains from intertempora1 corrections.       These would be more (less) signifi-

cant if a larger   (~ma11er)   discount rate were used.   Third, since each of the

plans involves at least a short-term revenue loss, we assume that the gov-

ernment balances its budget by scaling up personal marginal tax rates or· by

imposing lump-sum taxes on consumers.       We describe this scaling procedure

more thoroughly in Section III.      Because scaled marginal rates apply to in-

come from both labor and capital, the effect is to remove only a portion

of the intertemporal distortion     while allowing any given reform plan to have

full interindustry effects.      Fourth, our estimates of the elasticity of 8ub-

stitution between capital and labor in each industry vary between 0.6 and
                                    - 4-


1.0.     Higher elasticities of substitution would imply larger interindustry

distortions.      Consequently, the relative size of gains from the removal of

interindustry and intertemporal distortions cannot be forecast with pre-

cision.     Our results make it apparent, however, that the order of magnitude

of the gains is similar.


I.     Saving, Inflation, and Income Taxation.

       The U. S. tax system's treatment of capital imposes two major types

·of distortion.    The first of these is an intertemporal one.   Savings occur

of of after-tax income, yet its return may be taxed again by both the cor-

porate and personal income taxes.     This additional taxation has the effect

of raising the cost of saving, thus biasing consumption plans towards the

present and away from the future.     The second large distortion is an inter-

industry one.     Different industries incur different effective capital tax

rates due to varying degrees of incorporation, age structures of assets,

debt/equity ratios, and other financial policies.     Rational investors will

equalize rates of return net of all taxes that discriminate by industrial

location.    Therefore, as producers set the marginal cost of capital equal

to its marginal product, the latter must differ by industry.     Reallocation

of capital from low to high marginal product industries could consequently

increase total product.

       Both intertemporal and interindustry distortions are aggravated by

the presence of inflation.     With respect to taxes on labor income, the progres-

sive nature of the personal income tax (PIT) ensures rising marginal and

average tax rates for individuals as inflation occurs, unless rates are

systematically reduced.     Since saving varies positively with real income,

the effect of inflation through its impact on the personal income tax may
                                - 5 -


be to reduce private saving.

     With respect to taxes on capital income, inflation creates illusory

capital gains which are nonetheless taxed as if they were real.   The value

of shares in an industry should rise by an amount approximately equal to che

inflation rate times that industry's ownership of capital stock, and these

purely nominal gains are then taxed as income.   Inflation simultaneously

reduces the real value of permissable depreciation deductions for calculating

the corporate or personal income tax base.    Furthermore, with the deduction

of interest payments and inclusion of interest income in tax bases, inflation

lowers the effective rate of tax on borrowers and increases the rate on

lenders.   Because industries differ with respect to (a) the proportians of

capital gains that are real and nominal, (b) the age structure of their as-

sets, and (~) the proportion of investment financed by debt, the effect of

infTation will not only increase capital taxes on real capital income, but will

do so differentially by industry.

     The present tax system thus contains a considerable anti-savings bias,

aggravated by its inflation non-neutrality.   Consequently, there exists a

prima facie case for encouraging saving through the tax system and its

treatment of inflation.   Since proposals to increase saving through the tax

system do so by increasing the return to postponed consumption, and as in-

flation increases effective personal and corporate income tax rates, pro-

posals to promote saving tend to partially offset the real effects of in-

flation.   Conversely, attempts to make taxes on labor and capital income

inflation neutral11 will increase the real return to saving.   Welfare ef-

fects of a plan to raise savings and reduce intertemporal distortions will

be heavily influenced by the reform's impact on reducing interindustry dis-
                                    - 6 -



tortions caused by inflation, and vice versa.

     Advocates and opponents of various proposals to increase saving and

index taxes have taken sides with necessarily partial knowledge of their

plans' long term productive and distributive impacts.      Our estimates

below show that the effects of typical proposals on national income vary

considerably, while distributive impacts range from extremely regressive

to approximately neutral.      The remainder of the paper evaluates some of

these tax reform proposals by simulating them in a dynamic general equi-

1ibirum model of the U. S. economy.

     This model, developed by Fullerton, Shoven, and Whalley for the U. S.

T!easury Department, is based on disaggregated micro data.      It captures the

effects of a tax change on factor prices and output prices, thus measuring

both the sources side and uses side of income simultaneously.      The initial

parameters are obtained in a manner that ,allows us to replicate the 1973

U. S. economy as an equilibrium.      We assume that the 1973 economy was both

in equilibrium and that it was on a steady-state growth path.     Welfare im-

pacts of a proposal are then determined by calculating its model-equivalent

form, obtaining an equilibrium for a counterfactua1 economy in which the re-

form has   b~en   implemented, and then comparing this economy to the unaltered

base equilibrium sequence.

     The next section formally introduces and describes six concrete propo-

sals for tax structure reform.     These plans are similar at least in spirit

to existing proposals in government and political circles.     The third section

discusses the general equilibrium model used to evaluate the proposals

and notes the sources for the data and exogenous parameter values employed.

Section IV considers the simulation results obtained, while a concluding

section summarizes the insights they reveal.      Finally, in an Appendix we
                                        - 7 -



    specify how each tax proposal is translated into modelled rate and equa-

    tion changes'for the purpose of calculating the counterfactua1 economy.


    II.   Six Reforms.

          The first proposal considered, P1, is a plan to raise the maximum

    amounts deductible for employer or employee contributions to pension plans,

    Keogh self-employment plans and IRA retirement accounts.-
                                                                   4/ The plan's

    primary goal is to encourage     savi~g,    and it does far less to remove inter-

    industry distortions or to correct for inflation.         Increasing these maxima

    effectively serves to reduce the proportion of an individual's savings sub-

    ject to taxation, and thus reduces the inter·tempora1 distortion caused by

    the tax system.      In principle, any plan to expand pension/Keogh/IRA cover-

    age or to raise their ceilings has an ambiguous effect on inducing new

    savings.   While the price effect is clearly positive, since the effective

    cost of postponing consumption is reduced, the income effect is likely to

    have a negative impact.      Since we use an estimate from Boskin (1978) of .4

    for the uncompensated elasticity of savings with respect to the net rate of

    return, our results show that P1 does have a strong, positive        imp~ct   on

    savings.

          The second proposal considered, P2, makes 70% of personal interest re-

~   ceipts deductible from the personal tax base.        While P2's supporters may in-

    tend to encourage saving and partially index capital income against inflation,

    the latter goal is not systematically achieved.         Nominal interest income

    is already deductible on the borrower's side.         As corporate business is a

    major net debtor,    thi~   treatment means that inflation could have a nega-

    tive effect on real tax rates for interest income, more than removing any

    double taxation.     The plan may exacerbate the debt/equity distortion
                                      - 8 -



 already existing with the corporate income tax on only equity income.



        Since only certain forms of savings are encouraged by an interest in-

 come exclusion, one would expect it to be a less potent savings inducement
       .     ..                             5/          It might have a larger wel-
 than l1beral1zat10n of the pension programs.-
 fare gain, however, since the interest exclusion generates reductions in

 interindustry and other distortions, as industries with disproportionately

 large amounts of debt finance tend to be relatively highly taxed by cor-

 porate or other tax systems.

        The third proposal consists of the imposition of a60% dividends ex-

 clusion from the personal income tax basJYcombined with the elimination of

 the $100 dividend deduction. i   /   As   the value of the $100 deduction amounts

 to only about 4% of dividends paid in 1973, the net effect is to substantia1-

 ly reduce the average rate of taxation on personal savings.        The effect on

 the marginal rate is still stronger:         those with dividend income above $100

 receive the majority of dividend income.        Therefore, the $100 deduction is

 primarily a lump-sum transfer to dividend recipients, and has little impact

 on marginal tax rates.    Since dividends as a return to savings are taxed at

 both   theco~porate   and personal level, increasing the exclusion helps e1im-

 inate an important source of intertemporal distortion.         Furthermore, due to

~different rates of incorporation and financial policies across industries,
            on dividends
 the extra tax/implies various rates among various industries. The ef-

 ficiency gains from dividend exclusion may therefore be especially strong.

        P4 is based on a recent proposal by Senator Russell Long (D.-La.) to

 reduce the percentage of capital gains includable in the personal income

 tax to 30%.    While P4 may be partially intended to counteract the rising

 effective capital tax rates due to inflation, it does so in an ad hoc
                                      - 9 -


manner.   Its main consequence is to raise the rate of return to holding

corporate stock.    As with P2 and P3, only one of several forms of savings

receives a reduction in intemporal distortion, and then only a partial one.

Their relative potencies will depend on the extent to which interindiustry

distortions are also lessened.        Welfare gains will also be affected by

the plans' distributional impacts, primarily because of different propen-

sities to save.     Since high income consumers save a higher proportion of

their incomes, a progressive (regressive) tax change will tend to reduce

(increase ) t h e aggregate proport i on   0   f i ncome   saved. ~/
     In contrast to P4, the next plan does involve the inflation indexation

of capital gains.     The added real tax burdens on capital gains income               i~


posed by inflation may cause significant net welfare losses, as well as

creating large income redistributions.              On the other hand, an inflation in-

dexation proposal would be slightly more difficult to implement than any

of the plans previously mscussed. Any scheme would be necessarily imperfect

since a perfect price index dces.not exist.                Once a price index is chosen,

the base purchase price used in the calculation of capital gains can be
                                                T
readily adjusted upward by a factor            ~~i (l~(t»      ,   where   ~(t)   is the

inflation rate in year     t,   and    T   is the number of years for which the

asset is held.     In our calculations we compare indexation to a benchmark

equilibrium with a .perpetual 7% inflation rate, the rate recorded in 1973.

The degrees of excludability allowed in P2 and P3 were chosen with the in-

tention of making them comparable in terms of additional capital formation

to P5.

     The final proposal considered, P6, is one designed to almost complete-

ly index taxes on income from capital against inflation. 9 !               It is the only
                                      - 10 -



plan involving changes to tax laws other than on the personal income tax.

P6 includes the indexation of depreciation deductions for corporate in-

come taxes, incorporates the indexation of capital gains, and also involves

changes in the treatment of interest income.             Taxation of dividends at a     1
constant rate with only insignificant deductions renders its taxation ap-               J
proximately inflation-neutral.         The other major taxes such as those on           I
property and rent income, are also approximately ad valorem taxes on

 factor income, and as such are inflation neutral.            In general, any tax

 levied in an ad valorem fashion, either on a product or on a fac-

 tor's income,      will be inflation neutral.        A tax with a variable average

 rate or which taxes nominal value that fails to increase pari passu with

 inflation will have its effective rate vary with inflation.

       Depreciation allowance indexation requires that each corporate or non-

corporate firm's taxable income in year           k   be reduced by the amount
 k
~=~, (l~(t»·DEPR(k)          where   k'    is the year in which the firm's capi-

tal assets were purchased and DEPR(k) is the historical cost depreciation

allowance in year      k.     Obviously, the computational problem grows in com-

plexity when one admits the possibility that firms purchase various assets

in different years.         Nonetheless, the practical problems of implementation

~are   far from insurmountable.

        Indexation of capital gains corresponds exactly to that of plan 5.

 Finally, interest indexing in P6 involves the deduction of interest income

 from the personal income tax base equal to the rate of inflation times the

 base value of interest-earning assets.          However, deduction of interest pay-

 ments from the corporate income tax base must be cut by             n(t) times the

 value of their interest-receiving        1~abi1ities.     Household interest deduc-

 tions on    n(t)    times their interest      beari~g   liabilities are also barred.
                                  - 11-




       Given the above tax adjustments, the only significant impact of unan-

ticipated inflation   ~n   real capital income earnings will be to impose lump-

sum gains on debtors and losses on lenders.     When P6 is implemented, a

corporation's capital tax rate will be unchanged by inflation regardless of

its financial policies.      Individuals are taxed only on the returns to their

investments, rather than on the returns plus       ~(t)   times their interest-bear-

ing assets.


III.    The General Equilibrium Model.

       We use an empirical general equilibrium model previously developed

by Fullerton, Shoven and Whalley to simulate the effects of different tax
                10/
reform proposals.-- It has been constructed as a general purpose model,

but is particularly well' suited to analyze specific tax policy changes.        Its

construction from disaggregated    microeco~omic   data allows interindustry

distinctions unobtainable in most macroeconomic models.        A brief outline of

the model is provided here.

       The economy is divided into nineteen profit-maximizing industries,

each of which produces a single output from a,combination of capital services,

labor serv~ces, and the outputs of other industries.        Capital services are in

fixed supply during a given period, but grow over time as investment occurs.

Labor endowment is in fixed supply at any instant, but grows over time at

a constant rate.    Labor supply in any period is variable and equals ag-

gregate labor endowment less leisure:.time.     Labor s,Upply is thus determined

by leisure demands, which depend on relative prices and income.         Both

labor and capital are perfectly mobile across industries.

       Each industry has a Cobq-Douglas or other Constant Elasticity of Sub-

stitution (CES) production function 'over primary inputs, where the elas-
                                        - 12-




    ticity of substitution is chosen as a       t~est-guess"   value from evidence in

    the literature.   Each output is used in part as an intermediate input through

    a fixed-coefficient input-output matrix.       Outputs can also be purchased by

    government, used for investment, or be converted via a fixed coefficient

    transformation into one of fifteen consumer goods.         There is a simple for-

    eign trade sector to close the model, but for all practical purposes this

    model of the U. S.   e~onomy   should be considered to be a closed one.

         There are twelve consumer classes, differentiated by their 1973 income

    levels.   Consumers in each class possess initial endowments of labor and

    capital services which can be sold for use in production or to government.

    Perfect factor mobility' and perfect competition combine to ensure equality

    of the net-of-tax return among industries.       As noted above, a consumer can

    also choose to buy some of his own labor endowment as leisure.         We model all

    gov.ernment transfers as essentially lump-sum payments to consumer groups in

    proportion to their observed 1973 receipts from social security, unemploy-

    ment compensation, food stamps, and other welfare programs.

         Consumer demand functions are based on CES utility functions with

    double nesting.   The choice between present and future consumption is rep-

    resented by the outside nest, and the elasticity of substitution between

~   those two types of consumption is based on an estimate of the uncompen-

    sated savings elasticity with respect to the net-of-tax rate of return.

    We use the value of 0.4 found by Boskin (1978). The breakdown of present

    consumption into commodities and leisure is represented by the inside nest,

    and the elasticity of substitution between those two subsets is based on an

    estimate of the uncompensated labor supply elasticity with respect to the

    net-of-tax wage. For this latter value we use 0.15. This choice is discussed

in Fullerton (1980a). All classes have the same form of utility function, and

identical labor supply and savings elasticities. They do have different de-

mands for all commodities, however, with the parameters determined from

Consumer Expenditure Survey data.

     The various Federal, state and local taxes are typically modelled as

ad valorem tax rates on purchases of appropriate products or factors.           Cor-

porate income taxes and property taxes are modelled as different effective

rates of tax on use of capital by industry. Social security, workmen's com-

pensation and unemployment insurance appear as industry taxes on labor use.

Personal income taxes operate as different linear schedules for each con-

sumer group, with marginal tax rates increasing from an average of 1% for

the lowest income group to 40% for the highest income group.

     In our benchmark model   inflation has effects on real taxes       through

the capital gains and interest income taxes and by the use of depreciation

allowances based on historical costs. Consequently, inflation has the real

effect of altering each industry's tax on use of capital services

and hence its effective price of capital services.       On the other

hand, the inflation rate remains an exogenously specified parameter.

There is   an implicit presumption in the model   that   various

tax policies do not have differential impacts on the inflation rate itself.

Instead, the model has been adjusted to obtain 'different effective capital

tax rates for different inflation rates.   Effective capital tax rates are

calculated by measuring each industry's real use of capital services with

replacement cost depreciation.

     The model is parameterized for 1973 using data from the National

Income and Product Accounts, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Ex-

penditure Survey, and the Treasury Department's merged tax file.        These

ures and for general equilibrium consistency requirements. / This "bench-

mark" data set is used to solve backwards for relevant preference parameters

and tax rates. so that the model solution can replicate the benchmark equi-

1ibrium.   The user can specify different tax rates       a~d   equations to re-

calculate a simulated "counterfactua1" equilibrium with different resource

allocations for comparison with the benchmark.        The model is solved using

Merrill's variant of Scarf's algorithm for an equilibrium price vector

where excess demands and profits are zero.

     Capital accumulation occurs through the act of saving by consumers and

replacement investment by firms. less depreciation.         Savings is treated as

the sixteenth consumer good, and involves the purchase of producer goods in

fixed proportions to form a composite investment good.           The conversion from

expected future consumption to demand for savings is based on a myopic ex-

pectations assumption:     consumers take the current return to capital as the

expected future return in deciding how much to save.        In a steady state,

this myopia will turn out to be realistic.

     The notion of a static benchmark equilibrium is extended to a bench-

mark steady state in which all values grow proportionately           at the effective

labor force growth rate.    Labor force growth is evenly divided between popu-

lation changes and Harrod-neutral technical progress.           A tax policy change

causes divergence from the original steady state path, and alters the economy's

factor ratio and utility levels at any instant.        The model's essential

convexity makes asymptotic convergence to a new steady state path an almost

certain event.     The new steady state   i~   characterized by a new constant

ratio of effective labor units to capital service units and unchanging rela-

tive prices.     The net adVisability of a policy change will depend on the

    size and timing of changes in consumer utility levels, the distribution of

    those changes, and the discount rate used to compare the two sequences.

         It is important to recognize the somewhat limited sense in which we

    simulate general equilibria.    Various financial policies are captured in

    our modelling of capital income distribution flows, but we assume these poli-

    cies to be fixed because we have no estimates of the elasticities of cor-

    porate financial policy with respect to the effective prices of finance.

    Therefore, for example, a reduction in the dividends includability in the

    PIT base does not induce corporations to alter the fraction of net income

    they distribute as dividends.    This assumption of corporate non-responsive-

    ness causes the present value estimates to be biased downwards.            Sensitivity

    analysis can be performed by allowing corporations 'to alter their financial

    patterns in a logical direction but by an essentially arbitrary amount.

    It has been found that       extreme corporate reaction assumptions lead to

    welfare gains of roughly 50 to 100% more than the gains registered in the

    nonresponsive case.

         The model as specified does not include aspects of disequilibrium such

    as factor unemployment.   It measures real effects without a money equation,

    expressing all prices in relative terms.      Voluntary unemployment is captured

~   through the labor/leisure choice, though, and the interaction of exogenous-

    ly specified inflation with effective tax rates is modelled by adjusting

    those rates appropriately.     The model is thus complementary to short-run

    Keynesian disequilibrium models rather than competitive with them.

         Finally, the model requires that government run a balanced budget. 13 /

    Therefore, when policy changes generate alterations in the tax equations

    and parameters, the revenue gain or.loss implied cannot be recorded as a
                                   - 16 -


government surplus or deficit.      The model further specifies that the gov-

ernment obtain a specific real value of goods and services over time, with

its purchasing power defined by means of a Laspeyres price index.            Conse-

quently, each policy change that implies a loss of government purchasing

power must be compensated by a tax increase that just offsets that loss.

The model is constructed to allow for automatic changes in the income tax

structure to provide the extra tax to maintain an "equal yield."         This

equal yield can be realized by imposing a lump-sum tax on all consumer groups

in proportion to their initial net incomes, or by increasing the marginal

tax rate of each class by a constant amount (additive scaling), or by multi-

plying the marginal rate of each class by a constant fraction (multiplica-

tive scaling).     This last method can impose severe deadweight losses on the

economy, because proportionately more of the revenue is obtained from the

high7income, high-saving class.      Some might prefer' its progressive nature,

however, since the capital tax reductions of the six proposals are often

regressive.      Rather than comment on the desirability of different distributional

impacts, we present the reader with alternative replacement taxes.           The

tradeoff between efficiency and distributional impacts will be noted below.

  *These welfare measures involve calculating a sequence of momentary equilibria
   through time with increments to the capital and labor service endowments of
   the economy through savings and population growth. We consider ten equi-
   libria at 5 year periods with an appropriate treatment of the terminal con-
   ditions. The dynamic compensating variations are analogues of static con-
   cepts applied to the consumption sequence over time assuming the first
   period discount factor is unchanged.

 **The   types of scaling are explained in the text.

***The numbers in parentheses represent the gain as a percentage of the dis-
   counted value of welfare (consumption plus leisure) in the base sequence.
   This value is $45 trillion for all comparisons, and accounts for only a .
   population the size of that in 1973.

              Column (5):      These figures give the first year's price of capital services relative to the price of labor ser-
                               vices (when multiplicative scaling was used in the simulation). In the benchmark steady state

We then obtain the number of dollars needed to pay each consumer in each

period to be able to reach the    H sequence of the benchmark, and discount

those dollars by the assumed 4% discount rate.

     Table 2 presents a number of summary statistics for the six plans,

including the static or annual measures of welfare gain in columns I and 2.

The static measures of efficiency shown in column I are the changes in ex-

panded income, defined as the sum of national income plus leisure, evalu-

ated at the geometric mean of pre- and post-policy change prices.    Column

two gives the percentage change of national income alone, and can thus be

affected by labor/leisure choices.    We use the real income figures rather

than. compensating or equivalent variations in static comparisons because

the utility contribution of savings may be inaccurately assessed by con-

sumers due to their myopic expectations.

     Column 3 shows the revenue shortfalls generated by the various proposals

when revenues are replaced by lump-sum taxes on. consumers.   This type of re-

placement tax was used here to isolate the effects of the plan without com-

bined effects from scaling marginal tax rates.    A "cost-effectiveness" ratio,

equal to the dynamic welfare gain with multiplicative scaling divided by

this first year revenue shortfall is also computed and shown in column

4.   Column 5 presents the relative price of capital services in the first

year and column 6 the relative price of capital in year 50.    The latter

set of figures should be close to the steady state price ratio.     Column

7 gives the first year's percentage increase of savings over the bench-

mark value for each reform, while column 8 gives the same figure for
                                    - 22 -


year 50.   Finally, column 9 provides the percentage increase in capital

stock after 50 years with each reform.

     Table 3 presents the twelve income classes along with the distribution-

al results of each plan.       We examine only the initial distribution effects

from the static model because the dynamic model is not able to obtain sat-

isfactory estimates of distributional impacts.         Table 4 shows the nineteen

industries in the model, and presents a comparison of capital tax rates by

industry for the six plans.

     Examining Table 1 first, it is apparent that the P6 extensive index-

ing plan dominates all other proposals by large amounts, regardless of the

replacement tax.       Welfare gains are about $200 billion in present value.

Results of sensitivity analysis suggest that the added depreciation de-

duction accounts for most of the gain.        A reason for the strong showing

of both P6 and the P3dividends exclusion proposal, with about $100 billion

of gains, lies largely in their removal of interindustry distortions.

They both go a long way towards reducing taxes on capital and thus much

intertemporal distortion as well. 14    fn   fact, the gain from inflation index-

ing is nearly equal to the elsewhere estimated gain from full integration

of the corporate and personal income taxes. lil        It is also evident from

Table 1 that there is a sizeable welfare gain to be had from the F5 indexing

capital gains alone, over $60 billion.         This exceeds by more than $30

billion the gain from P4" (jncreasing the capital gains exclusion to 70%).

To lielp explain this result, turn briefly to Table 4, which suggests that

P5 (gains indexing) is more successful than P4 (gains exclusion) in re-

ducing the effective capital tax rates on those industries with particu-

larly high rates, thus giving it a stronger interindustry effect.         That

it also reduces    f     (the average proportion of capital income taxable by
                                       - 23 -


the personal income tax} by a larger amount attests to its superior ability

in reducing intertemporal distortions as well.

        The dynamic welfare benefits from adopting PI (pensions liberalization)

or P2 (interest exclusion) are comparable to the gains from implementing

P4 (capital gains exclusion).           This result in itself is noteworthy, since

it suggests that interindustry effects are extremely important.                PI offers

purely intertemporal efficiency gains, and P2 offers large intertemporal
                             16
benefits relative to P4.          /   Nonetheless, P4 compensates by achieving

greater interindustry gains than PI or P2.                Note, however, that the weight

of the intertemporal gains is apparently greater for the lump-sum replace-

ment, where intertemporal efficiency gains are not offset by revenue-pre-

serving taxes on both labor and capital income.

        The static welfare results in the first two columns of Table 2 conform

to the pattern set in Table 1, with the exception of a reversal of ranking

of P4    (~apital   gains exclusion) and PI (pensions liberalization).          Pension

liberalization looks relatively worse here because the static measures do

not adequately capture intertemporal effects, where it is strongest.               P2

(jnterest exclusion) does relatively            bette~,   though in the case of multi-

plicative scaling for tax replacement it actually induces a fall in national

income.

        Turning to column 3 of Table 2,it is seen that the extensive indexa-

tion package requires a much larger income tax increase to offset its im-

plementation than does any other plan.             The interest exclusion plan also

demands a rather large replacement tax, particularly relative to the size

of the welfare gain it offers.          Proposals 3 (dividends exclusion), 4 (gains

exclusion) and 5 (gains indexation) require relatively small replacement

taxes, and thus have high cost-effectiveness ratios, shown in column 4.

While the cost-effectiveness ratio provides a rough indicator of net benefits

per dollar of tax revenue» it does not demonstrate that these plans are most

desirable in the sense of, providing the largest net gains or savings in-

creases.

        The price of capital services relative to the price of labor services

appears in columns 5 and 6 in Table 2.                      The expected return to saving in

this model is

     to absorb part of the efficiency gains in increased leisure time further

    raises the capital/labor      ratio~

           Columns 7 and 80f Table 2 present savings responses to each of the

    proposals.     Pl~   the direct savings subsidy, has the largest impact, followed

    closely by the extensive indexation plan.       The other savings plans gener-

    ate an amount of savings roughly 1% over the benchmark case in each year.

    Column 9 provides similar information, that PI and then P6 do the most to

    raise future capital stocks through savings.

           Looking at the distributional patterns appearing in Table 3, importance

    of the form of tax replacement is evident:       multiplicative scaling greatly

    enhances the gains or reduces the losses of the poorer classes.          On   the

    other hand, multiplicative scaling induces lower welfare gains °in both the

    static and dynamic present value estimates than either other replacement.

    It has been found both here and elsewhere that a strong tradeoff exists

    between the size of the welfare gain and its distribution to the poorer

    classes. 17/   This is only mitigated on occasion by the fact that the very

    bottom income groups, consisting largely of retirees, own significant amounts

    of capital.

           All proposals are regressive when additive scaling is used for tax re-

    placement.     In the case of PI (pension    liberalization)~   the first eight

~   classes are made worse off.       P6 (extensive indexation) is only weakly re-

    gressive under additive scaling, and no class is made worse off.

          Examining the distributional effects with multiplicative scaling for

    tax   replacement~   we find that all plans show bimodal curves for percentage

    benefit gains.       This stems from the U-shaped distribution of the capital!

    labor ratio across income classes, so that any plan which increases           P
                                                                                   k
    or cuts taxes on capital will tend to have a U-shaped distribution of gains.
                                - 26 -



PI remains a somewhat regressive plan.     With the exception of benefits

accruing to the twelfth income class, the distribution effects of P3

(dividends exclusion) and P4 (gains exclusion) are not far from being

proportionate.   Again excluding the twelfth class, P6 (extensive indexation)

even enjoys a progressive distribution of gains.     All proposals provide a

percentage gain to the richest class far larger than to any other class.

P6, however, is a Pareto improvement in the sense that every class is made

'better off regardless of the tax replacement.

     The capital tax rates presented in Table 4 are valuable for comparisons
 relative
of/interindustry tax differentials. The rates do not iriclude certain pen-

sion tax exclusions modelled as general savings subsidies.     A cursory glance

shows that of the proposals modelled as directly affecting the capital tax

rates (P2 through P6),   P6 (extensive indexing) reduces capital tax

rates by a far larger amount than do the others.     It seems especially ef-

fective in reducing tax rates for the most heavily taxed industries, and

thus yields more interindustry gain as well as intertemporal gain.

     Most of the results obtained are consistent with a priori expectations.

The gains accruing to the proposals involving increased exclusions (P2,

P3, P4) largely reflect the fact that they represent movements towards per-

sonal and corporate tax integration.     The size of the gains from indexing

schemes attest to the importance of inflation in increasing both inter-

temporal and interindustry distortions.     Obviously, these welfare impacts

would have been even more important if 1980 data had been available so

that 1980 inflation rates could be used.

v.   Conclusion.

     This paper analyzes six alternative plans to increase savings by cut-

ting taxes on capital income.    The capital tax cuts appear   in different

forms, and include   effortsto reduce the real impacts of inflation on the

taxation of real income.    We employ a recently constructed general equi-

librium model for the U. S. economy and tax system.    The paper discusses

the model and its use of disaggregated data in the third section, and out-

lines the model equivalent forms of the proposals in an appendix.

     Extensive indexation of capital taxes for inflation is shown to yield

present value dynamic gains of about $200 billion, comparable to the welfare

gains obtainable from integration of the personal and corporate income taxes.

A 60% exclusion of dividends from the personal income tax offers gains of

about $100 billion, based on the assumption of unchanging financial policies.

The gains for indexing only capital gains for inflation are over $60 billion,

indicating that this proposal dominates the proposal to reduce the capital

gains inclusion to 30%.    The distribution of the gains among the income c1as-

ses is similar for the two proposals.

     Both the static and dynamic results indicate that interindustry efficiency

gains are of the same order of magnitude as intertempora1 ones.     The plan

most successful in terms of generating new savings and capital formation,

PI, is among the least successful in terms of welfare gains measures.    The

simulations serve to emphasize our first proposition that increased capital

is only valuable if used properly.   In general, the inflation indexing plans

prove effective in achieving both greater capital formation and its proper

allocation.   Asthe second proposition notes, the proposals to increase the
                                                       in generating welfare gains.

pacts of proposed savings incentives.

     Dynamic and static gains are highly sensitive to the chosen yield pre-

serving tax, as these taxes impose differing welfare losses themselves.        It

is apparent that the results will also be highly sensitive to the inflation

rate chosen.   In general, non-neutrality of the U. S. tax system ensures

that inflation will have significant real effects.

     As our third proposition states, there is an apparent inverse rela-

tionship between the size of welfare gain obtainable and its progressive

impact for any particular plan.     The cost of increased capital accumula-

tion through reduced intertemporal distortions appears to be a redistribution

of income shares from poor to rich.

     As a summary observation we draw attention to the one plan which pro-

vides gains to all classes, even if the percentage gains differ, regardless

of replacement .tax assumption.    This plan, involving the provision of ex-

tensive inflation indexation, also happens to be the plan with the largest

dynamic welfare gain, accruing from improvements to intertemporal efficiency

and interindustry efficiency.     These two strong. attributes of the indexing

plan are only offset by its possibly greater administrative complexity.

                                      APPENDIX




         The general equilibrium model is designed to allow a variety of methods

    of distributing income from different assets, and to capture the influence

    of the major taxes imposed on each type of capital income.     This Appendix

    discusses the modelling of capital taxes and personal taxes on capital in-

    come, and explains the changes made to the benchmark data set and equations

    in order to model the proposed reforms.

         The capital tax calculation computer program, TMOD, first estimates

    total returns to capital in each of the nineteen industries.     It reads in
                                                         ,
    data on dividends, retained earnings, rents paid, interest payments, unin-

    corporated capital income and imputed interest payments in each industry.       We

    aim to allocate capital according to where it is used rather than by the

    sector in which the returns are ultimately received.     The imputed interest

    payments prevent the Finance/Insurance industry, which enjoys positive net

    interest income, from being credited with negative capital use.

         Our goal is to determine the capital tax rate (eTR) in each industry

    as a function of the relevant tax laws, institutional patterns, and finan-

    cial practices.   To find the CTR in an industry, we divide capital taxes

~   by net capital factor income.     We define a unit of capital as that amount

    which earns an annual return of $1 net of all taxes that discriminate ac-

    cording to industrial location.     This definition stems from the requirement

    of a Walrasian equilibrium that marginal factor returns net of all taxes

    be equalized across industries.     Because effective taxation on capital in-

    come at the personal income tax (PIT) level depends upon the industry from
                                                                -    30-


which the capital income was                          received~            it is necessary to include part of

personal tax payments in the tax on income from capital. 18 I

Since capital income has been subjected to the average PIT rate at the

factor level, there is a correction for each marginal tax rate at the per-

sona1 level.       The personal income tax applied to capital income is given

by


               t~          =    (T.. - T)kg.f                    j=l, ••. ,12                               (5)

     This equation states that corrections at the personal level are based

on the average fraction of capital income that is taxable at the personal

level.

         These consumer taxes on capital income are both positive and negative

and when aggregated over the twelve consumer classes yield no revenue.

The modelled system operates exactly as a withholding system under which

each industry pays tax on                 fiKG            at the average rate         T.   The consumer

where     NCITC.1     is the noncorporate investment tax credit.            Since the     NCITC.1

reduce the personal income tax liability, we include in the numerator the

amount of income which if fully taxable would result in the reduced lia-

bi1ity.     It is the amount       NCl       - NCITCi/L      which when multiplied by     L

imputed net rents of owner-occupied homes are excluded from the numerator

since this imputed income is not taxable.

     In the benchmark case,                   and       gRENT are taken to be one, since

interest and rents are entirely subject to the personal income tax.                     The

value of dividend exclusions under the $100 deductability rule amounts to

about 4% of dividend payments.               For simplicity we treat the exclusion as a

fixed percent, rather than a fixed amount, and use .96 for                   gDIV'

     The determination of          gRE        is more complex.      The effective propor-
                                         i
tion of taxable capital gains is reduced by the deferral allowed, assuming

retained earnings are immediately capitalized in the value of corporate

stock but that the stock is not immediately sold.                   Estimates of the deferral

value suggest that it is considerable; we multiply the percentage of gains

includable,         PINCL,   by 50% to account for this deferral. 1973 tax law pro-

vided for 50% inclusion of capital gains in the PIT base, giving PINCL a

base value of a half.         With inflation, the annual increment in capital

 gains - that is, the rise in stock value - should exceed the value of·

 retained earnings.            Capital gains should also reflect the nominal in-

 crease in that industry's capital assets, an amount equal to the inf1a-

 tion rate,       T   ,   times     ASSET ,       the value of assets held by corporations

 in the i        industry.        The increment in nominal capital gains divided by

 the industry's real capital gains is then                           (~.ASSETi      + REi)/RE i •    Fina1-

 1y, before this amount can be multiplied by the deferral factor and                                     PINeL,

 recognition must be taken of the approximately 17.2% of corporate stock

 which was held in 1973 by pensions and insurance companies.                                   Taxation on

 savings through these channels is virtually nonexistant, but the model

 already treats this tax break as part of a 30% savings exclusion from the

 PIT, since approximately 30% of household savings in 1973 occurred through

 these vehicles.          To avoid doubly crediting this tax break, 17.2% of retained

 earnings must be treated here as being fully taxable.                                  Then

 of Current Business data in the following manner.                               Estimates of corporate

 net rents and net interest paid are added to figures, giving corporate profits

 after tax with inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) and capital consumption

 adjustment (CCA).            Corporate net rents and net interest shares of total
                                           - 35 -


     rents and interest paid are assumed to equal the ratio of corporate profits

     after tax with      IVA + eCA    over the sum of those profits and noncorporate

     capital income.     The resulting vector of income to corporate assets is

     then scaled up to equal $732 billion, the asset value of individuals' cor-

     porate equity holdings in 1973.        The     ASSET       values thus equal the value

     of corporate capital owned by households and used in the               i         industry.

          Having described the manner in which the model derives capital tax

     rates, we proceed to consider the changes incorporated in order to capture

     the goals of the six tax reforms.        The proposal to raise pension maxima is

     treated as an increase in the savings exclusion from 30 to 40%.

          The plan to increase the interest exclusion is also straightforward.

     Flow of Funds data on assets and liabilities suggest that the gross lending

    by households is $793.2 billion, while lending by pensions and insurance

     companies is $323.7 billion, or        29%     of the combined value.           Insurance and

    pension income is lightly taxed but this exclusion is treated elsewhere.

    Therefore interest excludability should only pertain to the sum directly

    . paid to individuals.      We use gross rather than net household assets to de-

     termine our weights, on the grounds that P2 does not affect the ability of

     individuals to deduct interest payments from their taxes.                  Letting   PI1~INCL


     denote the percentage of interest income fully taxable at personal rates,

~   we have


                    g1   =    P1NT1NCL·(.7l} + .29                                         (9)


    The impact of the excludability proposal, P2, is to reduce PINT1NCL from

    1 to .3,   or            from 1 to one half.

          The next three proposals involve only single parameter changes.                    The

    plan to remove the $100 dividend dequction but to allow a 60% dividends
                                           - 36 -


 exclusion from the personal tax base starts with the assumption that the

 percentage distribution of total dividend income accruing to nontaxable

 insurance companies and pensions equals their share in equity holdings,

 the aforementioned 17.2%.         Referring to the percentage of dividends includ-

 able in the PIT base as PDIVINCL,         gDIV     may be written as



               ~IV   = PDIVINCL·(.828} +       .172.                           (10)



 The model equivalent form of P3 is to change PDIVINCL from .9444 to .389,

 or         from .96 to one half.

      The proposal to increase the capital gains exclusion, P4, is modelled

 in a like manner.   The term PINCL in equation (8) is reduced from .5 to

 .3 to capture the reduction in capital gains includability from 50% in

 1973 to Senator Long's suggested 30%.

      The P5 proposal set forth as an alternative to Senator Long's proposal would

 index capital gains by removing the capital gains tax on purely nominal ap-

 preciation in stock values.         This is achieved in the model by setting           ~


 equal to zero in equation (8).

      The final, comprehensive indexing package involves several substantive

 changes.   As with P5, capital gains indexing is achieved by setting               ~


/ in equation (8) to zero. Indexing of depreciations is achieved in the following

 manner. We start with the assumption that the indexing scheme will permit a

 reduction in the tax liability of the i thindustry by an amount equal to

so that .225043 is used for (l~)t - 1.                   It should be stressed that the

results are highly sensitive to the values chosen for                   i.   Moreover,one

would ordinarily anticipate a change in financial policies to accompany

changes in the tax treatment of depreciation:                  t   should change with the

removal of discrimination against long-lived assets.                  OUr model does not

capture this additional efficiency gain.

tal consumption allowance data for 1973 obtained from the July, 1976 SCB

to unpublished estimates of noncorporate depreciation obtained from the

Commerce Department.

       The third element in comprehensive indexing involves the removal of

part of taxable interest income from the PIT.base and elimination of part

of the individual and corporate deduction for interest payments.                    SCB figures

suggest a 1973 inflation rate of roughly 7% and prime interest rate of

slightly more than 8%.              Assuming the average loan was at 9%, a real interest
                                         - 38 -



rate of 2% emerges.         Since 7/9 of interest income was only nominal,

we reduce the value of PINTINCL from 1 to 2/9 in the equation:


                 gI     =   PINTINCL· (.262) + (.738)                          (14)



     The removal of 7/9 of the deductions ~laimed on household interest

payments as well means that only household net interest-bearing assets,

some $114.9 million, should enter the weighting scheme.            This lowers the

weight on PINTINCL to .262 (compared to P2 in which gross interest-bearing

assets entered the weighting scheme). The impact of this measure is not
                net
great, since most/interest income accrues to pensions and insurance com-

panies, which are already favored.         The value of gI      only falls from 1 to .942.

     Since it is not the intention of indexing to allow both interest pay-

ments and interest receipts to be deducted, corporate interest deducta-

bility is decreased to 2/9 of total interest payments.             Individuals and

corporations are thus allowed only a real deduction invariant with the in-

flat ion rate.        In principle, 7/9 of interest deductability for noncorporate

enterprises should also be removed.         We felt, however, that this would be

a highly impractical proposal.         Much unincorporated business, particularly

in agriculture, has a high ratio of interest payments to gross income.                A

reduction in their interest deductability could imply tax liability in ex-

cess of cash receipts since gain occurs as a lower real value of debt.

Without significant institutional changes, it is unclear that this could

be accoIIDnodated without severe       disruption:      It is also most unlikely that

the Congress would consider such a reduction in the first place.             We there-

fore limited our reduction in deductible interest payments to the household and
                                      - 39 -



corporate sectors.      In addition to changing the weights in (14), this

action has the effect of increasing corporate taxes in industry by the

.48 marginal corporate tax rate in 1973 times the percent of·interest no

longer deductible, 7/9, times corporate interest payments in industry             i,
                                                                 th

        The general equilibrium model we use clearly allows the effective

modelling of a great number of policies, in manners similar to the adapta-

tions for the six proposals outlined above.      A limited drawback is that

financial policies remain unchanged.      However, any guess or prediction based

on a model of the U. S. financial sector can easily be incorporated by simply

altering the sizes of various flows in the TMOD routine.

  We consider dividend deduction from the personal income tax rather than

    The tax rates and deductions are all based on our 1973 data and tax
    laws. Our comparisons are all based on changes to the 1973 economy
    and the following dynamic sequence based from the 1973 economy, which
    had a $100 dividend exclusion.

    In our model, individuals all have the same utility functional form.
    Data consistency requirements imply differences in some parameters;
    exogenously chosen ones are assumed identical across individuals.
    Each CES form has constant marginal utility of income, though these
    values may differ by class since parameters differ.

    True inflation neutrality would be difficult, if not impossible to
    achieve. Individuals and firms alter financial practices in manners
    that prevent any practical proposal from achieving inflation neutrality.
    Any change to capital tax rates such as the indexation of all capital
    income could thus cause capricious capital gains and losses, following
    the adage that an old tax is a good tax. Proposals for indexation
    and their shortcomings are discussed in Brinner (1973) and Folsom (1978).

     Plan 3 (60% dividend exclusion from the PIT) does relatively well here
     because of its role as a partial corporate and personal tax integration

      That P2's intertemporal effects exceed P4's can be seen from Table

     .indicates that it lowers c~pita1 taxes and hence intertemporal distortion
     more than does P4.
