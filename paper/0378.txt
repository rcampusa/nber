                Labor Turnover and Youth Unemployment


                                 ABSTRACT



      The main question of concern in this paper is why youth unemployment
is high relative to unemployment of adults. The analysis is based largely
on longitudinal micro-data in the NLS and MID panels of men, surveyed in
the 1966-1976 decade.

      Since the duration of unemployment increases with age, incidence
that is the probability of experiencing unemployment is the main focus
of our analysis. The basic finding is that the at first rapid and then
decelerating decline with age in the probability of unemployment stems
from a similarly shaped relation between the probability of separation
(from a job) and working age. The age patterns are, in turn, mainly due
to the decline of probabilities as tenure lengthens. Indeed, at given
levels of tenure, unemployment incidence does not at all decline with
age, except among blacks and in periods of high unemployment. We conclude
that the short tenure level of the young is the main reason for the age
differential in unemployment. To check this we compare youth with short-
tenured groups which are not adversely selected, migrants who were not
unemployed before migration and immigrants. The comparison reveals that
youth are in the same situation as others with little accumulated tenure.
We do note, however, that unemployment declines more slowly for youth
than for others, reflecting the gradually increasing commitment to work
in the transition from school to work and from parental to own household.

      Increases in the duration of unemployment with age are ascribed,
within a search model framework, to a decline in the probability of
finding job vacancies among older movers. The inference of increasing
difficulty in job finding is also consistent with observed increases in
the probability of unemployment conditional on separation, declines in
the quit/layoff ration, and in wage gains from moves as workers age.

1. Introduction: The Youth Unemployment Problem

         Public concern about youth employment problems in the U.S. derives

from three facts: (1) the unemployment rate of young people is high in

absolute numbers, in relation to adult unemployment, and in comparison

with other countries, (2) unemployment rates of black youth are much

higher and a large fraction of non—working black youth does not even

search for jobs, (3) youth unemployment rates have increased in recent

years. The trend is not pronounced among whites, but the rate for black

youth has risen from levels comparable to white rates in the 1950's to

the present depression-like levels.

         In this paper we do not address the problem of trends. It is an imp3r-

tant question for assessing the plight of black youth and a smaller one for

the white population beyond the adverse, but temporary conjunction of the

business and demographic cycles. Rather, our question refers to the more

permanent fact of high youth unemployment. Why is it so high? Are there

criteria by which we can judge that it is too high? Why does it decline

with age in a particular fashion?

     Recent developments in the economics of labor markets provide two

complementary approaches to the understanding of differential unemployment.

Search models are applicable, in principle, to the analysis of duration of

unemployment, as they highlight the conditions under which job search

terminates. On the other hand, episodes of unemployment originate in the

context of job or inter—labor force moves, so that models of labor turn-

over are most useful in understanding the incidence of unemployment. Since

age differences in the incidence of unemployment are even larger than

differences in unemployment rates, we emphasize labor turnover as the main

framework for analyzing the relation between age and unemployment. We also

employ a search model which captures some relevant aspects of the age differ-

entials in job separation and in the duration of unemployment.

     Our data sets are the panels of men in the National Longitudinal Surveys

(NLS) and in the Michigan Income Dynamics surveys (MID). The data lend them-

selves to several analyses with which we attempt to illuxninate the structure

of unemployment. In section II we decompose the "unemployment rate" observed

in a period into incidence, or proportion of persons experiencing unemployment
some time during the period, and average duration of unemployment during

the period. This enables us to assess the relative importance of each com-

ponent in creating unemployment differentials among age or any other popu-

lation subgroups.

     We observe the incidence and duration of unemployment in periods longer

than a year in section III. The rate at which incidence and duration increase

as the period is lengthened indicates the degree of persistence of unemploy-

ment or its converse ,the degree of turnover among the unemployed. The ob-

served degree of persistence may be due to positive serial correlation in the

probability of experiencing unemployment for given individuals, or to hetero-

geneity in this probability across individuals, or both. These categories

cannot be distinguished by lengthening the period, but are explored in re-

gression analyses (section V).

     In section IV we relate current unemployment incidence P(u) to current

labor mobility, defined as the probability of job separation from the current

employer P(s). We comjare P(u) and P(s) over the life-cycle and by length of

job tenure. The apparent absence of "aging effects" on the incidence of un-

employment is tested in comparisons of youths with migrants. According to

the identity P(u) =   P(s)P(uls),   factors underlying labor mobility P(s) ought

to account for some of the patterns of incidence P (u), expecially when recall

unemployment is excluded from P (u). We explore the factors underlying the

probabilities P(s) and P(u) in regression analyses in section V.
      Further insights into differences in conditional unemployment P(u s)

and in duration of unemployment are obtained in a search model presented

in section VI. This model also carries implication for quit/layoff be-

havior and for wage changes connected with separations and unemployment.

      Section VII is a replication of regression analyses on data for blacks

and an analysis of the racial differentials.


II. Components of Unemployment

      The same rate of unemployment is observed during a survey week when a

certain proportion of the labor force is unemployed two months on average

or when only one third of that proportion is unemployed for a period of six

months. The rate does not tell us whether a large number of those affected

share a small burden or whether the opposite is the case. If the obser-

vation period is sufficiently long, the rate can be decomposed into incidence

and duration of unemployment. Whether or not time spent in unemployment is

to be interpreted as distress or as productive activity, we want to know

whether it is incidence or duration which is mainly responsible for the

differences in particular comparisons of population groups.

      To do this we may define a personal unemployment rate during the period

(e.g. a year) by the ratio of weeks spent in unemployment to weeks spent in

the labor force:


          u =   wui
(1)
                 Li
      A simple average of u would measure the group unemployment rate in

an average week if each person spent the same number of weeks per year in

the labor force. Otherwise the individual u must be weighted by their time

in the labor force WLi in averaging. As a result the group rate is obtained

in:

      Table 1 provides decompositions of unemployment experience by the NLS

samples of young and mature men in the years 1969—71. The young men ranged

in age between 17 and 27, the older men were 48 to 62 years old. The men

are classified by school enrollment status, educational attainment, and race.

Unemployment followed by a return to the same employer ("recall" or "temporary

layoff") is excluded from Table 1, but is included in Appendix tables.1

participation component _is the major one among students in periods 1966-69

        n   = sample   size
though not in 1969_71.2 it is followed in relative importance by incidence

and duration. among the young incidence exceeds duration in producing the

unemployment total, while the opposite is true in the older groups. Both

incidence and duration are larger among blacks than whites and among the less

educated youth compared to the more educated.3 In the right-hand panel, per-

cent differentials in the unemployment rate and its components are calcu-

lated for selected groups. Clearly, higher unemployment rates of the young

are attributable to higher probabilities of unemployment; duration actually

works in the opposite direction. While duration always increases with age

in the white sample, the age differential for blacks is quite small in 1966—67

and 1967—69.

     On average, almost 40% of all unemployed older men were on temporary

layoffs and were recalled by the employer, while about 25% of the non-student

young unemployed workers were recalled. Inclusion of recall unemployment

shows a narrowing of the age differential in both the incidence and dur-

ation components of unemployment. This is because of the greater proportion

of recall unemployment among the old.

     A comparison of decompositions for 1967-69 and 1969-71 provides infor-

mation about cyclical changes. Going from the tight labor markets of 1967-69

to the recession years 1969—71 we find that duration of unemployment shows

a greater increase (proportionately twice as large) than incidence of unemploy—
ment, and that the age differentials widen in incidence and narrow in

duration. Both incidence and duration of unemployment are more cyclically

sensitive in the young than in the old labor force. Whatever the cycle

phase, we conclude higher incidence is the reason for higher youth unemploy-

ment. It is, therefore, the component of major interest for our study.


III. Short and Long-Run Unemployment Experience

     The longitudinal data enable us to observe the incidence and the amount

of time spent in unemployment over periods of several years. As indicated

in Table 2 the average incidence in a single year (p) in the 1966—69 period

was 13.5% for young white non—students. Over the 3-year period it was P3 =

27.9%   For the same group the average number of weeks spent in unemploy-

ment during a single year was 7.7.   It was 11.3 over the 3-year period. We

may define "complete persistence" in unemployment experience when the same

persons are unemployed in the three year period as are in a single year.

Then P3 = p and W3 = 3w.   "Complete turnover" is the opposite case, when

those unemployed in one year are not unemployed in the other two years.

Then P3 = 3p and W3 = w.   The actual figures are inbetween the extremes,

so that a significant degree of persistence coexists with a great deal of

turnover.

     There are two possible, and not mutually exclusive reasons why the

number of people experiencing unemployment sometime in an n—year period is

less than n-times the number of unemployed in a single year. First, the

experience of unemployment in one year increases the probability of be-

coming unemployed the next year. The events are dependent in probability

because of time or tenure dependence: the longer a person stays in the

job the less likely he is to separate, hence to become unemployed. The

other possibility is independence in probability over time, but differences

in sizes of probability across people in the group: those with higher proba-

bilities are more likely to be found unemployed at any time than are others.

Both possibilities give rise to the persistence in observed incidence, so

that n < np andWn >W.

       Let us consider the two cases separately:

(1) The assumption of homogeneity, that is, p = p for all individuals i,

with time independent probabilities yields an upper limit for P (It is

clearly less than np, which would require a negative serial correlation).

Denote the upper limit by n'          = 1 - (1       )n• The observed n-year inci-

dence is P <    n'   and a natural measure4 of the degree of persistence is

1 — X, where X =   pn p . When
                   ______            X =     1, there is no persistence in the un-
                   pn - p
employment experience.

(2)    Assume independence, but heterogeneity. Here the group consists of

individuals whose p differ. Define p =             E(p)   and qj = 1 -   p,    q =

Then   E(1) = EEl    — (1 -   )n]   < 1 - (1 -     p)'•', and 1 —   E[(q1)']   < 1 -   qfl
The inequality holds because, as is well known E[(q)fl] > [E(q)]n.    In other

words, if homogeneity and independence obtained within each of the subgroups

differing in p, the observed      would be smaller than    expected on the

assumption of homogeneity of the whole group.

       In Table 2, A = 65.9% for young white non-students so the degree of

persistence for this group is 34.1%; it is 49.4% for old NLS whites. Racial

differences in A are small but they are not standardized by education.

Among the young, persistence is greater in groups with education levels

above high school and it does not change with age. Among the less educa-

ted, persistence increases with age. Apparently, tenure dependence is

weaker and/or heterogeneity smaller in the young less educated than in

the more educated groups. According to our analysis in the next section,

this is reasonable if the less educated auire less firm specific skills

on the job. Over time there is a differentiation in these groups into

people who acquire job attachments and others who continue to drift. The

result is a growth of tenure dependence and of heterogeneity with

age.

       Of course, the observed P will be even smaller if time dependence (or

heterogeneity) obtains within the subgroups. Consequently, A < 1 may reflect

heterogeneity or time dependence or both. The data in Table 2 cannot dis-

tinguish whether it is heterogeneity or time dependence which produce a less
than proportionate increase in incidence and in time spent in unemployment.

Regression analyses described in section V explore, these matters further

and suggest that both factors are at work in producing the result.


IV. Incidence of Unemployment and Labor Turnover: Experience and Tenure Profiles

     Since it is incidence that is responsible for high levels of youth un-

employment we direct our attention primarily to the analysis of P(u) and

secondarily to the question why adult men experience longer spells of un-

employment.   Spells of unemployment occur, if at all, at the instance of

job change or of movement between the non-market (household, school, the

military) and the labor market. They also occur without job change in the

case of recalled workers on temporary layoffs.

     Unemployment incidence is definitionally related to labor turnover in

the probability formula P(u) = P(s) P (u Is) with recall unemployment excluded.

For the sake of completeness, our findings include also recall unemployment

(not shown in the text).

     Published data classified by age show that the high rates of youth un-

employment drop quite sharply to relatively low levels beyond the first

half-decade of working life. Table 3 shows the age profiles of unemployment

in relation to labor mobility. The upper panel based on a 1961 BLS survey

(the last available survey of this kind) shows the incidence of. unemployment

among j changers.    It suggests strongly that the age profile of unemployment

is very much a reflection of the typical age—mobility profile. Almost half of
the job changers became unemployed during the year although this proportion

increased somewhat with age.   In the lower panel mobility is defined more

broadly as the proportion of the labor force who have been on the current

job (with the current employer) less than a year in January 1978. Unemploy-

ment incidence among all men in the labor force and not merely among job

changers is shown in the lower row of the lower panel. Here the age curve

of incidence is also convex as i the mobility curve,

but flatter, especially beyond age 35. This is because (a) temporary layoff

unemployment is included in the figures which almost doubles the incidence

at older ages, and (b), even when temporary layoffs are excluded, the

quit/layoff ratio declines with age.(See rows 3 and 4 of the upper panel.j Since

the probability of unemployment is higher following layoffs than quits,

unemployment conditional on separations increases with age.   In view of the

relatively minor changes in conditional unemployment, the steep decline of

youth unemployment in the early years of experience can be attributed to

the convex shape of the age curve in labor mobility.

     Mincer and Jovanovic (1979) show that the age decline in job separations

is due primarily to the fact that the probability of separating declines with

tenure in the current job, whether or not the separation is initiated by the

worker or the employer. The theory underlying this relation is that the

informational process of job matching and the accumulation of specific

capital on the job create differences between workr productivity

in the current job and elsewhere as well as differences between wages in

current and alternative employments. The convexity of the tenure-mobility

profile is due to the initially sharp decline in the probability of a

separation following a successful job matching ("probation") period, and

an eventual leveling off of P(s) following completionof specific capi-

tal accumulation in the firm. The experience (working age) profile of

mobility is easily derived from the tenure profile. Given s =         f(T,x)
where s is the mobility (sparation) rate, T length of tenure, and x

length of experience in the labor market:


(3)
            dx T dx x
The negative slope of the tenure curve (relation between tenure and separa-

tions)       diminishes with T, and    is positive and nonincreasing.5

The convexity of the experience mobility curve s(x) is thus due to the

convexity of the tenure curve. The "aging effect,"          ,   steepens the
slope of the experience profile but does not affect its convexity. The

aging effect represents declines of mobility with experience at fixed levels

of tenure, and is pronounced in quits but not in layoffs (Mincer—Jovanovic,

Tab1e 1).

      The longer a worker stays jn the firm   the   less likely he is to

separate. nquently he is less likely to become unemployed, unless

separations after a longer stay in the firm carry a sufficiently higher

risk of unemployment. This may be true of "permanent" (not recalled)
layoffs which are less expected by higher tenured employees, while the

opposite ought to hold for quits since the opportunity cost of unemploy-

ment increases with tenure. These predictions are weakly confirmed in

M regressions, mot shown here. The opposing signs of unemployment

conditional on quit and layoff cancel in total separations so that P(us)

shows no clear pattern with tenure as is shown in Table 4.

     Consequently, the tenure profile of unemployment should reflect the

profile of separation, and the analyses of the experience profile of

unemployment incidence can be represented equivalently to equation (3) in:


          dP(u)   = 3P(u)   dT
                                 + 9P(u)
            dx        3Tdx
Decline   and convexity of the experience profile of unemployment is thus due,

as was true of separations, to the sharp decline and convexity of the

tenure profile of incidence.

     A comparison of tenure profiles of incidence and of separations is

shown in Table 4. Over the first few years of tenure, the decline in

unemployment incidence appears to be somewhat more rapid than the decline

in separations for both age and race groups. Aside from a first year decline,

the probability of unemployment conditional on separation P(uls) does not

change systematically. However, as we already noticed in Table 3, P(uls)

is higher at older ages.

     Among blacks the age differential in P(uls) varies over the business

 cycle. It is observable in 1969—71, but not in 1967—69, As noted before,

a similar cycle pattern was observed in age differentials in duration.               The

age increase in P(ujs) arises mainly        from   the increase in the layoff/quit

ratio (apparent in Table 3), but also from an increase in the probability

of unemployment conditional on layoff P(ulL).          However, P(ujQ) decreases

slightly with age.6

       The age increase in the conditional probability P(uIs) is the reason

for the absence of an aging effect              in eq. 4) in unemployment in the

face of a significant aging effect in separations. At given levels of

tenure the difference in P Cu) between the young and        the   old white men is

small although the difference is evident among the blacks who show a

stronger "agingeffect" in separations (temporary layoffs excluded). The

age differences also increase In the recession period 1969—71.

       We check on the age effect with the M data which covers the complete

age range. The absence of an aging effect in the probability of unemploy-

ment of whites is confirmed In the MD data even though the period covered

(.1975-76) was a period of high unemployntent, A regression of P(u) on

experience x, defined as years spent in the labor force, yields the equa-

tion Ct—ratios in parentheses):


(.5)      P(u) = .162   —   .OC6x    + .001x2
                             (2,7)     (1.8).



When job tenure T is included in the equation, the effect of x vanishes.
Tenure effects are strong: unemployment declines twice as rapidly over a

year of tenure than over a year of experience.


(6)       P(u) = .172 — .002x — .00004x2 — .0132T + .0003T2
                         (.9)     (.8)      (4.3)     (2.8)



Both the experience profile in (5) and the tenure profile in (6) are

convex.7 Clearly, P(u) does not depend on x, but on T. In other words,

unemployment declines with age not because of aging but because of the

lengthening of tenure:      > 0 and       =0   in equation (4).

      The conclusion must be that the short tenure level of the young is

the main reason for the age differential in the incidence of unemployment.

By definition, new or recent entrants and reentrants into the labor market

have short levels of tenure. The fact that their unemployment incidence

is not higher than the incidence of older men at comparable levels of

tenure suggests that it is not behavior or circumstances peculiar to

young people, but the dynamics of "job shopping" In the labor market

which is largely independent of age,

      Does the finding of similar incidence at comparable tenure levels

of the young and the old mean that youth unemployment is not excessively

high? Not necessarily, One may argue that turnover is excessively high,

so that tenure is unduly short among the young. Also, one may argue

that older job movers with whom we are comparing the early tenured young

represent an adverse selection of unstable workers, There is some
                                  21




evidence that this suspicion is correct: older men with shor€ tenure tend

to be persistent movers whose wages and wage progress over their careers

are lower than those of stayers, while such differences (between movers

and stayers) are negligible among the young (Mincer-Jovanovic 1979,

Tables 5 and 6).

     Is it excessive turnover or is it newness in the labor market that

produces the high early unemployment of the young?     is possible that

among workers of comparable quality a first encounter with the labor market

produces more turnover and unemployment than at early levels of tenure

on any subsequent job. Being new in a labor market is an experience not

restricted to the young. We may, for instance, compare the young with

international and internal migrants of all ages who also encounter a new

labor market. Since migrants do not represent an adverse selection,

indeed the opposite is argued and shown to be the case in migration studies

(e.g. Chiswick 1978), their unemployment is not likely to reflect

excessive turnover,

     Table 5 presents comparisons between the unemployment experience of

migrants (of all ages) and of young natives: while unemployment rates of

young non—migrants (age 18.-24) are over twice as high as the rates of

adult men, the rates of men who arrived in the U.S. from abroad were twice

as high as the youth rate in all age groups (panel A). The reason the

immigrant rates are higher is because they had at most only a year of

experience in the U.S. labor market, certainly less that the (18-24) youth
had on average. Rates of the immigrants are comparable to the unemploy-

ment rates of men who entered or reentered the labor force during the

year (Panel B), and, indeed, are somewhat higher than the rates of young

(18—24) men who have less than a year of experience in the labor market.

     Th Panel (C) immigrants (regardless of age) are compared with natives

of the same educational level (high school, the largest group) by years

of experience in the U.S. labor market. During the first 2 years the

unemployment rate of immigrants is somewhat higher than of the young

natives but it declines more rapidly, Initial handicaps (language?)

in settling in a job are overcome more quickly by immigrants, The

slower rate of decline among the young reflects the change from single

to married status and from part-time, part-period to full-time, full-

period work, Thus, although the high initial turnover and unemployment

of the young men are no greater than that of immigrants, a group that is

highly motivated and committed to the labor market, the decline in turnover

and unemployment is slower. The growth of commitment to the labor market

takes time in the transition from dependent member of parental household

to head of own family, with the mix of school, leisure, and work shifting

towards the latter in the allocation of time. The significance of these

factors in affecting unemployment incidence is shown in regression analyses

to be described in the next section,

     iternal   migrants represent a group which is intermediate in an
information and cultural sense, between   Immigrants   and native experienced

(non—migrant) workers. Their unemployment rates are lower than those

of immigrants during the first year in the new location and comparable

to the rate of young non—migrants (row 2 of Panel A). Again this comparison

is biased because the young nonmigrants have had more than one year of

labor market experience, while the migrants have been only a year or

less in the new location,

     Table 6, drawn from the NLS data, compares the incidence of unemploy-

ment of migrants during the first four years in the new labor market with

the unemployment of young men with at most 4 years of labor market

experience in 1967, Migrants who were unemployed at origin just before

migrating were eliminated from the sample so as to avoid a possible adverse

selection which would bias upward the destination unemployment of migrants.

Within-firm geographic transfers were also eliminated to avoid an opposite

bias. Temporary layoffs were excluded, and the sample restricted to

non—student, white men,. The results are incidence of adult married

migrants was 14%, about the same as for the young, married men and 19%

for the non—married adult migrants compared to 26% for young, single men,

Inclusion of temporary layoff unemployment raises the figures for the young

somewhat more than for the old migrants, the reverse of the general case,

     We think it is fair to conclude that the major circumstance reponsible

for high youth unemployment is newness in the labor market, rather than

young age and unstable behavior. This is not to say,however, that the

frequency of unemployment among the young stands in an immutable ratio to that

of adults. icreases in young cohorts consequent on the 'baby boom" create

larger proportions of young workers with short tenure. Similarly, longer

schooling means that work experience and tenure are shorter at a given

age (e.g. 18 years) , so that unemployment of young non—students is more

prevalent (relative to adult unemployment) in countrIes with higher educa-

tional attainment, Of course, the partial labor market commitment of youth

in transition in school and family status is a factor in greater turnover

as is the interruption of work experience by military service. Minimum

wage legislation may also be important although its impact on employment

and labor force participation is probably stronger than on unemployment

or on turnover (Mincer 1976). Note that black youth were not included in

our comparisons with migrants and we have already seen that their unemploy-

ment incidence exceeds not only that of whites but also of black adults

at comparable levels of tenure, especially in early tenure where most

unemployment is concentrated.



V. Factors Affecting the flc±dence of Unemployment


     The apparently close relation between turnover and unemployment

suggests that some or most of the variables which affect separations are

factors which also affect unemployment. We ascertain these factors and

the similarity, of their effects in parallel regressions of separations and

of uremp1oyment incidence on the same set of independent variables,
                                     27




     As is well understood in the analysis of labor mobility, the observed

reduction of separation probabilities as tenure lengthens may be a statis-

tical illusion rather than a description of individual behavior. Suppose

that individual propensities to move are not reduced by tenure yet they

differ among workers. In that case, the    estimated tenure profile of

mobility S(T) observed across a sample of workers will have a downward

slope and will be convex as well. Persons with high propensities to move

separate at early levels of tenure while those with lower propensities

stay on for longer periods. As only stayers remain in long tenure classes,

the apparently declining tenure cuzve would level off at low separation

rates in the long—tenured classes.

     Much the same phenomenon may be expected to appear in the statistical

treatment of unemployment incidence. Unemployment risk may not be related

to duration of job tenure,yet differences among individuals

in the unemployment risk to which they are subject can create exactly the

same spuriousness in the tenure profile, given the relation between separa-

tion and unemployment. Actual1yheterogenejty and "tenure dependence" are

not mutually exclusive hypotheses regarding labor mobility and unemployment

incidence. Indeed, the theory of job sorting and of acquisition of specific

human capital implies heterogeneity in levels and slopes of tenure profiles

(Min.cer—Jovanovic 1979). Therefore, heterogeneity does not fabricate an

unreal tenure curve, It merely steepens the slope of the real (average)

tenure curve.
     Differences in levels of tenure profiles can be indexed by observations

on past mobility behavior. If so, their inclusion in the regression should

reduce the bias in the tenure slope. Other measured factors represent

heterogeneity not captured by the limited observations on past mobility.

Their inclusion further reduces the tenure slope while increasing the

explanatory power of the regressions.

     A comparison of the separation and unemployment regressions shows that

the probability of unemployment is, just as labor mobility, subject to

tenure dependence and that individual characteristics, such as education,

health, marital status, local unemployment rate, and job training, affect

the probabilities of separation and of unemployment, given tenure. These

regressions appear in Tables 8A and 8B for NLS young white non-students

(1969-71), in Tables 8C and 8D for the MID (1975—76), and in Tables BE and

8F for mature NLS men (1969-7l). For the NLS, the dependent variables are

defined as number of separations and number of unemployment spells during

the period; for the MID survey, as the probability of separation and the

probability of unemployment respectively. Results are similar for both

number and incidence of events; however, we refer to both as incidence of

unemployment and separation. Temporary layoffs are excluded. Comparable

regressions covering the period l967-'69 for NLS, and l973-74 for MID both

including and excluding recall unemployment are available in the appendix.

With minor exceptions, inclusion of recall unemployment yields qualitatively

similar results. Sample means of the independent variables appear in

Table 7.

shows an experience profile which disappears once tenure is added. This

means that within the observed age range (which is limited in the NLS),

probabilities of both separation and unemployment are the same at given

levels of tenure regardless of experience. In the complete age range

(available in the MID data) the inclusion of tenure reduces but does not

eliminate experience effects on separations0 However, such "aging effects"

are eliminated in the unemployment incidence equations.

      Next the inclusion of heterogeneity indices of past behavior and of

heterogeneity factors (col. 3) reduces the tenure slope both in separations

and in unemployment incidence. Most of the reduction is achieved when prior

mobility indices are added to tenure. As an example, which holds in all the

regressions, compare col. 2 in Table 8D with eq. (6) above. Both prior

separations (per year) and prior unemployment (conditional on separations)

were used as indices in NLS. Prior unemployment incidence is unconditional

in MID. Tenure remains significant after all other variables are included.

     Three training variables were used in the young NLS regressions: company

training on the current job, training prior to the current job, and off-the-

job training. Of these, only the first approaches statistical significance

and, as would be expected on specific capital grounds, it reduces both

separations and unemployment incidence. The training effects are stronger

in the 1967-69 than in the l969-7l re9ressions shown here.

     Unemployment incidence is positively affected by the local level of

of unemployment which, however, does not affect separations. This finding

appears in the NLS regressions for young men in both periods (1969-71

and 1967-69) and in MID regressions for 1973-74 and, less strongly
for 1975-76. We find also that the local rate is not related to quits,

but is positively related to layoffs, These findings suggest that differences

in local unemployment reflect differences in local demand for labor somewhat

more clearly than differences in turnover. If it were turnover only, local

rates would be positively related to separations, which is not observed. If

only labor demand differs, there would be no relation between the local

unemployment rate and separations, a positive relation with layoffs, both

of which are observed, and a negative relations with quits, which is not

observed.

     Both separations and unemployment incidence are negatively related to

education and to marital status among the young. Short hours (part-time

work) and non-participation some time during the year C   or   in prior years)

are associated with higher probabilities of separation and of unemployment

in the young NLS data, and in the MID data for 1973-74.    (In 1975-76 part—

timers appear to have fewer separations and the effect of part—time work on

unemployment incidence disappears.)

     Un±on membership reduces separations, and has no significant effect

on incidence, unless temporary layoff unemployment is included when the

effect becomes positive, Employment in the government sector has a weak

negative effect on separation and on unemployment in the young NLS, but

both effects are stronger at older ages (MID and NLS).

     Bad health has no clear effects on separations and a positive effect

on unemployment incidence in 1967—69 in the young NLS sample. Both effects
are positive in the MID but not clear in the older NLS samples.

     The following conclusions may be drawn. Regression results strongly

support the turnover hypothesis of unemployment incidence. To the extent

that differences in job sorting and specific capital processes underlie

variation in labz mobility across people, they are important in creating

differential unemployment. Therefore, both tenure dependence and hetero-

geneity are characteristic of unemployment incidence as they are of separa-

tions. Factors which account for the convex (decelerating) decline of the

incidence of unemployment with age are: lengthening of tenure with age,

change from single to marital status, and the shift from part-time and

part-period work activities to full-time work.

     We should note the relevance of marital status, part-time work,and

non-participation in understanding the comparison with migrants in Table 5

(Panel C). The transition from school to market and from parental to own

household which is observed in a cross—section of young people is gradual.

It results in a slower decline of separation (lengthening of tenure) com-

pared to the experience of largely adult migrants whose work in the new

labor market was the major reason for migration.

     A comparison of unemployment P(u) regressions with separation regressions

leaves out questions about the conditional probability of unemployment.

This probability P (u I   ) enters the   product in P (u) = P (s)'   P (uI s). It


was shown to tncrease with age in contrast to both P(s) and P(u). What

are the factors associated with P(uls) and why does it increase with age?
                                 41




We try to estimate factors affecting P(uls) in two ways. In "augmented

regressions" we add separation variables to all the others (col.5 of the

Tables) and study factors affecting unemployment given separations. The

alternative procedure is to restrict the regressions to workers who moved,

that is to job separators as well as to entrants and reentrants (col. 6).

These we call "restricted regressions."

     In both kinds of regressions the variables which remain significant

are: the local unemployment rate, prior conditional unemployment, marital

status, education, and less clearly part-time work. Union membership

becomes positive and significant at least in the 1969-71 period. Similar

results are found in MID regressions, The variables show higher t—scores

in the restricted regressions (col.6), but the bulk of "explanatory power"

in the augmented regressions is due to the turnover variables. For example, in

the 1969-71 NLS sample of young men these variables produce an   = .505

which increases only to .521 when all the factors are added.

     Table 3 suggested that both separations and unemployment are more

heavily weighted by layoffs than by quits at older ages. Some of the

variables which are significant in affecting conditional unemployment in

the regressions are apparently more closely associated with layoff unemploy-

ment. This is true of the local unemployment rate, as already noted. Prior

conditional unemployment must be weighted toward layoff, since unemployment

conditional on layoffs is twice as high as unemployment conditional on quit.

The same holds for unemployment of union members, However, education,
marital status, and short hours affect both quits and layoffs and so affect

the conditional in each type of separation.

     Altogether, the NLS regressions are not very helpful in explaining the

age increases in conditional unemployment. Lower levels of education and

of health and more frequent union membership among the old account for a

part of it, The other variables have none or even opposite effects on age

patterns. That the variables we were able to measure do not account for the

growth of conditional unemployment with age is apparent in observing the

effects of experience on incidence in the regressions restricted to job

movers. The effect is positive in the older NLS (ages 48 and over), and

less so In MID (average age near 40) before and after all other variables

are included, There are no experience effects in the restricted regressions

within the first decade of work experience C the young NLS sample),

Evidently, the probability of unemployment when separating increases at

adult ages within each of the classes (levels) of the variables we have

measured.


V. ConditiQnl Unemployment  and Pifferences        in   the Duration of
    Unemloent A Search Model,
     Although we are nt able to ascribe much of the higher conditional

unemployment at older.ages to the   factors we   have measured, we know that it

is largely associated with the increased layoff/quit ratio, Why do quits

decline more rapidly at older ages than layoffs?
           At given tenure levels a worker's incentives to quit decline as he

ages because the payoff period to whatever benefit the quit produces is

getting shorter. Furthermore, we suggest that potential job changers

encounter a diminished probability of finding a job at older ages. There

are several possible reasons for this. Short prospective tenure inhibits

hiring by employersin the presence of hiring or training costs. A record

of job mobility at older ages is a deterrent to hiring for the same reasons,

insofar as it suggests a higher probability of further separation as it

does in our findings. On the supply side, workers' human capital even

if nt specific to the firm becomes progressively more specialized to a

narrower cluster of firms within an industry or occupation. The proportion

of job changers who also change industry and occupation diminishes at older
       8
ages

        In the terminology of search models we argue that, on average, older

workers who separate from jobs have a lesser probability of finding a job

per unit of search time, not because they are holding out for a higher

acceptance wage within the relevant wage offer distribution though it is

'ue of some, but because the probability of getting any offer, that is the

probability of finding a vacancy, is smaller. On this assumption we can

show that olrworkers who separate will search longer when unemployed and

quit less frequently while their acceptance wade will be relatively lower,

so the wage gaii will be smaller (or negative) for older job movers than

for younger ones.
       In the standard search model the individual samples from his wage

offer distribution f(w) receiving one offer per unit of time. The worker

decides on an optimal wage floor which equates the gain from an additional

unit of search to the cost of it. The resulting rule is:


(7)                   Pa(Wa_Wa)=c=Waz

where Wa is the lowest acceptable wage, 1'a is the probability of getting an

acceptable wage offer, that is of W Wa, Wa the mean of all acceptable wage

of ferS;c is the (marginal) cost of search which includes opportunity and

other costs. The highest opportunity cost or foregone wage is Wa. Income

offsets z which are contingent on continued search such as unemployment com-

pensation or the current wage when searching on the job 'entei costs with a

negative sign. Duration of search D is inverse to a In this model search

is longer the higher the acceptance wage which is higher the lower cost of

search.

       Now the probability of accepting a wage offer must be redefined given

that   the probability of finding any offer in a unit period can be less than
1. A lesser frequency of czacancies may be a result of   depressed   business
conditions in general, or depressed markets for a particular type of labor,
or a function of lesser efficiency or intensity of   search. The optimum con-

dition becomes:


(8)                   popa(a_Wa)=c=Wa_z
Here p is the probability of finding a job offer, a the probability of

finding an acceptable job conditional on finding a vacancy, and PePa is

the probability of finding an acceptable job. D is now the inverse of

the product POPae As before, changes in c produce a positive relation

between Wa and D. However, changes in p over the business cycle or other-

wise, or differences in p across people tend to produce a negative cor-

relation between Wa and D.

      A reduction in p leads to a downward revision of Wa ,hence to an

increase in a The question is whether P0Pa will rise or fall in (8).

No perfectly general answer can be given to this question, but a most

plausible answer is that             will fall, hence the duration of search will

lengthen even though Wa is revised downward in consequence of a fall in

It is easy to see that the difference              —
                                                       Wa)increases as Wa is lowered
in a uniform or triangular wage offer distribution0 When Wa is reduced,

Wa is reduced by a smaller amount, so that POPa must fall, if c is fixed or

reduced. Actually, c will be reduced since lowering of Wa will lead to a

fall in foregone wages when search is contirued..

                     -                                                      Wa

can be rewritten in ratio form:

Only an unusually high skew in the distribution, such as in the Pareto

distribution, yields a fixed —    whatever the position of Wa Even
                             Wa
then     will fall as the right hand expression does.

      The conclusion that a lower p is very likely to produce longer

search and lower acceptance wages holds both for unemployed and for

employed searchers. In the latter case c = Wa — W0, where W0 is the wage

paid on the job. n increased duration of search on the job, of course,

means a reduction in the frequency of quit.

      In sum, workers facing fewer vacancies in their search may be expected

to have a longer duration of search and a lesser wage gain when unemployed,

and to inhibit their job change (quit) when employed. These conclusions

are consistent with worker behavior during the business cycle: duration of

unemployment increases and quits decline while layoffs increase, partly

because employment demand declined and partly to substitute for a decline

in attrition (quits). Note that in contrast to other models, this explanation

of behavior during the business cycle does not assume myopia, or lags in
              10
adjustment.

      applying the same model to the life-cycle we may   argue   that either

p or c decline at older ages. A decline in c is not plausible except very
  early when labor market entrants become eligible for unemployment compensation.

  A decline in c would lead to increases in Wa and in wage gains, but the

  opposite is implied by a fall in p and is observed.    The implications

  that older men have a longer duration of unemployment, a reduced --ratio,

  and a lower Wa when changing jobs are strongly confirmed by the data in

  Table 9. The shorter duration of unemployment of the young is also due

  partly to relatively frequent inter—labor force mobility. Again, this is

  characteristic of very early labor force behavior and cannot account for

  the age-uptrend in duration of adult unemployment. Nor can this upturn be

  ascribed to the somewhat longer duration of layoff than of quit unemploy-

 ment, Duration increases with age in both cases. Table 9 shows that a

 similar search interpretation can be given to unemployment differentials

 by race and, somewhat less clearly, by education. We elaborate on the race

 differentials in the next section.

        Although we have no direct evidence on the reduction of p at older

 ages, P(uIL) may be a good index. It increases with age, is inverse to

 education and is higher for blacks. The only exception is that P(uJL)

 is less for the older, more educated whites compared to young whites in

• the same category,.

        In sum, as large as they are, age differentials in unemployment rates

 are attenuated by the longer duration of unemployment and higher probability

 of unemployment of older movers, Both the longer duration and the higher

VII. Black—White Differences in Youth tJneinployment

         Black youth unemployment has grown relative to white youth unemploy-

ment over the past tWO      decades   or longer. A fuller understanding of the

present differential, therefore, requires an analysis of this trend. This

is beyond the scope of our present work. We did replicate the statistical

analyses on black data, and report some of the findings.

         The salient   features in the racial unemployment differentials are:
higher   incidence,    longer duration, and greater non—participation among

black youth as shown in Table 1. Those differences hold for both students

and nonstudents.       Age comparisons in 1966-67 and 1967—69 show that the
duration of black youth unemployment is not much shorter than the duration
of unemployment of older blacks. Since        the race differential in duration

of   older men's unemployment is small, it is not clear whether     our NLS sample
of   older blacks understates their adverse position, or whether our findings
about   the young are, indeed, an indication     of deterioration of labor market
conditions   in present cohorts of black youth. But these inferences are

not mutually exclusive.

        The longer duration of black youth unemployment compared with white

youth is mirrored in Table. 4 in higher conditional unemployment at each level
 of tenure. The higher incidence of unemployment of black youth is due both

 to the higher separation rates and to higher conditional unemployment at

 fixed levels of tenure. The result is that while the black separation

 rates are 20% higher than the white rates, the black incidence of unemploy-

ment is twice as high as the white.

      Table 9 shows also that the black conditional
                                                           unemployment P(uls)
is higher than the white largely because --       , the   quit/layoff ratio is
lower, and also because both conditionals P(ulL) and P(uIQ) are higher.11

By the search model argument of the preceding section, we may conclude

that because blacks face a lower probability of finding vacancies than

whites do, their duration of unemployment is longer,wage gain smaller,

and quit/layoff ratio lower. It has been noted that black quit rates

are not higher than rates of Whites.12 In our interpretation, this does

not suggest an equally stable work experience: total separations of blacks

are higher, but quits are inhibited because of an adverse labor market,

and some of the excess layoff is in part a substitution for reduced quit.

      Some of the factors that appear to influence the higher black separa-

tion rates and their slower decline with experience are suggested in compari-

Sons of black and white regressions in Tables bA and lOB. The effects of

experience   on separations and   on unemployment incidence of blacks are not

significant   in the MID sample and positive in the young NLS sample. These
findings   may not be inconsistent, since the quadratic experience term in

in the NLS black regression has a negative coefficient and implies that the
positive effect vanishes within less than a decade (the MID sample is over

a decade older). Similarly, tenure is not significant in the black MID

sample,    though it   is negative and significant in the NLS sample of young

blacks.    The tenure effects are somewhat weaker, and the     effect of
training on the   current   job is, if   anything', positive, rather than negative

in the black sample. This suggests that blacks receive not only less

training .,   but also a lesser specific component of it. Marital status,

which reduces separations of whites, has little effect on separations df blacks

in NLS and MID and on unemployment of blacks in MID. Education reduces unem'-

ployment of blacks in 1973—74 but not in 1975—76 in the MID sample. At the same

time, prior unemployment conditional on separation predicts future separations more

sharply among blacks than among whites, that is, black movers who encoun-

ter unemployment are more likely to separate from jobs than are those who

move without unemployment and more than comparable whites. Taken together,

these effects may also explain why over the early years of experience the

decline in separations and in unemployment incidence is not pronounced

among non—student blacks, when it is for whites.

      So much for the differential regression effects as estimated in the

regression coefficients. Differential characteristics of black youth also

contribute to the higher unemployment. On average, black youths had less

tenure, less training, lower education, fewer married, more working part—

time and intermittently.

unemployment the clues for understanding why such unemployment is higher

 for blacks are sparse. Education has no effect on blacks while it was

negative for whites. Again, the likely conclusion is that the conditional

unemployment of blacks is higher because their quit/layoff ratio is lower

at all levels of the factors.

        Our findings convey some impressions of greater job instability of

blacks which is partly due to lesser training and to fewer specific components

of job experience, to greater non—participation, to weaker effects of

education and of family status. Greater difficulties in job finding are

consistent   with longer duration of unemployment, inhibition of quits, and
augmentation of layoffs. We do not know, however, how much of the difficul-
ties are matters of discrimination, of perception of potential productivities
by employers or     of informational efficiency of job search. In contrast to
the   whites,unemp].oyment of young blacks is   higher than unemployment of
older   blacks at   fixed tenure levels as we noted in Table 4. Also,   the race
differential   in duration is larger at young than at older ages. Both of

these findings may be a reflection of the deterioration in labor market

conditions of recent cohorts of young blacks.



La plus 9a change...?

        A 1969 survey of research on youth labor markets concluded that

"The normally high level of teenage unemployment is due primarily to the fact

that so many teenagers are labor market entrants or reentrants rather than to
their deficiency or instability as employees."13 We amend this conclusion

by interposing   a continuum of ob   experience and showing how it translates

into a decelerating age decline in the incidence of unemployment.

        Our evidence is based on far richer data than were available to

the researchers in the 1960's. But we do face a question of data com-

parability: the NLS shows   lower unemployment rates for young non—students,
consequently a smaller age-differential than the cPS does.      Yet our findings
of   no "aging effects" are also reproduced in the MID   data, apart from being

consistent with the spirit of the conclusion reached a decade ago on the

basis of fragmentary, cross—sectional CPS aggregates.
