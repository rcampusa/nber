          Wages, Nonwage Job Characteristics And Labor Mobility



                                 ABSTRACT



    This paper examines the impact of a set of nonwage job charac-

teristics on the quit decisions of young and middle—aged men. The

empirical analysis shows that young men are less likely to quit

"physical" jobs or jobs with bad working conditions but are more

likely to quit repetitive jobs. Older men, however, are more likely

to quit jobs with physical requirements or bad physical conditions but

are less likely to quit repetitious jobs. After they quit, young men

experience an increase in the physical components of the job and a

decline in repetitiveness while exactly the opposite holds for the

older men. It was shown that the age differences in the impacts of

the nonwage attributes could be explained by the fact that young men

place greater weight on wage growth opportunities in the job and in the

physically demanding jobs there are good opportunities for wage growth,

while in the repetitive jobs, wage growth is slow. The finding that

young workers want to move into jobs that are simultaneously perceived

by older workers to be undesirable indicates how opportunities for

mobility can improve an economy's productivity.

       Since the timeof Adam Smith, the theory of equalizing differences
--   that   individuals are induced to accept less attractive jobs by

receiving compensating increases in their wages -- has been used by

economists as an explanation of the existence of wage differences in

the labor market. By definition, the theory has important implications

for understanding the mobility of labor since an individual's decision

to change jobs is based on all the characteristics of a job -— the wage

rate, fringe benefits and the nonpecunfary job attributes. Reynolds

(1951) explicitly recognized this in his case study of labor mobility

in a New England factory city in the years l9G-1948. While the,

analytical studies of labor mobility, that appeared after the Reynolds

study made important contributions to our understanding of the determi

nants of individual turnover behavior, they ignored the nonpecuniary

motives for turnover because of the lack of data on nonpecuniary' job

attributes.' The only study that examined the relationship between

worker quitting and nonpecuniary attributes was that of Viscusi (1979)

but his work was limited to an examination of the impact of the

industry injury rate on worker quit behavior.

      In this paper, the analysis of individual turnover behavior is

expanded to consider the role of a set of nonwage job attributes.     In

particular, the relative importance of nonpecuniary returns at dif-

ferent stages in an individual's life cycle is explored. Data on the

nonwage attributes of an individual's job are obtained by merging the

Dictionary of Occupational Titles data set and fringe benefit data

from the Bureau of Economic Analysis with the National Longitudinal

Surveys of Young and Mature Men. In Part I, a framework for incor-

porating nonwage job characteristics into the job change decision is

presented. Part II discusses the manner in which the data set was

created. The empirical results are presented in Parts III, IV and V

and conclusions are given in Part VI.


I.   Framework

     In a world characterized by imperfect information and/or changing

conditions or tastes, labor turnover is the means by which workers and

firms correct their errors.   If the match between a worker and a firm

is determined to be unsatisfactory, this can be rectified by a

separation. A worker compares his real income stream in the current

job, Y, with his real income stream in the alternative job, Y.

If Y — Y    is greater than the costs associated with mobility, the
     a .c
individual will change jobs and thereby improve his economic position.
                                                   —3—


       The important point to recognize here is that the real ircome

stream is composed of both monetary (wages and fringes) and non-

monetary forms of compensation. The latter should have a distinct

role in the turnover process for the following reasons. First, it is

usually more difficult to obtain information about nonpecuniary job

attributes unless some time is spent on the job. Therefore much job

turnover may take place as a way of learning about the characteristics

of various types of jobs. This would be true especially in the case of

young individuals. Second, as an individual ages, his preferences for

nonmonetary as opposed to monetary forms of compensation may change.

This could be due, for example, to changes in health status and family

responsibilities. To the extent that the relative mix between monetary

and nonmonetary returns could not be changed on a given job, a separa-

tionwould occur. For both of these reasocs, an analysis that ignored

the role of rionpecuniary job characteristics in the turnover process

would be unable to explain much of observed turnover behavior.2

       The effect of nonpecuniary job characteristics on the individual's

job change decision can be obtained by estimating the following equation:

time period, W. is his money wage in the current job (before the quit),

      It would not be necessary to distinguish between pecuniary and
nonpecuniary forms of compensation if the two were perfectly correlated.

attributes,   X. is a vector of personal characteristics that may influ-

ence turnover behavior even though the wage is held constant (e.g.

education, experience, health, unionization),3 C1 is a vector of varia-

bles that measure the costs of mobility (e.g. wife's labor force

participation),4        T. is job tenure and T.2 is the quadratic of job

tenure,5 and .     is   the residual. Since the decision to change jobs

is based on the difference between real income streams in the current

and alternative jobs (holding costs of mobility constant), the coeffi-

cients on W.,, F. and desirable NP. should be negative; the lower W, F1 or

desirable NP., ceteris paribus, the greater the probability of quitting

since the individual's skills are likely to be rewarded at a higher

rate in other firms.


II. Data

     In order to compare the effect of nonpecuniary job attributes on

turnover at different stages in the life cycle, the quit equation is

estimated for the NLS Young Men's sample and the NLS Mature Men's

sample. The young men were between the ages of 124 and 24 in 1966 while

the mature men were betweeh 245 and 59 in that year. Since both samples




     3These variables have been used in previous studies of job mobil-
ity. See Bartel and Borjas (1977) and Jovanovic and Mincer (1979).

     41n the case of local mobility, a working wife should lc.,er the
cost of mobility since her earnings provide a cushion against the risk
associated with a job change.

      5Jovanovic and Mincer (1979) show that the tenure-turnover profile
 is nonlinear because specific capital accumulation in the firm is
eventually completed. Even if returns to specific capital do not decel-
erate with tenure, the qrowth of acceptance waqes guarantees a nonlin-
ear tenure-turnover profile because of the dccl ining upper tail of the
wage offer distribution.

survey individuals over several years, a quit is defined to occur if
the individual quit the job he was holding in the base year over a

subsequent two-year perod. The two-year periods analyzed are 1967-69

and 1969-71.   In order to be in the sample, the individual had to be

employed both at the beginning and at the end of the relevant two—year

period. In addition, the young men were required to not be enrolled

in school while the mature men could not be retired from their regular

jobs. These restrictions insure that the sample is composed of primary

workers fully committed to the labor force and also guarantees that a

quit does not occur in order to leave the labor force.6

     While the NLS data sets provide information on turnover, wages,

and personal characteristics, they do not provide information on fringe

benefits nor do they describe the nonpecuniary characteristics of the

job. An estimate of the fringe benefits that an individual is receiv-

ing in his current job can be obtained by using data collected by the

Bureau of Economic Analysis on the total expenditures for labor conpen—

sation, divided into wage and nonwage ccx'nponents, for 2-digit SIC

industries and similar data reported in the Annual Survey of Manufac-

turers for 3—digit SIC manufacturing industries. Brown (1980) has used

these data to create the ratio of nonwage compensation/wages for indus-

tries classified according to the 3—digit Census system and his data

set is used here for merging with the NLS samples. The use of this




     6Given these restrictions, I am not examining all turnover inci-
dents experienced by the men in the sample but have focused very
specifically on jOb chancies experienced by regular full-time workers.
                                      -6-


ratio enables us to consider whether the wage and the nonwage forms

of compensation have equal impacts on the quitting decision.

     Given the form in which the fringe data are available, we need

to express the quit equation differently than it is shown in equa-

tion (1). Define total monetary compensation received by the

employee as M =       + F.   Then write the quit equation as:


                     =    + ctln   M. +
                                           a3NP.
                                                   +    ....                    (2)

This can be rewritten as:


          Q. =      + c&1lnW. +   a1ln(l    +   F./J)    +
                                                             cx3NP.
                                                                      +   ...   (2a)

or under the assumption that F/W is small,


                  cz + a1lnW. + a1 F./W. -       ciNP.
                                                         +     ...              (2b)

Equation (2b) enables us to test whether wages and fringes have equal

impacts on quitting by using the logarithm of the wage and the absolute

ratio of fringes to wages (as calculated by Brown) as independent

variables and testing to see if the coefficients on these two varia-

bles are equal.

     The second component of nonwage job attributes is the nonpecun—

iary characteristics of the job, or the working conditions. An

important source of data on job characteristics is the Dictionary of

Occupational Titles (DOT) file. Originally, each of over 13,000 DOT

occupations was assigned a dummy variable for each of about twenty joh

characteristics. These 13,000 occupations were then aggregated into

the nearly 300 3—digit Census occupations using a conversion matrix
                                 -7-


based on the October 1966 Current Population Survey. Thus the "score"

for each occupation represents the probability that a randomly

selected individual in that 3—digit occupation has the given job

characteristic. For those individuals in occupation categories 775

(operatives, not elsewhere classified) or 985 (laborers, not elsewhere

classified), the job characteristic data are further classified by the

3-digit Census industry code.

     Since the NLS data provide information on the individual's 3-digit

Census occupation and industry categories, the NLS files and the DOT

file can be merged. The DOT file has been similarly merged by

researchers who were studying other topics. For example, Lucas (1977)

merged it with the Survey of Economic Opportunity file in order to

examine the extent to which wages adjust in the market in response to

the existence of positive and negative job attributes. Brown (1980)

merged the DOT file with the NLS Young Men's sample to expand on Lucas's

work in order to account for the correlation between job characteristics

and unobservable variables that affect the wage. Finally, Quinn (1977)

merged it with the Retirement History Study in order to estimate the

impact of job characteristics on the retirement decision.

     For the study on the relationship between turnover and job charac-

teristics, six characteristics from the DOT file were selected for merg-

ing with the NLS data.7




     7The excluded characteristics were those describing the educational
training and aptitude requirementsof the job as well as variables such
as "job involves interpretation of feelings in terms of personal view-
point," "job involves evaluation of information against judgmental
criteria.''

         Cl)    The job requires performing repetitive functions       (REP)


         (2) The job involves a variety of duties or the direc-

                tion, planning and control of an entire activity

                or the activity of others    (Wi-IVAR)



         (3)    The job requires working under stress       (STRESS)


         (1,)   The job requires physical strength       (REQST)


         (5)    The job has other physical requirements such as

                climbing, balancing, stooping, crawling, reaching,

                handling, talking, hearing or seeing       (PHYS)


         (6) The job involves bad working conditions(extremes

                of cold or heat, humidity, noise, toxic conditions,

                or hazards) (BADWC)


         Reall that in the only previous study of quits and nonpecuniary

    job attributes, i.e. the work by Viscusi, the industry injury rate was

    used as a measure of nonpecuniary characteristics. The DOT data are

    far superior to this measure for two reasons. First, they provide

    information on several nonpecuniary attributes. Second, the data are

    specific to the individual's occupation and therefore avoid the problem

    faced by Viscusi, namely that all occupations within an industry are not

•   likely to come into contact with the job hazard (e.g. clerical and sales

    management jobs); in other words, an industry injury rate is not a

    proper estimate of the hazards faced by individuals in specific ocupa

    tions.
                                 -9-

     Table 1 presents the mean values of the wages and nonwage job

characteristics of the two samples. The mature men earn signifi-

cantly higher wages than the young men and also have a significantly

higher ratio of fringes to wages. In the case of the DOT charac-

teristics, the young men are significantly more likely to be in jobs

with bad working conditions (BADWC), jobs that have physical require-

ments (PHYS) and jobs that are repetitive (REP). The older men are

significantly more likely than the young men to be in jobs that are

stressful (STR) and jobs that involve a variety of duties (WHVAR).

The only inconsistent finding here is the greater likelihood of older

men being in jobs that require physical strength (REQST).


III. Quit Equations

     In this section the results of estimating equation (2b) on the

merged data files are presented. Since the results for the two time

intervals, 1967-69 and 1969-71, were quite similar, the time periods

were pooled. Two dependent variables were used: QUIT, which equals

one if the individual quit his job during the relevant time period

and JOBREL, which equals one if the individual quit his job for

job-related reasons such as wages, working conditions, disliking

fellow employees, etc.8 Since the dependent variable is dichotomous,




     8The alternative is to quit for personal reasons such as health or
family problems. 70 percent of the mature men's quits and 81 percent
of the young men's, quits were for job-related reasons.

the maximum-likelihood probit technique was used for estimation.

Table 2 presents the results for the yourg men while Table 3 shows

the results for the mature men. Only the coefficients on the wage,

the fringe benefit variable and the nonpecuniary job attributes are

shown. The other variables included in the quit regressions are

education, experience, the square of experience, tenure, the square

of tenure, marital status, health status, size of local labor market,

a vector of industry dummy variables and a dummy distinguishing the

two time periods.

     The results show that money wages have a negative and significant

effect on the probability of quitting for both young and older men.

Fringe benefits also have a negative effect for both samples but the

effect is not significant for young men.    It is interesting to con-

sider whether the coefficients on LWAGE and FRINGE are significantly

different from one another for either sample. The results of the

likelihood-ratio test show that only in the case of job—related quits

by the older men do fringes have a larger impact than wages. In all

other cases the wage and fringe coefficients are not significantly

different. These results are important since they indicate that the

relative values placed on the two forms of monetary compensation

change as an indvidual ages. This may be in response to changing

tastes,   family responsibilities or health conditions.9




     9The test is performed by calculating the ratio of the restricted
and unrestricted likelihood functions. Minus two times the logarithm
of this ratio is distributed chi—square.

     The effects of the nonpecuniary job attributes are shi;n in

Tables 2 and 3 in three ways.    In Columns (1) and (tt) the six variables

are used together. In Columns (2) and (5) the variables are used

separately in the equation so that these columns in effect report

results from six different equations. Finally, in Columns (3) and (6),

the six variables are collapsed into three factors that resulted from

a factor analysts of the variables. They are: BRP which is com-

posed of BADWC, REQST and PHYS and therefore measure the uphysicalu

components of the job, RWH which equals REP minus WHVAR and therefore

measures the repetitiveness or lack of variety in the job, and STRESS

which measures whether the job requires working under stress. These

different specifications of equation (2b) were used because of the

high degree of correlation among many of the nonpecuniary variables.

     The results show that for the young men, bad working conditions

and physical requirements do not have a significant impact on quitting

while strength requirements actually lower the probability of quitting

for a job—related reason (in column (5)). The factor that is composed

of these three variables, BRP, has a negative effect which is close to

significance for job-related quits. Repetitiveness, variety of duties

on the job and control over an entire activity have important effects

on the probability of quitting for young men. REP is positive and

significant in Columns (2) and (5) while WHVAR is negative and sign ifi-

cant in Columns (1), (2), (4) and (5). Further, the factor that

combines these two variables, RWH, is positive and significant for all

quits and for job—related quits. The stress variable is negative and

almost significant in   Coiumn (1).    In sum, young men are more likely
                                  - 1 5-


to stay on jobs that are "physical," jobs that are stressful, or

jobs that are non-repetitive and involve the control over an

entire activity.

     The results for the older men are quite different. In Table 3

we see that the presence of bad working conditions increases the

probability of quitting and this is significant for job—related quits.

Further, the factor that measures all of the "physical" components of

the job is positive and again, this is significant for job—related

quits. In addition, older men are less likely to quit jobs that

involve repetitive tasks as shown by the coefficients on REP and RWH.

     In sum, the results in Tables 2 and 3 confirm the roles played

by wages, fringe benefits and nonpecuniary job attributes in the turn-

over decision. An important finding is the existence of differences

in the impacts of the nonpecuniary characteristics across age groups.

Young men are less likely to quit "physical" jobs or jobs with bad

working conditions and are more likely to quit repetitive jobs while

older men are more likely to quit jobs with bad physical conditions or

physical requirements and are less likely to quit repetitive jobs. A

possible reason for these age differences is explored in Part V.


IV. Changes in Wages and Non-Wage Job Characteristics

     The analysis in Part I I   showed that, holding other things

constant (e.g. the wage arid fringes), young men quit "repetitive"

jobs while older men quit "physical" jobs. An interesting issue is

to consider what happens to these men after they quit. Do the young

quitters move into jobs that are less repetitive and do the older
                                   -16-


quitters take jobs that are less physical? The results in Tables 2

and 3 do not necessarily provide answers to thesequestions. Given

the longitudinal nature of the data, however, the questions can be

answered by examining changes in wages and nonwage job charac-

teristics over thetwo—year period under study. This is done by

estimating an equation in which the dependent variable is the change in

the job characteristic and the independent variables are a set of

personal characteristcs and a set of dummy variables indicating the

individuals mobility status over the relevant two year period. The

coefficients on the mobility variables show how the job characteristic

changed relative to the change experienced by the stayers.

       This type of analysis is also valuable because it provides a method

of coping with potential problems due to population heterogeneity. It

is possible that in the quit equations estimated above the job charac-

teristics proxy unobserved personal characteristics which measure the

propensity for turnover. For example, unstabl&' young men may tend to

be in repetitive jobs. By examining changes in job characteristics, this

bias is avoided because unobserved personal characterics are likely to

be constant over time. The change in a given individuals status can

be directly observed.

       Tables L and 5 present the coefficients on the mobility variables

from the "change equations. Mobility status is indicated by JOBREL

-- a   job-related quit took place, PERS— a personal reason quit took

place, and LAYOFF - a layoff took place. The coefficients in Table !+

show that young men who quit for job-related reasons experience larger

wage increases than stayers but the ratio of fringes to wages remains
                                -17-


the same. For these quitters the physical components of the job (as

summed up by BRP). increase and repetitiveness Cas measured by RWH)

declines. Both of these changes are close to significance. The

change in physical requirements (PRYS) is significant at the 5 percent

level. These results are consistent with the findings from Table 2

indicating that the heterogeneity bias was not dominating those results.

The coefficients in Table 5 show that older men who quit for job—related

reasons, like their younger counterparts, experience a significant

increase in wages relative to stayers while the fringe benefit/wage

ratio remains the same. As anticipated, for these men the physical

components of the job (BADWc, PHYS, BaR) decline while repetitiveness

increases and variety of duties decreases (the sum of these effects is

demonstrated by RWH). These results are close to significance; the

strongest result is a decline in BADWC. Again, these findings are con-

sistent with the earlier findings in Table 3b.

     The results in Tables 4 and 5 show that quitters obtain increased

compensation in their new jobs. The interesting finding is that both

monetary and nonmonetary forms of compensation increase. For young

workers, an increase in nonmonetary compensation means a decrease in the

repetitiveness of the job while for older men it means a decrease in the

job's physical requirements.


V.    Explaining the Observed Age Differences

     One of the major findings of the analyses presented ici Parts I II

and IV is that there are distinct age differences in the roles played by

various nonpecuniary characteristics in the mobility decision. Young

people tend to quit jobs that are repetitive in nature while older

people tend to quit jobs that have physical requirements or bad working

conditions. A possible explanation for this age difference is that

older people are more likely to experience health problems that may

force them to 1eave physically demanding jobs)0 This hypothesis can

be tested by creating interaction terms between the nonpecuniary charac-

teristics and the health variable and adding these terms to the older

men quit equations. The argument would be that, among the older men,

those with health problems are more likely to quit jobs that are

physically demanding or have bad working conditions. The results,

not reported here, do not support this hypothesis; the interaction term

between HLTH and BRP was never significant.

    A second hypothesis that could explain the age differences relates

to the opportunities for investment and wage growth on the job.    It is

possible that those jobs that are physically demanding or have bad work-

ing conditions are also the types of jobs on which the individual can

experience rapid wage growth. Since young men would place greater weight

on these growth opportunities than the older men (in view of their longer

time horizon) we would then expect to observe young men being less likely

to quit the physically demanding jobs. This hypothesis was tested by

estimating wage growth equations for a sample of young men who did not

change jobs over the relevant two-year time period. In addition to a

vector of personal characteristics, the nonpecuniary variables Cthose




          the NLS samples, 11 percent of the young men and 22 percent of
the older men reported that they had health problems that limited the
kind or amount of work they could do.

produced by the factor analysts described in Part Iii) were used as

independent variables in these equations. The coefficients on the

nonpecuniary variables are shown in Panel A of Table 6. The results

show that young men in jobs that are physically demanding or have bad

working conditions (BRP) have significantly larger wage growth in both

dollar and percentage terms. Further, young men in jobs that are

repetitive in nature (RWH) have significantly smaller wage growth in

both dollar and percentage terms. Since these equations are restricted

to individuals who did not change jobs over the two-year period, it is

possible that a selection bias exists in Panel A. An alternative test

that avoids this bias is shown in Panel B where a wage equation is

estimated on the full sample and the variables BRP, RWH and STRESS,

their interactions with tenure, and a vector of personal characteristics

are included. The results show that the tenure interaction with BRP is

positive and close to significance while the tenure interaction with RWH

is negative and significant. Recall from Part III that young men were

less likely to quit the physical jobs but more likely to quit the

repetitive jobs. The results in Table 6 provide an explanation for

these findings, namely, that young men quit in order to improve their

opportunities for wage growth.'1




      The opportunities for wage growth that exist in the physical
jobs do not appear to be due to formal company training programs. Even
when a variable indicating the acquisition of such training was included
 n the wage growth equations, the positive ard significant effect of BRP
remained. Growth opportunities on these jobs are obviously due to
 informal methods of training and skill acquisition.

VI. Summary

     This paper examines the impact of    set of nonwage job   character-
istics on the quit decisions of young and middle-aged men. The data

set ws constructed by merging the data in the National Longitudinal

Surveys of Young and Mature Men with data from the Dictionary of Occupa-

tional Titles File and the Bureau of Economic Analysis file on fringe

benefits. The empirical analysis showed that many of the nonwage job

attributes had significant impacts on worker quit behavior and there

were differences in the effect! of the nonwage characteristics across

age groups. Young men were less likely to quit "physical" jobs or

jobs with bad working conditions but were more likely to quit repeti-

tive jobs. Older men, however, were more likely to quit jobs with

physical requirements or bad physical conditions but were less likely

to quit repetitive jobs.

      These age differences were further demonstrated in an analysis

that examined changes in the nonwage components of the individual 's

job after the quit took place. This exercise also avoided the hetero-

geneity bias that may have plagued the quit equations. The findings

here were that young quitters experience an increase in the physical

components of the job and a decline in repetitiveness after the quit

while exactly the opposite holds for the older men who quit.

      In conclusion, this paper has demonstrated that the quit decision

is multi—faceted and a thorough analysis requires information on the

various attributes of the individual's job. The observed age differ—

ences have important implications for the role that labor mobility

plays in allocating human resources withn the economy. The finding
                                     -24-


that young individuals want    to   move into jobs that are simultan-

eously perceived by older workers to be undesirable indicates

how   opportunities   for mobility can improve an economy's productiv-

ity. Similarly, seniority rights, often viewed as constraints on

optimizing behavior, can be seen in this context as beneficial; they

enable senior workers to choose the jobs they prefer thereby creating

vacancies in jobs that young workers desire.
