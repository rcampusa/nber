                                  THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME

        This paper builds a simple model where there is a connection               between    employees’

perception of the “fairness” of employers and the actual distribution of income. Wages are based

in part on employers’ assessments       of the productivity   of individual employees.    I show that the

equilibrium   distribution    of income depends on the beliefs of employees concerning the accuracy

of these evaluations.    I give conditions under which the distribution of income across employees

of the same vintage is more equal if employees           believe that these evaluations      are generally

inaccurate (so that they are skeptical of capitalists in general) than when they believe that these

evaluations   are accurate.      The model is consistent      with the fact that, in a sample of seven

countries, the distribution    of income is more unequal in countries where people feel that income

inequality is not too large.

    People have opinions         about       the degree to which the differences in pay reflect differences

in productivity.      In particular,        they have views on the extent         to which differences in inmme

reflect, instead,     personal    connect ions, are the result of favoritism             or result from capricious

decisions by people         with influence,        In this paper,     I show that        opinions    of this sort can

affect the actual distribution           of income even when they do not affect individuals’                 abilities.

In particular,      a change in the degrm to which people believe that differences in pay reflect

differences in productivity         can change the actual income of people even if their marginal

product     remains unchanged.          1

    My focus on the effects of these beliefs raises the question                     of where these beliefs come

from.     In particular,    there is the issue of whether         people’s perceptions           about the degree to

which individual       income reflects individual         productivity       shouldn’t   be identical to the actual

connection       between    income and pay. In this paper, I allow the actual connection                     between

these variables to differ from the perceived connection                    and I do this for two remons,

    First, it is very difficult to know what the actual connection                       between productivity      and

pay actually       is. If one leaves aside the possibility          of experimenting         by varying one’s own

productivity,      it is very hard to learn about this connection               unless one actually observes the

output     of different people.        2 But, in modern       industrial     firms where workers are extremely

interdependent       and where the aggregate value produced                  by the firm is subject      to large ran-

dom disturbances,          measuring        the output   of individuals      is very hard.    There are, of course,

indirect me=urements          of the relationship        between productivity        and pay. Under the assump-

tions of the stripped       down model I present, for instance,              this relationship      can be learned by

measuring       the changes      in the income of people who change jobs.                  However, the extent        to

which statistia       of this sort, shed light on the issue depends                on auxiliary     assumptions,    the

validity of which is itself difficult to establish            empirically.      That is not to say that different

    lThe paper is closely related to Piketty ( 1995) where changes in the perceived connection between effort
and income change the equilibrium       level of effort and thus change actual income. The difference is that in
Piketty (1995) these changed beliefs Meet actual income only by first affecting the potential productivity         of
individuals.
    2This too is closely related to Piketty ’s (1995) argument that it is difficult to learn the connection between
effort and pay.
individuals     do not contribute        differently   to firm output     or that people do not have estimates

of what these differences are. It is just that these estimates                 are based on pieces of informa-

tion that are hard to communicate               between people so that it is difficult to obtain          “objective”

estimates     of individual     productivity.

    The second reason to consider models where the perceived connection                         between pay and

productivity     differs from the actual one is that people do not appear to agree on this connec-

tion. A particularly         telling set of examples        of this disagreement   can be found in Hochschild

(1981), who reports on twenty eight in-depth                  interviews about the distribution       of resources.

Summarizing        she says (p.        140), “The poor . . . often argue that if productivity             were truly

rewarded,      this would create more equal incomes (italics in original). ” And goes on to say

(p. 141) “On the other hand, wealthy respondents                     . . . often argue that if productivity      were

truly rewarded,      this would create less equal income. ” 3 This sort of disagreement                        is con-

sistent    with the earlier claim that           people find it difficult to communicate          effectively their

information      about the way the economy works.

    Because firms perceive the productivity                 of different people to be different,     they will pay

different people different         amounts.       Indeed,    in the case of a frictionless     competitive      labor

market,     the wage of an individual           is equal to that individual’s      marginal    product.     Opinions

about     whether people are or are not paid their marginal                  product   do not alter this so that

the have no effect on the actual distribution                of income.

    In the model I present,            there are two departures         from the assumptions      of the standard

competitive      labor market      which ensure that these opinions matter.              First, I suppose that a

worker’s departure        from a firm depends          on his outside opportunitia        and that the firm has

imperfect      information     about     these opportunities.       The result is that    employers       have some

monopsony       power and that wages depend both on the firm’s perception                     of their employees’

marginal      products,   and on the firm’s =sessment             of the likelihood    that these employees will

    3These differences are consistent with those found in larger surveys. McClosky and Zaller (1984) report
that 84~0 of rmpondents    whose family income is above $35000 view the capitalist system as fair and efficient
while only 51% of respondents     with lower income do so. This type of statement   may simply reflect different
txtes for redistribution  but it aho could reflect differences in opinions about the determinants  of individual
incomes.

leave.   Second, there are search costs so that         workers have to forman              opinion about      what

they will bepaidon        theoutside    before they leave a firm.

    This combination      of assl.~mptions yields a simple mechanism                by which opinions affect the

distribution     of income.     If workers regard the evaluations         of their employers       as inaccurate,

they are tempted        to quit if they receive a low evaluation            while they are inclined         to stay

if they remive a favorable one. The reason is that,                if capitalists     are inaccurate,   it is good

to work for a firm that h~ an inaccurately             high estimate       of one’s own ability.        Employees

who receive high ratings from their current employers conclude that they have found a good

match while those who receive a low rating expect alternate                  employers to pay higher wages.

    Thus,      the perception    that capitalists   have become more accurate               makes workers that

have received a low rating from their firm more likely to stay (because                       they now expect a

low rating from other firm          as well).   A monopsonistic        firm then tends to cut their wages.

Similarly, this change in perception        leads workers that have gotten a high rating to be more

willing because      they are no longer afraid of getting            low wages from alternate           employers.

This, in turn,      tends to raise their wages.       Since the wages of highly rated              employees    rise

while those of employees with low ratings           fall, inequality     increases.

    The paper proceeds as follows. Section            1 presents     the model and studies         how the wage

distribution     changes in response to changed perceptions            by workers of the accuracy of firm’s

evaluations.      Section 2 considers social efficiency, and, in particular,             studies whether    overall

output   in the economy rises or falls when workers deem firms to be more accurate.                      The mea-

sure of overall output        I consider is, in some sense, a welfare measure because it includ=                 the

nonpecuniary       utility that people get in their jobs.      One difficulty with evaluating            aggregate

outcomes       is that one needs an “objective”      measure of firms’ ability to evaluate workers and,

for the reasons I mentioned         it is hard to know how one would go about obtaining                    one. For

the purpose      at hand, I pretend that firms have an accurate msessment                 of their own ability to

judge individuals’      productivity.    This leads me to use the firms’ estimates              of their accuracy

in computing       the model’s predictions      regarding   aggregate      output.

    The main conclusion of this section is a negative one. For reasons I explain, there appears


                                                        3
to be no robust       connection       between overall output          and the beliefs of workers.         Even when

workers’ beliefs become more accurate in the sense of getting                      closer to the capitalists       beliefs

that are used to evaluate social output,              overall output    can fall. Thus, my model is one where

there not be a trade-off           between       equity and efficiency:     for certain     parameter      values it is

possible to increase both at the same time. I also show that simpler measures of output                               like

the amount       of output      that is produced      to be sold in the market (which, like GNP, is readily

observable)     do not give an accurate            picture of whether      overall output      (which includes        the

enjoyment      people derive from their jobs) incre~es.                Thus it is possible that an increase             in

workers’ perception          of distributional     equity leads to an increase in inequality            together     with

a fall in overall output,        even though a measure of market output                 such as GNP rises.

    Sections     1 and 2 focus on inequality           across individuals     whose publicly observable             char-

acteristics    are identical.     The individuals      differ only in the evaluation        made of them by their

employers and this information             is held privately      by individuals      and their employers.      In Sec-

tion 3, I show that one can reinterpret                the model so that       it applies also to the inequality

of wages between        people who differ in observable             characteristics     like education.      Section 4

discusses the empirical         applicability     of the model. In particular,        it discusses measurements         of

people’s opinions      about income inequality           and studies the connection         of these opinions        with

the actual distribution          of income.      It shows that,    across a sample of seven countries,             actual

inequality     is negatively     correlated      with the perception      that income inequality          is excessive.

This is in broad accordance            with the predictions       of my model.        Section 5 concludes.


1      The        Model

1.1      The Basic Structure

Employees      are of two types.        I suppose that those for whom a parameter                T is equal to one

have higher productivity,          at least in certain occupations,        than those for whom the parameter

T is equal to zero. I will suppose that T is not observable,                  though certain firms do observe

signals that are correlated         with the true value of T. The focus of my study is the connection



                                                            4
between employee beliefs about              the accuracy of firms signals about            T and the wages that

firms pay in equilibrium.

   There are two periods.          In the first period, each employee starts              out attached   to a firm.

This attachment       implies on!y that the firm has observed a signal S that is correlated                 with T.

After seeing this signal, the employee’s initial firm can make him an offer. This offer specifies

a wage that the employee earns in the first period assuming                   that he works at the original

firm (which I label o) during this period.           If the employee stays in firm o, his contribution             to

the firm’s first period output         depends on his type T. In particular,          the value of the output

he produces      is given by q + VT where q and v are parameters.                  Firm o, however, does not

observe these individual         outputs    even after the first period is over. To rationalize           this, one

can imagine that the firm’s actual output            is contaminated     by so much noise that it contains

negligible     information     about   the employee’s productivity.        Alternatively,        one can imagine

that the value of the employee’s output            accrues over time and that the effect on firm output

of employees of different productivities           is not detected    until much after the employees have

left the firm. The result,        in any event, is that the firm’s only indication              of the employee’s

productivity      at the start of the second period is the realization            of S.

    Before the employee either accepts or rejects the first period                  offer from firm o, he also

receives an outside      offer from an alternative        firm that    I will label al.       I assume that      this

outside firm offers him a wage equal to g. 4 By being in this alternative                      firm, the employ-

also gains nonpecuniary           utility   which is equivalent      to an additional        compensation      of n.

Abusing the language somewhat,               I thus treat him as receiving a total compensation             of g + n,

where I am including          the nonpecuniary     utility in his compensation.        The value of n is drawn

from a distribution          whose cumulative     density function     is F(n).     For much of the analysis,

I will focus on the special case where F represents               the uniform       distribution,    with density

    4The simpl=t rationalization  for this is there are actually two alternative     firms in which the individual
has a productivity  ~ and that the employee gets the same nonpecuniary          utility in both. If each of these
firms gets to make one wage offer to the employee then the logic of Bertrand competition        leads them to offer
him ~. An alternative interpretation would include in J not only the value of the employee’sfirst period
output but also the value of the information about the employee’stype that the alternative firm can expect
to acquire. I neglect this because it would complicate the analysis.

equal to h for n between O and I/h.         5

    If the employee works for al, a new firm which I label b observes a new signal R which is

also correlated    with the employee’s T. If the employee works for firm h in the second period,

his output   is, once again, given by q + vT.          Because this firm cares about           the employee’s

type, it will make him an offer that depends on its best estimate             of the probability         that the

employee has a T equal to one.         I assume that the nonpecuniary            utility   that the employ=

derives at this new firm is equal to zero.

    In the second period,      the employee       also gets an offer from an alternative              firm that     I

denote by a2. I assume that         he gets this offer whether      he worked for o or al in the first

period.   Firm a2, just like al offers a wage ~. G I also use n to denote the value (in terms of

wages) of the employee’s ncnpecuniary           utility at a2 and this too is drawn from F(n) though

this realization   is independent   of the one that gives nonpecuniary           utility at al.

    Thus, in period 1, the employee can work at either o or al. If he works at o, he can work

at either o or a2 in the second period.         If he works at al, he can work at either b or a2 in the

second period.     Note that I have assumed that the employee enjoys nonpecuniary                     utility only

at those jobs (al and a2) where his productivity           does not depend on his type. This, as well

as well as the assumption      that nonpecuniary       utility is uncorrelated     over time in jobs where

the employee type is unimportant,          simplifies the analysis considerably            without,    hopefully,

having a material     effect on the results.

    My analysis of the model proceeds           as follows. In the next subsection,         I consider equilib-

rium wages in the second period at firms o and b. Then, I study expected                      compensation        in

the second period.     This differs from expected      wages at o and b because the individuals              have

the option   of working in alternate       firms where they also get nonpecuniary               compensation.

Finally, the fourth subsection      d=cribes     the equilibrium   wages at firm o in the first period.

    ‘Using zero u the lower bound for the realizations    of n does not reduce the generality of the analysis
since one can think of the lowest value for n as being incorporated  in J.
    6Again this can be rationalized by the assumption   that there are two such firms and that their circum-
stances are identical.

1.2        Second Period Wages

Employers       o and b know that employees will leave and go to a2 if they are offered a wage

w that is lower than the employee’s realization                   of ~ + n. On the other hand, the expected

benefit from keeping an employee to which the firm pays w is (q + vET – w), where ET

represents    the firm’s expectation        of the employee’s T. Thus, these employers set their wage

offers w to maximize



                                             F(w – q)[q + VET – w]                                                (1)


where E takes expectations           conditional     on the information          available to the firm.

                              f(w”     - q)[q + VET – 10”]– F(W* – g) = o                                         (2)

The second order condition           requires that

                                            f’[9 +vET–w*]–2f<o                                                    (3)


      Differentiating   (2) with respect to ET, ; and w*, one obtains

                                        f                                 f - f’[9 + “ET - w*1 dq
                  dw- = —                                   vdET +                                                (4)
                          2j – f’[q + VET –          W*]                  2f – f’[q + vET –    W*]

      The second order condition            (3) implies      that       the denominator    in these expressions    is

positive so that an increase in the employee’s expected                     productivity   T raises the wage offer.

To ensure that increases in the employee’s outside                       wage, ~, also the firm’s wage offer, it is

neassary      and sufficient that

                                            f’[q+vET–w*]-f<o                                                      (5)

which is consistent     with (3) but imposm a more stringent                    requirement   on f’.

      As can be seen from (4), there is a special case where the wage offer is linear in expected

productivity.     This is the c=e where F is uniform so that j’ is zero and f is a constant                   equal

to h (at least in the range where F is between O and 1). In this c~e, (2) reduces to
                                                           q+~+vET
                                                w* =                                                              (6)
                                                                    2

                                                             7
    Because fl is zero and both (3) and (5) are trivially                          satisfied,   (6) implies that the wage

is increasing     in both     ET and ~. For future reference                     it is useful to compute        the resulting

profits using (l).        These are
                                                          q–q+vETz
                                                     h(        ~             )                                                (7)

    I assume throughout           the analysis that the worker’s productivity                      is no smaller in firm o

(or b) than in firm az so that q is no smaller than ~. This implies that, regardless                                      of the

distribution      F, the optimal         wage always exceeds ~ and that                   F is positive so that         there is

a strictly     positive    probability      that    the employee        stays at firm o. It then follows that                 the

equilibrium      wage is always below the employee’s                     expected       productivity y E(q + vT).           Note

also that the solution        is interior as long as the highest                 possible n, which I label R and which

satisfies F(fi) = 1, also satisfies


                                            f(~+fi)[q-       ~-      fi+vET]<l                                                (8)


    If condition      (8) is satisfied,       individuals        leave firm o with positive             probability.      If it is

violated,     the optimal     wage is ~ + ii and the employee stays with probability                          one.

    To compute        the optimal        wage, one must know the value of ET.                          I now compute       these

values concentrating         first on the value for firm o and then on firm 13.Firm o computes                               this

expectation      knowing only the value of S. I suppose that, just like T, the signal S can take on

two values, zero and one. I let the unconditional                      probability      that S is equal to one be equal

to the unconditional          probability      that T is equal to one and denote both these probabilities

by ~. Thus # denotes both the fraction of high productivity                              individuals     and the fraction      of

individuals     who get a high S.

    Since I wish the signal S to be informative                      about       T, I assume that       the probability      that

S is equal to one conditional               on T being equal to one, which I denote by u, exceeds ~.

It is important       to note that this is a subjective                 probability       concerning      the accuracy       of a

signal. Thus there is little to prevent different agents from using different values of u in their

calculations.      In particular,        I denote by a the subjective                conditional    probability        of S held

by firms and by UWthe subjective                   conditional       probability     held by workers. To simplify the


                                                                 8
analysis, I also use u, the conditional            probability       believed by firms, to evaluate overall output

in this economy. Thus, in effect, I am pretending                      that u also represents           the true frequency

with which a T equal to one is associated                 with an S equal to one. However, if one is willing

not to compute       average values of output             one would not need to decide whether                   any given

value of u is true and one could still learn how changes in people’s subjective                               probabilities

affect equilibrium    wages.

    Letting P denote probabilities,             the expected         value of T conditional           on observing   that S

is equal to one is

                                                        P(s=         lIT=    l)P(T=       1)
                         P(T=l           IS=    l)=                                            =0                          (9)
                                                                     P(s    = 1)

while the expected      value of T conditional            on observing that S is equal to zero is

                                                   P(S=OIT           = l)P(T=         1) = (1 –a)#
                      P(T=      lls    =0)     =                                                                          (lo)
                                                               P(s    = o)                     1–4

    Given that a exceeds ~, this latter probability                    is smaller and, indeed, it equals zero if the

signal S is perfectly    discriminating            so that a is equal to one. Even when it is not, the fact

that u exceeds # together            with (4) implies that the equilibrium               wage paid by o to employees

with an S equal to one, w;, exceeds the wage paid employees with an S equal to zero, w:.

    I now consider the wage offered by firm bin the second period.                          I assume that R, the signal

observed by b, has characteristics             very similar to those of S. In particular,                the unconditional

probability   that R is equal to one is ~. Also, firms believe that the probability                           that R is one

conditional   on T being equal to one is u while workers believe this conditional                               probability

to be OW. I also assume          that everyone believes that the realization                        of R is independent       of

the realization   of S once one conditions              on the true value of T. In other words


              P(R=lls          =j,     T=k)=P(R=l/T=k)                                   where k,j = O, 1


    Before computing         b’s expected      value of T for individual             workers, I study the probabilities

that,   for a given worker,           a signal S equal to one (or zero) will be followed by a signal

R equal to one (or zero).              These       conditional       probabilities     are important        in determining


                                                                 9
whether individual           workers quit their firm o jobs in the first period.              They are also important

ingredients      in calculating     tl~e expected       value of T by a b firm that has observed a particular

realization     of R.

      The probability        that a signal S equal to one will be followed by an R equal to one is


P(R=l         IS=l)      =     P(R=l,        T=lIS=l)         +P(R=l,         T=      OIS=     1)

                         =     P(R=lIS         =1, T=l)P(T           =lIS=l)+P(R=                   lIS=l,      T=   O)P(T=OIS=l)

                                       l–~                   l–~

while the probability          that R will equal zero conditional            on S being equal to one is equal to

1 minus the expression            in (11), Similarly,      the probability     that R will equal zero given that

S equals zero equals


P(R=OIS=O)               =     P(R=O,        T=lIS=O)         +P(R=O,         T=      OIS=O)

                         =     P(R=OIS         =0, T=l)P(T=l              IS= O)+P(R           =OIS=O,          T=   O)P(T=OIS=O)
                         =       4(1 -0)2
                                              + [1 - ~::;)]’=             l.d+d(~)’                                                 (12)
                                   l–~

while the probability          that R will equal one given that S is equal to zero is equal to 1 minus

the expression        in (12).

      Both the expression          in (11) and that        in (12) are increasing        in o (given that a exceeds

~).     The intuitive     reason for this is that          a higher u implia          that    both S and R are more

highly correlated        with T.         As a result,    a higher o ensures that             S and R are more highly

correlated      wit h each other.           Thus,   if workers perceive that          the value of a is high, they

expect the perceptions            of future employers        about their ability to be highly correlated                with

the perception        of their current employer.           By contrast,     if workers perceive a to be low, they

regard this correlation           = low.

       I now turn to firm h’s expectation               of T for individuals       with R equal to either zero or

one.     Firm b does not observe the realization                   of S. However, it can use the fact that the

worker whose R it observes has agreed to accept a job with al to make inferences about the

probability      that the worker has had a signal S equal to one. If, in particular,                         the equilibrium

                                                              10
is one where only workers whose S is equal to zero accept jobs with alternative                              firms in the

first period,   firm b should infer that any worker whose R it observes must have had an S

equal to zero. Thus, the probability            z that b should attach to finding an employee whose S

was equal to one depends on the type of equilibrium                         that prevails in period     1. I study the

form of this equilibrium       further below.         For the moment,           I compute      the expected        values of

T under the alternate        assumptions       that S is known to equal 1 and that S is known to equal

zero.    The expected      value assuming        that there is a probability            z that S is equal to one is

then a simple weighted average of the two numbers                      that I compute       here.

    If S is known to equal one, the expected                  value of T of an employee whose R is equal to

one is

                                     P(T=l,          R=l     IS=l)      =P(R=l         IT=l,     S=l)P(T=lIS=l)
P(T=l      IS=l,    R=l)       =

                                =    a(a–@)+@(l–#)

while the expected      value of T for an employee whose R is equal to zero is

                                     P(T=l,  R= OIS=l)                       P(R=O(T=          1,S=    l)P(T=         11S= 1)

    On the other hand, if S is known to equal zero, the expected value of an employee whose

R is equal to zero is

                                                       P(R=OIT          =1, S=       O)P(T=l        IS=O)
                P(T=lIS=O,          R=O)         =
                                                                        P(R = 01S = O)
                                                         (1 - U)*@(l - ~)
                                                                                                                        (15)
                                                 =     (1 -@)’ +#(a-d)*

Since both the conditional          and the unmnditional             distributions    of S and R are identical,          the

expected     value of T for an employee whose R is equal to one while his S is equal to zero is

the same as that of an employee whose S equals one and his R is equal to zero.

    Simple calculations       establish     that the expression         in (13) is no smaller than the expression

in (14) as long = u is no smaller than ~ and that the inequality                       is strict if u is strictly     larger

                                                              11
than ~. Similarly,       the expression     in (14) is strictly    larger than the expression               in (15) if o is

strictly larger than ~. Put simply, employees who get signals equal to one are deemed more

productive     than individuals     who get signals equal to zero.

    Now suppose that firm b attaches              a probability    z to the event that the individual              got an

S equal to one. If it sees an R equal to one, its posterior                    expectation      of T is

                                                 02(1 – #)                            0(1 – a)(l – ~)
              P(T=l      IR=l)=Z                                      +(1–Z)                                           (16)
                                       a(a – ~) + 4(1 – ~)                         (1 - ~)’ -(0          - ~)’

while, if it sees a signal R equal to zero the expected                T is

                                            0(1 –0)(1    – ~)                        (1 - O)’@(l - ~)
              P(T=l      IR=O)=Z                                                                                       (17)
                                       (1-#)      2-(a-~)2+            (1-z)      (l-#)      3+~(o-+)2


    The expression       in (16) exceeds that in (17) so that the expected                     value of T is larger for

employees whose R equals one. Thus, (4) together                   with the second order condition                 implies

that the wage paid by h to an employee with R equal to one, w;(z) exceeds the wage paid

to an employee whose R equals zero, w:(z).                Moreover, both these wages are increasing                   in z,

the probability       that an employee who takes a job at al gets a signal S equal to one.


1.3       Expected          Second Period Compensation

Second period compensation           differs from the second period wages paid by o and b because

the employee      has the option     of working at a2. In particular,                     if an employee gets a wage

offer w from either of these firms which is below ~ + n, he goes to work for a2 in the semnd

period,     Thus, an employee who knows that his semnd                    period wage offer by either o or b is

equal to w has an expected          compensation         (including     the value of the nonpecuniary               utility

the employee gets on the job) of c(w) where the function                       c is given by


                                  c(w) = F(?.O
                                             – g)w +
                                                               /~’r(~
                                                                    +n)~~(n)                                           (18)


    The derivative      of c(w) with respect to w is F(w – ~) which is strictly positive given that

q exceeds    g. Thus,    c(w) is strictly      increasing in w. This is not surprising,              an employee who

gets a higher wage offer can expect his compensation                    to be higher because he can afford to


                                                          12
be choosier with the outside              offers he accepts.    Because F(w – ~) is an increasing          function

of w, c(w) is actually             a mnvex function    of w. This convexity       is particularly    obvious in the

case where F is uniform.               In this case, (18) becomes


                                        c(w) = h(w – ~)w +       /l’:(g+n)hdn
                                                                  w-q



Carrying         out the integration,      this is


                                                                                                                (19)


which is convex in w because when w is small the individual                     is relatively    unlikely to stay at

the firm so that an incre~e              in w has a relatively small effect. The reason this function falls

with h when w is equal to .! is that an increase in h lowers the mean of the value of outside

offers.

    In the first period, an employee’s expected                second period compensation           depends also on

his expectation           concerning     the wage he will be offered by either            o or b. To simplify this

analysis,        I assume that the worker observes the realization              of his signal S. 7 This means

that the employee knows the wage that o will offer him in the second period.                           8 I label the

employee’s expectation               of this wage w“(S) where depending           on the realization     of S, this

equals     either    w:   or w;.

    Now consider an employee                  who works at al in the first      period.     I denote his expected

compensation          by c“(z, S).       This compensation      depends    on the fraction        z of employees in

firms     like   al whose S is eq’lal to one because           this fraction   determines       the wages paid by b

in the second period.              It also depends   on the employee’s own S because this determinm              the

employee’s subjective           probability     that his signal R will equal one. If his signal S equals one,
   T1tis important, however, that he be unable to demonstrate to firm b that his S is equal to ‘ne.
   ‘Alternatively, one can assume that he has to infer his S, and thus his second period wage at o, from his
fir~t period wage. This gives the same equilibrium allocation M in the c=e where the employee observes S
directly as long as employees with different values for S get different first period wages. \Vhat complicates
the analysis of this c=     is that the firm can now choose to pay all employees the same first period wage
so u to make it impossible for them to learn their realization of S. In the numerical simulations           I have
done, I have not found any parameter      combinations   for which the firm would profit from this concealment of
information.   Thus, for the parameters    I have studied the equilibrium is the same whether employees observe
S directly or not.


                                                           13
his expected         compensation       in the second period after working at al, c“(z, 1) is


              Ca(z,l)      =   PW(R = 11s = l) C(W:(Z)) +(1 – PW(R = 11s = l)) C(W:(Z))

                                                                                                                     (20)


where PW denotes probabilities              computed      using worker’s perceptions             of a.

      If, instead,    his S is equ2,1 to zero, his expected             compensation,      Ca(z, O) is


              Ca(z, o)    =    (1 – *DW(R= 0[s = O))c(w:(z))               + PW(R = 01s = O))c(w:(z))

                          =    C(w:(z))[d     – 4(01~_–#~)2] + C(w:(z))[l               – 4 + #(;_–@@)2]             (21)


Rather obviously, c’(z, 1) exceeds c’ (z, O). The main interest in these formulas,                          however, lies

in the way that c“(z, 1) and c“(z, O) change with aW. Differentiating                          (20) and (21), we obtain

                                dc’(z,l)         Zuw – ~          ~
                                                            [c(w,(z))     - C(w:(z))]     >0
                                    do.      =    l–#

and
                               dca(z, O)
                                           = –~~ al- -:[c(w:(z))            - C(w:(z))]     <0
                                 do.,                   —

      Thus,   the belief that capitalists         are more inaccurate           (so that UW is low) leads workers

who get an S equal to one io expect lower wages on the outside while it leads workers who

get an S equal to zero to expect higher wages on the outside.                            In other words, a low value

of UWleads workers to regard both the current                     realization    of S and the future realization       of

R as likely to be mistaken.             As UWfalls, workers deem it more likely that a high realization

of S will be followed by a low realization               of R. Thus, an employee who gets a high S value

becomes less optimistic          about his compensation            on the outside.       Similarly, an employ-      with

a low S becomes less pessimistic              about his compensation            by b.

      Before concluding        this section, it is worth comparing              the compensation         an employee can

expect to get in the second period when he stays at o with what he can expect to get if he

leav= and joins al. This difference depends on what outsiders                           expect S to be for employees

who leave w well as on the employee’s                   actual value of S. To start with the simplest               case,

suppose the employee gets an S equal to zero and outsiders expect all employees who leave to

                                                             14
have an S equal to zero. In this case there is no difference between perception         of S inside and

outside firm o. I will show that, when F is uniform and the employee’s perception              of a, OW,

is the same as the firms’, the employee’s expected        second period wage is the same at o than

outside.      However, the convexity of the c(w) function    implies that expected     compensation      is

larger on the outside.

     If F is uniform and R is equal to one, (6) and (14) imply that the wage offer by b is equal

to

                                                                                                       (22)

     On the other hand, if R is equal to zero, (6) and (15) imply that this wage offer equals


                                                                                                       (23)


     Using (12) the expected     wage offer is


                                                                                                       (24)


which is the same as the wage offer that o will make in the second period.              The reason the

expected      wage offers are the same is that both o and b start out with the same information.

Thus, by the law of iterated       expectations   the expected   value of b’s expectation    of T is the

same as o’s expectation       of T. Since, in addition,   wages are linear in firm’s expectations        of

T, the two expected       wage offers are the same. While the expected wage offers are the same,

the employee gets a more variable wage offer by going to al than by staying at o. Since this

variability     raises (19), the employee has a higher expected    compensation      on the outside.

     An essentially    identical analysis applim to the case where the employee draws an S equal

to one and in which outside employers expect the employee’s S to be equal to one. On the

other hand, when the employee’s S is equal to one and outside firms expect it to equal one

only with probability       z where z is less than one, the expected     second period wage is lower

at b than at o. Similarly,      when the employee’s S is equal to zero and outside          firms expect

it to be equal one with positive probability,       the employee’s expected     wage is higher on the

outside.

                                                    15
1.4      First Period Wages

I now turn to the way wages offered by o in the first period depend on the realization                        of S.

Any given realization      of Sleads,      aswe saw earlier, toan       estimate     ofT     that is not changed

from the first to the second period.           Thus, if paying awagew          leadsan     employee tostay,    and

supposing   the firm does not discount           the future, the firm gains

                     q + VET(S)+ {F(w”(s)– g)[q + VET(S) – w“(s)]}
                                                                 – w.                                          (25)

where wO(S) represents,           once again, the optimal       second period       wage as a function        of S

that I computed       in Section 1. In this expression,        the term in curly brackets is equal to the

maximized       value of (1), it represents     the expected    second period profits from being able to

offer an employee with a particular            S a wage w“(S) in the second period.

     Assuming employees do not discount the future either,                an employee who stays at firm o

expects a present value of total compensation             over two periods equal to

                                                  w + C(w”(s))

     By leaving, the employee can expect to earn a present value of total compensation                        equal

to

                                                 g+ n + Ca(z, s)

The employee thus leaves whenever his n is above the cutoff value n“(z, S, w) which is given

by

                                  n“(z, s,w)   = w + C(w”(s)) – g – Ca(z, s).                                  (26)

     Thus, firm o sets first period wages in order to maximize

 F(w +C(WO(S)) – I-          C“(2, S)){q +VET(S)        + F(WO(S) – q)19 +VET(S)             - w“(s)] - W} (27)

      In general, the wage that maximizes           (27) depends    both on z and on S so that I denote

this optimal     wage by w*(z, S). Assuming an interior            solution,    the first order condition      that

characterizes     w“ (z, S), is

f(~(z, s,W“(Z,      s))){q+vET(s)+F(w”(s)
                                    -q)[q+vET(s)-w”(s)]-w*(z,s)}-F(n(z, s,w*(z,s)))=o
                                                                                                               (28)


                                                        16
    I am now in a position        to describe the equilibrium         for this model.     Suppose we start with

a candidate       value of z, which I call 5. Given this candidate          z, one can solve (28) for w*(Z, S)

and use (26) to compute          the optimal      cutoffs for the two types.        This allows one to compute


                                                   +F(n”(:,    1, W“(2, l)))
                                                                                                               (29)
                      ‘(z) =   ~F(rz*(i, I,    W*(i, l))) +(1 - @)F(rz*(2,0, w*(:, o)))
    The denominator         of this expression      gives the fraction of all employms          that leaves firm o

for given Z and wages w“ (2, S). The numerator                 represents   the fraction of all employees who

both leave firm o and have an S equal to one. The variable 2 therefore                         equals the fraction

z that results from 2 and the wage policy w“(5, S). In equilibrium,                      ;(2) must thus equal ;

itself. Because Z and i take values between zero and one and the ; function                         is continuous,

the Brewer fixed point theorem              implies that there exists an equilibrium           2 which equals the

resulting    2. In general, there is no reason to suppose that there exists only one equilibrium

though,     generically,   the equilibria     will be locally distinct.     9

    To study how the equil~.brium wages vary with u *, one thus generally                        has to take into

account how the equilibrium           z varies with UWas well. However, it is of interest               to see how

wages would vary if z were fixed both to develop intuition                       and because    there is a special

case where this applies         directly.     If z were fixed, one can see how wages vary simply by

differentiating     (28) with respect       to the wage and to c’. This gives

      ~~(z,s)       = f - r{9 + ~~~(s) + ~(~”(s) - F)[q+ ~~~(s) - ~“(s)l - ~}                                  (30)

    The second order condition              implies that the denominator           of this expression   is positive

and, as long as a condition        that is analogous       to (5) is satisfied,     the numerator    is positive as

well. Then, an increase in expected             outside compensation        in the second period leads firm o

to raise its first period wage. Thus, in this case, a reduction                 in oW, which lowers c; and raises

~ lowers the wage associated           with S equal to one, w“(z, 1), and raises the wage associated

    ‘Indeed   Acemoglu and Piachke (1996) display multiplicities    in a very similar model. The function 2 is
increuing   because a high value of Z leads to high second period wages, which in turn leads to a high value
of 2. Multiplicities ariae if the slope of this function is greater then one for certain values of 2 while it is
smaller than one for others. In the numerical simulations reported below, the equilibrium       turns out to be
globally unique.

with S equal to zero, w“(z, O). Thus, as long M w“(O, 1) starts out being higher than w“(O, O)

an increase in UWraises the gap between               the highest and lowest wages paid inside firm o.

    This gap between the highest and lowest firm paid inside a firm corresponds,                     broadly, to

the variability     of wages inside firms.     The analysis      above also implies that      an even simpler

measure of inequalit y increases with OW. This simpler measure is the gap between the highest

and lowest first period wage paid in the economy which, given that                   the economy        contains

only three wages also corresponds          broadly     to measures    such as the interdecile     range.     In the

model, the lowest wage paid is ~ so this measure of inequality               rises whenever       w’(z, 1) rises,

    Because the denominator           of (3o)is positive,     it follows that the optimal    wage cannot rise

by as much as c= itself. Given (26), this implies that a rise in c“ unambiguously                     lowers the

cutoff n at which employees leave and, as a result, it raises the number of quits.                    Therefore,

a reduction      in UWincreases the turnover      of employees whose S is equal to zero while it raises

the turnover      of employees whose S is equal to one.

    I now turn to the question          of whether,     as required   above for inequality      within firms to

rise, the first period wage of employees          whose S is equal to one exceeds that of employees

whose S is equal to zero. A higher S implies a higher ET and this unambiguously                        raise    the

terms in curly brackets       in both (27) and in (28).          As in the analysis of (4), this raises the

optimal     wage. On the other hand, employees              whose S is equal to one can expect          a higher

second period wage in firm o if they remain and, because their probability                      of getting     an R

equal to one is larger, they also anticipate             a higher value for c“(z, S).       The former raises

the cutoff n in (26) while the latter          lowers it.     Thus, with (5) satisfied,      the former tends

to reduce w“(z, 1) relative         to w“(z, O) while the latter tends to increase          it. Thus, the fact

that CO(WO(S))goes up for employees who infer that their S is equal to one introduces                          some

ambiguity     in the relationship     between w“(z, 1) and W*(z, O).

    I now show that,        in the case of F uniform,           the effect of the increase      in CO(WO(S)) is

quantitatively      less important     than the other two effects so that,        w“(z, 1) is indeed larger

than w’(z, O). In the uniform c~e, substituting               the wage in (6) into (19) and using (7), (28)

   h[q+vET        +h(q-~;         vET)2-w]-h[w+            ;(q-~;        vET)2    + *       –C’(z,   s)]    = o

so that the optimal     wage is

                                                                  h q–~+vET             2

   For a given Ca(z, S), this is clearly increasing       in ET so that w“(z, 1) would exceed w“(z, O)

if employees with different wages expected          their outside    compensation       in the second period

to be the same.       In fact, employees    with S equal to one expect            a higher second period

compensation      on the outside and this too raises w“(z, 1) relative to w*(z, O).

   I now provide some intuition        for the result that, for constant       z and under the conditions

I have laid out, increases in UWraise the relative turnover of high S individuals                together     with

their relative wages. Figure 1 helps one interpret          these results.    This figure shows the labor

supply curve given, implicitly,      by (26). This is a labor supply curve because a higher wage

leads workers to have a higher cutoff n’ so that the fraction of this type of workers staying at

the firm, F(nc),    rises. The firm then has a conventional          monopsony      problem in which there

is a marginal     cost of labor that lies above the labor supply curve and a marginal                      revenue

from an additional      unit of labor which, in this case, is horizontal.           The equilibrium          cutoff

is the one that ensures that marginal cost is equal to marginal              revenue and the equilibrium

wage ensur=       that this cutoff is on the labor supply curve.

   An increase in c’ for this worker (which would result if the employee had an S equal to

zero and Uw fell) would shift the labor supply            curve to the left because it raises what the

worker can expect to earn outside and thus it makes departures                 more attractive.       This leads

to a reduction     in the cutoff, so that more workers of this type leave in equilibrium                   and, at

least for linear labor supply, also leads to an increme in the equilibrium              wage. An incre~e in

OWlowers c’ for workers with S equal to zero while raising it for those with S equal to one,

so that it moves the labor supply curve of employees                with S equal zero to the right while

it mov=    that    of employees    with S equal to one to the left.          It thus increases       the relative

turnover   and wages of high S workers.

                                                     19
    The question       is then whether      taking into account       the endogeneity    of z changes these

results.     It is easy to see that,     even with endogenous         z, either   the labor supply curve of

workers with S equal to one must move to the left or that                    of employees   with S equal to

zero must move to the right.        The reason is that changes in z move both curvm in the same

direction.     For instanm,    increases in z move both labor supply curves to the left since they

raise the value of c“ for both sets of employees.

    There is actually     one interesting    case where the assumption         that z does not change when

UWchanges is appropriate.         This is the case where employees with S equal to one have such

high productivity       that   firm o is led to pay them a wage that              keeps them at firm o with

probability     one. In other words, in this case, w“(O, 1) is not an interior solution but rather,

is the wage that ensures        that the cutoff (26) is given by n. Thus,


                                  W“(o,l) = fi+q+         Ca(o,l) – C(w”(l))


    As long as the cutoff for employees with S equal to zero is lower, z is zero and remains

zero for arbitrarily    small changes in OW.The earlier analysis implies that a small reduction              in

aW raises C=(O,O) and lowers c“(O, 1). The above equation                now implies immediately      that the

wage for employees with S equal to one falls while, given the cond it ions discussed earlier, the

wage w“(O, O) must rise so that inequality              within the firm falls. While turnover for high S

employees does not change in this case, those with S equal to zero leave firm o with increased

probability.


Z          Social      Efficiency

In this section I ask whether          the allocation    of labor is more efficient when workers have a

higher value of UW. For the purposes of this analysis, I ignore distributional              issues altogether.

In other words, I ask simply whether equilibria               with different values of OWproduce a larger

amount of total social output.          The natural      definition   of social output   in the model, which

I will label Q includ=         both the output     produced      in firms for sale in the market,      which I

will label Q and the nonpecuniary           benefits earned by workers, particularly        since the two are

                                                         20
comparable       in the worker’s eyes.

    An increase in O does not, of course, guarantee                that the allocation    is Pareto superior and,

indeed, it generally will not be since some workers will see their wages rise while others will

see their wages decline. An increase in this output                  measure suggests     that a Pareto superior

allocation      would be obtaine,ble        if one had access to lump sum transfers           but, if these really

were possible,      the distributional        concerns     which are the heart of this paper would not be

very important.        Nonetheless,       it is useful to know whether increasing         trust    in capitalism    by

increasing fYWraises, in some sense, the total value of the pie that is produced.                    Because these

are more readily observable             measures,     it is also of interest   to study the effect of changes in

OWon the value of market output               Q and on the value of the average first period wage, which

equals

                 w = q + ~[hn”(z,
                                1)(?.0”(2,           1) - q)] + (1 -    ~)[hn”(z, o)(w”(z, o) - g)]                (32)

In particular,     it is worth knowing whether the change in market output                   Q or in the average

first period wage is a good indicator               of the change in Q.

    When a worker with a given ET works at either o or b, market                          output     is q + vET.      I

suppose      that when he works at either al or a2, his market                   output   is g so that his social

output    inclusive of nonpecuniary            benefits is ~ + n. 10 Because workers voluntarily              decide

whether to stay at o or b, their decisions involve cutoff values for n; workers whose n is below

the cutoff stay while the others leave. From a social point of view it is also optimal                       to have

cutoffs for n. In particular,           if it is optimal     for workers with given values for their signals

and a given n to leave their employers,               it follows that all workers with the same signals and

higher values of n should leave as well. Similarly, if workers with given signals and a given

n should stay, so should all workers with lower values of n.

    In equilibrium,      there are six cutoff values of n. First,              there are two cutoffs at b in the

second period associated           with R being equal to either zero or one. I label these n: and n!

respectively.     Second, there are two cutoffs at o in the second period ~sociated                   with S being

  1°As noted in footnote 5, ~ cculd in principle        also include the rents from learning the value of the signal
R. If it did include   these   rents,   however,   ~ would change with z so the earlier analysis would have to be
modified.

equal to either zero or one. I label these n: and n: respectively.                               Finally, there are the two

cutoffs at o in period one associated                  with S being either zero or one and these I label no and

nl.

      Before computing           O and Q as a function           of these six cutoffs, it is worth computing             social

and market output           of a worker at o (or b) in the second period assuming                         that the worker’s

expected     T is given by ET and that the cutoff is given by n’. Market output                               is simply


                                                 q + F(?zc)(q       + VET – Q)


while social output         is

                                      g + F(nc)(q         + vET)       – ~) + J= ndF(n)

In the uniform case this equals

                            u(nc, ET) = ~ + *               + hnC(q + vET – ~) – h(nC)2/2                                 (33)

so that    the derivative        of social    output      with   respect      to n’   is


                                                       h(q + VET – q – n’)                                                 (34)

Total output      thus increases with the cutoff n’ as long as output                            inside the firm, q + vET,

is larger than ; + n’, the output                outside     the firm for the cutoff value of n’. Because social

output     is a concave function             of nc, the optimal         cutoff is the one where these two values of

output     are equal.

      Now consider the social output               of an employee with S equal to one, If he stays in o, his

output     in the first period is q + vu while his expected output                         in the second period is u(n~, a).

If he goes to al, his output             in the first period is ~ + n. With probability                   P(R = 1IS = 1)

his expected     output      in the second period is u(n~, E(TIR = 1, S = 1)) while with probability

P(R = 01S = 1) it is w(n~, E(TIR = 0,S = l)).                           Thus, in the uniform case, overall expected

output     for such an employee is

                                                                    23
where Q. is computed       analogously     to Q1.

    We saw earlier that changes in u ~ affect nl and nz and this obviously results in changes

in overall output.    Below, I compute these effect on output           but it is important     to realize that,

in general, there are additional        output    effects from changes in aW. In particular,          whenever

changes in aW affect z, firms of type 6 change their wage offers in the second period.                  This, in

effect, changes the cutoffs values n: and n: and this h= additional               welfare effects. Thus, my

numerical    analysis looks at three different measures            to assess the effect of av on efficiency.

First, I look at h(q + vET – ~ – nl) and h(q + vET – ~ – nO) to see the period one output

effects of changes in aW. Then, I look at the derivatives             of the form of (36). I also compute

the derivative    of O with respect      to aW taking into account        the changes in z. 11 Using the

same method,      I also compute     the derivative of Q with respect to aW.

    The use of simulations       also allows me to compute           changes in different measures        of in-

equality.   So far, I have concentrated          on the gap between     the highest and lowest wage paid

inside firm o and the gap between the highest and lowest first period wage paid in the econ-

omy. Here, I consider       two additional       measures.     The first is the ratio of the average wage

earned by employees whose S equals one, which I denote by ws=l, to ws=o, the average wage

earned by employ~s        whose S equals zero.          If S were observable,      this would be a natural

estimate    of the inequality   between people whose S differs. The second measure I consider is

the variance of the logarithm       of first period wages. Both of these measures can be computed

using variants of the method        used to compute          average wages in (32).

    Table 1 presents      the results    for four combinations       of parameters.        All these numerical

exercises are carried out assuming         that q and g are equal to one, while a is equal to .9 and h

is equal to 1.5. As can be seen from the table, the first three experiments                   involve a ~ equal

to .7 while the last involves a smaller ~. The parameter                 v equals 1 in the first column,           2

in the second and 3 in the last two. In all four simulations,               the first period wage is higher

for employees with S equals to one and rises with u ~, even when taking into account                          the

 11I compute this derivative by first computing the equilibrium      z and the resulting    Q when u is equal to
UW and then recomputing    these values for a slightly smaller value of UW.

endogenous      response of z. Thus, the ratio of the highest to lowest first period wage paid in

the economy rises. In addition,          increases in UWraise the ratio of the highest          to the lowest

wage paid inside firm o and also raise the average wage earned by people whose S equals

one relative to the average wage earned by people whose S equals zero. The variance of log

wages, on the other hand, doa           not always increase t bough it increases        in three of the four

combinations      considered.

    The main qualitative         difference between these simulations        is that increases in aW lead to

different output     effects for different parameter        values. As can be seen from the information

in the first two rows of the table, the first column is unique in representing             a situation    where

v is sufficiently    low that    even high S employees leave firm o with positive             probability.       I

report   only one such simulation            because    all of those I have computed      have qualitatively

similar properties     to that    reported     in column one.      In particular,   they involve declines in

both overall output      and in market        output    in response to increases in aW.

    The reason for this turns        out to be that an increase in UWreduces the turnover                 of em-

ployees with S equal to zero while raising the turnover                of employees   with S equal to one.

Unfortunately,      the turnover of these latter employees is socially more costly. This can be seen

by analyzing the first period benefits from increasing the cutoff n for both sets of employees.

The general formula for these first period benefits is given in (34) though                it reduces to the

simpler formula in the eigh ~h and ninth rows in the case where q is equal to ~. The entries

in these rows show that social output            rises in the first period when the cutoff for either type

of employee is increased,        t bough it rises more with the cutoff for employees whose S equals

one. The reason for this discrepancy            is that (31) implies that, leaving everything      else equal,

firm o only increases the wages of employees with S equal to one by one half of their extra

productivity.    This means that the gap between the actual productivity                of an employee and

the wage he is paid (which is what determines               whether he leaves) is larger for more produc-

tive employees.      The result is that       there is a bigger social gain when the retention           rate for

these employees goes up and this can be accomplished                 by lowering aW.

    The second column shows a situation                where the higher value of v ensures that employees


                                                          25
with S equal to one are retained with probability           one by firm o. Then, social output           increases

with CTW
       because such increases reduce the turnover of employees with S equal to zero (while

having      no local effect on the turnover       of employees     whose S equals one).             Qualitatively

identical     results arises when, as in the third column, v is incre~ed             further    so that it equals

3.

     The main purpose          of the third column     is to permit     comparison     with the last column,

which keeps v equal to 3 w-bile lowering #. This changes the results dramatically                         because

overall output      now declines when UWgoes up. This is true even though first period overall

output      still rises when turnover by employees with S equal zero is reduced and even though

the increase in UWdoes reduce turnover.           The reason for the decline in O is that the derivative

given in (38) is negative because the social value of having employees with S equal to zero

outside     firm o in the second period is lower than having them inside firm o. The reason for

this is that,    as I discussed earlier, social output      is a concave function       of nb and having the

employee be outside        the firm induces randomness         in his cutoff depending         on the realization

of R.

     Another     interesting    fea:ure   of the last column    is that   the decline in overall output             is

accompanied       by an incre~e       in market   output,   as well as by an increase            in average first

period wages. Thus these simple measures             are not good indicators      of overall output.       In this

c~e, the principal source of loss is that, because employees are more attached                   to their original

employer,      they are less likely to get high nonpecuniary          benefits from alternate       employers.

     In conclusion,    there are robust examples       where an increase in OWraises inequality             while,

at the same time lowering overall output.            Thus, the increase in inequality          that results from

the changes in beliefs that I am considering          would be detrimental      even if lump sum transfers

were available.     In addition,    there are cases where overall output       falls even though measured

GNP rises so that simple measures cannot be used to gauge the welfare effects of the changes

in beliefs.

3        Observable                Characteristics

So far I have treated         the signals S and R as observed privately            by firms and their employees.

Thus the increase in first period wage inequality                  I derived must be thought        of as an increme

in the inequality          within groups with identical       observable      characteristics.     I now show that

the analysis       developed    above can, in principle,          apply also to changes in inequality       betw~n

groups that differ in observable         ways. A general treatment             of this issue is beyond the scope

of this paper.       In this section I show only that              a special case exists where the analysis          in

the earlier sections applies unchanged             so that an increase in UWleads to increased inequality

between groups.

       I suppose    that there is a signal e which, again, takes either a value of zero or one. This

signal, which can be thought          of as an indicator      of education,    is correlated     with T in the sense

that

                                      P(T=lle       =l)>P(T=lle=                O).                              (39)

I also assume that the indicator            e is correlated       with S so that


                                      P(S=l\e        =l)>P(S=lle=O)                                              (40)


Thus, education        is both positively       correlated    with actual productivity           and with the signal

of productivity       S.

       I now give an example        where, in spite of (39), wages depend only on S and R as before.

One feature of this example is that, consistent               with Figure 2,


                                  P(T=llS        =1, e=l)=P(T=llS=l)                                             (41)


       In Figure 2, the set of events where S is equal to one is given by the union of the sets

whose areas are A, B, D and E. The set of events where e is equal to one is given by the

union of the are=           A, B and C, while the set of events where T is equal to one is given by

the union of A, D and E. Thus, the probability                     that T is one, conditional       on both C and e

being equal to one is A/(A + B) while the probability                      that T is one conditional       on just S


                                                             27
being equal to one is (A+         D)/(A      + B + D + E). Thus,        (41) is satisfied as long as

                                                       AD
                                                       —=—
                                                       BE

    Note that the Figure is consistent            with (39) because the probability        that T is one condi-

tional on e being one, A/(A + B + C), is larger than the unconditional                    probability     that T is

one which is given by (A+ D + E)/(A + D + E + G). On the other hand, the probability                          that

T is one conditional     on S being one is, given the above equation,                 A/(A + B). This means

that S is a strictly   better    indicator       of T than is e (since the conditional      probability     that T

is one is strictly   larger when S is one than when only e is known to equal one. Because the

events where e indicates        that 2’ is one are also events where S indicates           the same thing, e is

superfluous   so that firm o need look only at S to determine                  an employee’s productivity.

    As long ~ firm b observes S, the wages it pays then depend only on S and R so that e

is superfluous   for b as well. While I have assumed that S is not directly observable                     by b, S

becomes known in equilibrium           to b as long as the parameters            are such that only employees

with S equal to zero ever leave firm o. Then, firm b knows that any employee it hires has

an S equal to zero and can safely neglect information                  contained    in e. Thus, the equilibria

studied in earlier sections for these combinations             of parameters     continue to be equilibria even

when the signal e is available,

    An econometrician      who does not observe S will tend to compute                 wages conditional      on e.

The average wage conditional          on e being equal to one is

                                             A+B                       c
                                ‘e=l=A+B+C              ‘s=l+A+B+Cws=O

while that condition       on e being equal to zero is

                                             D                      E+F+G
                       ‘e=O=D+E+F+G                     ‘s’l+D+E+F+Gws=O

where G represents      the area of points where T, S and e equal one and where, given the way

the figure is drawn (40) is satisfied because

                                          A+B                      D
                                      A+B+C             ‘D+     E+F+G

                                                          28
    This condition      implies that the ratio W.=l /w.=O rises with the ratio w,s=l/ Ws=o, Since

this latter     ratio rises with OW in all the simulations              reported   in Table     1, the “education

differential”    w,H1/w.GO rises as well. 12


4      Empirical               Relevance

One way of demonstrating           the empirical       validity    of the model in this paper         would be to

show that holding constant        the productivity         of individuals,   the distribution    of income is more

unequal when people feel that pay is less related to productivity.                 Unfortunately,    neither cross-

section nor time series data on peoples’ opinions about the connection                    of pay to productivity

appears     to exist.   What     does exist is data on peoples’ opinions              about     the desirability   of

income dispersion       in general       and about    the extent      to which they want redistribution            to

increase.     In addition   there is, of course, data on political             outcomes    in different    places at

different points in time.

    In this section, I discuss data of this sort and relate it to the actual distribution                 of income.

I consider both data across countries            at a point in time and, to a much lesser extent data

over time for the United States.            Figure 3 focuses on seven countries            at a point in time.     It

shows the relationship         between     the attitudes      towards inequality     from a 1987 international

survey as well as inequality       measures      from around the same period.             13

    The horizontal      axis of this figure gives the fraction of people who agree with the statement

that “Differences in income in [respondent’s               country] are too large”. These figures are drawn

from Evans (1993) which reports              the results of a 1987 survey which asked the same set of

questions in the seven countries          reported   in the figure. 14 On the vertical axis, the figure gives

   12Note that this analysis is agnostic w to whether education helps in raising S or T. In other words,
the analysis takes the joint diat ribu tion of T, S and e as given without inquiring as to the determinants
of any of these variables. One can thus imagine that the correlation between S, T and e is due in part to
the productivity    enhancing effect of education,   as long M one accepts that after the education is completed,
firms have access to a signal of productivity      that is better than the individual’s educational     diploma. Or,
one can imagine that e is typically high for able individuals simply because these enjoy education more.
   13Memura      of inequality are not available for every year although this problem may not be extremely
severe because inequality changes relatively slowly.
   14The only other country included in the survey was Hungary which I excluded because I felt that the data
on actual inequality was probably not very meaningful in the during its post-communist           transformation.



                                                            29
the Gini coefficient for household             pre-t ax income.           These figures are drawn from Deininger

and Squire (1995) who report inequality                   measures       from a number of sources.             To help make

these figures comparable,            I used figures from the LIS data base ( Atkinson,                        Rainwater     and

Smeeding,        1995) for all the countries           for which these figures were available,                namely      for all

countries    except     Austria      and Australia.        15 The correlation            between    these figures is -.72.

Such a negative        correlation     fits with the model presented                earlier if one regards       the opinion

that inequality       is too large as closely related            to the opinion that pay does not correspond                  to

performance.

    There are, of course, akernative               interpretations.            One possibility     is that the perception

of large inequities      leads to policies which cause actual inequality.                     This too would make the

widespread        perception   of inequity      lead to a relatively            even distribution       of income.     But, if

this theory       were valid, the perceptions            would affect incomes only through                    their effect on

policies.

    One way these policies could be leading                        to the negative        correlation    in figure 3 is by

affecting the measured         income distribution              itself. The measure of pre tax household               income

on which my Gini coefficients are based includes some government                            transfers and cash transfers

to poor people might be larger in countries                     where people dislike inequality          more. I have thus

also looked at OECD meas~res of the distribution                         of labor earnings.        The coverage of these

data is not uniform for the seven countries                 in my sample.         For Austria, the U.K. and the U. S.,

the figures appear to be comparable                and the ratio D9/D5 is largest in the U. S., intermediate

in the U.K. and smallest             in Austria.       The D5/Dl         ratio is highest in the U.S. and lower for

the U.K. and Austria,          though the latter two numbers                   are essentially   identical.    These figures

are broadly       consistent   with the Gini coefficients for pre-tax income.

    Another       source of potential       endogeneity,          is that high income people might work less in

countries       where people dislike inequality             more because they are subject               to more taxation.
  151 picked,    for each country    the observation     that    was closest    to 1987. The data for Switzerland      me from
1982, those for Germany are from 1983, those for Norway, the U.K. and the U,S. are from 1986 and those for
Ireland and the Netherlands    are from 1987. The Australian  data come from the 1989 Statistical Yearbook
for Australia  while those for Austria, whine data are probably the least comparable  to the others, comes
from 1987.



                                                                 30
In fact, it is not clear that             the countries     in my sample         in which people dislike inmme

inequality     have particularly        progressive     income taxes.       In particular,     the correlation    of the

Gini coefficients based on after tax household                 income (all of which come from the LIS data

base) with the Evans’ measure is only -.40.

    When people say that they think inequality                    is excessive, they could have many different

things     in mind.       For instance,       they might feel that        the differences      in income are due to

differences in social contributions            but that differences in social contributions            do not warrant

large income disparities.          In particular,     they might be unhappy             if differences in raw abilities

(= opposed        to in effort) lead to large differences            in income.     It is also possible that,       as in

my theory,        they dislike income inequality           because      they feel that      differences in income     do

not reflect differences in productivity.              Unfortunately,      I am unaware of international          surveys

which allow one to sort out the relative importance                      of these perceptions       in explaining    the

differences in attitudes          portrayed     in Figure 3. In any event, and as I expound                  on in the

conclusion,      I regard my theory as only a first attempt             at showing that beliefs about inequality

matter     and hope that         related models can explain            why other changes in attitudes            towards

inequality     have similar effects.

    Because it corresponds           most closely to the belief that pay does not reflect performance,

I focused attention          on the survey which asked whether                people thought       income disparities

were excessive.       It is important      to note, however, that the answer to this question is strongly

positively     correlated      with the answer to questions            that ask whether      people favor additional

redistribution      from the rich to the poor.            Evans (1993) reports           a measure which gives the

mean response to questions            ~king people whether they would like the unemployed                    to receive

a guaranteed        standard     of living, whether       they support       more spending        on benefits    for the

poor, whether         they support      a guarant~      of jobs for everyone and whether             they are in favor

of a basic income for everyone.             With a higher means score representing                less enthusiasm     for

redistribution,       the correlation     between this mean score and the answer plotted                   in Figure 3

is -.80.     Similarly,     the mean score against         redistribution      has a correlation      of .78 with the

pre-tax Gini coefficient and of .52 with the after-tax                   coefficient.

    Time series evidence on attitudes                 towards income inequality               seems even harder to obtain.

This is particularly         surprising        given that many political          analysts      have noted a ‘shift to the

right”   in U. S., British          and Canadian           electoral    outcomes.       In all three countries,         the late

1970’s and early 1980’s saw the election of leaders like Ronald                               Reagan,    Margaret      Thatcher

and Brian Mulroney whose rhetoric                    was substantially        more ‘pro-market”            than that of their

predecessors.      The only U.S. data that confirms that this wa-s accompanied                                by a change in

people’s attitude       towards        redistribution        are reported      in I<luegel and Smith (1986).               They

conducted       a national    survey in 1980 and found that only 1S70 of their respondents                             disagreed

with the statement           that    the U.S. was spending               too much on welfare.            As they say, this is

substantially      smaller than         the 3970 of the people who agreed,                    in a 1969 survey conducted

by Feagin (1975), that the “U.S. was spending                          too little on welfare. This comparison             suffers

from several difficulties           not the le~t        of which is that the public perception                of government

policies might have been different in the two instances.

    In spite of the paucity              of attitudinal        data,     it may be reasonable           to suppose      that the

change in electoral outcomes                  in these three countries is suggestive            of an increased confidence

in the free market system.             If so, it is tempting           to think about whether           the incre~ed     income

inequality      in these three         countries      over the last 20 years couple is partially                    due to this

change in attitudes.          What makes this explanation                  attractive     is that, as Moss (1995) shows,

inequality      h= worsened disproportionately                  in these three countries         (together with Australia).

By contrast       countries     in continental         Europe such as France,             Italy and Germany          have seen

their earnings       inequality       fall.     And, interestingly,        leaders in these countries          appear     not to

have shifted nearly as much towards a free market rhetoric.                              16

    Thus the increase           in United         States     income inequality          surveyed    in Levy and Murnane

(1992), which involves incremed                   dispersions     in wages both within groups of similar educa-

tional attainment        as well as across groups that differ in their education,                          could be due to a
   ‘6This is no place for a thorough survey of the extensive literature on the forces that have recently affected
the income distribution   in a variety of countries. It is worth mentioning one complementary     view here; namely
that free-market oriented leaders have worsened the income distribution         in their countries by reducing the
influence of unions. For a discussion of this possibility see Freeman and Katz (1994).




                                                                  32
change in beliefs about the fairness of the free enterprise               system.    This explanation           is consis-

tent with a remarkable          change in workers’ attitudes          towards their employers.              As Uchitelle

(1994) reports citing a study by Richard               Freeman and Joel Rogers, workers no longer view

big business m an adversary.           They do not blame their employers for the anxiety that they

feel about their income and job security.              Instead,    workers regard their employers              as victims

of global competition         which forces employers        to cut costs and lay off workers.

     Thus, interestingly,      international      competition      may have increased       income inequality          via

two mechanisms.            The first and more traditional           one, is that    this competition           may have

reduced      the demand for low skilled workers,            The second is that the existence                of this inter-

national     competition     may have convinced         workers that their employers             are not being unfair

when they cut wages. This, in turn, may have exacerbated                     inequality     through         a mechanism

akin to the one presented         in this paper.


5       Conclusions

This paper presented         a first attempt     at understanding      how changes in workers’ conception               of

the capitalist    system affect the distribution          of income. The main contribution                  of the paper

is that it shows that changes in beliefs can have a direct effect on the distribution                          of income

even if they do not affect the inherent             productivity     or the effort of any worker. 17.

     This result is based on considering             a particular     change in beliefs, namely              a change in

the extent to which people believe employers                are accurate     in their assessment            of individual

productivity.     This is related    to peoples’ general attitude          towards income inequality             because

a belief that employers are inaccurate             and whimsical in deciding who should get a high wage

is presumably      associated     with a dislike for the income inequality                that    results     from these

decisions.    The main issue that is left unaddressed is whether the results in this paper extend

to   changes in attitudes       towards       income inequality     that stem from other sourcm.                 It would

be interesting     to know whether        a    related model would predict that the income distribution

   17By contrast, most of the modern theoretical literature on income distribution     makes the distribution of
income vary only = a result of changes in actual the inherent productivity y of different workers. For a recent
example and some references, see Acemoglu (1995)


                                                           33
depends        also on the extent      to which people believe that people whose productivity                          differs

ought     to earn different      levels of income.         One possible          model along these lines might                 be

constructed       by extending      P.kerlof’s (1982) ‘(gift exchange”               model.   In that        model,    worker

effort depends        on the relation       between      the wage paid and the “reference wage” and firms

maximize        profits   by taking     into account       this relationship,          As social notions         of fairness

change,    the relevant       reference wage may change as well. In particular,                       an increased      belief

that more productive           people should be paid more might lower the reference wage for low

skilled workers while raising that for skilled workers.                   And, in turn, this might widen income

disparities.

    Another       issue that    deserves further         attention     is the way workers modify               their beliefs

about     the appropriateness         of the income distribution.           In part, this would require modeling

the learning of workers along lines similar to Piketty                   (1995). In addition,     it is worth thinking

about     changes in society that tight           have relatively        rapid effects on these beliefs.           Suppose,

for instance,     that a new technology is introduced                and that it is apparent      to workers and firms

that only some people can use this technology                     effectively.     Or, along the same lines, global

competition       makes raise the relative value of the output                of certain workers. If workers come

to feel that employers are able to determine                the identity of those workers whose productivity

is enhanced        by either    technical     progress     or international        competition,       they     are in effect

increasing      their trust in the connection         between pay and productivity.

    The other element that has been left out of the model is the effect of ideological                                changes

on the institutions        that are determined        in the political      arena. If workers perceive capitalism

as fair, they are more likely to vote for representatives                     that uphold capitalist           institutions,

engage in less redistribution          and, quite possibly, try to reduce the influence of unions.                     These

institutional      changes,    particularly    the reduction          in union power, would presumably                  affect

the income distribution          as well. It then becomes important                  to disentangle     the direct effects

of changes       in ideology     from those brought           about     indirectly     through    changes       in political

institutions.
