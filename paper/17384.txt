An Experimental Study of Alternative Campaign Finance Systems: Donations, Elections and
Policy Choices

                                              ABSTRACT

We experimentally study the effect of alternative campaign finance systems – as characterized by
different information structure about donors – on donations, election outcomes, political candidates'
policy choices, and welfare. Three alternative campaign finance systems are considered: a full anonymity
(FA) system in which neither the politicians nor the voters are informed about the donors' ideal policies
or levels of donations; a partial anonymity (PA) system in which only the politicians, but not the voters,
are informed about the donors' ideal policies and donations; and finally a no anonymity (NA) system
in which both the politicians and the voters are informed about the donors' ideal policies and donations.

We find that donors contribute less in the FA system than in the PA and NA system, and candidates
are less likely to deviate from their ideal policies under FA than under the PA and NA systems. The
effect of donations on the candidate's policy deviations differs in FA from that in PA and NA. Specifically,
in the FA system larger donations lead to smaller deviations from the candidate's ideal policy; but
in the NA and PA systems, larger donations lead to larger deviations. As a result we observe that the
donations lead to a centrist bias in the candidate's policy choices, i.e., donations are more likely to
make extreme candidate move to the center than to make centrist candidate move to the right. This
centrist bias is present more robustly in FA treatments. Finally, we find that donors greatly benefit
from the possibility of donations regardless of the finance system. Voter welfare remains virtually
unchanged under the PA and NA systems, especially when there is competition among the donors.
Our findings provide the first experimental evidence supportive of Ayres and Ackerman's (2002) campaign
finance reform proposal.

1        Introduction
    Campaign contributions and spendings have many potential eﬀects. On the positive side, cam-
paign resources allow the candidates to fund the dissemination of useful information to the voters.
This may lead the voters to make more informed electoral choices. On the negative side, voters’
interests may be harmed if candidates trade policy favors to special interests, or large donors, in
exchange for contribution. While the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution has repeatedly
been used by the Courts to strike down eﬀorts to restrict overall campaign spending, the ﬁrst
two quotes above suggest that the Supreme Court nonetheless is concerned about the potential
corruptive inﬂuence of money in politics.
    Throughout history, election procedures have been modiﬁed in order to stem the degree of
inﬂuence in elections and policy choices. Secret ballots, for instance, are often thought of as pro-
tection for those who vote against the winning candidate. However, once ballots were made secret,
candidates needed an alternative observable measure by which they could reward those who sup-
ported them during their campaign. Currently, non-anonymous campaign contributions may ﬁll
that role. A candidate cannot tell if an individual votes for him but can see how much money
an individual contributes to his campaign. Based on that knowledge, the candidate could choose
policies to reward that individual for monetary contributions. Indeed, the importance of money in
American electoral campaigns has been steadily increasing over time. In 2008, the elected House
of Representatives on average spent $1.3 millions in their campaigns, a 53% increase in real terms
over the average expenditure in 1998. Over the same period, the average real cost of a winning
Senate campaign increased by 21% to $6.5 million.1
    Given the suspicion that politicians, once elected, are likely to reciprocate on the desires of those
who contributed to their election, as forcefully expressed in the quoted majority opinion of the U.S.

Supreme Court in the McConnell v. FEC [540 U.S. 93 (2003)], there have been numerous attempts
to control and limit the inﬂuence of money in politics. Currently the campaign ﬁnance regulations
can be characterized by two features, transparency and contribution limits. On the transparency
front, the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) of 1972 required candidates to disclose sources of
campaign contributions and campaign expenditures. Current campaign ﬁnance law at the federal
level requires candidate committees, party committees, and political action committees (PACs) to
ﬁle periodic reports disclosing the money they raise and spend.2, 3 Additionally, they must disclose
expenditures to any individual or vendor.
    On the contribution limits front, the 1974 Amendment of FECA introduced statutory limits
on contributions and created the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to enforce the limits of
individual donations to $1,000 and donations by PACs to $5,000.4 These speciﬁc election donations
are known as “hard money.” The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) of 2002, also known
as “McCain-Feingold” named after its sponsors, is the most recent major federal law on campaign
ﬁnance. It revised some of the legal limits on expenditures set in 1974, and prohibited unregulated
contributions (commonly referred to as “soft money”) to national political parties,5 but it also
doubled the contribution limit of hard money, from $1,000 to $2,000 per election cycle, with a
built-in increase for inﬂation (see Potter (2005), written by a former Commissioner of the Federal
Election Commission, for a comprehensive review of the campaign ﬁnance disclosure laws in the
United States).6
    A new paradigm for campaign ﬁnance reform, proposed by Yale Law School professors Bruce
Ackerman and Ian Ayres in their 2004 book Voting with Dollars: A New Paradigm For Campaign
Finance, however, advocates a drastically diﬀerent approach to reduce the corruptive inﬂuence of
money in politics. As highlighted in the third quote above, a key part of Ackerman and Ayres’
   2
    Federal candidate committees must identify, for example, all PACs and party committees that give them contri-
butions, and they must provide the names, occupations, employers, and addresses of all individuals who give them
more than $200 in an election cycle. The Federal Election Commission maintains this database and publishes the
information about campaigns and donors on its web site.
   3
    The Buckley Court did indicate a circumstance in which the FECA’s disclosure requirements might pose such
an undue burden that they would be unconstitutional. The Court opined that disclosure could be unconstitutional if
disclosure would expose groups or their contributors to threats, harassment, and reprisals; and the Court suggested
a “hardship” exemption from disclosure requirements for groups and inviduals able to demonstrate a reasonable
probability that their compliance would result in such adverse consequences.
   4
    In its ruling in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), the Supreme Court upheld contribution limits, but overturned
the expenditure limits, stating: “It is clear that a primary eﬀect of these expenditure limitations is to restrict the
quantity of campaign speech by individuals, groups and candidates. The restrictions. . . limit political expression
at the core of our electoral process and of First Amendment freedoms.” Acknowledging that both contribution
and spending limits had First Amendment implications, the Court stated that the new law’s “expenditure ceiling
impose signiﬁcantly more severe restrictions on protected freedom of political expression and association than do its
limitations on ﬁnancial contributions.” The Court implied, however, that the expenditure limits placed on publicly
funded candidates were constitutional because Presidential candidates were free to disregard the limits if they chose
to reject public ﬁnancing. The Supreme Court aﬃrmed this ruling in Republican National Committee v. FEC, 445
U.S. 955 (1980).
   5
    “Soft money” also refers to funds spent by independent organizations that do not speciﬁcally advocate the election
or defeat of candidates, and funds which are not contributed directly to candidate campaigns.
   6
    In early 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, essentially
overturned part of the BCRA, by appealing to the First Amendment: Corporations and unions can now use general
funds to support or oppose a candidate within 30 days of a presidential primary or 60 days before general elections.

new paradigm instead advocates full anonymity, where all contributions will be made secretly and
anonymously through the FEC, indicating the campaign to which they want them to go.7 Private
donations would still be allowed but they would be anonymous and the FEC would be the clearing-
house for these now anonymous donations. To prevent the donors from communicating to the
politician by donating a specially chosen amount of contributions, the FEC masks the money and
distributes it directly to the campaigns in randomized chunks over a number of days.
    What paradigm will be more eﬀective in reducing the role of corruptive inﬂuence of money in
politics, the full transparency system as advocated by FECA (1972), or the full anonymity system
as advocated by Ackerman and Ayres? In this paper, we use laboratory experiments to make a
ﬁrst step in addressing this important question.8 We conduct laboratory experiments to compare
the diﬀerent campaign ﬁnance systems – as characterized by diﬀerent information structure about
donors available to the politicians and voters – in terms of donors’ contributions, election outcomes
and candidates’ policy choices.
    Speciﬁcally, we consider three alternative campaign ﬁnance systems as characterized by their
information structure.

       ∙ Full Anonymity (FA).           In the FA system, donors’ preferences and the exact amount
         donated by each particular donor is unknown by the candidate and voters. The only informa-
         tion available to the candidate is the total donated amount. We interpret the full anonymity
         system as corresponding to the system advocated by Ackerman and Ayres (2002).

       ∙ Partial Anonymity (PA). In the PA system, we assume that donors’ preferences and the
         amount of donations are unknown by voters. The candidate, however, observes the locations
         and donations of each of the donosr. The partial anonymity system, in our view, corresponds
         closer to the current campaign ﬁnance system in the U.S.

       ∙ No Anonymity (NA).          The NA system can also be referred to as the Full Transparency
         system. Under this system, both the candidates and the voters observe both the donors’
         locations and their contributions. The NA system will correspond to what happens under a
         perfectly enforced campaign ﬁnance disclosure laws.

    Theoretically, the information structures have several eﬀects on the behavior of the candidates,
voters, and donors. For example, the candidate’s ability to reciprocate the donors in their policy
choices depend on whether the donors’ ideal policies are observed by the candidate. Anticipating
this, the donors will thus have diﬀerent incentives to donate to the candidates. Finally, the voters
will also react to the donations depending on their perception of how likely it is the candidate
will move toward the ideal policy of the donors if they win. As we describe in Section 4, in our
experiment we focus on the donors and the candidates, and summarize the voters’ behavior by
electoral rules. In particular, we assume that voters’ election behavior under NA diﬀers from that
under PA and FA in that the eﬀectiveness of donations under NA depends on the donor’s ideal
policy location; in particular, we assume that under NA, donations from more extreme donors are
less eﬀective.
   7
    Ackerman and Ayres’ proposal also includes a Patriot dollar component in which each voter is given a $50 voucher
in every election cycle to allocate between Presidential, House and Senate campaigns.

    As we will argue in Section 3, theoretical comparisons between the fully transparent and fully
anonymous campaign ﬁnance systems are diﬃcult because of the existence of multiple equilibria in
inﬁnitely repeated elections. As a result the theoretical literature we review in Section 2 has mostly
focused on the eﬀect of contribution limits on election outcomes and welfare in models that feature
binding contracts between donors and politicians, which are enforceable only if politicians are aware
of donors’ identities. In the terminology of our paper, the existing theoretical research assumes that
the campaign ﬁnance system is either NA or PA, thus it does not allow for the comparison with the
fully anonymous system in which donors’ identities are not known to the politicians. While there is
a large and growing literature using ﬁeld experiments to study interesting political science issues, we
are unaware of any existing study that investigates the eﬀect of diﬀerent campaign ﬁnance systems
distinguished by information structures.9
    In our experiment, there are three types of agents: political candidates, donors, and a continuum
of voters whose preferences regarding the subsequently implemented policy are characterized by the
interval [0, 300]. The voters are not played by human subjects in our study; instead their behavior
is summarized and represented by probabilistic voting functions. There are two candidates. One
candidate is played by computer and his ideal policy position is ﬁxed at 225. The other candidate
is played by a human subject and his preferences may vary from 0 to 150. Without donations, the
probability of a human candidate being elected depends on his location in such a way that a more
centrist candidate has a higher chance. All information about candidates is common knowledge.
Donors can contribute to the human candidate’s campaign fund. Donations to the campaign fund
do not go directly to the candidate but rather increase his probability of winning the election. Upon
observing the amount of donation and other information available in a particular treatment, the
human candidates make a decision regarding the implemented policy.10 The computer, if elected,
always chooses the policy 225. Whenever the implemented policy diﬀers from their ideal policy, all
agents bear cost equal to a squared distance between the agent’s ideal policy and the implemented
policy. Because of such a payoﬀ function and the timing of actions, it is a dominant strategy for the
candidate to always choose the ideal policy unless interactions are inﬁnitely-repeated. We mimic
an inﬁnitely-repeated environment in our setting by randomly determining the last period.
    We ﬁnd that donors contribute less in the FA system than in the PA and NA system, and
candidates are less likely to deviate from their ideal policies under FA than under the PA and NA
systems. The eﬀect of donations on the candidate’s policy deviations diﬀers in FA from that in
PA and NA. Speciﬁcally, in the FA system larger donations lead to smaller deviations from the
candidate’s ideal policy; but in the NA and PA systems, larger donations lead to larger deviations.
We ﬁnd that donors greatly beneﬁt from the possibility of donations regardless of the ﬁnance
system. Voter welfare remains virtually unchanged under the PA and NA systems, especially when
there is competition among the donors. Finally, we observe a centrist bias, i.e., donations are more
likely to make extreme candidate move to the center than to make centrist candidate move to the
right. Our ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst experimental evidence supportive of Ayres and Ackerman’s
(2002) campaign ﬁnance reform proposal.
    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature.
Section 3 presents a theoretical model of the donor-candidate relationship in which donations

e.g., Green and Gerber (2008), for studies on how to get out to vote using ﬁeld experiments.

       For the sake of data completeness candidates were asked to make a decision before observing the election outcome.

increase the probability a candidate is elected. Under the assumption that a candidate does not
reward the donor by implementing a policy closer to the donor there is a corner solution where the
donor contributes either zero or enough to increase the candidate’s probability of winning to 100%.
Section 4 describes our experimental design, including some modiﬁcations to the theoretical model
in order to make it more consistent with the design. Section 5 presents the experimental results.
Finally, Section 6 concludes.


2         Related Literature
    There is a large theoretical literature in economics and political science that analyzes welfare
consequences from campaign contribution limits.11 It is typically assumed that campaign contri-
butions are used in electoral races to provide information to voters, and the candidates secure
contributions by promising favors. The literature emphasizes two diﬀerent ways that campaign ex-
penditures may provide information to voters. One strand of the literature assumes that campaign
advertising is directly informative (e.g., Coate 2004a, 2004b; Ashworth 2006). For example, Coate
(2004a) presents a model in which limits to campaign contributions may lead to a Pareto improve-
ment. His main insight is that the eﬀectiveness of campaign contributions in increasing votes may
be aﬀected by the presence of contribution limits. When contributions are unrestricted and can-
didates have a strong desire to hold oﬃce, campaign advertising will not be that eﬀective because
voters will rationally be cynical about qualiﬁed candidates, anticipating that they will implement
favors for their contributors if elected. This cynicism will reduce the likelihood of voters switching
their votes and, despite the fact that resources are spent on advertising, qualiﬁed candidates will
not have much of an electoral advantage over unqualiﬁed opponents. On the other hand, when
campaign contributions are limited, candidates’ incentive to oﬀer favors to extract more contribu-
tions is dampened. Voters now anticipate that advertised candidates will implement fewer favors
than in the unrestricted case and this may increase the likelihood they will vote for them. This
increase in the eﬀectiveness of advertising means that limits, despite reducing the level of cam-
paign advertising, need not reduce the likelihood that qualiﬁed candidates get elected. Moreover, if
elected such candidates will implement fewer favors than in the unrestricted case. Thus, all regular
citizens can be better oﬀ when contributions are limited.
    A second strand of the literature instead assumes that political advertising is only indirectly
informative (e.g., Potters, Sloof, and Van Winden, 1997; Sloof 1999; Prat 2002a, 2002b). The core
idea in these papers is that candidates have qualities that interest groups can observe more precisely
than voters and the amount of campaign contributions a candidate collects signals these qualities
to voters, which is the informational beneﬁt of campaign contributions. However, lobbyists make
campaign contributions based on promises from candidates that they are prepared to adopt a policy
stance that goes toward the lobby’s preferred policy and away from the median voter’s preferred
policy. Prat (2002a), for example, showed that banning contributions can raise voters’ aggregate
welfare when the losses in terms of information about competence are smaller than the costs of
policy distortion. In a similar model, Sloof (1999) showed that a disclosure requirement on the
identities of contributors and the amounts involved is beneﬁcial to voters relative to an electoral
environment with no disclosure.

    While there is a large experimental literature on voting, very little exists on campaign ﬁnance.12
Houser and Stratmann (2008) conduct experiments where candidates can send advertisements to
voters in order to inﬂuence the elections. Advertisements may or may not be costly (to voters) to
send but they contain information about the candidate’s quality (high or low). Based on a model
where power-hungry candidates are motivated to trade favors for campaign contributions, they
found in their experimental data that high-quality candidates are elected more frequently, and the
margins of victory for high-quality candidates are also larger, in publicly ﬁnanced campaigns than
in privately ﬁnanced electoral competitions . They also found that contribution caps can improve
voter welfare but do not increase the likelihood that high-quality candidates will be elected.


3        A Theoretical Model
    In this section, we provide a simple analytical framework to understand the incentives for donors
to contribute to the candidates’ campaign. We also use the model as the basis of our experimental
design described in Section 4.

3.1      Basic Set Up for a Single Election
Agents. There are three types of agents in the model: political candidates, (potential) donors
and voters.13 There are two political candidates in each election, 𝐽 > 0 donors and a continuum
of voters.

Policy Space and the Ideal Policies of the Agents. We assume that the set of policies
that can be implemented is characterized by an interval [0, 𝑏]. Agents have preferences over which
particular policy is implemented. Speciﬁcally, we assume that each agent has a most-preferred
policy, sometimes referred to as the ideal policy, 𝑥 ∈ [0, 𝑏] with 𝑏 > 0. If an agent’s ideal policy is
𝑥, and the implemented policy is 𝑦, then the agent’s disutility is −(𝑦 − 𝑥)2 .
    The ideal policies for the two candidates in our model are denoted respectively as 𝑐1 and 𝑐2 .
The locations of candidates are assumed to be common knowledge. This would be the case if,
for example, during the electoral campaign or during prior political activities the preferences of
candidates became known to the public; alternatively, the candidate’s ideal policy could reﬂect the
candidate’s party position.14
    The ideal policy for donor 𝑗 ∈ {1, ..., 𝐽} is denoted by ℓ𝑗 ∈ [0, 𝑏] . Whether ℓ𝑗 is known or not to
the voters and the political candidates depends on the campaign ﬁnance system we describe below.
Finally, voters’ ideal policies are located uniformly on the interval [0, 𝑏] .

Baseline Winning Probabilities. Suppose that the ideal policies of the two candidates be 𝑐1
and 𝑐2 , and suppose that 𝑐1 < 𝑐2 . Then given that voters’ ideal policies are uniformly distributed on
[0, 𝑏] , the expected vote share of the candidates will be given by (𝑐2 + 𝑐1 ) /2𝑏 and (2𝑏 − 𝑐2 − 𝑐1 ) /2𝑏
    12
   See Palfrey (2006) for an insightful survey on laboratory experiments related to political economy issues, and see
Morton and Williams (2010) for an updated review of experimental methodology and reasoning in political science.
    13
    We will from now on drop the adjective “potential” and simply refer to “potential donors” as “donors”. Readers
should be aware that this refers to the role designated to a particular agent.
    14
    However, this assumption does preclude us from exploring the role of campaign expenditures in informing the
voters about the candidates’ positions.

respectively, under the assumption that a voter will vote for the candidate whose ideal policy is
closer to his own. We assume, as is common in probabilistic voting models, (see, e.g., Calvert,
1985 and Banks and Duggan, 2005) that candidate 𝑖′ s probability of being elected, denoted by 𝜌𝑖 ,
corresponds to the theoretical vote share, i.e.,
                                   𝑐2 + 𝑐1                       2𝑏 − 𝑐2 − 𝑐1
                            𝜌1 =           ,    𝜌2 = 1 − 𝜌1 =                 .                     (1)
                                      2𝑏                              2𝑏
We refer to these as baseline winning probabilities, and we will describe below how campaign
contributions aﬀect these probabilities.

Candidates’ Objective Function. We assume that if candidate 𝑖 wins he enjoys utility 𝑣𝑖
from being elected. While a candidate’s ideal policy is common knowledge, he is not restricted to
choosing his ideal policy if elected.
    Denote candidate 𝑖’s policy choice as 𝑦𝑖 , which leads to a loss of −(𝑦𝑖 − 𝑐𝑖 )2 if 𝑖 is elected and
𝑦𝑖 gets implemented. Thus, 𝑖′ s objective is to choose 𝑦𝑖 to maximize

                              𝜌𝑖 ⋅ 𝑣𝑖 − (𝑦𝑖 − 𝑐𝑖 )2 − (1 − 𝜌𝑖 ) [𝑦𝑗 − 𝑐𝑖 ]2 ,
                                  [                ]
                                                                                                    (2)

where 𝑦𝑗 is the policy choice of candidate 𝑗 ∕= 𝑖. Note that the second term in (2) does not depend
on candidate 𝑖′ s choice 𝑦𝑖 .

Donors and Campaign Donations. There are 𝐽 donors in our model. A donor can contribute
to a candidate’s campaign fund. Donations to the campaign fund do not go directly to the candidate,
but do increase the candidate’s probability of winning the election. The donor’s beneﬁts from
donations are two-fold. First, donations can increase the likelihood that the candidate a donor
prefers will win. Second, if interactions are repeated the candidate who received donations might
reciprocate and choose a policy which is more beneﬁcial to the donor.
    In this paper, we focus on donations to one given candidate, say, candidate 1, for simplicity.
In other words we assume that if donors decide to donate they can only donate to candidate 1 or
donate nothing. This simplifying assumption will help us to concentrate on our main question of
interest, which is to what extent big donors can inﬂuence the policy choice of a given candidate. In
particular, we abstract away from questions of the competition between candidates for donations
and from competition between donors contributing to diﬀerent candidates.

Information and Timing. We consider three alternative campaign ﬁnance systems that diﬀer
in their information structure. For all three systems candidates’ locations are common knowledge
and each particular donor always knows his preferences. The ﬁrst system we consider is called Full
Anonymity (FA). Under FA donors’ preferences and the exact amount donated by each particular
donor is unknown by the candidate and voters. The only information available to the candidate is
the total donated amount. The second campaign ﬁnance system is called Partial Anonymity (PA).
Under PA, the candidate and the donors, but not the voters, know the location and donations
of each individual donor. Finally, we also consider a No Anonymity (NA) system where both
the candidate and voters observe donors’ preferences and donated amount. In particular, voters
anticipate that the candidate will reciprocate generous donations by choosing a policy which is
more favorable to donors.

       Candidate             No                         Yes                       Yes

Table 1: Voters’ and Candidate’s Information About Donors Under the Three Campaign Finance
Systems.

    Table 1 summarizes the diﬀerences in the assumed information of the voters and the candidate
about the donors’ donations and their identities (ideal policies).
    The timing in each election is as follows. First, donors learn their locations and the locations
of both candidates. Then each donor decides how much to contribute to candidate 1. The election
takes place and the winner determines the policy, which is publicly observed.

Payoﬀs. We assume that candidate 1’s actual probability of winning is increased from its baseline
winning probability 𝜌1 as in (1) depending on the donations he receives from the donors. We assume
that donor 𝑗 ′ s donation 𝑑𝑗 increases candidate 1′ 𝑠 probability of winning at a rate 𝑟𝑗 . The impact
of donations on candidate 1’s winning probability may depend on donor identity under the no-
anonymity system, if the voters anticipate that donors may diﬀer in how the candidate’s policy
choice upon winning is aﬀected. Thus, for FA and PA we assume that 𝑟𝑗 = 𝑟 for all 𝑗 whereas for
NA 𝑟𝑗 can diﬀer among the donors.
    Ignoring the natural constraint that the probability of elections cannot be greater than 1 for
notational simplicity, the expected payoﬀ for a donor with ideal location ℓ𝑗 and wealth 𝑤 who
donates 𝑑𝑗 to candidate 1, when candidate 𝑖 chooses policy 𝑦𝑖 if elected, is:
                    𝐽                                        𝐽
          (                )                          [              ]
                   ∑                                       ∑
                      𝑟𝑘 𝑑𝑘 𝑤 − 𝑑𝑗 − (𝑦1 − ℓ𝑗 )2 + 𝜌2 −         𝑟𝑘 𝑑𝑘 𝑤 − 𝑑𝑗 − (𝑦2 − ℓ𝑗 )2 .
                             [                   ]                     [                    ]
            𝜌1 +                                                                                   (3)
                 𝑘=1                                        𝑘=1

We assume that a donor’s contribution amount is constrained to be non-negative and no more than
an exogenously set maximal donation amount 𝑤     ¯ ≤ 𝑤.
    Notice that in (3), a donor’s realized payoﬀ may be negative if the chosen policy of the winning
candidate 𝑦𝑖 is too far from the donor’s ideal policy. Since participants in an experiment cannot
receive negative payoﬀs we modify (3) as
         𝐽                                                𝐽
(               )                                   [             ]

                       {[                     ] }                        {[                    ] }

                                                                                                      (4)
In what follows we will refer to (3) as “no limited liability”case and to (4) as “limited liability”case.

3.2   Finite Elections
   We ﬁrst analyze the case of ﬁnite elections. With ﬁnite elections, backward induction implies
that for any campaign ﬁnance system there is no scope for the politicians for reciprocating the
donors. In this sense all elections are independent from each other and it is suﬃcient to simply
analyze the one-period election. Furthermore, as there is no reciprocating by the politicians, all
donors will be contributing only to increase the probability of winning for their preferred candidate,
and not to aﬀect the policy choice of the human candidate.

                                                   8
No limited liability Case. We begin our analysis with the no limited liability case. From the
backward induction argument we know that the candidate 𝑖 will choose policy 𝑐𝑖 which is correctly
anticipated by donor 𝑗 who will choose 𝑑𝑗 to maximize
                   𝐽                                                        𝐽
          (                      )                                     [                  ]
                   ∑                                                        ∑
                                                           2
                                                                                                  𝑤 − 𝑑𝑗 − (𝑐2 − ℓ𝑗 )2 .
                                     [                         ]                              [                       ]
            𝜌1 +         𝑟𝑘 𝑑𝑘           𝑤 − 𝑑𝑗 − (𝑐1 − ℓ𝑗 )       + 𝜌2 −         𝑟𝑘 𝑑𝑘                                    (5)
                   𝑘=1                                                      𝑘=1

This function is linear with respect to 𝑑𝑗 and therefore the maximization problem has a corner
solution at 𝑑∗𝑗 = 0 or 𝑑∗𝑗 = 𝑤.
                             ¯ It is optimal for donor 𝑗 to donate as much as possible, i.e. 𝑤,
                                                                                             ¯ to
candidate 1 if
                                − 1 + 𝑟𝑗 [(𝑐2 − ℓ𝑗 )2 − (𝑐1 − ℓ𝑗 )2 ] > 0;                     (6)
and to donate 0 otherwise. Looking at (6) we see that it is optimal to donate nothing when either
the impact of donations, 𝑟𝑗 , is small or when there is not much diﬀerence between candidates’
platforms from the donor’s point of view.
    If the election probability does not reach 1 then nothing more needs to be done and, in particular,
notice that the behavior of other donors has no impact on optimal 𝑑𝑗 . If, however, the election
probability does reach 1 the result is modiﬁed as follows. Denote by 𝐽1 the minimum number of
donors needed to make the probability of elections equal to 1 for candidate 1. Suppose that there
are 𝐽𝑤¯ donors for whom (6) holds. If 𝐽𝑤¯ < 𝐽1 then all donors with (6) will donate 𝑤  ¯ and the rest
will donate 0. If 𝐽𝑤¯ ≥ 𝐽1 then we will have a multiplicity of equilibria where the sum of donations
                                           ∑
from donors with (6) is such that 𝜌1 + 𝑘 𝑟𝑘 𝑑𝑘 = 1.

Limited Liability Case. Next consider the case in which players’ payoﬀs are restricted to be
non-negative. First, consider the case when 𝑤 ≤ (𝑐2 − ℓ𝑗 )2 . When this condition is satisﬁed, it
means that the donor receives zero payoﬀ whenever the second candidate is elected and therefore
the donor’s objective function is
                                       𝐽
                                  [           ]
                                      ∑
                                         𝑟𝑘 𝑑𝑘 𝑤 − 𝑑𝑗 − (𝑐1 − ℓ𝑗 )2 .
                                                [                  ]
                            max 𝜌1 +                                                         (7)
                                         {𝑑𝑗 }
                                                    𝑘=1

Assuming an interior solution, the ﬁrst order condition implies that the optimal amount of donations
is                                                          ∑
                                   𝑤 (𝑐1 − ℓ𝑗 )2      𝜌1       𝑘∕=𝑗 𝑟𝑘 𝑑𝑘
                             𝑑𝑗 = −                −      −               .                      (8)
                                   2         2        2𝑟𝑗        2𝑟𝑗
    As compared to the case of no limited liability, the interior solution is feasible as long as
𝑑𝑗 ∈ [0, 𝑤].
         ¯ Parameters aﬀect the optimal donation in an intuitive way. Richer donors will donate
more and donations are higher if the candidate’s ideal policy is closer to the donor’s; also donors
with larger impacts on elections, i.e., those with higher 𝑟𝑗 , donate more. These properties carry
through to the equilibrium donation levels given by (9) below. Furthermore, we observe a free-
riding eﬀect, that is, if other donors donate more, then donor 𝑗 will donate less. Suppose that the
best-response donation for all donors is as given by (8), then the Nash equilibrium is:
                             𝐽
              (                    )
          ∗            1 ∑ 𝑟𝑘             1 𝜌1       𝐽                   1 ∑ 𝑟𝑘
         𝑑𝑗 = 1 −                    𝑤−         −        (𝑐1 − ℓ𝑗 )2 +            (𝑐1 − ℓ𝑘 )2 . (9)
                    𝐽 +1        𝑟𝑗      𝐽 +1 𝑟     𝐽 +1                𝐽 +1    𝑟𝑗
                                 𝑘=1                                                                    𝑘∕=𝑗




                                                                   9
   When 𝑤 > (𝑐2 − ℓ𝑗 )2 a donor’s utility coincides with the no limited liability case if 𝑑𝑗 <
𝑤 − (𝑐2 − ℓ𝑗 )2 and it becomes (7) otherwise. Depending on parameter values three cases are
possible: the optimal donation can be either 0, 𝑤 − (𝑐2 − ℓ𝑗 )2 , or the level determined by (8).
Having three cases makes the exact analytical expression for the NE too cumbersome and so for
parameter values from our experiment we calculate it numerically.

3.3       Inﬁnitely-Repeated Elections and Campaign Finance Systems
    When the candidate-donors interactions are inﬁnitely repeated and when all agents are suﬃ-
ciently patient, we are in the realm of the folk theorem and the game admits multiple equilibria. In
particular, in inﬁnitely-repeated elections, it is possible to sustain an equilibrium in which candi-
dates will reciprocate to donors’ contributions in their policy choice, understanding that otherwise
donor contributions will no longer be as forthcoming in future elections. Donors contribute to
the candidate not only to inﬂuence who wins the election, but also to inﬂuence the candidate’s
policy choice upon winning the election. Thus the set of equilibria will depend on the information
structure implied by alternative campaign ﬁnance systems.15
    For the purposes of our paper we do not need a complete characterization of the equilibrium
set. However, we are interested in how candidate’s response to donations aﬀects the optimal
donation level as compared to the static case. To ﬁx ideas, let d = (𝑑1 , ..., 𝑑𝐽 ) denote the proﬁle of
donations by the 𝐽 donors. Suppose that 𝑦1∗𝑆 (d;𝑐1 ) is candidate 1’s policy choice as a function of
d under campaign ﬁnance system 𝑆 ∈ {FA, PA, NA} .16 Note that when interactions are inﬁnitely
repeated donors can anticipate that the candidate will choose a policy that is diﬀerent from 𝑐1 .17
For simplicity, consider the limited liability case when 𝑤 ≤ (𝑐2 − ℓ𝑗 )2 . In this case, donor 𝑗 ′ 𝑠
problem in campaign ﬁnance system 𝑆 is, analogous to (7), given by,
                                     𝐽
                              [              ]
                                    ∑          {                          ]2 }
                                        𝑟𝑘 𝑑𝑘 𝑤 − 𝑑𝑗 − 𝑦1∗𝑆 (d;𝑐1 ) − ℓ𝑗
                                                           [
                         max 𝜌1 +                                              .                   (10)
                                 {𝑑𝑗 }
                                               𝑘=1

The ﬁrst order condition with respect to 𝑑𝑗 for problem (10) is:

                                                    ]2      ∑         ∂ [𝑦1∗ (d;𝑐1 ) − ℓ𝑗 ]2
                   𝑟𝑗 𝑤 − 2𝑟𝑗 𝑑𝑗 − 𝑦1∗𝑆 (d;𝑐1 ) − ℓ𝑗 − 𝜌1 −
                                  [
                                                              𝑟𝑘 𝑑𝑘 −                        = 0.                 (11)
                                                                               ∂𝑑𝑗
                                                                 𝑘∕=𝑗

Comparing (8) and (11) we see that donations will be higher than in the static model if and only if
                                                                            ]2
                                                        ∂ 𝑦1∗𝑆 (d;𝑐1 ) − ℓ𝑗
                                                         [
                      ∗𝑆              2            2
                   [(𝑦1 (d;𝑐1 ) − 𝑙1 ) − (𝑐1 − 𝑙1 ) ] +                        ≤ 0.
                                                                ∂𝑑𝑗

In other words, if the donor anticipates a more favorable policy (the ﬁrst term) and expects more
favorable response to larger donations (the second term) then the optimal donations will be larger
than in the static case. By the same token, if donors anticipate less favorable policy to be imple-
mented then it might be optimal to donate less.

    See Mailath and Samuelson (2006) for a comprenhensive review of the research on repeated games, in particular
on the diﬀerences between repeated games with public monitoring and with private monitoring.
  16
    We are restricting ourself to equilibria in which the candidate’s policy choice only depends on the donation proﬁle
in the current election and ignores the past donation history.
  17
       Recall that in ﬁnite elections, 𝑦1∗ (d; 𝑐1 ) = 𝑐1.


                                                            10
    In contrast to the ﬁnite election case, a donor’s belief about 𝑦1∗𝑆 (d;𝑐1 ) and, therefore, her
behavior, depends crucially on the campaign ﬁnance system 𝑆. For example, in the FA system,
one would expect that 𝑦1∗FA (d;𝑐1 ) is not as responsive to d as 𝑦1∗PA (d;𝑐1 ) or 𝑦1∗NA (d;𝑐1 ) . In our
analysis of the experimental data in Section 5, we empirically examine the diﬀerences in the policy
choice function, as well as donor’s contribution amounts, across diﬀerent campaign ﬁnance systems.
    Analogously, we can also easily delineate the incentives for the candidate’s policy choice in
the inﬁnitely repeated elections environment. When candidate 1 decides on his policy choice in
a given period, he will take into consideration his belief regarding donors’ contribution function
in the next period 𝑑∗𝑆                                       ∗
                     𝑗 (𝑦1 ) . The candidate chooses policy 𝑦1 this period based on the trade-oﬀ of
short-term loss (from choosing a policy that diﬀers from 𝑐1 ) and the beneﬁt from next period’s
higher contributions (and thus a higher likelihood of winning the election). Again, it is important
to note that a diﬀerent campaign ﬁnance system 𝑆 can lead to diﬀerent beliefs by the candidate
regarding donation functions.


4         Experimental Design and Procedures
    Our actual experimental design is closely related to the model described in the previous section.
In this section, we present the details of the experimental design as well as the justiﬁcations for
some of the design choices.18

4.1         Players and Basic Environment
Donors, Candidates, and Voters. All participants were divided into groups and assigned
to either the role of donors or the role of candidates. Within each group, there were exactly
two candidates for the election. However, only one candidate is a human participant; the other
candidate is represented by a computer player.19 For convenience, we also refer to the human
candidate as candidate 1, and refer to the computer candidate as candidate 2. The number of
donors in each group varies from one to three.
    In each experimental session, we start with the one-donor phase where each donor was paired
with a human candidate for 14 rounds, followed by a two-donor phase where two donors were paired
with a human candidate for 12 rounds, and, ﬁnally, in the three donor phase the three donors were
paired with a human candidate for 11 rounds.
    Voters are not represented by human subjects in our experiments.20 Their role of choosing
the winning candidates is summarized by the probability function of the human candidate being
elected. In what follows, we explain how the winning probability function depends on a candidate’s
ideal policy, her donations received, and voters’ information (or lack thereof) about the locations
of the donors.
    18
         We provide the experimental instructions given to the subjects in an FA treatment in the Appendix.
    19
    Having only one human candidate allows us to abstract away from potential strategic interplays between the
candidates, and allow us to focus only on the strategic interactions between the human candidate and donors.

                     Figure 1: The Ideal Policies of Voters, Donors and Candidates


Policy Spectrum and the Ideal Policies. The policy spectrum is given by the interval [0, 300]
and we assume that the ideal policy location of voters is uniformly distributed in this interval.21
The ideal policy location of the computer candidate, 𝑐2 , is ﬁxed at 225; the ideal location of
the human candidate 𝑐1 is randomly drawn from the range [0, 150].22 The realization of 𝑐1 and
𝑐2 = 225 are known to all donors (and voters). Like human candidates, donors’ ideal policies are
drawn randomly from the range [0, 150]. In treatments with multiple donors, their ideal policies
are independent from each other. Figure 1 shows the potential ideal policies of voters, donors, and
candidates.

Donations and Policy Choice. Each donor is provided with an endowment 𝑤 = 9, 000 ECUs
(Experimental Currency Units) at the beginning of each game, of which a pre-speciﬁed amount,
𝑤,
 ¯ can be used as contributions to a candidate’s campaign where the value of 𝑤      ¯ varies among
treatments. As in the theoretical model, donations can be made only to the human candidate.
Donations are not direct transfers to the candidate. Their eﬀect is to increase the probability that
the human candidate is elected.
    Candidates observe the total donated amount and in PA and NA treatments candidates also
observe the individual donations and donors’ preferences. Candidates determine the implemented
policy which aﬀects the payoﬀ of all participants in a candidate’s group. The computer candidate
always implements a policy choice of 225 if elected, while the human candidate is free to implement
any policy along the [0, 300] spectrum.

4.2    Campaign Finance Systems, Information Structure, and Election Results
    The key experimental variation of our study is how alternative campaign ﬁnance systems provide
diﬀerent amounts of information to the voters and politicians about the donors’ ideal policies and
their contributions. In this paper, we study how this information aﬀects donors’ incentive to
donate and the candidate’s incentive to reciprocate in policy choices. The eﬀect of the information
on voters, however, is subsumed in our speciﬁcation regarding how campaign contributions aﬀect
election results, which we explain here.

Human Candidate’s Baseline Probability of Winning. If the realized ideal location of the
human candidate is given by 𝑐1 , we assume that her baseline probability of winning the election,
𝜌0 , is speciﬁed by (1):
                                             𝑐1 + 225
                                        𝜌0 =          ,                                      (12)
                                              2 × 300
  21
    Because voters are not represented by human subjects, this assumption about the distribution of voters’ ideal
policies will be reﬂected in the election probability function described below.
  22
    Note that, by limiting 𝑐1 to be randomly drawn from [0, 150] , the human candidate’s average ideal position is at
75, making it on average symmetric with respect to the computer candidate.


                                                         12
which simply represents that fraction of voters whose ideal points are closer to 𝑐1 than to 𝑐2 = 225.
For example, a human candidate located at 𝑐1 = 0 would have an initial probability of election
of 37.5% while a candidate located at 𝑐1 = 75 would have an initial probability of 50% and one
located at 𝑐1 = 150 would have an initial probability of 62.5%.

The Eﬀect of Information Structure on Voter Behavior. The three campaign ﬁnance
systems described in Section 3 diﬀer in the information available to the candidates and the voters
about the donors’ ideal locations and their campaign contributions. The main experimental object
of interest in this study is on the eﬀects of the alternative campaign ﬁnance systems on donors’
contribution decisions, the winning candidate’s policy choices and welfare. As a result, we assume
that the eﬀect of the information structure on voter behavior is captured by the eﬀect of campaign
donations on the probability of the human candidate being elected.
    Election Probabilities under FA and PA. Speciﬁcally, we assume that in the Full Anonymity
and Partial Anonymity systems, campaign donations increase the probability a candidate is elected
at the rate of 1% per 100 ECUs of contribution. That is, in both FA and PA systems, if the human
candidate’s ideal policy position is 𝑐1 and the candidate receives a total donation of 𝐷 = 𝐽𝑗=1 𝑑𝑗 ,
                                                                                           ∑

then the probability of him being elected is given by:23
                                                  𝑐1 + 225
                         𝜌𝑆 (𝐷) = 𝜌0 + 𝑟𝐷 =                + 0.0001𝐷, for 𝑆 ∈ {PA, FA}                       (13)
                                                  2 × 300

where 𝑟 = 0.0001 reﬂects the eﬀect of campaign expenditures on election outcomes.24 The justiﬁ-
cation for the voters to behave this way is that in both FA and PA, the voters are assumed to be
unaware of the donors’ identities and contributions to the candidates.
     Election Probability under NA. The voter behavior under the No Anonymity (or the Full
Transparency) system is more complex. The key feature of the NA system is that both the voters
and candidates are aware of the donors’ ideal locations. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that
voters will expect the candidate’s policy choices to be aﬀected by the donors’ ideal locations in a
setting of repeated elections, which will aﬀect their voting behavior and thus the election results.
Qualitatively, we capture the eﬀect of voter information in the NA system by postulating that
the eﬀectiveness of donations in aﬀecting the election results in the NA system depends on the
donor’s location; in particular, donations from more extreme donors are less eﬀective. Intuitively,
if the candidate receives a large contribution from a donor, then voters may view that candidate as
being more likely to implement the policy favored by the donor which then will aﬀect the election
probability.
     More formally, denote the maximum allowable donation amount by all the donors as 𝐷,25
and write 𝑑𝑗 as the donation of donor 𝑗 whose ideal location is at ℓ𝑗 . Let d = (𝑑1 , ..., 𝑑𝐽 ) and
l = (ℓ1 , ..., ℓ𝐽 ) denote the proﬁle of donations and ideal policy locations for the 𝐽 donors. We
assume that the voters expect that, given (d, l) , the policy implemented by the human candidate
  23
    For studies on the eﬀects of campaign spending to vote shares and probability of winning, see, e.g., Jacobson
(1985), Abramowitz (1988), Green and Krasno (1988), Levitt (1994), and Gerber (1998).
  24
    Of course, the winning probability is capped by one, so the human candidate wins the election with probability
min {𝜌0 + 𝑟𝐷, 1} . We ignore the boundary of 1 for expositional ease.
  25
       The level of 𝐷 is an experimental choice variable that we describe below.

                                                   𝐽                      𝐽

                                    𝑦1𝑒 (d, l) =             ℓ𝑗 + ⎝ 1 −             ⎠ 𝑐1 .                  (14)
                                                   𝑗=1
                                                         𝐷                𝑗=1
                                                                                𝐷

Expression (14) captures our intuition that voters are sophisticated enough to expect politicians to
reciprocate large donations and implemented policies favorable to large contributors. For example,
if none of the donors donates then d = 0, and thus 𝑦1𝑒 (0, l) = 𝑐1 ; if there is only one donor with
ideal location ℓ1 who chooses to donate 𝑑1 = 𝐷, then (14) implies that the voters believe that
the human candidate will be fully captured and expects a policy choice of 𝑦1𝑒 = ℓ1 . In general, if
the amount of donations is low relative to 𝐷, then the voters expect the human candidate’s policy
choice to be close to 𝑐1 .26
    We assume that the aggregate eﬀect of donations on the human candidate’s probability of being
elected is given by:
                                                                𝐽
                                           𝑦 𝑒 (d, ℓ) + 225    ∑
                              𝜌NA (d, ℓ) = 1                +𝑟     𝑑𝑗 ,                         (15)
                                                2 ⋅ 300
                                                                                𝑗=1

which captures the two eﬀects of donations under the NA system: ﬁrst, as in the FA and PA
system, the term 𝑟 𝐽𝑗=1 𝑑𝑗 captures the direct positive eﬀect of donations and campaign ﬁnance
                     ∑

expenditures on the probability of winning at rate 𝑟 = 0.0001; second, diﬀerent from the FA and PA
system, voters know the donors’ donations and their ideal policies and expect the human candidate
to be at least partially captured by them after winning the election, thus the base rate of winning
the election by the human candidate changes from 𝜌0 to [𝑦1𝑒 (d, ℓ) + 225] / (2 ⋅ 300) . Note that since
it is implausible that donations of few large donors can guarantee the election with probability one
we imposed the restriction that the updated probability of election cannot be greater than 0.8.

4.3       Additional Details about the Experimental Design
Payoﬀs for Players. The active players in our experiments are the donors and the human
candidates. Now we specify their payoﬀs. If a donor with ideal policy ℓ𝑗 donates 𝑑𝑗 to the human
candidate, and the policy implemented by the elected candidate (whether it is the human or the
computer candidate) is 𝑦, then the donor’s payoﬀ is given by

                               Π𝐷 (𝑦; 𝑑𝑗 , ℓ𝑗 ) = max{9, 000 − 𝑑𝑗 − (ℓ𝑗 − 𝑦𝑖 )2 , 0},                       (16)

where we recall that 9,000 is the amount of ECUs we provide to each donor subject. Also notice
that we impose the limited liability case to guarantee that participants of our study will receive
non-negative payoﬀs.
   For a human candidate with ideal policy location 𝑐1 who chooses to implement a policy 𝑦1 , her
payoﬀ is given by:
                                        {
                                          6, 000 − (𝑐1 − 𝑦1 )2 if she wins,
                        Π𝐶 (𝑦1 ; 𝑐1 ) =                                                       (17)
                                          0                    if she loses
where 6,000 ECU is the human candidate’s value of winning the election.27
  26
    This particular functional form was chosen for two reasons. First, the resulting marginal impact of donations
does not depend on donated amount. Second, it does not depend on the amount donated by other donors.
  27
       Voters’ payoﬀ function is not important for our experiment because we do not use experimental subjects for


                                                              14
Other Experimental Variations. Though the main focus of our experiment is on the eﬀect of
the variation in campaign ﬁnance system, we also vary the number of donors and the maximum
donatable amount in a given campaign ﬁnance system. Speciﬁcally, for each experimental session
(deﬁned below), we vary the number of donors from one to three sequentially. Considering a
diﬀerent number of donors enabled us to study the eﬀect of the competition between donors for
favors from politicians. As for the maximum donatable amount we considered two cases. In one
set of sessions, we allow each donor to contribute 1000 ECUs per round, so that the total amount
available for donation is 1000 in the one donor phase, 2000 for two donor phase, and 3000 in the
three donor phase; in another set of sessions we keep the aggregate amount of donations set at
3000, so that in the one donor phase each donor can contribute 3000, while in the two and three
donor phases each donor can contribute 1500 and 1000 respectively.

Time Line in a Given Round. The timing in each round is as follows. First, donors and the
human candidate observe their ideal policy location. Then, donors decide how much to contribute
to the human candidate. In making their contribution decisions, the donors are provided with
the following information: the candidates’ ideal policy locations; the human candidate’s baseline
probability of winning the election 𝜌0 as calculated in (12); their potential payoﬀ losses if either
the human candidate or computer candidate is elected and implements their ideal policy; and for
the NA and PA treatments, also, the locations of the other donors.
    Once all donors make their contribution decision, the candidates and donors view the amount of
donations (in aggregate for the FA treatment and by donor in the PA and NA treatments), the up-
dated probability of the human candidate winning the election, and, in the NA and PA treatments,
also the ideal locations of all donors. The human candidates then make their policy decisions28
after which the winning candidate is randomly selected according to the updated probabilities, as
given by (13) for the FA and PA treatments and (15) for the NA treatment.29 Finally, the winning
candidate’s chosen policy is implemented and a ﬁnal screen shows each participant his or her own
payoﬀ for this round.

4.4       Sessions and Treatments
    In total we conducted six sessions deﬁned by the combinations of information structure (either
FA or PA or NA) and the maximum donatable amount (either 1000 or 3000 ECUs). Within each
session, we kept the information condition and the rule with regard to maximum donatable amount
ﬁxed. However, we varied the number of donors during a given session, starting from a one-donor
phase where each donor was paired with a human candidate for 14 rounds, followed by a two-donor
phase where two donors were paired with a single candidate for 12 rounds, and ﬁnally, in the
three-donor phase three donors were paired with a single candidate for 11 rounds.
    As mentioned in Section 3, the candidates can rationally deviate from their ideal policy if
interactions are inﬁnitely repeated. To mimic an inﬁnitely-repeated environment we kept the
matching between the donor (or donors) and the human candidate constant within each phase. For

them. However, when we evaluate the eﬀect of campaign ﬁnance systems on welfare in Section 5.4, we assume that
voters have similar payoﬀ function as the donors, with the exception that they do not contribute.
  28
    We chose to have candidates choose their policy decision prior to the announcement of the election winner so as
to have a complete set of policy choices for the candidates.
  29
       We use the random number z-Tree’s generator. See Fischbacher (2007) for a description of the z-Tree software.

example, in one-donor phase the same candidate was matched with the same donor for the entire
14 periods. Furthermore, to eliminate the last-period eﬀect, the number of rounds per phase was
not announced to the subjects and was varied to minimize guessing when the last period per phase
would occur.
    In order to facilitate the comparison of diﬀerent treatments, we used the same pre-generated
values for candidates’ and donors’ ideal policy locations. That is, in all one-donor treatments we
used the same 14 pairs of candidate-donor locations. In all two-donor treatments we used 12 triplets
of candidate-2 donor locations and so on. Given that the same participants would play treatments
with 1, 2 and 3 donors, the ideal locations for one-donor treatments diﬀered from the ideal locations
for two- and three-donor treatments. Across sessions, however, the draws of the ideal policies were
kept identical.30
    The six conducted sessions are denoted by the abbreviation of the information condition and
a number representing the maximum donatable amount rule. For example, in session denoted as
FA3000 the donations were fully anonymous and the total donatable amount was 3000. Thus in
the one-donor phrase of FA3000 the donor could donate 3000 ECUs at most, in two-donor phase
each donor could donate 1500 ECUs at most and so on. In session NA1000 the No Anonymity
information structure was used and the maximum donatable amount per donor was equal to 1000
regardless of the number of donors.
    Table 2 provides a summary of our experimental design and a number of subjects participating
in each session. A total of 120 subjects participated. Sessions were conducted at Florida State
University’s xs/fs laboratory in September 2010. Payments averaged about $18.25 for the 90
minute sessions.


5        Results
     This section presents experimental results. Throughout the section we will use the same nota-
tions as in the theoretical part of the paper. Speciﬁcally, 𝑐1 will denote the location of a human
candidate, ℓ𝑗 the location of donor 𝑗, 𝑑𝑗 the donation of donor 𝑗 and ﬁnally, the policy chosen by the
human candidate will be denoted as 𝑦1 . In what follows, we will also refer to policy locations from
[0, 49] as extreme locations, those from [50, 100] as moderate locations, and those from [101, 150] as
centrist locations. We ﬁrst present and discuss descriptive statistics in Section 5.1; we then study
the determinants of candidate policy choices in Section 5.2 and donor donations in Section 5.3; and
ﬁnally we investigate the welfare implications of allowing donations and candidates’ responses to
those donations under the alternative campaign ﬁnance systems in Section 5.4.
    30
    Table 4 records the actual draws of the human candidate’s ideal policy location 𝑐1 and the donor(s)’ ideal policy
locations, 𝑙1 , 𝑙2 and 𝑙3 , depending on the number of donors in the treatment.

5.1    Descriptive Statistics
    Table 3 reports the basic descriptive statistics of the experimental results on donors’ donations
and human candidates’ policy choices by session and number of donors. Panel A of the table
shows average actual (left column) and the average theoretical (right column) donations, where the
theoretical predictions were calculated using derivations from Section 3 and under the assumption
that donors expect the candidate to implement 𝑐1 . Panel B shows the average deviations and the
average absolute deviations of the human candidates’ policy choices from their ideal policy locations.
Average absolute deviation measures candidate’s responsiveness to donations and average deviation
measures whether donations tend to distort candidate’s choice towards the centrist or extreme
policies.

Table 3: Actual and Equilibrium Donations by Treatment. Candidates Deviations and Absolute
Deviations by Treatment.
Notes: The top panel shows actual donations observed in each treatment as well as equilibrium predictions.
The equilibrium is calculated under the assumption that donors expect the candidate to implement his MPP.
The bottom panel shows the average deviations of the candidate from his MPP as well as the average absolute
deviation.



Donations. Panel A shows that donors’ average actual donations in the FA treatments are lower
than in the PA treatments. This holds for any number of donors and for both the 1000 and 3000
maximum donatable amount conditions. In the PA treatments, it is not unreasonable for donors
to expect candidate’s reciprocation in the policy choices which justiﬁes more generous donations.
This eﬀect is quite strong: with the exception of 3-donor 3000-treatments, the donations in PA are
considerably larger than donations in FA.
    Panel A also shows that donors’ average actual donations in the FA treatments are lower than


                                                         17
in the NA treatments. This also holds for any number of donors and for both the 1000 and 3000
maximum donatable amount conditions. This ﬁnding provides support for Ackerman and Ayres’
(2002) proposal for campaign ﬁnance reform, at least in reducing the level of donation money in
politics.31 The FA treatment, relative to the NA and PA treatments, at least weakens the policy
reciprocity motive for the donors to contribute to the candidate, while leaving intact the donation
motive for increasing the winning probability of the candidate whose ideal policy is closer to the
donors.32
    The ranking of the average donations between the NA and the PA treatments is more compli-
cated both for the theoretical and the actual data. Panel A shows that, for 1-donor treatments
donations in the NA treatment are less than those in the PA treatments, while for 3-donor treat-
ments donations in NA are greater than those in PA. For 2-donor treatments NA donations are
slightly greater under the 1000 maximum donatable amount treatment but less when the maximum
donatable amount is 3000. Intuitively, in the NA treatments the campaign donations vary in the
rate with which they impact the election probability. In particular, extreme donors whose dona-
tions are less eﬀective in NA may have two possible responses: either to reduce donation because
it is less eﬀective to begin with or to donate more to compensate for the reduced eﬀectiveness
of donation in the NA setting. Both approaches can be rational depending upon donors’ beliefs.
Similarly centrist donors can donate more or less than in the PA treatments. As we see from Panel
A both scenarios are possible.

Policy Choices by the Human Candidate. Panel B of Table 3 shows that, with the exception
of the PA1000 and PA3000 treatments, the candidate’s average deviations tend to be positive.
Recall from Section 4 that the ideal location of the human candidate 𝑐1 was randomly drawn from
the range [0, 150], while the voters’ ideal policies were uniformly drawn from the range [0, 300] .
Thus, 𝑐1 tends to be to the left of the median voter and so a positive distortion of the human
candidate in his policy choice is in fact a centrist bias. In section 5.2, we show that one reason for
the centrist bias is that candidates with a higher initial probability of election – i.e. those with
more central locations – are less responsive to donations. Assuming that centrist policies are more
socially desirable than extreme policies, contributions to a candidate’s campaign should have a
welfare improving eﬀect. This claim is investigated in detail in section 5.4.
    There are two exceptions, however. In the 2-donor PA1000 and PA3000 treatments the candi-
date’s average deviation was slightly (less than two units) negative. This is due to the fact extreme
donors exert the most inﬂuence in the PA treatments as compared to the FA treatments (where
their location is unknown to the candidate) and NA treatments (where their donations have a
smaller eﬀect than donations from more centrist donors). Thus, extreme donor inﬂuence can be
strong enough to outweigh the centrist bias and move the candidate towards more extreme policies.
We will see the conﬁrmation of this ﬁnding in Results 2 and 4 in Section 5.2.
    Finally, the average absolute deviation varied from 3.82 in NA1000 to 27.70 in NA3000, with
the former corresponding to a loss of 15 ECUs (out of the 6000 ECUs obtained from winning the
election) and the latter to a loss of 767 ECUs due to not choosing 𝑦1 to be equal to 𝑐1 . The average
  31
    The level of money in politics is only one aspect of the eﬀects of campaign ﬁnance reforms. Below we will also
consider the policy choices by the candidates and the eﬀect on voter welfare under diﬀerent campaign ﬁnance regimes.
  32
    As we show below, the candidates still modify their policy choice away from their ideal policy even in FA
treatments, though to a lesser degree than in PA and NA treatments.



                                                        18
absolute deviation across all treatments was 15 and therefore the candidates on average would
sacriﬁce 3.75% of their election beneﬁts.

5.2     Policy Choice
5.2.1    Deviations in Candidates’ Policy Choice

    Figure 2 shows locations of donors and the human candidates, as well as the average policies
chosen by the human candidates, for each period. The top panel shows the data for 1-donor treat-
ments, the middle panel for 2-donor treatments and the bottom panel for 3-donor treatments. In all
six charts, circles correspond to candidates’ locations; crosses, triangles and diamonds correspond
to donors locations. The blue line are candidates decisions in FA, green line in NA and red line in
PA.
    As it can be immediately seen from Figure 2, deviations from candidates’ ideal policies are very
common. Indeed, the average chosen policy diﬀered from the ideal policy in almost every round
of every treatment. Interestingly, deviations also occur frequently in the FA setting even though
donors’ locations are unknown to candidates. However, centrist and moderate candidates were less
likely to deviate in the FA treatments which is particularly noticeable in 3 donor treatments. In
NA and PA treatments, where donors’ locations were observed, we see that with few exceptions
candidates would choose a policy that is more favorable to donors. Speciﬁcally in treatments with
one donors and in treatments with multiple donors where all donors’ ideal policies are located on
the same side of the candidate, the candidate would typically move towards the donor(s).
    To formally test whether and when the deviations are statistically signiﬁcant and whether these
deviations diﬀer with the campaign ﬁnance systems, we conduct 𝑡-tests comparing the candidate’s
ideal policy with the chosen policy. To explain how we do this, we shall recall from Section 4.4
that, for each period 𝑡 we have ﬁxed the values of candidate and donors’ ideal locations across the
six sessions (as deﬁned by the combinations of information structure and the maximum donatable
amounts) and also within the same session across groups. For example, in period 1 of all 1-
donor treatments (whether the information structure is FA, NA or PA, and whether the maximum
donatable amount is 1000ECU or 3000ECU), the candidate’s location was 63 and the donor’s
location was 12. Thus, we will observe the policy choices from 18 human candidates for FA and
NA information structure and from 24 candidates for PA information structure.33 Using the 18
(24 respectively) observed policy choices for FA and NA (PA respectively), we can test whether
the policy choice of the human candidate (denoted by 𝑃 𝑜𝑙𝐶) diﬀers signiﬁcantly from their ideal
policies 𝑐1 . Table 4 reports the results from the 𝑡-tests for whether the policy chosen by the candidate
deviates substantially from his ideal location. The results are presented for each candidate’s location
and each treatment and are ordered with respect to 𝑐1 . In Table 4, we use the indicator ‘1’ to denote
the case where the hypothesis 𝑃 𝑜𝑙𝐶 = 𝐶 is rejected in favor of 𝑃 𝑜𝑙𝐶 > 𝐶 at the 5% level, ‘-1’ to
denote the case where the hypothesis 𝑃 𝑜𝑙𝐶 = 𝐶 is rejected in favor of 𝑃 𝑜𝑙𝐶 < 𝐶 at the 5% level,
and ‘0’ to denote the case where the hypothesis 𝑃 𝑜𝑙𝐶 = 𝐶 can not be rejected at the 5% level.
    The deviation pattern shown in Table 4 is overall fairly systematic. First and foremost, there
  33
    As described in Table 2, 36 subjects participated in FA and NA sessions and 48 subjects participated in the
PA sessions. In 1-donor treatments, two subjects are paired in a group. Thus, we have 18 human candidates in FA
and NA sessions and 24 in PA sessions. One can analogously determine the number of human candidate choices for
2-donor and 3-donor treatments.

tend to be fewer signiﬁcant policy deviations under FA than under NA and PA. This simply follows
from the observation that there are much less frequent non-zero entries in FA than in NA and PA.
Moreover, the deviations under FA, when they do, occur only when the candidate’s ideal location
is extreme; in contrast, the deviations under NA and PA occur more generally across the spectrum
of candidate’s locations.
    Second, Table 4 also shows that, if the candidate’s location is extreme, the deviations tend to
be signiﬁcant and are towards the center of the policy spectrum. Such a systematic deviation in
all three information structures is not particularly surprising since for extreme candidates donors
are most likely to be to the right of the spectrum. In particular, the candidate does not have to
observe their locations to correctly anticipate this.
    Third, when the candidate’s ideal policy is close to the center but donors’ locations are more
extreme, we observe that under the NA and PA systems it is possible for donors to induce the
candidate to choose a policy away from the center of the spectrum to the left. This eﬀect is not
signiﬁcantly present under the FA system. However, it should be noted that the NA treatment does
ﬁlter out some of the extreme donors’ inﬂuences; in particular, in the 3-donor case the deviations
to the left are signiﬁcant only for PA and are not signiﬁcant for the NA system.
    Finally, as we already saw from Figure 2, when candidates respond to donations they move
towards the donor. While there are exceptions to that rule, such as period 2 of 1-donor NA
treatment, most of the time the chosen policy was more favorable to donors than the politician’s
ideal policy.34
    We should emphasize that the pattern whereby extreme candidates move to the right and
centrist candidates move to the left is not due to mechanical restrictions imposed on the candidate’s
policy space and donors’ locations. The key determinant for candidate’s choice especially in PA
and NA treatments is donors’ locations. For example, in our experimental data we do observe a
centrist candidate deviating to a more centrist policy as in period 8 of 1-donor PA treatment where
𝑐1 = 119 and 𝑙1 = 148. At the same time, in 2-donor NA and PA treatments moderate candidates
located at 87, 92 and 95 would move left towards more extreme donors.
    We summarize the above results as follows:

Result 1: Candidates are less likely to deviate from their ideal policy under FA than under PA
    and NA systems.

Result 2: Under all three information structures, extreme candidates tend to deviate from their
    ideal policy to the right. Under PA and NA, but not under FA, centrist candidates are also
    likely to deviate to the left under the inﬂuence of extreme donors, though the eﬀect is somewhat
    weaker for NA especially in 3-donor treatments.

5.2.2    Determinants of Policy Deviations

    Having established the general presence and direction of deviations from the candidate’s ideal
policy under the three campaign ﬁnance systems, we now explore in more detail the factors that
aﬀect the candidate’s decision to deviate and the deviation size. Table 5 reports the Panel-Tobit
  34
     In 1-donor treatments it is clear which policy is more favorable to the donor. In treatments with multiple donors
discussion about a more favorable policy makes sense when all donors are on one side of the candidate. As we can
see in these cases statistically signiﬁcant deviation was always towards the donors.



                                                         22
regression results for each of the information structures and each number of donors. The dependent
variable we use in these regressions is the absolute value of the candidate’s deviation, i.e., ∣𝑦1 −𝑐1 ∣.35
    Due to natural diﬀerences between treatments with diﬀerent numbers of donors the choice of
independent variables depends on 𝐽. In all regressions, we include as explanatory variables the
ideal policy location of the (human) candidate, donation amount(s), and the squared distance(s)
between the donors’ and the candidate’s ideal policies.36 For treatments with 𝐽 > 1 we anticipate
that the impact of the donor who is closest to the candidate should diﬀer from the donor who is
the furthest from the candidate. The variables related to the former are indexed by the word 𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒
and the variables related to the latter are indexed by the word 𝑓 𝑎𝑟.
    In addition to the above variables, we also added several dummy variables. For all treat-
ments we used dummy variables “DidCMove𝑡−1 ” for whether the candidate deviated last period,
“DidCWin𝑡−1 ” for whether the candidate won election last period, and “Is1000” for whether it was
1000 or 3000 treatments. We also added several variables to see whether relative locations of the
candidate and donors matter. For the 1-donor treatments we used a dummy variable (𝑐1 > 𝑙1 )𝑡
which takes value 1 if the candidate is more centrist than the donor. For the multiple-donor treat-
ments we used a variable (𝑐1 < 𝑙𝑚𝑖𝑛 )𝑡 equal to 1 if the candidate is on the left of donors and variable
(𝑐1 > 𝑙𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) equal to 1 if the candidate is on the right of donors. To quantitatively capture the
relative location of the candidate and donors we also used variable (𝑐1 − 𝑙𝑓 𝑎𝑟 )(𝑐1 − 𝑙𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒 ). It is
negative when the candidate is between the donors and takes its minimum if the candidate location
is the average of 𝑙𝑓 𝑎𝑟 and 𝑙𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒 . The further the candidate is from the donors the larger is the value
of (𝑐1 − 𝑙𝑓 𝑎𝑟 )(𝑐1 − 𝑙𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒 ).

1-Donor Treatments. Panel A of Table 5 presents the results when there is only 1 donor for the
FA, PA, and NA treatments separately. First, note that the donation amount 𝑑1 had a signiﬁcant
eﬀect on the deviation size in all three treatments; but interestingly, the sign of the eﬀect diﬀers
depending on whether the donor locations were observed by the candidate as in PA and NA
treatments, or not as in the FA treatment. Coeﬃcient estimates in Panel A indicate that in the
PA and NA treatments larger donations lead to larger deviations. This is quite intuitive and is
evidence that candidates reciprocate donors’ contributions. However, in the FA treatment we found
that larger donations lead to lower deviations. The intuition for this result is very diﬀerent from
that for the PA and NA treatments. Because candidates do not observe the ideal policy location
of the donor, they are likely to interpret larger donations as an indication that the donor’s ideal
policy is close and as a result would reciprocate by not deviating.
    The second variable of interest (𝑙1 − 𝑐1 )2 , i.e., the distance between the donor and the candidate,
  35
    The reason that we use the absolute deviation and not the level of the deviation is that the interpretation of
coeﬃcients is more interesting. For example, a positive sign of a particular variable, say donated amount, means that
larger donations led to larger deviations. With the level of the deviation as a dependent variable, the interpretation
would be that larger donations lead to more centrist policy which we believe is not as informative. We also believe
that we are less likely to ﬁnd an eﬀect of a variable if we use the level of deviation as the dependent variable because
the eﬀects of a particular variable could get canceled since extreme candidates were more likely to move to the right
and centrist candidates to the left.
  36
    In multiple-donor treatments using variables 𝑑𝑖 and 𝑙𝑖 where 𝑖 = 1, 2 or 3 would not be informative since the
locations of donors were determined independently of their index numbers. Instead we classiﬁed donors by being the
closest or the furthest from the candidate as one would expect candidates to respond diﬀerently to donations from
the two.

Table 5: The Panel Tobit Regression Analysis of the Candidate Behavior.
Notes: The dependent variable is ∣𝑐1 − 𝑦1 ∣. The variable 𝑑𝑖 with subscript 𝑖 denotes donations from donor 𝑖 and 𝑙𝑖
denotes location donor 𝑖. For multiple-donors panels, variables with subscript “far” refer to the furthest donor from
the candidate, and those with subscript “close” refer to the closest donor to the candidate. The variable (𝑙𝑖 − 𝑐1 )2
is the squared distance between donor 𝑖 and the human candidate. The variable “𝐷𝑖𝑑𝐶𝑀 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑡−1 ” is the dummy
variable that takes value 1 if the candidate deviated in the last round; the variable (𝑐1 > 𝑙1 )𝑡 is the dummy which
takes value 1 if the candidate is more centrist than a donor; “Is1000” is equal to 1 if maximum amount to donate is
1000; “𝐷𝑖𝑑𝐶𝑊 𝑖𝑛𝑡−1 ” is 1 if the candidate won in the last period. Finally, 𝑐1 < 𝑙𝑚𝑖𝑛 is equal to 1 if the candidate is
to the left of donors and variable 𝑐1 > 𝑙𝑚𝑎𝑥 is equal to 1 if the candidate is to the right of donors.

also had an expected impact. In the FA treatment where the distance was unobserved, the impact
of this variable was insigniﬁcant. But in NA and PA treatments the impact was positive and highly
signiﬁcant. That is, in the NA and PA regimes when the candidate observes the donor’s preference,
the further away the donor is from the candidate, the more likely the candidate will deviate from
his ideal policy and the larger the size of the deviation.
    The estimated coeﬃcients on the candidate’s ideal location 𝑐1 are negative and signiﬁcant in
all three treatments. Recall that a larger 𝑐1 means that the human candidate has a larger initial
probability of being elected. Thus this result means that, holding the donation amount and other
factors constant, candidates who are more likely to be elected to start with are less likely to deviate
from their preferred policy. Furthermore, it means that extreme candidates’ deviations are larger
than those of centrist candidates. This together with our observation from Table 4 implies that
donations are more likely to make extreme candidate more moderate and less likely to make centrist
candidate less centrist. The intuition behind the result is straightforward. When the candidate
has a relatively high chance to win elections without the donations (in our model it’s centrist
candidates) then they value donations less and are less inclined to reciprocate. On the other hand,
candidates with a lower election chance may desire campaign contributions more and may be more
willing to reward donors. The coeﬃcient estimates indicate that the eﬀect of this centrist bias
varies across treatments: it is strongest under FA and is approximately the same in NA and PA
with PA being the weakest. This ﬁnding that candidate’s policy deviations, when inﬂuenced by
donations, are biased towards the center is beneﬁcial for voters’ welfare, an issue discussed more in
Section 5.4.
    Looking at other variables we see that the candidates’ policy response did not diﬀer between
the treatments with 1000 and 3000 maximum donatable amounts. The relative position of the
candidate and the donor, (𝑐1 > 𝑙1 )𝑡 is insigniﬁcant in the FA and PA treatments but it is signiﬁcant
in the NA treatment. Insigniﬁcance in FA and PA is not surprising since in the former case donors’
locations was unobserved and in both cases the donors’ impact on the election probability was the
same regardless of whether they are more or less extreme than the candidates. Similarly, signiﬁcance
of (𝑐1 > 𝑙1 )𝑡 in the NA is not surprising because the donations’ impact on the election outcomes
diﬀers depending on who was more extreme. However, it is somewhat surprising that in the NA
treatment candidates’ deviation was larger when donors were more extreme (i.e., when 𝑐1 > 𝑙1 is
true). This is surprising because the election probability formula in expression (15) implies that
donations from extreme donors have a lower impact. The willingness of the candidates to respond
more aggressively to more extreme donors under the NA regime, despite the voters’ backlash, points
toward a potential weakness of the NA system.
    Finally, the coeﬃcient estimates for the dummy DidCWin𝑡−1 are signiﬁcantly negative in the
FA and PA treatments, but negative and insigniﬁcant in NA. This is evidence that candidates
who lost elections in 𝑡 − 1 would deviate more in period 𝑡. As for the coeﬃcient estimates for
DidCMove𝑡−1 , they are positive in all three treatments and signiﬁcant at 10% level in FA and PA.
This suggests that candidates who deviated last period were more likely to deviate in the current
period as well.

2-Donor Treatments. Panel B of Table 5 presents the results when there are two donors for
the FA, PA, and NA treatments separately. The donations by the two donors, now labeled by
𝑑far and 𝑑close separately, have a negative eﬀect on the candidate’s policy deviation in the FA


                                                  25
treatments. But interestingly, only the coeﬃcient estimate of the furthest donor’s donation 𝑑far is
signiﬁcant.37 The reason that only 𝑑far is signiﬁcant is as follows. In the FA treatments, recall that
the candidate is only able to observe the total donation amount, i.e., 𝑑far + 𝑑close , and not 𝑑far and
𝑑close separately. However, when we regress the total donations on (𝑐1 − ℓfar )2 and (𝑐1 − ℓclose )2 , it
turns out that only the coeﬃcient for (𝑐1 − ℓfar )2 is signiﬁcant and it is negative.38 That is, the
furthest donors’ donations would drop with the distance between the candidate’s and the donor’s
ideal policy locations. Thus, from the candidate’s point of view, receiving a particularly large total
donation is a clear indication that both donors have ideal policies close to his; therefore, there is no
reason for the politician to move. Moreover, since the indication itself is due to large donations from
the relatively furthest donor (whose ℓfar is nonetheless close to 𝑐1 ), we have that 𝑑far is negative
and signiﬁcant.
    The eﬀects of the donations diﬀer in the NA and PA treatments from those in the FA treatments
described above. In the NA and PA treatments, we ﬁnd that donations from the furthest donor
have a positive eﬀect and donations from the closest donor have a negative eﬀect on the candidate’s
policy deviations. This is intuitive, since reciprocation to donations from the closer donor requires
that the candidate deviate less, whereas reciprocation to donations from a further donor requires
that he deviate more. However, only 𝑑far is signiﬁcant in the PA system, while only 𝑑close is
signiﬁcant in the NA system. The signiﬁcance of 𝑑close in NA is due to the fact that donations from
closer donors have higher impact on election probabilities (see expression 15).
    We found that, in the FA treatments, as in the 1-donor case, the squared distance between
the candidate and the donors’ ideal policies, (𝑐1 − ℓfar )2 and (𝑐1 − ℓclose )2 , are both insigniﬁcant
which is intuitive since they are not observed by the candidate. In the PA system, we found that
the distance to the closest donor has a positive and signiﬁcant impact on the deviation, so that
as the distance to the closest donor gets larger, it means both donors are further away and so
reciprocation would require larger deviation. In contrast, in the NA system, it is the distance to
the furthest donor that has a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect. Despite the diﬀerence between the PA
and NA systems in which of the two variables is signiﬁcant, the main message is similar to what we
observed in 1-donor treatments: when donors’ ideal policies are farther away from the candidate’s,
reciprocating candidates are willing to deviate further away from their ideal policy in the NA and
PA treatments.
    Also, with two donors, the variable 𝑐1 has a negative and signiﬁcant eﬀect in the FA system,
but it is insigniﬁcant in both the PA and NA system. This implies that, with two donors, the
centrist bias we discussed previously still applies under the FA system, but we no longer observe
this bias in the case of PA and NA. We already saw evidence of that from Table 3, where the only
treatments that led to more extreme chosen policies were 2-donor PA treatments. The variable
“Is1000” is insigniﬁcant in all three treatments which is not surprising since for 2 donors the
diﬀerence between 3000 and 1000 treatments is less substantial. Finally, as in the 1-donor case, the
variable “DidCWin𝑡−1 ” is negative in all three treatments; however, this time it is signiﬁcant only
in the NA treatment.
  37
    However, the null hypothesis that coeﬃcients for 𝑑far and 𝑑close are equal cannot be rejected (with a 𝑝-value of
0.51).

3-donor Treatments Panel C of Table 5 presents the results when there are 3 donor for the
FA, PA and NA treatments separately. The 3-donor case is diﬀerent from 1- and 2-donor cases
in that variables related to donors’ locations and donation amounts turn out to be insigniﬁcant.
This result is quite robust and holds for all three treatments and many alternative regression
speciﬁcations. The reason is that with three donors the role of one particular donor becomes less
important. Candidate’s location has a negative and signiﬁcant eﬀect on his policy deviations, as it
was in 1-donor treatments. Thus with three donors we again have a centrist bias, namely, extreme
candidates are more likely and centrist candidates are less likely to deviate.39
    We summarize our main ﬁndings in this section as follows:

Result 3: The eﬀect of donations on the candidate’s policy deviations diﬀer in FA treatments
    (in which the candidate does not observe the donors’ ideal policies) from that in PA and
    NA treatments (in which the candidate observes the donors’ policies. Speciﬁcally, in the FA
    system larger donations lead to smaller deviations from the candidate’s ideal policy; but in
    the NA and PA systems, larger donations lead to larger deviations.

Result 4: The donations lead to a socially desirable centrist bias in the candidate’s policy choices,
    i.e., donations are more likely to make an extreme candidate move to the center than to
    make a centrist candidate move to the right. This centrist bias is present robustly for all FA
    treatments, but for the PA and NA treatments it is present only with 1 donor and 3-donors.

5.3     Donations
    We now investigate the donor’s contribution decisions. In order to understand the determinants
of donor’s donation decisions, we ﬁrst use as the benchmark the static Nash predictions for the
equilibrium donation level as characterized in Section 3 under the assumption that donors expect
the candidate to implement his ideal policy, and they face limited liability. We then use the donors’
best response to the estimated policy response function we estimated in Table 5 as the benchmark.40
Finally, we present regression results on the factors that impact the donations.

5.3.1    Using the Static Nash Predictions as the Benchmark

    Figure 3 shows the static Nash and the average actual donations in 3000 ECU treatments with
1 donor. The NA treatment data is plotted separately because the impact of donations on election
probabilities under NA diﬀer from those under FA and PA, and therefore equilibrium predictions
are diﬀerent. To ease the comparison with the theoretical predictions the 𝑥-axis is ordered by
distance between the candidate’s and the donor’s optimal policies.
  39
     Note that we observe non-monotonicity of 𝑐1 for NA and PA treatments. It is signiﬁcant in 1 and 3-donor
treatments and insigniﬁcant in the 2-donor treatment. We conjecture that this is due to the following. Having several
extreme donors and no centrist donors, a reciprocating centrist politician is more likely to choose a more extreme
policy as compared to the case of only one extreme donor and the case of having extreme and centrist donors. The
former can explain why there is a centrist bias in the 1-donor treatment but not in the 2-donor treatment. The latter
can explain why there is a centrist bias in the 3-donor treatment. Indeed, with three donors it is less likely to have
all three of them extreme.
  40
   To save space, we only present results for the treatments in which the maximum donatable amount is 3000 ECUs.
The results for the treatments with 1000 ECU maximum donatable amount are similar and available from the authors
upon request.

Figure 3: Static Nash (BR) and Actual Donations in Treatments with 1 Donor Ordered by Distance
Between the Candidate and the Donor.

    Figure 3 shows that, in all three treatments, the observed donation is very close to the theoretical
static Nash predictions until the distance between the candidate’s and the donor’s ideal policies
is 51 or more. For each period and each treatment we conduct a 𝑡-test to see whether and when
the diﬀerence was statistically signiﬁcant. When the distance is less than 51 the 𝑡-test shows that,
with only two exceptions, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the theoretical and observed
contributions.41 When the distance is 51 or greater the observed donations were higher than the
theoretical ones. The reason is obvious, with larger distances it is likely that donors expected chosen
policy to be more favorable thereby justifying higher levels of donations. Comparing donations
between FA and PA treatments we see that donations in PA were higher than in FA. Again, given
that in the PA treatment donors are likely to have more favorable expectations about candidate’s
response so it is optimal to donate more.
    Figure 4 shows the theoretical and average donations for 2-donor 3000 ECU treatments. In the
top row are donations of the donor who was closest to the candidate and the middle row shows
donations of the furthest donor. Figures in the left column are for the FA and PA treatments,
while those in the right column are for the NA treatments. Again we observe that the average
actual donations tend to be higher under the PA treatments than those under the FA treatments.
The furthest donors tend to over-contribute compared to equilibrium predictions. As for the closest
 41
      The two exceptions are NA treatment with distance 23 and PA treatment with distance 41.

The top chart corresponds to the closest donor, the next chart corresponds to the second closest donor, the third
chart corresponds to the furthest donor. In the bottom chart, circles denote locations of the closest donor, triangles
denote locations of the middle donor, diamonds locations of the furthest donor and the line connects the candidates’
locations.


donors we observe both over- and under-contributions. Whether the closest donor contributed more
or less than predicted is largely determined by whether the candidate is expected to implement
a less or more favorable policy. In periods 4, 7, 8, 9 and 12, both donors were located on the
same side of the candidate, so it is likely that the candidate’s response will be a more favorable
policy for the closest donor, and except for period 12 we observe overcontribution. In the remaining
periods the candidate was located between the donors and was more likely to move towards the
furthest donor thereby hurting the closest one. Not surprisingly whenever this happens we observe
under-contribution.
    Figure 5 shows individual donations in 3-donor treatments. For the sake of space we present only
ﬁgures for the FA and PA conditions. We observe that the furthest donor was consistently over-
contributing and the closest donor was consistently under-contributing. The diﬀerence between
the FA and PA conditions is now less pronounced and we see several instances where the FA
contribution was higher than the PA contribution. Some instances can be explained by the diﬀerence


                                                            30
in expectation. For example, in period 6 the closest donor could have more favorable expectations
in the FA treatment than in PA. Indeed, in the FA treatment locations of the other two donors
were not observed and it was unlikely that the candidate picks the policy that could hurt the
closest donor. In the PA treatment on the other hand the politician (and the closest donor) could
see that the other two donors are very centrist and potentially could choose a policy which would
be too centrist from the closest donor’s point of view. Other instances, such as the diﬀerence in
contributions of the furthest donors in periods 2 and 4, are unlikely to be caused by diﬀerences in
expectations. In general, as compared to 1- and 2-donor treatments potential diﬀerence in donors’
expectation is less successful in explaining over- and under-contribution. While overcontribution
by the middle donor in periods 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 11 as well under-contribution in period 7 could
be explained by expectations of more (or less for period 7) favorable policy. However, under-
contributions in periods 1, 5 and 9 are less likely to be caused by expectations of less favorable
policy. A potential alternative explanation could be that donations are strategic substitutes, so
that given overcontribution of the furthest donors it is optimal for other donors to contribute less.

5.3.2    Using the Best Response to the Observed Candidate’s Policy Choice Function
         as the Benchmark

    While we showed above that the static Nash predictions for the donors’ contributions seem
to be matched quite well in some situations, overall we believe that the assumption that donors
expect that the human candidate will implement his ideal policy once elected is not realistic.
Indeed our analysis in Section 5.2 demonstrates that the candidates systematically respond to the
donations, though in diﬀerent ways depending on the campaign ﬁnance system. Here we examine
the donors’ donations using the donors’ best response to their perceived policy response function
from the candidates, 𝑦1∗𝑆 (d;𝑐1 ) in the notation of Section 3.3, as the benchmark. We assume rational
expectations and approximate the perceived policy choice function by the actual policy choice
functions we estimated in Table 5. Using these estimated policy response functions 𝑦ˆ1∗𝑆 (d;𝑐1 ) , we
numerically calculate the equilibrium donation level in each treatment for each number of donors.
We then compare these predictions with the amount that was actually donated. The results for
1-donor 3000 ECU maximum donatable amount treatments are presented in Figure 6.
    We see that with this new assumption the ﬁt is somewhat improved especially when the distance
between the candidate and the donors takes intermediate values. Recall that under the assumption
of non-deviating politicians it was optimal to donate 0 when the distance was 53 or larger. Now,
in NA it is always optimal to donate a positive amount and in PA it is optimal until the distance
becomes 75. To save space we do not show pictures for 2 and 3 donors.42 In general, the diﬀerence
in predicted amount of donations is less substantial in cases with multiple donors because the corner
solution frequently ends up to be optimal regardless of whether the candidate is expected to move
or not.

5.3.3    Regression Analysis

   Finally, we focus on which variables impact the size of the donor’s donation. The results of
ﬁxed-eﬀect panel estimations are shown in Table 6. To make donations comparable across the 1000

     The results for other treatments and multiple-donor cases are available upon request. The ﬁts between this
benchmark and the actual donations improved to some degree in all cases.

Table 6: Donations.
Notes: The ﬁxed-eﬀect panel estimation of donors’ behavior. The dependent variable is donations made by a partic-
ular donor as a percentage of total donatable endowment. 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑂𝑝𝑝 and 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑂𝑝𝑝1 are the square distances between
the donor’s opponent(s) and the candidate; 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝐶 is the distance between the closest donor and the candidate; 𝜌1 is
the initial election probability. In FA and PA 𝑟𝑗 = 0.0001 for all donors and in NA it diﬀers across donors; 𝐼𝑠𝐶𝑔𝑡𝐷
is the dummy variable that is equal to 1 if 𝐶 > 𝐷. Finally, 𝑊 𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑟𝐿 is equal to 1 if the candidate won the election
last period.


and 3000 treatments the dependent variable is deﬁned as the percentage of maximum donatable
amount. Independent variables include: the donor’s distance from the candidate’s ideal policy;
distances of other donors, “DistOpp” and “DistOpp1”; the distance of the closest donor to the
candidate, “DistC” ; the initial probability of election; a dummy variable equal to one if the
candidate’s location is greater than the donor’s location; a dummy variable equal to one if the
candidate won the election last period; and, in the NA treatments, the impact of donations 𝑟.
    Table 6 shows that the major determinant of donations was the distance between the candidate
and the donor. It is signiﬁcant in all 9 treatments and the sign is negative, that is donors donate
more to the candidate who is closer. The locations of other donors had no signiﬁcant impact.
    Other notable eﬀects are as follows. First, comparing the constant between treatments we see
that for 1 and 2 donor cases the PA has the largest constant then followed by NA and the smallest
one is for FA. In the 3-donor case the constants for NA is the highest and the constant for FA


                                                         33
and PA are approximately the same. In other words in 1 and 2-donor sessions, the PA donors are
the most generous and the FA donors are the least generous. The same relationship is observed
if we simply look at the averages. For example, the average donations in 1-donor FA3000 session
was 1397 versus 1522 in NA3000 and 1735 in PA3000. The variable DidCWin𝑡−1 is negative and
signiﬁcant in all PA treatments and is insigniﬁcant in all other treatments. When DidCWin𝑡−1 is
signiﬁcant it means that the candidates who lost in the previous period receive larger donations
this period. As we already established candidates are the most responsive in the PA treatment
and, therefore, donors might be particularly sensitive if the elections are lost and donate more next
round. The increase varies from 6% to 12% of the donatable endowment. Finally, the variable
DistC is positive and signiﬁcant in the PA treatment with 3 donors. This means that when the
closest donor gets further away from the candidate donations increase. This is most likely due to
the fact that having one donor close to the candidate other donors might expect that the candidate
is more likely to ignore the others.
    We summarize the main results in this section as follows:

Result 5: Average donations are the lowest in FA treatments and the highest in PA treatments.

Result 6: Donors’ actual donations seem to match the theoretical predictions well based on the
    donors’ best response to the candidates’ observed policy choice function.

Result 7: In all treatments donors donate less to candidates located further away.

5.4     Welfare
    While mitigating the inﬂuence of money in politics is the goal of many of the campaign ﬁnance
reform proposals, we should recognize, as much of the theoretical research reviewed in Section 2
emphasize, campaign contributions can play potentially important roles in improving the electoral
outcomes and increase social welfare. Thus in this section, we investigate the eﬀect of campaign
ﬁnance systems on the voters’ and donors’ welfare.

5.4.1    Voters’ Welfare

    To study the impact of diﬀerent treatments on voter welfare, we calculate and compare the
expected voter welfare under the alternative campaign ﬁnance systems, using as the benchmark
the voter welfare when donations are prohibited. In calculating voter welfare, we assume that voters’
preferences are similar to those assumed for the donors, as speciﬁed by (16), with the exception that
voters do not make donations. We also assume limited liability for the donors. More speciﬁcally,
suppose that the candidate, if elected, implements policy 𝑦1 and his probability of election is 𝜌ˆ1 ,
then the expected utility of a voter with an ideal policy location of 𝜇𝑖 is:
                      {                      }                  {                       }
             𝜌ˆ1 ⋅ min 9000 − (𝑦1 − 𝜇𝑖 )2 , 0 + (1 − 𝜌ˆ1 ) ⋅ min 9000 − (225 − 𝜇𝑖 )2 , 0 .      (18)

   In the benchmark when donations are prohibited, 𝜌ˆ1 = 𝜌1 as determined by (12), and we
assume that 𝑦1 = 𝑐1 , that is the candidate will implement his optimal policy. When calculating
the expected voter welfare under alternative campaign ﬁnance systems, we use the actual policy
proposed by the human candidate and the relevant election probabilities: (13) for the FA and PA

systems, and (15) for the NA system. Finally, we use the assumption that voters’ ideal policy
locations are uniformly distributed [0, 300] for the aggregation of individual voters’ utilities.
    Intuitively, the introduction of donations may have two, possibly opposing, eﬀects. One is that
the probability of election is altered and the other is that the candidate may respond to these
donations by implementing a policy other than his ideal policy. The eﬀect of donations, without
the candidate’s deviation from his ideal policy in his policy choice, is straightforward. Donations
to candidates located between [0, 75] will cause a decrease in social welfare as they increase the
probability that extreme candidates are elected; donations to candidates located between [75, 150]
cause an increase in social welfare as more centrist candidates now have a higher probability of
being elected.43 However, since candidates are free to choose a policy other than their ideal policy,
donations to extreme candidate could be beneﬁcial if they lead to more moderate policies.
    In Figure 7 we present the diﬀerence between the average voter welfare under alternative cam-
paign ﬁnance systems and the “no-donation” benchmark for each candidate position by treatment.
For each period, voter welfare for each subject grouping (human candidate and donor(s)) is cal-
culated and then averaged across the groupings in the same treatment. The benchmark welfare
then is subtracted from these empirical averages.44 Since the data series are constructed as the
diﬀerence of empirical and theoretical welfare, observations above zero show that the particular
empirical welfare measure is higher than the no-donation benchmark, while those below zero show
that welfare is lower than the benchmark. The data points are ordered by candidate’s location.
    Overall, we ﬁnd that when the candidate’s position is extreme (i.e., farther away from the center
of 150 in our experiment), voter welfare tends to be higher under the campaign ﬁnance systems
in treatments with 1 and 2 donors. In these treatments, we see that PA tends to perform the
worse, while FA tends to perform the best, with few exceptions. In the exceptional cases where
voters’ welfare under the campaign ﬁnance system is lower than the benchmark, we also ﬁnd that
the decrease is fairly low under the FA treatments. The FA system is particularly beneﬁcial to the
voters when donors are extreme. The results are noisier and more mixed in the 3-donor treatments.
This is in part because there are fewer groupings of candidate and donors in 3-donor treatments.
Another ﬁnding is that limiting the donatable amount at a lower level reduces the potentially
harmful eﬀect of donations. This is particularly noticeable if we compare one- and two- donor
treatments with 3000 and 1000 donatable amounts. Finally, while NA treatments do ﬁlter out
some of the inﬂuence of extreme donors there are many instances where the NA treatments lead
to the lowest possible welfare.
    Table 7 shows average voter welfare by treatment and number of donors.45 We boldface the
number that is larger than its counterpart in each treatment. In the 1-donor treatments, we ﬁnd
that the interaction between the candidate and donors improves voter welfare in all 1000 ECU
treatments, and FA seems to perform better than NA and PA. In 3000 treatments, however, voter
welfare is improved only under FA. In 2-donor treatments, voter welfare is only improved under
FA; and in 3-donor treatments welfare is improved in four of the six treatments. One reason why
the 2-donor setting is particularly detrimental for the welfare is that with two donors, it is fairly
  43
       This result is directly tied to the fact that the computer candidate’s location is ﬁxed at 225.
  44
    Note that the scale of the ﬁgures omits some data points (this is particularly true in the NA treatments with
three donors) so that changes in aggregate welfare for centrist positions can be more easily discerned.
  45
    Relative to what were depicted in Figure 7, we averaged the voter welfare over the realization of the candidates’
ideal locations in calculating the numbers reported in Table 7.

likely to have both donors being more extreme than the candidate thereby inﬂuencing more extreme
policy. Adding the third donor, however, makes such realization of locations considerably less likely
which improves the welfare.

          Table 7: Averange Voter Welfare and the No Donation Benchmark by Treatment.

    To determine whether or not there is a statistical diﬀerence, total empirical welfare for each
group in each treatment is calculated and compared to the benchmark welfare. For example, in
the 1-donor FA3000 treatment there are twelve groups and fourteen elections. Each group’s total
welfare is summed over the fourteen elections and considered an observation. One-tailed Wilcoxon
signed-ranks tests are then conducted for each of the ﬁfteen treatments.46 The 1-donor FA1000
and PA1000 treatments are the only ones where the empirical welfare is signiﬁcantly greater than
the benchmark. The Wilcoxon statistics are 0 and 12 respectively for these treatments, and both
are signiﬁcant at the 2.5% level. The 1-donor and 2-donor PA3000 treatments are the only ones
where the benchmark welfare was signiﬁcantly greater than the observed welfare. The Wilcoxon
statistics are 13 and 1 respectively, and are signiﬁcant at the 2.5% and 1% level. This suggests that
voters are primarily harmed in those treatments in which (1) donations have the same impact across
donors, (2) the identities of the donors are known, and (3) the number of donors is small enough
that the candidate can respond favorably to large donations without (potentially) alienating the
other donor.

5.4.2     Donors’ welfare

    Donor welfare can be calculated in a similar manner to voter welfare, only that the empirical
measures of donor welfare must take into account the donations made. Thus, when calculating
expected payoﬀs for donors, each donor’s donation is subtracted from his endowment.
    Table 8 shows average donor welfare by treatment. The table shows that donors beneﬁt greatly
from this campaign ﬁnance system, and the only instance in which the no-donation benchmark
exceeds the observed donor welfare measure is in the 1-donor FA3000 treatment.
    As with the analysis of voter welfare, each series of elections for each group within each treatment
is considered a single observation. Total donor observed welfare is calculated and compared to the
benchmark donor welfare. Results of the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test overwhelmingly favor the
  46
    Holding the information condition (FA, PA, and NA) constant, the 3-donor 1000 and 3000 treatments are the
same as each donor can donate up to 1000. The observations from those treatments are combined so that there are
ﬁfteen, instead of eighteen, treatments.

Result 8: Voters do not lose much or at all from the presence of campaign donations. They
    particularly beneﬁt from campaign donations when the candidate is extreme. The worst setting
    for voter welfare is the PA treatment with 2 donors. Overall, the FA system seems to perform
    marginally better than the other systems, though the diﬀerence is not pronounced in our
    experiment. Donors generally are better oﬀ from the donations, but less so in FA than in NA
    and PA systems.


6     Conclusion
    Campaign ﬁnance reform is one of the most important domestic policy issues, yet important
reform proposals are rarely studied empirically. In this paper, we compare alternative campaign
ﬁnance systems in a laboratory setting and focus particularly on their eﬀects on donations, election
outcomes, political candidates’ policy choices, and welfare. In our experiment, we consider three
alternative campaign ﬁnance systems as characterized by diﬀerent information structure about
donors. The ﬁrst is a full anonymity (FA) system in which neither the politicians nor the voters
are informed about the donors’ ideal policies or levels of donations, which we think corresponds in
essence to the reform advocated by Ayres and Ackerman (2002). The second is a partial anonymity
(PA) system in which only the politicians, but not the voters, are informed about the donors’ ideal
policies and donations, which we think corresponds closer to the current campaign ﬁnance system
in the U.S. And the third is a no anonymity (NA) system in which both the politicians and the
voters are informed about the donors’ ideal policies and donations, which will correspond to what
happens under a set of perfectly enforced campaign ﬁnance disclosure laws. In our experiments
there are two politicians with one being computerized, and between one to three large donors,
while the voters’ choices are summarized by election probabilities that depend on the speciﬁcs of
the campaign ﬁnance systems. Donors choose donations to the human candidate that may increase
his chances of being elected.
    We ﬁnd that donors contribute less in the FA system than in the PA and NA systems, and
candidates are less likely to deviate from their ideal policies under FA than under PA and NA
   47
      There are too few observations (four each) in the 2-donor FA1000 and NA1000 treatments to calculate statistical
signiﬁcance, but all groups in both treatments had higher observed welfare than benchmark welfare.


                                                         38
systems. We also ﬁnd that the eﬀect of donations on the candidate’s policy deviations diﬀer in FA
from that of PA and NA; speciﬁcally, in the FA system larger donations lead to smaller deviations
from the candidate’s ideal policy, but in the NA and PA systems, larger donations lead to larger
deviations. As a result the donations lead to a socially desirable centrist bias in the candidate’s
policy choices, i.e., donations are more likely to make extreme candidate move to the center than
to make centrist candidate move to the right. This centrist bias is present more robustly in FA
treatments. We also ﬁnd that voters beneﬁt from the donor’s contributions overall when the
candidates are extreme, though the eﬀect is small.
    These results provide supportive evidence for Ayres and Ackerman’s (2002) campaign ﬁnance
reform proposal. A fully anonymous campaign ﬁnance system seems to have the potential to reduce
the inﬂuence of money in politics more eﬀectively than the current partial anonymity system or
the no anonymity system. It more robustly leads to the socially beneﬁcial centrist bias from the
candidates.
    We should of course bear in mind that our ﬁndings are obtained in a laboratory setting, not
from the ﬁeld. Many important issues related to campaign ﬁnance and political competition are
abstracted away in our study. For example, in our experiment we assumed that candidate’s ideal
policies are common knowledge to all donors and voters. This suppresses one of the roles of
campaign expenditures, namely to inform voters about the candidate’s policy platform. We also
abstracted away from the critical voter turnout issue as we do not consider at all how voter turnout
may be aﬀected by whether or not donations are anonymous. Moreover, we ﬁxed the policy position
of the computer candidate and only included one human candidate in our experiment. Thus we
are unable to study how political competition might aﬀect the performance of diﬀerent campaign
ﬁnance systems. It is interesting and important to study how the alternative campaign ﬁnance
systems will perform when more of these issues are incorporated and when these systems are
possibly implemented in the ﬁeld rather in the laboratory.

    What follows are instructions for the FA3000 treatment. Screenshots included at the end are in the
order of donor’s donation screen, pre-election screen where all donors and candidates see the donations and
updated probability of winning (the example is a donor version of the screen), the candidate’s policy choice
screen, and the payoﬀ screen (the example is the candidate version of the screen).

                         Welcome to a decision-making study!
                                               Introduction

    Thank you     for participating in today’s study in economic decision-making. These instructions describe
the procedures    of the study, so please read them carefully. If you have any questions while reading these
instructions or   at any time during the study, please raise your hand. At this time I ask that you refrain
from talking to   any of the other participants.

                                          General Description

In this study all participants are assigned to one of two roles:

    ∙ a candidate who would like to be elected;
    ∙ a donor who may or may not provide ﬁnancial support for the candidate’s campaign.

    A candidate, if elected, determines the policy. The policy is described by a number between 0 and
300. A policy of 0 corresponds to one side of the political spectrum and a policy of 300 corresponds to
the other extreme of the spectrum. Candidates and donors have a most preferred policy that characterizes
your preferences with regards to the implemented policy. The closer the implemented policy is to your most
preferred policy the better oﬀ you are.

                                                Donor Stage

     At this moment I ask you to turn your attention to the monitor. During the study all of you will be
assigned the role of either a candidate or a donor. If you are assigned a donor role you will see the screen
similar to what you see now. You can see that there are two candidates — 𝐶1 and 𝐶2 — and that their
most preferred policies are located at 75 and 225 respectively. You are a donor and your most preferred
policy is located at 100. The candidate at 225, 𝐶2, will be played by a computer. This candidate always
chooses policy 225 if elected. The other candidate, 𝐶1, will be played by a human.
     Donors have funds, denominated in Experimental Currency Units (or ECUs), available for contribution.
On the computer screen you see that you have 9000 ECUs, 3000 of which you can donate. Donations can be
made only to the human candidate, 𝐶1. Donors need to decide how much money they want to contribute
to 𝐶1’s campaign fund. Contributions to the candidate change the probability a candidate is elected as will
be explained below.
     Without any contributions the initial chance of election is determined by the human candidate’s most
preferred policy. Having a more extreme policy means a lower chance whereas having a more centrist policy
means a higher chance. The initial chance of election will be calculated and displayed on the screen for you
every period. You see on the screen that when 𝐶1 is at 75 his chance of being elected is exactly 50%. When
𝐶1’s more preferred policy is to the left of 75, his chance of being elected will be less than 50% and when it
is to right of 75 it will be larger than 50%.
     If the human candidate receives contributions from donors then her chance of being elected changes from
the initial chance of election. Contributions increase the chance of election at the rate of 100 to 1. That is
a contribution of 100 ECUs increases the chance of election by 1%, a contribution of 200 ECUs by 2%, and
so on. The chance of election cannot be made higher than 80%. At this time I ask you to enter a donation


                                                      42
of 3000 and press the “Donate” button. You now see a new screen that shows the size of your donation and
the new probability for 𝐶1. Because of your donations the new probability is higher and is equal to 80%.
Press the “Continue” button.

                                           Candidate Stage
    After donors make their donations it is the candidate’s turn to implement a decision. For technical
reasons we ask candidates to decide on the policy before the actual outcome of elections. If you are assigned
the role of candidate you will see the following screen. The screen shows your chance of election as well
as the locations of donors and their contributions. You can enter any number between 0 and 300 as your
implemented policy. Please submit number 75. This policy will determine everyone’s payoﬀ. Notice that the
policy you implement has no impact on your chance of election. Your chance of election is only determined
by the donations and the initial chance of election. In our example, the chance of election is 80% regardless
of the implemented policy.

                                              Proﬁt Stage
     The next four screens will show you the proﬁt for 𝐷1 and 𝐶1 when 𝐶1 wins and when 𝐶1 does not win.
In the actual study you will only see one screen that corresponds to your role and the election outcome. The
current screen shows the donor’s proﬁt if 𝐶1 is elected. The proﬁt is determined as follows. We take your
initial endowment which is 9000, subtract the size of your donation, 3000 in our example, and subtract the
loss from the chosen policy. The loss is just the square of the diﬀerence between the implemented policy
and donor’s most preferred policy. In our example it is equal to (100 − 75)2 = 625. Clearly, the further the
implemented policy is from a donor’s most preferred policy the larger is the loss.
     Formally, a donor’s proﬁt is calculated as

                  9000 − 𝐷𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 − (𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑑𝑃 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑦 − 𝐷𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑃 𝑟𝑒𝑓 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑃 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑦)2 .

     Please press the “Continue” button. This screen shows the donor’s proﬁt if 𝐶2 is elected. The proﬁt is
calculated according to the same formula. Since the implemented policy of 225 is too far from 100 the proﬁt
is negative. Whenever proﬁt is negative it will be counted as 0. Please press the “Continue” button.
     The next screen shows 𝐶1’s proﬁt is 𝐶1 is elected. Whenever 𝐶1 is elected he receives 6000. If the
implemented policy diﬀers from 𝐶1’s most preferred policy then 𝐶1 incurs a loss which is also a square of
the diﬀerence. In our example 𝐶1 chose 75 and so the loss is 0. So the total proﬁt is 6000. On the next
screen we show 𝐶1’s payoﬀ if he loses the election. 𝐶1’s proﬁt is 0 in that case. Thus, the candidate’s proﬁt
is 0 when not elected and

                       6000 − (𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑑𝑃 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑦 − 𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑃 𝑟𝑒𝑓 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑃 𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑦)2 ,

if elected. Press “Continue”

                                              Two donors
    Within the study a number of donors will be varied depending upon the phase. The second example
depicts the case of two donors: 𝐷1 and 𝐷2. In this example you are 𝐷1. You see the location of the most
preferred policies for 𝐶1 and 𝐶2 which are 60 and 225. You also see the most preferred policies of both
donors. Yours is 100 and 𝐷2’s is 50. You see that the initial election chance is less than 50% because C1 is
to the left of 75. You also see that when there are two donors you can donate only 1500 of your endowment.
Please enter 1500 and the computer is programmed so that 𝐷2’s donations are 0. At the candidate’s screen
please enter policy 75. When 𝐶1 wins 𝐷1’s payoﬀ is 6875. If 𝐶1 loses then 𝐷1’s payoﬀ is negative and will
be counted as zero. When 𝐶1 wins now 𝐶1’s payoﬀ is not 6000 but 6000 − (75 − 60)2 = 5775 because his
implemented policy diﬀers from his preferred policy. Again, when 𝐶1 loses his payoﬀ is zero. This completes
our example. Notice that during the study you will either see the donor’s screens (if you are a donor) or the
candidate’s screens but not both.

                                        Phase Description

    The study consists of three phases, time permitted. In each phase participants will be divided into
groups. In the ﬁrst phase of the study there will be two people in each group: one candidate and one
donor. In the second phase of the study there will be three participants in each group: two donors and one
candidate. In the third phase of the study there will be four participants in each group: 3 donors and 1
candidate. Within a phase your group assignment will not change. Groups are re-assigned in the beginning
of every phase. This means that you will have the same groupmate(s) during each phase of the study but
your groupmates in diﬀerent phases may be diﬀerent.
    Example: In the ﬁrst phase person A is a candidate and is matched with person B who is a donor.
During the entire ﬁrst phase for person A there will be only one potential donor which is person B and
person B can only contribute to candidate A. Furthermore, it is the policy implemented by candidate A, if
elected, that will determine B’s payoﬀ. In the second phase the group assignment will be randomly re-done.
For example, person A can become a donor and will be matched with person C who is the second donor and
person D who is a candidate. The assignment will be re-done for the third phase as well.

                                            Cash Payoﬀs

    Your cash payoﬀ will be determined as follows. At the end of the experiment we will randomly draw one
of the three phases. Your cash earnings will be equal to the total proﬁt that you earned during that phase
with 6000 points being equal to 1 dollar. This is in addition to the $5 that you receive as a show-up fee.
For example, if the phase with 2 donors is chosen and you earned 60000 points at that phase then your cash
payoﬀ will be: 60000/6000 + 5 = $15.
