    The international capital market is presently characterized by
effective credit rationing to developingcountries.        Most developing

countries cannot obtain new credits from the international banking

system.     This situation is in sharp contrast with the 1970's, when the

international banking system engaged willingly in substantial resource

transfer to the developing countries.       This remarkable switch from a

functioning international credit market to a market characterized by
credit rationing reflects the growing awareness of the country risk

involved in further lending to developing countries.      Most developing

countries have reached a point where their willingness or ability to
service their debt is questionable, thereby increasing the reluctance

of the international banking system to extend new credits.      This

situation is further complicated by the drop in export prices

experienced by the developing nations in recent years, a process that

has further reduced their ability and willingness to service their

debt.

    A   significant literature has evolved in recent years which

attempts to study the unique characteristics of international country
risk.     The lack of simple enforcement mechanisms for international

debt repayment tends to degenerate the international credit market

into an equilibrium where the volume of international credit is

limited by the effective penalties associated with defaults.       These

penalties are potential embargoes that would restrict the flow of both
temporal and intertemporal trade (i.e., trade in goods and financial

assets, respectively)
    While the above literature has provided clues regarding the

problems of country risk, it has raised important policy questions of
what can be (Or should   be) done in the present situation characterized

by "over—borrowing" and debt overhang.2 An open question is the
degree to which the international system will be capable of

revitalizing the resource transfer for investment purposes from the

developed to the developing nations.

    The purpose of this paper is to identify conditions under which
renewed lending may benefit both the developed and the developing

countries.   We evaluate how the presence of endogenous terms of trade
effects--that is, a situation in which terms of trade between debtor

and creditor nations are significantly affected by the financial flows
between them——affects the conditions for the existence of beneficial
lending.   This analysis has special relevance because a competitive

international banking system does not internalize terms of trade

effects, and may not revitalize lending for investment purposes, even

in situations in which renewed lending is socially desirable.       This

may suggest an important role for policy-makers in imposing the
appropriate conditionality   (i.e., by imposing guidelines regarding the
domestic policies that should follow renewed lending).    We will
attempt to evaluate conditions under which such a role is desirable.

    We start our analysis by reviewing the behavior of the terms of
trade of developing nations in recent years.   The relevance of terms

of trade effects for the debt situation depends mainly on the

existence of a less than perfectly elastic demand for developing

countries' exports.   Existing econometric studies conclude that
developing countries face a downward—sloping demand curve for their
exports, at least when taken as a group.   In addition, the sharp




                               2
deterioration in terms of trade of debtor countries since the start of

the debt crisis, and the recent behavior of commodity prices suggest
the existence of a strong connection between terms of trade changes
and the debt situation.

    We continue our analysis by describing a model of the
international credit market which is characterized by insolvency on

the part of debtor countries.     This means that repayments do not

suffice to cover all obligations, and therefore become nore closely

related to available resources in the debtor economy than to existing

debt.   As a consequence, the debtor countries cannot borrow as much as

they would like to3, and find themselves credit rationed.     In these

circumstances, we assume that debtors and creditors negotiate
'contracts' that offer increased lending based on some conditions on

the use of the resources agreed to by the debtor country, and on the

extent of the attachment of the debtors output to repayment.     This

simple framework is intended to capture some of the main features of
the current rescheduling negotiation process.

    The debt negotiations are assumed to take place in the context of
a two—period, two—good world economy composed of two blocks of

nations:   creditors and debtors.    Each block produces one good, and

consumes both.      In the first period, debtors and creditors try to

reach a deal, or contract, to increase lending.      The contracts are

defined as   a   resource transfer to the developing nations in the first

period that specifies a marginal propensityto invest out of the
transfer and a marginal propensity to repay out of the proceeds of the

new investment in the second period.     A   contract is a

'Pareto—improving contract' if both blocks of nations benefit from the

marginal resource transfers.      We obtain the conditions for the
existence of Pareto contracts, and describe them.

    In the absence of terms of trade effects (perfect

substitutability between the two goods) the key results can be
summarized in the following way.     The conditioflguaranteeing the

existence of Pareto contracts is that the marginal productivity of

capital in the developing countries should exceed that in the

developed countries.   In the absence cf iistortions      (other than the

international credit market insolvency situation) this condition is

identical to the requirement that the interest rate be higher in the

developing than in the developed nations.     The larger the excess of
the marginal productivity of capital in the developed countries, the

larger the range of Pareto contracts,     The presumption is that this

condition is indeed satisfied because the interest rate in the heavily
indebted countries tends to be higher than in    the.   industrial

countries.   Nevertheless,   in a real world situation, the marginal

resource transfer will not occur in the absence of either appropriate

incentives or conditionality on the debtor country.

    We turn then to the analysis of the consequences of endogenous

terms of trade adjustment due to limited goods substitutability       on the

region of Pareto contracts.    We show that the Pareto region is

enlarged for strict conditionality contracts (contracts that require

high marginal propensity to invest in the debtor country) and is
reduced for contracts requiring low marginal propensity to invest on

the part of the debtor country.     We also analyze an alternative type

of contract between debtors and creditors.     In this case the amount of

the repayment is the only variable to be agreed upon, and investment

is assumed to be undertaken in an optimal manner by the developing

country.   We show how, in this framework, the existence of endogenous




                                4
terms of trade modifies the region of Pareto—improving     contracts.

    It is noteworthy that the terms of trade effect is not

internalized by the international banking system.      This has the

consequence that in the negotiation process the interests of the

banking system may diverge from those of   a   representative consumer in

the creditor country.     Tlis possibility may suggest an important role

in the debt renegotiation process for governmental institutions that

may provide the international banking system with the proper

incentives needed to implement the desirable contracts.




     II.   The Empirical Relevance of Terms of Trade Effects



    The relevance of terms of trade effects for the debt situation

depends on the answer to the following question: do debtor countries
face a downward—sloping    demand curve for their export products?    There

are two reasons to believe that they do.    The first is that although

perhaps all debtor countries can be considered small economies, often

they are all simultaneously affected by the same shocks, and their

joint response is of a large magnitude.    For example, the increasing

unavailability of foreign borrowing since 1982 affected most debtor
countries; their response included a generalized increase in exports,

and a terms of trade deterioration followed.4     This means that even
if the actions of each individual debtor country cannot affect its

terms of trade, on occasions the debtor country may find falling

prices every time it tries to increase the volume of its exports
because other debtor countries are doing the same.
       The second reason is that an increasing portion of debtor
countries' exports are manufactured products, the markets for which

are, in many cases, well described by a differentiated products

structure,      In a differentiated—products     framework (such as Spence

(l976)) there is a whole continuum of goods that can be produced by
a given industry, each of them differing only slightly from the        point
of view of    consumers' preferences.     Wit) increasing returns, each firm

will   specialize in    a different product on   the continuum, and it will

command   a   certain degree of market   power6    If this is the case, the

manufactured exports from debtor countries will face a

downward—sloping      demand curve, irrespective of   size considerations.
       Econometric studies of the elasticity cf demand for developing

country exports by industrial economies have usually taken developing
countries as    a   group.   Estimates of this import demand elasticity

range from somewhat less than 1 to over 4,7 The studies use,

however, different aggregations for the definition of the import

commodity, and different aggregations for the importer economy, apart
from different sample periods.         Despite that fact, it appears that a
number slightly above 1 is a reasonable synthesis of econometric

estimates of import demand elaSticity.         It is interesting to note that

the median (across products) elasticity estimated by Grossman (1982)

is equal to 1.2, the median (across countries) elasticityestimated by

Marquez and McNeilly (1987) is also equal to 1.2, and the elasticity

estimated by Dornbusch (1985) for the aggregate of non—oil developing

countries is also equal to l.2. Such a figure is also in line with
estimates of import price elasticities for industrial goods

irrespective of the country of origin of exports (see Goldstein and

Khan (1985)). This elasticity applies, however, to the aggregate of



                                   6
developing country exports, although for some particular goods, a few
exporters account for most of the supply.

    In fact, the evolution of the terms of trade of the group of

fifteen heavily indebted countries appears to reflect quite strongly

the debt problems faced by them since 1982, as suggested by the data

displayed in Table 1.    Sin'e 1982, the combined non-interest current
account for this group of countries displays a sharp turnaround.      The

non—interest current account, that averaged a deficit of over $2

billion in the period 1968—81, moved to an average surplus of over $32

billion during 1982-87.     This turnaround reflects the loss of access

to international credit from private sources of many debtor countries.

At the same time, these fifteen debtor countries experienced a sharp
deterioration in terms of trade, a cumulative 22 percent relative to

1981 levels.    Despite that deterioration, the volume of exports showed
a cumulative increase of over 10 percent in the same period.

    In addition to the general picture portrayed by Table 1, there

are other pieces of evidence that indicate an interaction between the

foreign debt situation and terms of trade developments.     One of these
is the behavior of the prices of non-oil commodities produced by

developing countries.     Despite continuous economic expansion in
industrial countries the relative price of non—oil commodities fell

sharply since 1983.     Econometric studies have often found that non—oil

commodity prices can be explained well by business cycle developments
in industrial countries and the dollar exchange rate (see Dornbusch

(1985)). However, since 1983, there appears to be break in
traditional relationships, (Morrison and Wattleworth,     (1987)>.   Chart

1, that   plots an index of industrial production and the relative price
of non—oil commodities since 1975, also suggests the existence of such




                                7
break in the relationship between these two variables,
    An additional piece of evidence concerns the differentiated

products argument.   A large part of the increase in debtor countries'

exports since 1982 consisted of manufactures, among which there are a

number of goods which can easily fit the differentiated products

description.   Although disaggregated data on price and quantity
indices of industrial exports are hard to obtain, there exists

published information in the case of Chile.       These data do show large

increases in the volume of industrial exports accompanied by sharp

drops in prices, as displayed in Table 2.      Since 1982, the volume of

manufactured exports grew by a cumulative 76 percent.       However, this

growth required deep cuts in prices, and the dollar prices of

manufactured exports fell by a cumulative 36 percent.       Relative to the

prices of manufactures exported by industrial countries, the fall in
export prices is even larger.       Relative to the unit value index of

their own imports, however, the decrease is smaller, which is partly

explained by the decrease in commodity prices and in prices of exports

originated in other developing countries.       In addition, we conjecture

that there might be a quality effect hidden in the data,      As imports
became more expensive and real income adjusted downwards, there might

have been a switch towards lower quality products in imports.       This

interpretation is suggested by a disaggregation of import price data,
which shows a very sharp decrease in the prices of consumption good

imports, and only a slight decrease in the prices of capital good

imports.

                III.    A   Framework of Analysis



    The purpose of our analysis is to identify conditions under which

an increase in the resource transfer from developed to developing

countries would be beneficial, and to study the consequences of

eridogenous terms of trade adjustment.           The simplest framework to deal

with these issues is a two-period, two—good world economy composed of
two blocks of nations: developed and developing nations.            Each block
produces one good, and consumes both. For simplicity of exposition it
is convenient to assume that in the long-run the relative price of the

two goods is exogenously fixed by the technology of production.                In
the short-run the supply is given, and the relative price of the two

goods is determined by the prevailingdemand conditions.             We will
identify the short run with the first period, and the long run with
the second.

    On the supply side, let X and Y denote the good produced by the

developed and the developing nations, respectively.           Let       and

denote the output level of the two goods in period          i, i=l,2.    The
output level is exogenously given in period one. In the second
period, the output level is determinedby investment carried out in

period one, which is denoted by I.          We assume an asymmetric

environment: good X can be either consumed or invested to increase the

future output of both good X and Y, while good Y can only be used for

consumption purposes.       The investment technologies also differ.           In

the developed economy, second—period output is linked to investment

according to:


                                —   (l+r)   dl




                                    9
where   I refers to investment in the   production of good X by the
developed economy, and r is the interest rate in the developed
country.    Thus, optimality conditions ensure that the marginal product
of capital is always equal to the interest rate in the developed

economy.    The supply level of a good is indicated by a bar over its
name.   In the debtor economy, investment translates into output

according to:



                         dY2   m(I)    dI*


        *
where I refers to    the use of good   X   for investment purposes in the

developing country, and m is a function of the volume of investment,
displaying decreasing returns. We do not make the assumption that the
marginal product of capital equals the interest rate in the developing

economy.    Instead, the volume of investment is determined by an
economic authority, and it is the subject of bargaining between debtor
and creditor.   Specifically, we assume that a fraction       is invested

out of every extra dollar of net borrowing:



                               -                               (1)


and that the value of    is subject to debt negotiations.      In fact, the

actual subject of the debt negotiations could be an economic policy

package for the debtor economy, which contains a set of measures (say
taxes and subsidies> that ensure that the level of investment in the

economy is consistent with the given value of 5.




                               10
     Note that the domestic interest rate in the debtor country (Which

we will denote by     r*) will    not be equal to the interest rate in the
creditor country, r.      This is     a   consequence of the situation of

insolvency which we assume the debtor country to be in.               This
situation implies that, in period one, the debtor country can obtain

net foreign resources only up to a certain limit B, which it cannot

control.      Thus, if this is a binding constraint, the debtor country is

credit—rationed,      and r* will exceed r.

    The situation of insolvency also implies that repayments by the

debtor country will fall short of its obligations and will thus be

linked the debtor's capacity to pay.             Specifically, we assume that, in

period two, the debtor country repays an amount R which is linked to
its available resources by:


                            —-
                             dR
                                          x                           (2)
                             dY2



    The value of x is determinedby negotiations between the debtor

country and its creditors.         We assume that there exists previous

indebtedness, contracted before period one, of a level that is larger
than any value that R can attain.             Note that this also implies that R
can be larger or smaller than (1+r)B.             In the absence of credit

rationing and insolvency, interest rates would be equalized, and
repayment would equal total existing debt (plus the corresponding

interest).
    Let   P      denote the price of good        z in period i,   where z    X,Y,
and i =   1,2;   and by   =1                  ) the   relative price in period i.

It is convenient to use good X as the nuineraire, normalizing                     to
                                                                              1

one.    We will assume that the future relative price of the two goods

is constant, say            =    1.     The motivation is basically to
concentrate on the terms of trade effects in the first period, when

the flow of international resources is from the developed country to

the developingcountry.                 The budget constraints faced by the

developing country are:

                           *      *

constraint puts a separate restriction on the debtor country in period

one, namely that the debtor country cannot borrow beyond the exogenous

limit    B.       This restriction is represented by equation (4).

       Similarly, the budget constraints faced by the developed economy

     In this sub—section, we will discuss the existence of contracts

that could make an increase in lending attractive to both debtors and
creditors.       We assume that negotiations may take place over the value
of two parameters:           and       x   that is, over the proportion of new

lending that is devoted to investment and over the proportion of the
increase in debtor country's GDP that will be paid back to creditors.
We will identify values of                     and x for which both the debtor and the

creditor countries will find it worthwhile to engage in increased

lending.     In the presence of risk of debt repudiation, there are

reasons to believe that the optimal contract may not be implemented by

a competitive banking system.                       Consequently, it may be useful to

identify conditions under which policy actions can lead to such

contracts.

     Let   us assume that          utility functions of the representative
consumer in the developing and the developed countries are given by:



            U
             *    * *    *   *     — u     *    *    *   +
                                                               *    *
                                                             pu (X2,Y2)
                                                                              *
                                                                                  (7)
                 (X1,Y1,X2,Y2)                 (X1Y1)


                                   —                     ÷                        (8)
             U(X1,Y1,X2,Y2)                u(X1,Y1)          pu(X2Y2)




                                               13
     We can obtain the welfare effects on the creditor and debtor
economies derived from increased lending by differentiating                      (7) and

(8), and    making use of the standard optinality conditions on the
marginal rates of substitution, and of the budget constraints                     (the

detailed derivation is presented in the Appendix):




             dE
                          -       -
                                  dB
                                        +            +   f(l-)m
                                                           l+r
                                                                          (9)




     The first term in (9) measures the welfare consequences of the

change in the terms of trade, given by the volume of exports                           =
                                                                                 (Y1
—
    1)   times the improvement in the terms of trade.               The other terms
reflect the increase in consumption.                 Consumption goes up in period
one by 1—a, and in period two by m(l-x).                   The second-period    increase

in consumption stems from an increase in output equal to                  m, with       a

fraction x of that increase being paid back to the developed

countries.

     The same procedure applied to the developed economy leads to:



                              —        —     -   1   +
                                                         —4--
                                                          +r              (10)
                  dE   'l,X             dB


     Equation     (10) shows that      welfare in the developed countries

changes in proportion to the amount of imports due to the terms of
trade effect, decreases due to the direct drop in wealth resultant
from the transfer, and increases due to the increase in repayment from
the developing nation in the second period.




                                       14
2.    The Existence of Pareto—Improving Contracts


       The international capital market setup is one in which the debtor

country cannot service its obligations in full (or cannot be forced

to>.       Its creditors nay nevertheless be willing to provide additional

resources, perhaps as a defensive strategy for previously contracted

loans (Krugman (1987)).                 In this context, we assume that debtors and

creditors bargain over the conditionality attached to any additional

lending.      This conditionality is summarized by the two parameters                   (fi

                                                                   10
and x) that determine investment and repayment.

       We will now try to identify the range of values of the parameters

x   arid    for which both blocks of nations could benefit from increased

resource transfers to the developing nations.                      We will call this

region the region of Pareto—improving contracts.                        A   region of

Pareto—improving      contracts will exist if additional lending increases

the world's total welfare.                 We can compute the global change in world
welfare generated by an increase in international lending by adding up

the welfare changes in each block, equations (17) and (18):


                        -   r               +          —
                                                                                (11)
                                *                          iJ
                   (l+r)(1+r        )            1+r



       The first term measures the consequences of shifting resources

from developed to developing nations.                  It is proportional to the

interest rate differential, and to the marginal investment rate in the

developing nations (a).                 This corresponds to     the fact that resources

are being transfered from a low to               a high     interest rate country, where

more productive investment projects exist.                      The second term measures

the potential distortion in the capital markets of the developing



                                            15
nations.    In the absence of distortions——other than the international

credit market situation——this term is zero, because investors will

equate the marginal product of capital (m) to the interest rate

(l+r*)     In the presence of distortions, the term in brackets is a

measure of the distortion wedge, and the change in welfare is

proportional to the distortion times the change in the distorted

activity   (fi)   Note that the overall change in world welfare is

proportional to the marginal investment rate in the developing

country.    If no new investment is triggered by the transfer there are

no aggregate wealth changes.

     We start our analysis considering the limiting case in which the
two goods are perfect substitutes (dQ/dB =           0),   and we will later

evaluate the consequences of imperfect substitutability              on the region

of Pareto contracts.




3.   Pareto-Improving Contracts with Perfect Substitutability



     To obtain the region of Pareto—improving contracts we start by

tracing an indifference curve on the            ($,x) plane.   This curve is the

locus of the pairs of values of           and    for which the country is

indifferent with respect to (marginal) additional lending.              The curve

forms the boundary of the region where the country benefits from a

marginal increase in the resource transfer.             Applying the same
procedure to the two countries allows us to identify the conditions
under which the region of    (x,8) where        both countries will benefit from
resource transfer is not empty.

     The configurations of     and   fi   for   which the developing nations



                                16
are indifferent with respect to increasing credit in the margin are

obtained from (9):



                            —                                        (12)
                                  I       (1-x)
                                           l+r



      Equation   (12)   defines       he curve DD in Figure 1.   In Figure 1, a

point like   H   corresponds to a contract that increases the credit
available to the developing countries under the conditions that a

fraction      of the marginal credit is devoted to investment and that a

fraction xH of the increase in future output is paid to the developed

countries. All points to the southwest of DD form the region for

which the developing countries benefit from an increase in the
resource transfer.12       Therefore, as long as 0 < x,,8        1, the
developing countries benefit for all possible contracts.3
      The parallel condition for developed countries is given by:


                                      —                              (13)


      This condition defines curve CC (Figure 1), drawn for the case in

which the marginal productivity of investment in the developing

nations exceeds the interest rate in the developed nations.                 All

points to the northeast of CC form the region for which the developed
countries will benefit from an increase in resource transfer.                 The

interpretation of (13) is straightforward.            An increase in lending in

period one of one dollar generates an increase in payoff in period two
of   mx.   That implicit rate of return is compared to the domestic rate

r to determine the convenience of increasing lending.




                                          17
     The area between the two curves in Figure 1 defines the Pareto

contracts.     The condition that guarantees the existence of

Paretoimproving contracts is that the marginal productivity of
capital in the developing countries exceeds that in the developed

countries.     The greater is the excess of the marginal productivity of

capital, the greater is the area of Pareto contracts.
     There is a strong presumption that this condition for the
existence of Paretoimproving contracts is indeed satisfied in the

real world, because interest rates in heaviiyindebted countries tend

to be much higher than in creditor countries, and presumably the

divergence of the marginal product of capital with respect to the

interest rate is not so large,      However, also in a real world
situation, the marginal resource transfer will not occur in the
absence of proper incentives or of conditionality on the debtor

country to satisfy the terms (,x) of the contract.




4.   Pareto-Improving Contracts with Imperfect Substitutability


     Under limited goods substitutability, an increase in the resource
transfer will have some impact on terms of trade.     In the next

section, we develop a model that determines the terms of trade effect

explicitely.    In the meantime, an approximate analysis can be made

using only information on the sign of dQ/dB.14
     From (9) and (10) we obtain the new boundaries of the sets of

contracts that are advantageous to the debtor and the creditor

country, respectively:




                               18
                             1 +
                        —                                           (14)
                                   m(l-X)
                             1           *
                                    1+r



                             I +
                        —          Y1——                             (15)
                                   1+r



    Consider first the case in which -l         <   dQ/dB < 0.   Both the CC and

DD curves shift towards the origin.          The set of contracts for which

developing countries are willing to receive additional resources is in
fact smaller.    Some contracts in the upper-left part of the unit

square are no longer beneficial because the welfare effect of the

terms of trade deterioration offsets the additional consumption

possibilities generated by the increased lending.             In contrast, the

set of contracts for which developed nations are willing to increase

lending is now larger, because the existence of a relative price
effect is favorable to the developed countries.

    We conclude that a deterioration in the terms of trade of

developing countries has the consequence of shifting the location of
the Pareto region leftwards and downwards.            This means that the

developed countries may obtain "softer conditionality terms, because
part of the economic repayment is implemented via terms of trade

adjustment.     This effect would be larger the lower is the

substitutability between the two goods.             It is noteworthy that from

the point of view of the banking system the curve CC continues to be

the relevant contract indifference curve.             This has the potential

consequence that at the negotiation process the interests of the

banking system may diverge from those of the other parties.                There




                                   19
exist some contracts that are Pareto-improving but are associated with

losses to the banking system.        This possibility suggests an important

role in the process for policy actions to provide international banks

with the proper incentives needed to implement such contracts.
     Consider now the case of dQ/dB positive.       Both the CC and PD

curves will shift outwards.     The developing countries will now be

willing to accept some contracts that produce a negative payoff when
evaluated at the domestic interest rate, because the terms of trade

improvement more than compensate for that,        From the point of view of

creditor countries, however, the set of beneficial contracts is now
smaller,   This would be a situation in which the creditor country
would attempt to regulate banks in order to restrain them from

increasing lending under some contracts that generate profits for the
banks but make the creditor country worse off.

     Consequently, the impact of endogenous terms of trade is
determined by the direction of the terms of trade adjustment to the

marginal increase in credit.     We now turn to study the factors

determining the sign of dQ/dB.




5.   A Model Linking Terms of Trade to International Lending



     The framework of lending and investment is as described above,
and the budget constraints    (3) to (6) apply.    We assume that the
demand structure in the developed nation can be summarized byJ5




                                20
                          —                                                      (16)
                 X1           Eg(Q); '1                E1(l.g(Q))
                          —                       —                              (17)
                               E2g(l);      Y2         E2(l-g(1))
                                       —                                         (18)
                                 E2         p(l+r)E1

where       is total expenditure in period i                    (E = X+ Q1Y).       The

function g(Q) determines the distribution of expenditure between the

two goods as a function of Lhe relative price.
    The demand functions for the developing world are entirely

symmetrical.     However, we assume that each country may consume a

larger proportion of the domestically produced good.                       This can be

represented by:


                      —                           —                              (19)
                              Eag(Q);      QYj         E(1-ag(Q))
                                                  —
                              E2ag(1);      Y2        E2(1-ag(1))                (20)

                                E2         p(1+r*)E                              (21)



where a <   1. The parameter a               measures the domestic bias in

consumption.16    To simplify further, it is useful to consider the

special case in which the g functions are given by:17



                              g(Q)    —
                                           hQa        h< 1                       (22)


    Therefore, a is equal to the elasticity of demand with respect to
the relative price of the two goods.

    Regarding investment demand, we assume an assymetric structure.
In the creditor country, there exists a linear technology that

transforms investment into output dX/dI =                       1+r, r being   a technological

constant.18    Therefore, in the creditor country, investment is the




                                             21
variable that adjusts to support the savings/investment/current
account balance.         By contrast, in the debtor country, investment is
determined by the economic authority, as explained above.




6.   Adjustment to an Increase in Net Borrowing


     Given the demand and supply structure detailed above, the

equilibrium of the system can be represented in the following way.                                        In

period one, with the credit constraint binding, consumption in the
debtor country cannot exceed the exogenous limit     + B — 1*. The
                                                 QY1
domestic interest rate adjusts to obtain that level of consumption.
The distribution of consumption across goods is given by (19) and

(20).   In the developed economy, consumption is set according to the

level of wealth but, given the exogeneity of B, the investment level I

has to adjust to satisfy the first-period budget constraint.                                      This is

of no consequence, because of the linear technology.                                    Market—clearing
in the first period is then given by:



                   +   B -
                             Iy)a(Q)
                                        +        - B -                   +   I+I           (23)



            -          + B   -                   +         -   B   -
                                                                                           (24)
      QY1       [QY1             I*](l.ag(Q))        {x1               I](1.g(Q))

     In the second period, there is effectively only one good, since

supply can costlessly accomodate any combination of                                 X   and Y.    Then,
there is only an income/expenditure equilibrium condition in each

country.    Given the credit constraints, second period consumption,
which is determinedaccording to the intertemporal conditions                                       (18) and




                                            22

    Equilibrium can then be represented by equations (23), (or (24)),

(27), and (28)        These equilibrium conditions determine the value of

the following endogenous variables: the first period terms of trade,

the interest rate in the developing countries, and investment in the
                         *
developed countries (Q, r , and I). The levels of net borrowing B,
and of investment by the debtor country 1* are exogenously determined

in the debt negotiation process.

    Suppose now that the developed nations initiate a marginal
increase in the available credit (dB >                               0),      and let us evaluate the

normative and positive aspects of the adjustment to such an increase

in lending.    The response of the terms of trade to the increase in

lending, evaluated at Q                1, is equal               to:19

       Consider        the case of a           = 1.20            The homothesticity of utilities

and the absence of a local habitat effect imply that wealth increases
or welath redistributions will not affect the relative price                                         Q
Therefore, the change in investment in the two countries will

detennine the change in tenns of trade,                                From   (30)       it can be seen
                                      *
that   the change in              I       is given by         , while the      change in I is a
one—for—one fall with the increases in lending and in consumption,
where the latter is proportional to the change in wealth in the

creditor country: —l +
       Note that        (30) implies that,                    when xTn/(l+r) =       I   (which defines

curve   CC, i.e. the lower                  bound of contracts acceptable to the creditor
when terms of trade do not change), for                                = 1    there is no change in

aggregate investment and thus in Q, for                                 <   1 aggregate investment and

Q   fall, and for        fi   >   1,      aggregate investment and Q increase,                   This

means that only when investment in the debtor country increases more
than one for one with increases in borrowing will terms of trade turn

in favor of the creditor country.

       We cam now use             (14),      (15),          and (29) to determine the region of

Pareto—improving contracts.                            The new boundary for the creditor country
is defined by:




                                                       24

              —i-;—              cl(l+p) J


     This means that with           imperfect substitutability                    (Q < C.'),   the
curve CC rotates to a position like C'C' (see Figure 2).                               For values of

 <   1, the terms of trade move                  in favor of the debtor economy, and

this fact excludes some contracts that would be beneficial without the

relative price change.            Note that, for                  <    1,   there is now     a region

(labeled region A) of contracts that are profitable for banks (whose

relevant cut-off continues to be still CC), but not for the
                                                       = 1 the two
representative consumer in the creditor country. At fi
curves overlap because, as can be seen from (29), there would be no

change in terms     of    trade.         For values of            fi   > 1, the terms of trade
                                                                 in
change in favor of the developed economy, and a typical consumer
the developed economy would benefit from contracts that are not

acceptable to banks, such as those in region B.21

     Therefore, accounting for imperfect substitutability between
                                                             under
goods produced by different countries changes the conditions
which a beneficial increase in lending may exist and creates a

divergence of opinion between international banks and a representative
consumer in the creditor country.                            In the context of the present

model, this divergence of opinion can be summarized in the following

way: for contracts with flsofterlt investment conditionality                                   (   <   1),
banks   are more likely to find opportunities for increased lending, but

the creditor country will find convenient contracts with "harder"

                                             > 1) and smaller repayment                        that
investment conditionality                (                                             (x)


actually produce losses to creditor banks.




                                             25
7.   An Alternative Framework 22



     The model above assumed that debtors and creditors negotiate over

the addition to investment () and to repayment (x) that should be

attached to an increase in lending.         Such framework appears to be in
line with observed behavior in the recent rescheduling negotiations.

Often in those negotiations, some conditionality on the debtor

country's policies——usually   within the framework of       a   Fund-supported

program——is part of the agreement.         In the model this policy

conditionality is represented as       a   certain value for the composition

of spending, that is, the value of the parameter        . In    addition,

negotiations determine how much is paid and how much is rescheduled, a
decision that is highly dependent on the economic performance of the
debtor. In the model, this is represented by the parameter x•

     It can be argued, however, that negotiating over (8,) is not the

best policy for the creditor.        The creditor could leave the investment

decision entirely up to the debtor, which (in the absence of
distortions in the debtor economy) would maximize second—period output

if the proper incentives are in place.         In order to provide such

proper incentives, repayment should be agreed as a fixed amount,
because then the debtor can keep the return to any increase in

investment that it achieves.23

     The alternative framework for negotiations would therefore not
attach policy conditionality to the increased lending.           In the absence

of domestic distortions, investment in the debtor economy would
therefore be determined by equating the marginal product of capital to



                                26
the domestic interest rate r*.                  The new contract being negotiated
would simply determine the marginal repayment that will follow the

increase in lending, which we will denominate                             Z     That is, Z is

defined by:



                                 Z   —                                                 (32)
                                               d8



    The equilibrium of this system is essentially the same as the one

above.    It is still represented by equations (23), (27), and (28), but

now the effect of an increase in lending has to consider (32) and that

investment in the debtor economy will be                          given   by:



                        dY2                              *
                                     s              l--r                               (33)
                        dl




                                           -        <0                                 (34)


where m    m(I*)   The effect on terms of trade of an increase in

lending can now be computed:



   --          [r[(1h)()                   +
                                               h(la)) {p(l÷r*)+z}]
                                                             -
                                                                                       (35)




where:


                                       * -
                    —   cr + l-ah
                             —i-- p(l+r )Y1                      >   0



                             (l+r*)(l+p)            -            < 0




                                           27
and n   is as   defined under equation (29).   It can be shown that     is

positive for all relevant values of a.
    The region of Pareto—improving contracts can now be determined.

This region only refers to values of Z.        If there are no changes in

terms of trade, it is clear that the creditors would not accept any

contract unless it sets     Z >   l+r, and debtors would not accept any
contract unless it sets     Z <   l+r*. As before, r* > r is the necessary
condition for the existence of a non—empty Pareto—improving region.
In Figure 3 we plot the region of Pareto—improving contracts as a

function of a, which represents the degree of substitutability        between

the two goods.      In the limit, as a goes to infinity and the two goods

are perfect substitutes, there is no terms of trade effect, and the

Pareto region is as described above.       In contrast, for finite values

of a, creditor countries require a value of Z exceeding l+r to engage

in further lending, and debtor countries accept a value of Z higher
        *
than l+r , because the terms of trade effect benefits the debtor
country.
    These results qualify the conclusions from the previous

framework, in the sense that if investment is done in an optimal
manner in the debtor country and debt negotiations provide the correct

incentives to achieve such investment, there are no contracts that the

creditor country would be willing to engage in that would not be
achieved by a decentralized banking system.        But, in addition, there

is a set of contracts under which the decentralized banking system

would engage in further borrowing that are not optimal from the point
of view of the representative consumer in the creditor economy.

Ultimately, the relevance of this and the previous framework depends
on an explicit account of the reasons for credit rationing and



                                   28
under—investment.      We suspect that the existence of defensive lending,

different time horizons between governments and the private sector,

distorted capital markets, and asymmetric information make the

conclusions of the former framework the more relevant ones.




                       IV.   Concluding Remarks



    This    paper   studied the conditions under which renewed lending to

heavily—indebted      countries could be advantageous for both creditor and

debtor countries.      In dealing with the debt overhang issue it is

usefui to   distinguish between     tne redistributive versus the efficiency

issues.    The purpose of our analysis was to highlight the potential

efficiency losses emerging from the drop in investment in the
developing countries due to the presence of credit rationing, and to

investigate mechanisms to revitalize tne investment process.          The

analysis focused on the case where there are two dimensions for the

conditionality:      the determination of the marginal propensityto

invest out of the new funds and of the marginal propensity to repay

out of future output.        We demonstrated the potential trade of f between

these two dimensions and pointed out that endogenous terms of trade

adjustment gives greater weight to investment conditionality.          We now

close the paper with some interpretive comments regarding

qualifications and extensions.
    Our discussion demonstrated that (in the absence of strict

investment conditionality) renewed lending to developing countries

tends to be associated with an improvement in the terms of trade of

the developing countries and vice versa.          This is consistent with the




                                   29
terms of trade deterioration observed in recent years.      In the

eighties, there was a switch from a regime that transferred resources
to the developing countries to    a   regime that transfers resources from
the developing countries.     The importance of the terms of trade

adjustment stems from the observation that it has first-order welfare
effects on the consumers in the creditor and debtor nations, despite

the fact that it is not internalized by the private banking system.

    There are some qualifications to our results in this paper.        The

framework developed in the paper considers debt and credit rationing

at the global level.     Even if each indebted country has limited market

power in its products, the group of indebted countries as a whole has

significant market power.     Because most indebted countries are facing

presently similar constraints, we have used an aggregate version of a
two-block world--creditors    and debtors.    However, if it is only the

collective response of debtor countries that is large enough to

produce terms of trade changes, individual debtor countries would not
be willing to accept a less favorable contract in consideration of the

terms of trade effect.     If this is the case, the set of contracts

acceptable to debtors is not changed by the existence of a terms of
trade effect of increased lending.      Another qualification is that it
is not entirely clear that the decisions of economic authorities are

consistent with the representative consumer's interest when it comes

to issues such as terms of trade changes.      It appears that the

protection of import-competing industries in industrial countries may
be, in fact,   more important for the authorities.
    This last point suggests an interesting extension to the present
framework.   Some consistency is required between the conditionality

attached to renewed credit and commercial policies adopted in the two




                                30
blocks of countries, particularly in the creditor countries.   Even in

the absence of renewed lending, repayment of past loans will require

Consistent commercial policy (i.e., intensive application of quotas

may defeat any sincere attempt for debt repayment).   This suggests
that the incorporation of commercial policy actions to the policies

considered in the debt negotiation process could have important

implications for the design of mutually advantageous debt contracts.

    Note that Y2+ X = Y2— R, because of the credit constraint, which
means that the change in the interest rate in the developing nations
(r*   )       does not generate a direct wealth effect.                                                  In fact, neither the

domestic nor the foreign interest rate affect wealth of the debtor

country.               This is a consequence of the credit rationing/insolvency

situation.                   Because of credit rationing, the country as a whole does

not have a net position on assets carrying the domestic interest rate

r*
   , and because of insolvency, repayments R are
                                                 not linked to interes'

rates.             With "normal', fully—integrated capital markets, an increase
in the world                 interest rate                reduces the borrower's wealth by the change

in the interest rate times the external indebtedness position.                                                            The

credit rationing and insolvency situation truncates this channel,

because it de—links debt service from the world interest rate.

          Finally, from (a6) and (a8), and making use of our assumptions

regarding marginal investment and repayment rates in the debtor
country, we obtain expression (9) in the paper, and an entirely

tnat the   variable r                    can be determined after the rest of the system is

solved.    The role of r* is only to ensure that spending in the debtor

economy, E1 is equal                     to the            resources avaiable in the first period,

and only the level of                           matters for the rest of the equilibrium.

1   For an analysis of country risk see for example, Harberger (1976),

Kharas (1981), Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), Sachs (1984), Kletzer

(1984)     ,   Cohen and Sachs    (1985)   ,   Dornbusch (1985), Krugman   (1985)

Smith and Cuddington (1985), Edwards (1985), Folkerts-Landau                  (1985),
Dooley         (1986), Aizenman (1986), Bulow and Rogoff (1986)       ,   Aizenman
(1987), Helpman (1987), and Borensztein and Ghosh (1988).

2   The literature on "solutions" to the debt situation is also quite

impressive.         Important studies that summarize advantages and

disadvantages of existing proposals include: Krugman (1985), Dornbusch

(1987),        Fischer (1987), Feldstein at al (1987), and Bergsten et al
(1985)
3   That       is, as   much as it is necessary to equate the domestic interest
rate to the international rate.

4   The link between real commodity prices and debt service is

suggested in Feldstein et al (1987).

5   An extensive analysis of this market structure in the context of
international trade can be found in Helpman and Erugman (1985).

6   Alternatively, the differentiation could arise from reputational or

learning problems.

7   This range is taken from the survey included in Marquez and

McNeilly        (1987)

8   The estimates reported by Khan and Knight (1988) also lie between 1

and   2.




                                       36
9    This would be consistent with an environment where there exists a

technology in period two that costlessly transforms good                     Y into good        X
at a fixed rate (say one)   .   The existence of credit rationing would
prevent the exploitation of arbitrage opportunities.                The assumption

is also consistent with the idea that the second period represents a

long—run position in the context of constant returns to scale and

perfect competition.

10   We abstract from monitoring problems, assuming that contract
conditions are perfectly enforceable.

11   Note that the consequence of credit rationing is 'under—investment'
in the developing nations relative to the first best.                The distortion

wedge is measured by the interest rate differential.                The change in

welfare is the result of multiplying the distortion by the change in
the distorted activity.
                                              *
12   In fact, this requires (l-x)m/(l±r           )   < 1, which we assume to hold
in the   relevant range.   It will always hold if, for example,                 m   =   l±r *
13   But contracts with (,x) outside the unit square are also possible,

and some of them benefit the debtor country.

14   This analysis is not fully correct because dQ/dB will itself depend

on the parameters$   and x.

15   An example of a utility function that generates this type of demand

function is:

                            xl__       yl_Y
     U(X1,Y1,X2,Y2) =              +          +                +
                        ln[_I_                        in[_1        1-7   }




                                 37
16   The case of a = 1 corresponds to the case where there is no 'local

habitat', and the demand functions are the same in both countries. The
case of a <   I    corresponds to the case where each country prefers its
own good.

17   We assume that the range of values of        Q   is such that hg(Q) < 1

always.

18   This linear technology serves the purpose of isolating

intertemporal marginal rates of substitution in the developed economy
from   feedback    from international lending to the developing world,

Our analysis can be extended to the case where r is endogenously

determined, without affecting the logic of our discussion.

19   The derivation is contained in the Appendix.

20   Note that, for    a <   I,   in the absence of new investment we get an

improvement in the terms of trade of developing countries due to the
"local habitat" effect.           This is in line with the classical transfer

criterion (for analysis using transfer considerations see Frenkel and

Razin (1987) and van Wijnbergen (1988)). Note also that, with a

unitary marginal investment ( = 1), the terms of trade adjustment is

independent of any local habitat effect.

21   The closer substitutes goods X and Y are, the smaller the terms of

trade change that would occur, and the smaller the shift in the CC
curve.    This    can be seen from equation (32), where the elasticity of

substitution is positivaly associated with c.            Also, the larger the
local habitat effect (smaller a) the larger the impact of the terms of

trade change on the Pareto region (i.e. the larger the shift in Cc).

22   We thank Elhanan Helpman and Assaf Razin for   coirurtents   that led to
this section.

23  In fact, the optimal policy for the creditor is dependent on the

nature of uncertainty in the model, and on the
                                                Possibleexistence of
asymmetric information, as the results in Krugman (1987) and Froot,
Sharfstein and Stein (1988) show.
