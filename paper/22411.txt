                                        ABSTRACT

We examine how a 16-week cut in potential unemployment insurance (UI) duration in Missouri
affected search behavior of UI recipients and the aggregate labor market. Using a regression
discontinuity design (RDD), we estimate a marginal effect of maximum duration on UI and
nonemployment spells of approximately 0.5 and 0.3 respectively. We use RDD estimates to
simulate the unemployment rate assuming no market-level externalities. The simulated response
closely approximates the estimated change in the unemployment rate following the benefit cut,
suggesting that even in a period of high unemployment the labor market absorbed this influx of
workers without crowding-out other jobseekers.

I. INTRODUCTION

         How do recipients respond to the maximum duration of unemployment insurance (UI)

benefits, and how do these responses affect the broader labor market? These questions are

important for the analysis of UI programs, and relevant for understanding the performance of

labor markets over the business cycle. A large literature has estimated the relationship between

maximum UI duration and the behavior of UI recipients, and it has been hypothesized that

extended benefits may have contributed to the trend of slow job market recoveries (Mitman and

Rabinovich 2014). However, evidence on the relationship between potential UI duration and

labor market ourtcomes, especially after the mid-1990’s in the United States is thin. An

additional consideration for evaluating how UI extensions affect the labor market is that the

aggregate effects of these policies may differ from those implied by the micro response if there

are general equilibrium effects or spillovers, as would be the case if search among UI recipients

crowded out other jobseekers. With a few notable exceptions (Levine 1993, Valleta 2014 and

Lalive, Landais, and Zweimuller 2015) we know relatively little about the relationship between

the micro and macro responses to UI extensions. 1

         In this paper we study the micro and macro effects of a large cut in benefit duration

Missouri that occurred in 2011 using newly available administrative data and regression


1
  Levine (1993) estimates the relationship between state and year variation in UI replacement rates and
unemployment durations for uninsured workers. Using data from the CPS and NLYS for 1979-1987 he finds
evidence of displacement. Valleta (2014) uses linked CPS data to examine the relationship between potential benefit
duration by state and exit to unemployment for workers who are likely UI ineligible. On average he finds no
relationship, but he finds that ineligible workers in higher unemployment states have higher exit rates when potential
duration is higher. Lalive et al. (2013) find evidence of displacement by comparing regions in Austria with longer
and shorter potential duration for older workers. Kroft and Notowidigdo (2015) conclude that there is potential
crowding out during recessions using variation in benefit levels across states and over time. There is also a literature
testing for externalities from job search assistance programs in Western Europe. These include Blundell et al.
(2004), Crépon et al. (2013), Ferracci, Jolivet, and van den Berg (2010), and Gautier, Muller, van der Klaauw,
Rosholm, and Svarer (2012). Davidson and Woodbury (1993) consider displacement effects from reemployment
bonuses in the United States. General equilibrium estimates in Hagedorn, Karahan, Manovskii, and Mitman (2013),
Hagedorn, Manovskii, and Mitman (2015), and Marinescu (2014) are also related to tests for the presence of
externalities.

discontinuity and differences-in-differences designs. Following the 2007-2009 recession, eight

US states reduced regular UI durations, partly in response to diminished reserves in state UI trust

funds as well as a changing political environment. While there is a precedent for cutting UI

benefit levels, to our knowledge this was the first time states cut maximum UI benefit durations.

These eight states (Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, North Carolina, Missouri, Michigan, and

South Carolina) cut the duration of UI benefits to below 26 weeks of maximum benefits, which

had been the standard maximum level in place for over half a century. 2

        We examine the effect of potential UI benefit duration on the duration of UI receipt,

reemployment, wages, and the unemployment rate by examining the cut in UI benefit weeks

implemented in Missouri in April 2011. This reduction, which occurred while Emergency

Unemployment Compensation (EUC) was in effect, resulted in dislocated workers receiving up

to 16 fewer weeks of UI eligibility than they would have received if they had applied

previously. 3 The policy change was sudden and unanticipated; only five days passed between

when the legislation was first proposed and when the law applied to UI claimants. 4 The timing

was such that there was almost no opportunity for claimants to shift the timing of their claims.

        We use rich unemployment insurance administrative data and wage records from

Missouri and a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to estimate the effects of this policy,

where the running variable is calendar time and the threshold of interest is the exact week the

law was enacted. 5 The administrative data we use not only allows us to measure UI receipt, but




2
  In 2010 all states had a maximum duration of benefit eligibility of at least 26 weeks.
3
  Specifically, the maximum UI duration was cut by 16 weeks for UI recipients previously eligible for 26 weeks of
regular state UI and eligible to participate in the EUC program.
4
  The legislation was a compromise aimed at breaking a Republican filibuster in the Missouri State Senate.
5
  More precisely, this is an interrupted time-series design, but we use RDD methods and for convenience refer to the
design as a RDD throughout.


                                                         3
also re-entry into employment and wages which has not been possible in the vast majority of

papers investigating UI in the United States, particularly in the post-2000 period.

       Our findings indicate economically and statistically significant higher rates of exit from

UI for claimants subject to the shorter benefit duration relative to claimants with the longer

duration at the cutoff, resulting in an estimated sensitivity of unemployment duration to potential

UI duration that is at the upper end of the literature. As found in Card, Chetty, and Weber (2007),

Schmieder, von Wachter, and Bender (2012), and Le Barbanchon (2012), we find evidence that

some UI recipients are forward-looking. For example, UI recipients subject to the benefit cuts

had 57 weeks of eligibility, but were 12 percentage points less likely to be receiving UI by week

20 of their spell, from a base of 46 percent. We estimate that a one-month reduction of UI

duration reduces the duration of UI receipt by 15 days, on average, and that approximately 54

percent of this change is through changes in exit rates occurring prior to benefit exhaustion.

       Analysis of earnings records for the universe of legally employed Missouri workers

indicate that those exiting early from UI largely enter employment. The estimates imply that a

one-month cut in potential duration resulted in a reduction of nonemployment duration of

approximately 10 days. The findings suggest that the benefit cut increased job search intensity.

However, we find more limited effects of shorter benefit durations on the UI exit hazard rate

after 20 weeks of UI, and for the long-term unemployed we find no evidence that lower potential

duration leads to higher employment rates after exhaustion.

       As in Card, Chetty, and Weber (2007), we find no significant differences in the average

quarterly earnings for the first job of recipients, conditional on employment relative to the

comparison group, suggesting that those induced to exit unemployment earlier are not penalized

with lower wages.




                                                 4
       The effects of extended UI on other job seekers is theoretically ambiguous. If there is job

rationing, which can arise in search models with diminishing returns to labor and sticky wages

(Michaillat 2012), increased search effort leads to negative externalities on other workers.

However, there are no externalities in models with constant marginal returns to labor and

perfectly elastic labor demand (Landais, Michaillat, and Saez 2010; Hall 2005). In models of

Nash bargaining (such as Pissarides 2000) the macro elasticity of UI benefits is larger than the

micro elasticity as a result of the “wage externality”.

       To assess spillovers, we calculate the change in the predicted path of the unemployment

rate from the policy, using the shift in the survivor function estimated from the RDD, and the

flow of initial UI claims. In the simulation we assume that jobseekers not affected by the UI cut

are not displaced from employment by UI recipients who were exposed to the policy, or other

spillovers. We compare this predicted path to the actual path of the unemployment rate from a

difference-in-difference (DiD) estimate of the cut. We find that the simulated and estimated

paths of the macro effect closely match. The predicted and estimated paths are approximately the

same in levels, and follow a similar kinked pattern, peaking at approximately a one percentage

point drop in the state unemployment rate. This effect was driven by the change in the number of

unemployed. The analysis suggests the labor market absorbed jobseekers without displacement,

even though the unemployment rate was high at the time of the cut at 8.6 percent. The findings

are more consistent with a labor market characterized by a flat labor demand curve in the

framework of Landais, Michaillat, and Saez (2010).

       Our study also speaks to the question of the labor market effects of UI extensions during

the Great Recession. During this period, UI benefits increased from the near-universal length of

26 weeks to up to 99 weeks in some states. Subsequently, declining unemployment led to




                                                  5
reductions in extended benefits, and benefit duration largely returned to pre-recession levels

following the expiration of the EUC program in December 2013. The labor market effects from

these changes in benefit duration are a central question for labor market policy and have been the

focus of a number of studies. Notably, recent papers studying this period in the United States

have used state level variation in benefit lengths to estimate the effects of increases and

decreases in UI potential duration over the 2007 recession period and its aftermath. The findings

from these studies are mixed. Rothstein (2011), Farber and Valleta (2013), and Farber, Rothstein,

and Valleta (2015) find limited effects of the UI extensions on job finding rates. Hagedorn et al.

(2013) find small effects on jobseekers, but large macro effects on wages, job vacancies, labor

force participation and employment. Hagedorn et al. (2015) provide evidence of possibly very

large effects of cuts in UI duration in 2013 on unemployment. Our paper contributes to this

literature by using a design-based approach with administrative micro data covering UI receipt,

employment, and wages to study the labor market effects of changes in maximum duration in

this period. While we find little evidence of moral hazard for the long-term unemployed who

exhaust their benefits, we identify a fairly large response to the benefit cut for a subset of

participants earlier in the spell.


II. INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND

        In the United States, UI is administered by state governments but is overseen and

regulated by the federal government. Before 2011, eligible laid-off workers received up to 26

weeks of regular unemployment insurance benefits if they were not reemployed before their

benefits were exhausted. During periods of unusually high unemployment, state and federal

governments have extended potential benefit duration, to support the long-term unemployed after

regular benefits are exhausted. In the 2007-2009 recession, two programs provided these



                                                6
extended benefits: the Extended Benefit (EB) program and the Emergency Unemployment

Compensation (EUC) program.

         EB is a permanent program that provides extended benefits in states with high

unemployment to unemployed workers who exhaust their regular state benefits. Until recently,

the federal government split the cost of EB with state governments. Through the Recovery Act

passed in February 2009, Congress temporarily suspended cost sharing and the federal

government bore all the cost of EB through December 2013. EB extended benefits are triggered

as a function of a state’s total and insured unemployment rate, and triggering thresholds vary by

state. When the federal government took on all of the costs of EB, Missouri temporarily enacted

legislation to implement an additional trigger that would increase EB duration from 13 to 20

weeks. 6

         Congress occasionally extends unemployment duration through federal legislation when

unemployment is high. During the period of the 2007-2009 recession, the EUC program was

active from June 2008 through December 2013. In the version in place at the time of the

Missouri policy change, federal benefits provided longer extensions for states with higher rates

of insured unemployment. 7

         The benefit cut in Missouri was the byproduct of a Republican filibuster, led by four

lawmakers in the Missouri State Senate who objected to legislation that would accept federal

money to extend UI benefits under the EB program. The bill would have allowed for the

6
  If the total unemployment rate (TUR) was at least 8 percent and 110 percent of the TUR for the same 3-month
period in either of the two previous years, the duration of EB would increase from 13 to 20 weeks
(http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1466).
7
  At that time EUC had four “tiers”: tier 1 = 20 additional weeks, tier 2 = 14 additional weeks, tier 3 = 13 additional
weeks, and tier 4 = 6 additional weeks. To move into a new tier recipieints had to exhaust the previous tier and the
next tier had to be available to state residents. The availability of tiers depended on whether the three month average
of the seasonally adjusted state unemployment rate exceeded a threshold set for that tier. At the time of the policy
change Missouri recipients were eligible for all four tiers. However, recipients who claimed UI around the time of
the policy change in April 2011 were only ever able to claim the first three tiers because the state unemployment
rate fell below the tier 4 threshold in February 2012, prior to tier 3 exhaustion.


                                                          7
continuation of 20 additional weeks of benefits to unemployed workers who exhausted their

EUC and regular benefits at no cost to Missouri. 8 The extension had already passed the Missouri

State House by a margin of 123 to 14. The first news reports of the filibuster were on March 4,

2011 (Wing 2011). On April 6 a report indicated that the lawmakers had agreed to end their

filibuster, though the article did not specify terms (Associated Press 2011). On April 8 the St.

Louis Post Dispatch published the first article detailing the possible compromise. Under the

compromise, regular benefits would be cut from 26 to 20 weeks in exchange for Missouri

accepting federal dollars and maintaining EB benefits for the long-term unemployed (Young

2011). In effect, the agreement traded-off longer UI durations in the short run (for the long-term

unemployed) in exchange for shorter UI durations in the long run. We found no press reports

prior to April 8 regarding the possibility of cutting the duration of regular benefits as a possible

compromise for the filibuster. This legislation appears to have been unanticipated. On April 13

the Missouri House of Representatives passed the bill which Jay Nixon, the Democratic

governor, signed into law on the same day (Selway 2011). All new claims submitted after that

date were subject to the abbreviated benefits (Mannies 2011).

         Federal regulations calculate EUC weeks eligible in proportion to regular state UI

benefits. Thus, the cut in regular state UI benefits triggered an additional 10-week reduction in

EUC, and the maximum UI duration fell from 73 weeks for claimants approved by April 13, to

57 weeks for claimants approved afterwards resulting in a total change in potential duration of 16

weeks. EB did not materially affect new claimants at this time (with or without the benefit cut)

because EB phased out by the time they were eligible to receive these benefits.




8
 The lawmakers leading the filibuster argued that accepting these funds would increase the federal deficit
unnecessarily.


                                                         8
       The change in potential UI duration was the only change in Missouri’s UI system in the

legislation. We corresponded with Missouri UI program administrators who told us that there

were no changes in the administration of the program, including search requirements or

communications with UI recipients. For example, they did not send additional notices informing

UI recipients affected by the policy change.

       For convenience, we label recipients applying for UI after the policy change the

“treatment group” and recipients applying before the policy change the “control group.”


III. DATA

       Our analysis utilizes administrative data from the state of Missouri covering workers,

firms, and UI recipients from 2003 to 2013. We use three data files for the analysis. The first is a

worker-wage file detailing quarterly earnings for each worker with unique (but de-identified)

employee and employer IDs. The second is an unemployment claims file that contains the same

worker and employer IDs as the wage file. For each claim, we observe the date the claim was

filed, the weekly benefit amount, the maximum benefit amount over the entire claim, the dates

weekly benefits were issued, the wage history used to calculate benefits and duration, and the

benefit regime (i.e. regular benefits, EB, or EUC). For every claim, we link the records for

regular benefits, EB, and EUC claims to construct a single continuous history associated with

each claim. The third dataset reports a limited set of employer characteristics including detailed

industry categories. The raw data contains 1,635,993 initial UI claims over 2003-2013 and

184,191 in 2011. We remove claims ineligible for UI, including unemployed workers who were

fired for cause or quit voluntarily, observations with missing claim types (regular, EB, or EUC)

or missing base-period earnings, and EB or EUC claims that could not be traced to an initial

regular claim. To aid in interpreting the effects, we also limit the sample to those workers who,



                                                 9
based on their earnings histories, would have been eligible for the full 26 weeks of regular UI

benefits without the policy change. Specifically, the formula for maximum potential duration of

regular benefits is:

                                               𝐸𝐸        1
        Regular Potential Duration = min�𝑋𝑋, �3 � �𝐵𝐵��

where E is a measure of total base period earnings, B is the average weekly benefit, and X is 26

weeks on or before April 13, 2011 and 20 weeks after this date. Because we want to focus on
                                                                                              𝐸𝐸
workers who are affected by the cut in maximum duration we select recipients for whom         3𝐵𝐵
                                                                                                    ≥

26. This procedure does not induce any mechanical change in the characteristics of workers

across the policy change threshold. These “full eligibility” claimants represent 72 percent of all

claimants in 2011 and 67 percent of all claimants for the entire 2003-2013 period. After these

screens we have 1,064,652 claims over the 2003-2013 period and 127,710 claims in 2011.

        Descriptive statistics for the administrative data appear in Table 1. Column (1) reports

summary statistics for the full 2003-2011 period and column (2) for 2011. The average weekly

benefit in 2011 in the sample was $260. UI recipients eligible for the maximum benefit duration

had an average of 14.5 quarters of tenure in their previous employer and their earnings in the last

complete quarter of employment prior to collecting UI benefits was $8,259. Earnings in the first

complete quarter of employment after the UI spell average $7,240. On average, recipients

claiming benefits in 2011 received 29.3 weeks of unemployment benefits.

        For the aggregate analysis we use data from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics

(LAUS) program of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For outcomes we use the state-by-calendar

month unemployment rate, the natural log of number of unemployed, and the natural log of the

size of the labor force. We deseasonalize these variables by regressing each outcome on state ×

month dummies over the 2001-2005 period and then deviating each outcome in 2005-2013 from


                                                    10
the predicted value of this regression. We also use these variables derived from the Current

Population Survey (CPS) to assess robustness.


IV. EMPIRICAL DESIGN

        To identify the causal effect of longer UI duration, we utilize the discrete change in the

maximum UI duration resulting from a rapid and unexpected policy change: claimants who

applied just before April 13, 2011 were eligible for 73 weeks of benefits and those who applied

after were eligible for 57 weeks. We use this discontinuity to compare similar displaced workers

entering the same labor market who experienced very different UI benefit durations. This quasi-

experiment implicitly controls for labor-market conditions that may be affected by the reform.

        We model the outcome variable 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 as a continuous function of the running variable, the

claim week, and estimate the outcome discontinuity that occurs at the threshold, the date of the

policy change:

(1)                                𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 + 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 − 𝑥𝑥 ′ ) + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 ,

where 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 is the calendar week of the UI claim for person i, 𝑥𝑥 ′ is the week of the policy change,

and 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 equals one if worker i applied after the policy change and zero if she applied before. 9

Thus, 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 − 𝑥𝑥 ′ ) is a continuous function of the running variable which captures the continuous

relationship between the application date and the outcome of interest. Because we control

flexibly for the running variable, the model can accommodate smooth seasonal and secular

changes in the labor market, allowing for unbiased estimation of the effect of the discrete policy

change. To expand on this point, the unemployment rate in Missouri began to decline in the

months before the policy was enacted. If our model is correctly specified, a smooth improvement

in labor market conditions would be captured by the term 𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 − 𝑥𝑥 ′ ). A threat to validity would
9
 We use the claim week because the data can be sparse when using the claim application calendar date, and there
are days with no claims, such as administrative holidays and weekends.


                                                            11
be if there was a discrete change in the labor market from one week to the next at the time of the

policy.

          In practice we first collapse the data to the claim week level and weight the observations

by the number of claims in the week, a process that yields identical point estimates to the micro

data. As shown by Lee and Card (2008), heteroskedasticity-consistent inference with collapsed

data is asymptotically equivalent to clustering on the running variable. We estimate the model

using local linear regression (Hahn, Todd and Van der Klaauw 2001) with the Imbens and

Kalyanaraman (2012) (IK) optimal bandwidth and a triangular kernel. We consider a range of

alternative bandwidths to assess robustness, as well as estimation of a local quadratic using the

Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014) (CCT) optimal bandwidth.


V. RESULTS

          Diagnostics

          We begin by testing for manipulation of the running variable, which would occur if

claimants could strategically time their applications around the policy change. Figure 1 plots the

frequency distribution of the number of UI claims by week, over the 2009–2012 period. The

solid vertical line denotes the time of the policy change, and the dashed vertical lines denote the

same date in the previous years. It is evident in Figure 1 that there is a great deal of seasonality in

claims, with a large spike in claims around the new year. The policy change occurred after the

large seasonal increase, in April, and by this time claims were at moderate levels. There is no

visual evidence of an abnormal spike in claims before the policy change, as would be the case if

claimants could time their applications apply for longer-lasting UI benefits. Column 1 of Table 2

formally tests for a discontinuity in claims (McCrary 2008). Estimating a local quadratic model




                                                  12
to fit the curvature in the distribution, we find no significant discontinuity in the relative

frequency of claims. 10

           Inspection of the frequency distribution does reveal a moderate jump in claims two weeks

after the change in policy. As will be seen, this applicant cohort looks different in a number of

dimensions from recipients who applied before or after this group, and in particular they appear

to have characteristics correlated with being lower duration claimants. This outlier might be

random noise, or it might reflect a failed attempt to time claims to obtain UI before the cut. To

keep the analysis as transparent as possible, we keep this group in the main sample. However, we

have also estimated all models excluding this cohort. Estimates presented in the Online

Appendix show precise but somewhat smaller estimates on UI receipt and nonemployment when

this cohort is excluded.

           As a second examination of design validity, we test for discontinuities in pre-determined

covariates of UI applicants around the policy change. Because there are numerous predetermined

variables from which we can select, we construct an index of predicted log initial UI duration

using all covariates available in the data set following the same procedure as Card et al. (2015).

To construct the index, we regress log UI duration on a fourth-order polynomial of earnings in

the quarter preceding job loss, indicators for four-digit industry, and previous job tenure

quintiles. Figure 2 plots the mean values of the covariate index over 2009–2012 by claim week.

The continuity in the index around the threshold is borne out visually, and the RDD estimate of

this predicted value at the cutoff is small and statistically insignificant (column (2) of Table 2).

The lack of evidence of sorting and differences in pre-determined characteristics around the

threshold reinforces the claim that the policy change was unanticipated and difficult or

        Duration of UI Receipt

        Figure 3 exhibits the mean duration of realized UI spells by application week. There is a

clear drop in the number of weeks claimed as a function of the claim week. Column (1) of Panel

A in Table 3 shows that the benefit reduction of 16 weeks is associated with 8.7 fewer weeks of

UI benefits claimed (s.e. = 1.4), on average. Appendix Figure 2 shows the point-estimate

estimated over a range of alternative bandwidths. The estimate is stable for a wide range of

bandwidths, including bandwidths smaller than the IK bandwidth and up to twice as large as the

IK bandwidth. 12

        We evaluate the chances of estimating a coefficient as large as ours by implementing a

permutation test in which we estimate model (1) using every week outside of the winter holiday

season as a placebo treatment. 13 The procedure generates 443 placebo estimates, none of which

are larger than our RD estimate of the treatment week. The distribution of these placebo

estimates is shown in Figure 4. The estimate for the actual treatment week is denoted by the

vertical line, which is in the extreme left tail of the placebo distribution.

        To evaluate whether our estimates could be driven by seasonal changes, we hone in to the

estimated placebo discontinuities at the policy-change week in each of the other nine years for

which we have data. While our estimate in the treatment year is -8.7, the nine placebo estimates

range from -1.2 to 2.0 (Appendix Table 3).

        In the Online Appendix we show that these estimates are robust to a variety of methods

11
   As previously discussed, in Figure 2 we see that the cohort receiving claims two weeks after the duration cut has
substantially lower predicted durations. This pattern can be seen in all subsequent analyses.
12
   Appendix Table 1 reports the estimate excluding the negative outlier cohort two weeks after the policy change.
The estimate is somewhat smaller but remains highly significant. Appendix Table 2 reports the estimate using a
local quadratic model with the CCT optimal bandwidth. The estimated effect is somewhat larger than the local linear
case, and statistically significant.
13
   We exclude the holiday season in November and December because of the extreme variation in average UI
durations in the period due to seasonal hiring. This procedure generates 443 placebo estimates from 2003-2012.


                                                        14
for dealing with seasonality. Appendix Table 4 shows estimates using deseasonalized initial

claims data. Appendix Table 5 removes claimants from the 25 percent of most seasonal

industries as well as manufacturing. We also demonstrate that a similar decline in weeks-

received does not occur in Utah, the only other state for which we have identical administrative

data (Appendix Table 6).

       The reduction in weeks of UI receipt is a possible combination of “mechanical” effect of

earlier exhaustion for the treatment group and pre-exhaustion UI exit. We decompose the overall

change in weeks of UI receipt into two parts: the part due to changes in behavior prior to

exhaustion and the part due to pre-exhaustion exit. The estimated effect of the treatment on

unemployment duration conditional on duration being less than 58, that is, excluding anyone

exhausting, is 6.4 weeks. Because E[Duration]= E[Duration|Duration < 58] * Pr(Duration<58) +

E[Duration|Duration ≥58] * Pr(Duration≥58), and Pr(Duration<58) ≈ 0.74 in the control group,

approximately 54 percent (=100*(6.4*0.74)/8.7) of the change in the overall duration of UI

receipt comes from changes in the response to the cut before exhaustion.

       Timing of UI Receipt

       To examine the timing of UI receipt in greater detail we estimate the probability that an

individual remains on UI through each of the first 73 weeks of the spell. Figure 5 presents binned

scatterplots of the probability that claimants remained on UI in weeks 20, 40, 55, and 60 as a

function of their initial claim week. The figure shows that there is a response to the cut in

maximum duration fairly early in the spell. In weeks 20, 40, and 55, before the treatment group

exhausted benefits, it can be seen visually that the duration cut is associated with a lower

probability of receipt. By week 60, the probability of remaining in UI for the treated group falls

to about zero, consistent with all remaining claimants in the treatment group exhausting their




                                               15
benefits, while 26 percent of the comparison group was still receiving UI at that point. In none of

these series do we see a similar break one year prior to the policy change (denoted by the dashed

vertical line).

         Table 3 columns (2)–(5) report the point estimates for the probability that the UI spell

lasted until weeks 20, 40, 55, and 60. The RDD estimate for UI receipt is -12.3 percentage points

in week 20, -11.8 percentage points in week 40, -10.1 percentage points in week 55, and -23.6

percentage points in week 60. All estimates are highly significant. These shifts are not seen in the

corresponding placebo estimates in Panel B. Placebo estimates are indistinguishable from 0 in all

cases except for the probability of receiving benefits in week 20, which is positive.14 As with

unemployment duration, the estimates are somewhat smaller excluding the outlier two weeks

after the policy change (Appendix Table 1), and somewhat larger when estimating a local

quadratic with a CCT bandwidth (Appendix Table 2) but significant in both cases.

         To estimate the timing of the effects over the whole period, we fit variants of equation (1)

where, in each specification, 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 is the probability that the claimant received at least T weeks of

benefits, where T spans 1 to 73. These estimates give the relative survival probabilities between

the two groups by week. Figure 6 plots each of these RDD estimates with the associated

confidence intervals. Figure 6 shows that the survival function diverges between the two groups

starting early on in the UI spells, until around week 20 of the UI spell.

         Note that there is a sharp drop in the survivor rate for the treatment group in week 20 and

a similar drop for the comparison group in week 26. These drops represent individuals who did

not receive benefits beyond the regular state benefits, either because they were ineligible since



14
  Because Easter was on April 24, 2011, we also estimated a placebo specification setting the policy change just
prior to Easter 2010. We found no significant effects for this placebo as well suggesting that our estimates are not
being driven by this holiday.


                                                          16
the federal government automatically enrolls the eligible, or did not enroll for other reasons.15

Because of these drops in the survivor rate at regular benefit exhaustion date, we do not interpret

the 20–26 week span because any differences over this term reflect a combination of eligibility

and behavioral effects.

         Excluding this 20–26 week period, the treatment-control differences in the survivor rate

are relatively stable from week 20 of the UI spell through week 57, at which point there is a

significant drop in the relative survivor rates as the treatment group exhausts EUC benefits while

the control group continues to receive EUC benefits until week 73. The error bands in Figure 6

show that the first significant difference between the two groups occurs in week 14, and the

differences remain significant for all subsequent weeks. These estimates indicate claimants

respond in a forward-looking way to UI exhaustion, and much of the response to the duration cut

occurs fairly early in the spell, within the first three months. This time pattern of exit is robust to

alternative bandwidths. Appendix Figure 3 shows the same plots with double the IK bandwidth

and the pattern persists.

         We can use the estimated survival functions to estimate the average change in the hazard

rate. In Panel A of Figure 7 we show the level of the survival rate for the control and treatment

groups which underlie Figure 6. A point in the survivor curve for the control is the constant in

the local linear regression used to estimate a weekly estimate in Figure 6. The treatment series is

the corresponding intercept for the treatment group. The difference in these two series is Figure

6. Panel B shows the survivor functions in logs. The slope of these functions times -1 is the



15
  It is also possible that this dip could be the result of unmatched administrative claims data. The raw administrative
data has a separate record for each type of claim (regular benefits, different EUC tiers, extended benefits). We
matched the records to form a continuous history. To the extent that we couldn’t match regular benefits to EUC
records this pattern would emerge. However, we believe that it is unlikely that this slippage plays a major role in this
pattern since the different tiers of EUC are also separate records, and we would therefore expect to see similar step
patterns at all points where these transitions occur, which we do not.


                                                          17
hazard rate. To compute the hazard rate we first smooth the survivor functions separately over

weeks 1-20 and 26-57 for the treatment group and weeks 1-26 and 26-73 for the control group.

We use these separate segments so as to not have the function be influenced by the drop in the

survivor function due to regular UI recipients not claiming EUC. We then numerically

differentiate these smoothed functions. The derivatives times -1 are plotted in Panel C. The

difference in the estimated hazard rates are shown in Panel D.

        This exercise reveals several features about the response of recipeints to the cut in

benefits. As can be seen in Figure 6, the largest response ocurrs in the first 20 weeks of the spell

where the hazard is approximately 1 percentage point higher in the treatment than the control.

However, the exit hazard in the treatment remains elevated after 26 weeks, by about half a

percentage point, something that is not necessarily apparent when looking at raw survivor

functions in Panel A. On average, the treatment group has a 30% higher exit hazard than the

control over the first 57 weeks of the UI spell. This translates into a large elasticity of exit hazard

with respect to the cut of 1.36. 16 A second interesting feature is that, consistent with Meyer

(1990), there are spikes in the exit hazard prior to exhaustion. This can be seen both for the

treatment and control groups approaching the EUC exhaustion weeks. 17 There is also some

evidence of a slightly elevated hazard rate in the treatment group approaching the 20 week mark.

This might indicate that some recipients mistakenly believed that they were not going to receive

more than 20 weeks of UI.

        Employment

        Using the quarterly wage files we can measure the employment rate for the treatment and

control groups following the policy change. Figure 8 plots the employment rate by UI

16
  The policy resulted in a 22% change in potential UI duration (16 weeks from a base of 73).
17
  We have also estimated hazard rates of UI exit for other period and have found consistent evidence of a spike
approaching exhaustion.

application week for four quarters after the benefit cut. Consistent with the pattern seen for UI

exits, in 2011 Q3—the first full quarter after the cut—there is a noticeable jump in the

employment rate for applicants claiming after the duration cut. The elevated employment rate for

the treated group can also be seen in 2011 Q4, 2012 Q1 and 2012 Q2.

        Figure 9 presents the RDD estimates and associated 95 percent confidence intervals for

employment rates by quarter, starting in the quarter the policy went into effect (the second

quarter of 2011) through the second quarter of 2013. The RDD estimate for employment is

insignificant in 2011 Q2, the quarter of the policy change. In 2011 Q3—the first complete

quarter after the duration cut—the treated group has a 11.9 percentage point higher employment

rate than the comparison group. The difference in employment rates is similar to the 10-12

percentage point difference in the probability of receipt in the early part of the UI spells over the

relevant range, suggesting that those individuals who leave UI before exhaustion tend to enter

employment. The employment effect fades out by 2012 Q4 at which point both treatment and

control have exhausted their benefits. The point estimates and standard errors for the

employment RDD are presented in Table 4. 18, 19

        Conveniently, the 16-week period when the treated group had exhausted benefits and the

control group was still eligible for benefits covers the entire third quarter of 2012 (as well as part

of the second quarter of 2012). Therefore, to assess the effects of benefit exhaustion for the long-

term unemployed in the treatment group, relative to the control who still received benefits, we

can look at the change in the relative employment rate between the two groups in 2012 Q3

relative to earlier quarters. If exhausting benefits results in people scrambling and successfully

   Appendix Table 7 reports local linear estimates excluding the outlier cohort two weeks after the policy change.
Appendix Table 8 reports local quadratic estimates with the CCT optimal bandwidth. We continue to see significant
employment effects in both cases.

   Appendix Figure 4 shows the same charts using twice the IK bandwidth.

finding employment, we would expect to see an increase in the RDD estimate for employment

relative to the estimate in the previous quarter and the subsequent quarter. This is not what we

find; rather, the relative employment rates in the treatment and control groups fell over the

period. This suggests that, for the long-term unemployed who did not respond to the policy early,

exhausting UI benefits did not hasten reemployment relative to the control. Instead, the positive

employment effects we observe come from the group of UI recipients who responded to the

changing weeks of eligibility well before exhaustion. A caveat to this conclusion is that at the

time the treatment group exhausts UI benefits the composition of the two groups differs since

there were more exits from UI in the treated group among the “forward-looking” subset of

participants. It is possible that an increase in the exit rate from this group in the control masks

any positive effect of exhaustion on employment in the treatment group.

       Figure 10 shows the “placebo” estimate for the employment effect of the benefit cut.

Specifically, we estimate the same model with quarterly employment outcomes for quarters

starting one year prior to the duration cut, setting the placebo duration cut to April 2010. There

are no significant employment estimates over this period. Appendix Figure 5 shows the placebo

distribution for employment probabilities in Q3 2011, Q4 2011, and Q1 2012 for placebo weeks

that range from one month prior to the actual policy change to six months after. This was a

period of improving labor market conditions for Missouri. The unemployment insurance spell

duration outcome is included for reference. The figure shows that the estimates for the real

policy change week are at the extreme tail of the placebo distribution, demonstrating that our

estimates are not simply capturing smooth improvements in the labor market.

       We can use the estimates corresponding to the relative nonemployment probabilities by

quarter (shown in Figure 9) to calculate the expected difference in the duration of mean




                                                20
nonemployment between the two groups. If we assume that the relative employment

probabilities between the two groups are the same after the third quarter of 2012, after which

point all recipients have exhausted their benefits, summing the estimates in Figure 9 from the

quarter of the policy change through 2012 Q3 implies that a one-month reduction in

unemployment duration reduces the number of days of nonemployment by an average of 10.4

days, with a 95 percent confidence interval of (6.7,14.1). 20 This confidence interval implies an

approximate elasticity of nonemployment with respect to potential unemployment duration in the

range of 0.37-0.78. This elasticity is only an approximation because we are assuming that UI exit

prior to exhaustion is into employment, as well as a particular exit hazard rate into employment

for UI exhaustees. Both of these assumptions are required to compute an average

nonemployment duration in the baseline. 21

        Reemployment Earnings

        A class of job search models predict that longer provision of unemployment benefits

allows workers to increase their reservation wage and find a more desirable job match. Longer

UI duration could also depreciate human capital resulting in lower wages. The literature has

mixed findings on the relationship between UI benefit duration and reemployment wages. Card

Chetty, and Weber (2007) found no significant effect of delay while Schmieder, Von Wachter,

and Bender (2013) find that workers with longer potential UI spells have lower wages. We find

that post-employment earnings do not change significantly following the cut in duration. Figure


20
   The confidence interval, which is constructed from the standard errors for each quarterly estimate, assumes no
covariance term between the RDD estimates of employment by quarter.
21
   This range is calculated as follows: the percent change in potential unemployment duration was 22%. The
confidence interval implies that the policy increased the number of days of nonemployment by 26.8-56.4 days, or
3.8-8.1 weeks. 80% of the control group exited before UI exhaustion and their average duration was 27.6 weeks. We
assume that these recipients entered employment We do not have a nonemployemnt spells for exhaustees. If we
assume a hazard rate into employment of 2% at the times of exhaustion, which is roughly what Figure 7 implies, this
implies a mean duration of 73+1/.02=123 weeks for exhaustees and an overall average duration of 46.7 weeks. This
yields a nonemployment elasticity in the range of 0.37-0.78.

been reemployed, by application week. 22 There is no evidence of a break at the threshold, a

finding that is confirmed by the positive and insignificant estimate on the log reemployment

wage outcome in column (5) of Table 4.


VI. RECONCILING THE INDIVIDUAL AND MARKET-LEVEL EFFECT OF THE POLICY

         We have documented fairly large responses of the duration of UI receipt and

nonemployment to changes in potential duration. In this section we ask how the cut affected the

aggregate unemployment rate and, further, what the relative magnitude of the change in the

unemployment rate and the change implied by the RDD estimates implies about possible

spillovers, particularly displacement effects from the treated group crowding out other

jobseekers. To this end, we estimate DiD models comparing the unemployment rate in Missouri

to a comparison group of states. 23 We then compare the estimated change in the Missouri

unemployment rate over the period to the change in the unemployment rate predicted by the

estimated change in the survivor function from the RDD models, assuming no market-level

spillovers. A comparison of the two series is informative about the degree of spillovers. 24

         The challenge for estimating the effect of the policy change in Missouri is in constructing

a reasonable counterfactual. The policy change occurred during the recovery of the 2007-2009

recession, and it is well known that states differed in the shocks they experienced and the

strength and speed of the labor market recoveries. Over the period there were shocks to housing

(Mian and Sufi 2012), manufacturing (Charles, Hurst and Notowidigdo (2016)), and credit

22
   Our data contains information on quarterly earnings.
23
   Hagedorn et al. (2014) conduct a similar analysis for a UI duration cut in North Carolina.
24
   Our design is best suited for capturing the “crowding” general equilibrium effects emphasized by Landais et al.
(2010). A caveat is that there are general equilibrium effects that are likely not detected by this research design. For
example, we may not be able to detect the effects of changes do to gradual firm adjustment to UI policy.



                                                           22
(Chodorow-Reich (2014), Greenstone, Mas and Nguyen (2015)). These shocks had different

regional distributions, and it has been found that the labor market recovery varied by region

(Yagan 2016). For this reason, we experiment with a number of approaches for estimating

counterfactuals in order to match Missouri to similar states with respect to the labor market

dynamics, as well as to assess robustness.

        In Figure 12 we plot the raw difference between the deseasonalized unemployment rates

in Missouri and the average of all other states by month. The figure shows what appears to be a

decline in the unemployment rate in Missouri coinciding with the duration cut as we see a

relative reduction in the Missouri unemployment rate, peaking at just over 1 percentage point,

following the April 2011 cut. 25

        In Figure 13 we compare Missouri to a synthetic control using the method of Abadie and

Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010) which assigns weights to

states as to minimize the mean squared prediction error between the treatment and control states

in the pre-intervention period for a set of outcomes. To construct weights for the comparison

group, we use as predictors the unemployment rate for each quarter from January 2009 – March

2011, the percent of employment in agriculture, mining, utilities and construction, the percent of

employment in manufacturing, the percent of employment in retail and wholesale trade, the

percent change in housing values from 1999-2006, the percent change in housing values from

2007-2010, and the percent of the state population that is living in rural areas. 26 We exclude from

the donor pool any state that cut UI duration prior to 2013. 27 The figure plots the Missouri


25
   Appendix Figures 6 and 7 show the raw unemployment rates for Missouri and the comparison groups, without

   The housing values are annual state-level indices for the value of single-family homes from the Federal Housing

   The procedure assigns weights of 10.5% to Arizona, 21.6% to Connecticut, 13.1% to Delaware, 42.2% to
Kentucky, 1.2% to Minnesota, 10.7% to North Dakota, and 0.8% to Oklahoma, and 0 to all other states.


                                                        23
unemployment rate against the weighted unemployment rate for the synthetic control. The figure

shows a similar drop as when we use the unweighted comparison group of states, with the

relative unemployment rate declining, peaking at almost a one-percentage point decline, and then

gradually reverting back to the control.

        Figure 14 uses the simple average unemployment rate of states that border Missouri as

the control. The motivation for this comparison is evidence that there are important regional

patterns in the cyclical pattern of unemployment (Yagan (2016)). The disadvantage relative to

the synthetic control approach is that we lose the ability to compare states with similar

characteristics that are not necessarily regionally concentrated, such as industry and housing

price dynamics. The drop in the unemployment rate also has a similar pattern as when we use all

states as the control group, though the fall in the unemployment rate appears even more

pronounced and more persistent in this comparison. 28

        Note that in these figures there appears to be some decline in the unemployment rate in

Missouri relative to the control states a few months before the policy change. While this decline

is not large, a reasonable concern is that we are detecting a pre-treatment change in trend in the

Missouri unemployment rate. In Figures 12-14 the month of April is marked with a dotted

vertical line for all years. It can be seen that even with seasonally adjusted data there is a

somewhat different seasonal pattern between Missouri and the comparison groups, with Missouri

exhibiting a pattern of sharper declines in unemployment from December through April. It is

therefore very difficult to distinguish the small decline in the unemployment rate we observe

prior to the policy change between a typical seasonal fluctuation and a secular change in trend.

Given the evidence from the micro analysis which point to large changes in unemployment

28
  Appendix Figure 8 shows the synthetic control approach just on border states. This figure also shows a similar
pattern of falling unemployment after the policy change, though with more of a positive trend between the treated
and control groups prior to the policy change.


                                                        24
durations, we believe it is reasonable to conclude that the patterns in these figures are driven by

these changes in policies.

        Next we compare these relative changes in the state unemployment rate to the changes in

the unemployment rate predicted by the RDD estimates assuming no spillovers. For every week

𝜏𝜏 relative to the week of the benefit cut (𝜏𝜏=0), we compute the predicted change in the number of

unemployed (∆𝑛𝑛�𝜏𝜏 ) due to the policy as:

        ∆𝑛𝑛�𝜏𝜏 = ∑57       𝑇𝑇       𝐶𝐶                73
                  𝑡𝑡=0(𝑝𝑝̂ 𝑡𝑡 − 𝑝𝑝̂ 𝑡𝑡 ) ∗ 𝑐𝑐𝜏𝜏−𝑡𝑡 + ∑𝑡𝑡=58(−0.05) ∗ 𝑐𝑐𝜏𝜏−𝑡𝑡 ,

where 𝑐𝑐𝜏𝜏−𝑡𝑡 is the number of initial UI claims in week 𝜏𝜏 − 𝑡𝑡 if 𝜏𝜏 − 𝑡𝑡 ≥ 0, 𝑐𝑐𝜏𝜏−𝑡𝑡 = 0 if 𝜏𝜏 − 𝑡𝑡 < 0,

and 𝑝𝑝̂ 𝑡𝑡𝑇𝑇 and 𝑝𝑝̂𝑡𝑡𝐶𝐶 are the estimated probabilities that UI recipients are receiving benefits t weeks

into the spell for the treatment and control groups respectively. An underlying assumption, which

the analysis above supports, is that pre-exhaustion exits out of UI represent moves out of

unemployment and into employment. For UI recipients who first received benefits 58–73 weeks

prior to the week of April 13, we make the assumption that the relative difference in the relative

exit rate out of unemployment between treatment and control is the RDD estimate for the

employment probability outcome in 2012 Q3. We assume that after 73 weeks, beyond the

duration of the program in the control period, there are no differences in relative unemployment

exit rates, an assumption that is consistent with the insignificant employment probabilities

between the two groups after they both exhaust. We then compute the predicted change in the

unemployment rate in each week after April 13, 2011 as ∆𝑛𝑛�𝜏𝜏 /𝑙𝑙𝜏𝜏 , where 𝑙𝑙𝜏𝜏 is labor force

participation.

        Figure 15 plots the predicted change in the state unemployment rate by week against the

DiD estimates (by month) of the change in the Missouri unemployment rate expressed relative to

the value in March 2011, the month before the cut. The DiD estimates not only line up closely to



                                                            25
the predicted change, but the series exhibits a similar kinked pattern with the unemployment rate

declining, peaking at close to 1 percentage point and kinking up at approximately same time as

the predicted change. It appears that the assumption of no spillovers used to form the predicted

response is appropriate as the increased exit rate of the UI applicants translated into a lower

unemployment rate. Appendix Figure 9 shows the predicted change using estimates without the

outlier cohort. Here the drop in the unemployment rate exceeds the predicted amount.

        Table 5 reports the estimates for the DiD models fit over the 2009–2013 period and with

the intervention period defined as April 2011 through December 2013. The unit of observation is

at the month-by-state level, and we estimate all models with state fixed effects, calendar month

dummies, interaction of time (calendar month) with the same set of state characteristics used in

the synthetic control match, and with and without a Missouri-specific trend. 29

        Computing standard errors is complicated in cases where there is only one intervention

unit. The primary concern when using grouped data in a DiD analysis is how to account for

possible serial correlation (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan 2004). Though we use data from

all 50 states and the District of Columbia, we cannot cluster on state because the relevant degrees

of freedom is the number of intervention units (Imbens and Kolesar 2012), which in this case is a

single state. As an alternative, we employ a number of different approaches for inference. For the

unweighted DiD estimates we report OLS standard errors, panel-corrected standard errors,

confidence intervals from a wild bootstrap using the empirical t-distribution (Cameron, Gelbach,

and Miller 2008), and the percentile rank of the coefficient from a permutation exercise where

we estimate a placebo effect of the cut for every state for the post-April 2011 period. We also

employ tests from Ibragimov and Müller (2014), which are discussed below. For the synthetic


29
  We have also estimated models with state-specific trends, which yield almost the same point estimates. However,
these models are not well suited for bootstrapping so we opted for the more parsimonious model.

control estimates, we report the percentile rank from the permutation exercise. Specifically, for

every state we form its state-specific synthetic control and compute the mean difference in the

outcome between the state and the state-specific control as if the state were treated. Table 5 also

includes the average post-intervention predicted change in the unemployment rate from the RDD

estimates, which can be compared to the DiD estimates to assess the degree of spillovers. We

show these both for the main estimates and the estimates excluding the outlier cohort.

       In Panel A the DiD estimate using the unweighted control is -0.89 percentage points

(column 1), and -0.80 percentage points with a Missouri-specific trend. These estimates are

interpretable as the difference in the Missouri unemployment rate in the period April 2011-

August 2013 relative to January 2009-March 2011 and relative to the average change in all other

states. The estimates are statistically different from 0 as well as from the predicted change in the

unemployment rate, in both models using OLS standard errors, panel corrected standard errors,

and the wild bootstrap confidence intervals. The percentile ranks are 5.9% (column 1) and 2.0%

(column 2) meaning that in specification 1, 5.9 percent of states have more negative estimated

effects while in specification 2, 2 percent of states have more negative estimated effects. Column

(3) presents the synthetic control estimates. The DiD point-estimate is -0.85, which has an

associated percentile rank of 3.9%. These estimated average changes in the unemployment rate

are larger than the predicted change in the unemployment rate, possibly twice as large if we use

the predicted change excluding the outlier cohort.

       We estimate these models in Panel B using the Missouri neighbors comparison group. In

these models we do not control for state characteristics interacted with time since there are too

few degrees of freedom to identify these effects, but otherwise the models are the same as in

Panel A. The estimates are similar in magnitude to when using all states. There is an estimated




                                                27
decline in the unemployment rate of 1.0, 0.76 and 0.70 percentage points without trends, with

Missouri-specific trends, and with the synthetic control respectively. 30 All of these estimates are

significant and are the largest estimated effects when permuting the treatment through this set of

states (the percentile rank is 0).

        Next we separately look at the numerator and denominator of the unemployment rate. In

Table 5 columns (4)–(6) we estimate the same models using the log of the number of

unemployed as the dependent variable. Across specifications, we see large and significant

declines in the number of unemployed, in the range of 10–12 percent depending on the

specification. These estimates are close to the predicted change in the number of unemployment

from the RDD estimates of 10 percent, and about 30% larger than the predicted value when

excluding the outlier cohort. Columns (7)–(9) report the estimates for log size of the labor force.

The estimates tend to be small and insignificant negative estimates, with the exception of the

synthetic control estimate that uses neighboring states that is fairly large at -3 percentage points

and significant. This last estimate suggests that there may have been some negative impact on

labor force participation, though the specifications with log of the number of unemployed imply

that a large portion of the effect on the unemployment rate is through changes in the number of

unemployed, consistent with the micro evidence. 31

        We have also computed p-values for the DiD estimate of the effect of the policy change

on the unemployment rate based on the approach of Ibragimov and Müller (2014). To implement

this test we limit the sample to 28 months on each side of the policy change, and collapse the


30
   The synthetic control is constructed using the same matching variables described in Figure 13 but using only
neighboring states. We exclude Arkansas from the donor pool because it changed benefit durations over the same
period. The control group consists of the following weighted average of states: 38.7% Illinois, 5.6% Nebraska, and
55.7% Kentucky.
31
   In Appendix Table 9 we reproduce this analysis using these measures derived from the Current Population
Survey. The magnitudes are close to those from LAUS, and while noisier they are still reasonably precise in most
specifications. This analysis shows that our estimates are not driven by how the LAUS data are constructed.

monthly difference between the Missouri and the average of the comparison group

unemployment rates (denoted for convenience UMO-CO,t) into blocks of months of varying sizes

(28, 14, 7, 4, 3, and 2 blocks in each of the pre and post periods). We then conduct a two-sample

t-test of equality of UMO-CO in the pre and post periods using the collapsed data and N-2 degrees

of freedom. In these tests the sampling variances are estimated from variation in UMO-CO across

blocks of months, and in doing so we assume independence of UMO-CO across blocks of months,

but allow for arbitrary correlation within blocks. Under the conventional assumption of weak

dependence in time series data, observations that are far apart will be less correlated to each

other than those close together, and we would therefore expect less auto-correlation when

grouping more months together into larger blocks than smaller blocks. By comparing p-values

across block groups we can assess the degree to which the inference is serially robust. Looking

across the columns of Table 6, this indeed appears to be the case. For the unweighted and

synthetic controls we can reject equality of the pre and post period values of UMO-CO for all block

groupings, even when we collapse the sample to just two blocks on either side of the cut-off,

where auto-correlation should be minimal. Appendix Table 10 shows the same test for the CPS

derived sample.

       In Table 7 we further control for regional shocks by narrowing the estimation to those

counties that straddle the Missouri state line. These border estimates look very similar to those

from the state-level analyses, with estimated changes in unemployment rates of approximately

0.8 percentage points, 9 percent declines in the number of unemployed, and no detectable

changes in labor force participation.

       Our conclusion from the cumulative findings is that there is reasonably strong evidence

that the increase in exit rates translated into a lower unemployment rate. Moreover, while an




                                                29
important caveat is that in a single unit intervention it is not straightforward to compute correct

standard errors, the point-estimates suggest that there were limited displacement effects due to

the higher employment rates from the treated group. This analysis also supports another

assumption: that the behavioral response is not local to the time of the policy change. If the effect

were transitory, we would not expect to see a pronounced and growing change in the state

unemployment rate.


VII. DISCUSSION

       The UI estimates imply that a one-month reduction in potential UI duration leads to a 0.5

month reduction in compensated UI spells and a 0.3 month reduction in nonemployment. The

implied elasticity of the UI exit hazard with respect to the cut in potential duration is

approximately 1.4, and we estimate an elasticity of non-employment in the range of 0.37-0.78.

These estimates are towards the upper-end of the literature.

       To situate the magnitudes, we discuss a subset of papers in the literature that are

representative of the range of estimates. Among European studies, the marginal effect for

nonemployment is close to van Ours and Vodopivec (2008) (me ≈0.4), women in Lalive (2007)

(me ≈ 0.4), women in Lalive (2008) (me ≈ 0.28), Le Barbachon (2012) (me ≈0.3), Landais,

Lalive, and Zweimuller (2015) (marginal effect = 0.3), and Centeno and Novo (2009) (me ≈

0.25), but higher than Card, Chetty, and Weber (2007) (me ≈ 0.1) and Schmieder, Von Wachter,

and Bender (2012) (me ≈ 0.1). The elasticity of nonemployment is close to Lalive (2008)

(elasticity ≈ 0.37 for men and 0.56 for women), Centeno and Novo (2009) (elasticity ≈ 0.45),

but smaller than Card, Chetty, and Weber (2007) (elasticity ≈ 0.1) and Schmieder, Von Wachter,

and Bender (2012) (me ≈ 0.12). U.S. studies include Leung and O’Leary (2015) (me ≈ 0.12) (for

a population of workers who are on the margin of UI eligibility), Landais (elasticity ≈ 0.34), and



                                                 30
Solon (1979) (elasticity for UI repeaters ≈ 1 , insignificant for non-repeaters).

           We are able to make better comparisons to US studies by comparing estimates of the

effect of potential duration changes on UI spells, and UI exit hazard rates. Our estimated

marginal effect of UI spell duration of 0.5 is higher than Katz and Meyer (1990) (me ≈ 0.2) and

Card and Levine (1990) (me ≈ 0.08) and closer to Landais (2015) (me ≈ 0.2-0.4). Our estimated

elasticity of UI exit hazard with respect to potential duration is substantially higher than Moffit

(1985) (elasticity ≈ 0.16), Card and Levine (1990) (hazard elasticity ≈ 0.34) and Katz and Meyer

(1990) (hazard elasticity ≈ 0.3) but closer to Landais (2015) (hazard elasticity ≈ 1.35) and Solon

(1979) (weeks unemployed elasticity ≈ 1).

           It is not surprising that estimates from some of these studies differ from the estimates

reported here since they tend to be from the 1980’s and early-1990’s in the US, or European

countries where the labor market institutions are quite different. In many European countries

baseline durations are long, and recipients have access to means-tested welfare programs after UI

exhaustion. Given the range of estimates, there is no reason that this relationship is necessarily

stable. It is also possible that the response to a potential duration cut is larger than an increase.

Few studies have examined cuts to potential duration, but one study that does, van Ours and

Vodopivec (2005) in Slovenia, also finds large effects on UI exit and job finding rates (elasticity

of exit rate with repect to potential benefit duration ≈ 0.9 – 1).

           In a related study that uses nationally representative data from the same

period, Hagedorn, Manovskii, and Mitman (2015) estimate the labor market effects of the

expiration of Emergency Unemployment Compensation in December 2013. They estimate that

the EUC expiration resulted in 954,000 fewer unemployed. 32 Our estimates applied to the

national data imply an effect of close to this magnitude. At the time of the expiration there were
32
     They also estimate that another 1.1 million people entered the labor force as a result of the failure to extend EUC.


                                                             31
approximately 4.7 million UI recipients who either had expiring benefits or were going to face

expiring benefits over the first half of 2014 (Council of Economic Advisors and Department of

Labor 2013). The average reduction in UI duration due to this expiration was 53%. Our

estimates imply that a 22% reduction in benefits (16 weeks from a base of 73) led to a 10 percent

reduction in the number of unemployed. Applying our estimates directly, a 53% cut in benefit

duration implies a 24% reduction in the number of unemployed. This translates to 1.1 million

fewer unemployed from a base of 4.7 million. This is very close to the Hagedorn, Manovskii,

and Mitman (2015) estimate. 33

        Our findings on the relationship between UI extensions and unemployment differ from

Rothstein (2011) and Farber and Valletta (2013) who find only a small relationship between UI

extensions and unemployment, most of which is the result of changing labor force status. One

explanation, of course, is that they use national data and are looking at changes in extended

benefits while we use data for one state and we look at changes in both regular and extended

benefits. It is also possible that our findings diverge for statistical reasons. These papers rely on

CPS data where unemployment durations and eligibility have to be estimated. This may result in

measurement and misclassification error that could attenuate their estimates.

        Another finding in our paper is that the increased hazard rate out of unemployment

insurance occurs in the first twenty weeks of the UI spell and then stabilizes. There is evidence in

the literature of this kind of anticipatory effects (Schmieder, Von Wachter, and Bender (2012);

Card, Chetty, and Weber (2007); Le Barbachon (2012), Landais (2015)). It is possible that the

media attention following the policy made the duration cut more salient in the minds of some UI

recipients, resulting in increased search intensity. However, this explanation would imply that

33
  Our estimated macro effect of the cut is also larger than Marinescu (2014) who estimates that a 10 percent
increase in benefits corresponds to a 0.7 percent decline in the unemployment rate. See also Coglianese (2015) and
Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis (2016).


                                                        32
the change in behavior is mainly local to the time of the cut, and less pronounced for subsequent

cohorts of UI recipients. As discussed, since the path of the unemployment rate tracks the

predicted path, which is based on the assumption that the change in the survivor function is

permanent, this explanation is less compelling.

       Another explanation for the forward-looking behavior is that recipients were confused by

the policy change, believing that the cut would give them only 20 weeks of benefits and not the

federal benefits which were an additional 37 weeks. This explanation is attractive because it

would imply smaller UI hazard elasticities, since some of the recipients would have then

believed the cuts to be substantially larger than those implemented. It is possible that recipients

interpreted the law in this way, but our review of media reports and Missouri communications to

UI recipients provide no evidence that the information disseminated would lead to this kind of

confusion. The media coverage at the time emphasized that the reduction was a compromise

to preserve extended benefits (e.g Young 2011). The initial packet sent to claimants before and

after the law change was identical and did not explicitly state the number of weeks of eligibility

for regular UI. Rather, the report states the maximum benefit and the weekly benefit. The

number of weeks of eligibility would be derived from the ratio of these two numbers (see

Appendix Figure 10 for an example of this document). No other wording was changed and no

information about extended benefits was provided in the initial packet for either the treatment or

control group. Instead, the claimants were informed whether extended benefits were in effect

when they logged into Missouri’s UI website (MODES) and they also received a call informing

them that extended benefits are available. When the claimant exhausted their benefits they were

reminded in correspondence that EUC was available and eligible claimants were automatically

enrolled. These procedures did not change with the law. Because the policy change was clearly




                                                  33
described even in the headlines, and the information regarding regular and extended benefits

were continuous at the time of the policy change, we find it difficult to sustain an argument that

policy understanding was affected discontinuously at the threshold. However, the presence of a

small spike in the UI exit hazard prior to 20 weeks in the treatment group might indicate some

confusion. If this was the case, it is interesting that some exiting recipients responded well before

the 20-week mark and were largely able to find employment.

       We find that the long-term unemployed who exhausted their benefits did not have higher

rates of reemployment relative to the group that remained on UI. This can be seen most clearly in

the comparison of employment rates during the period that the treated group had no benefits

remaining while the comparison group remained eligible. There is no evidence that the

employment rate rose for the group exhausting benefits during this period (with the caveat that

the control group at this point has a different composition near exhaustion as it contains a subset

of the “forward-looking” types). This finding suggests that the benefit cut increased

reemployment rates for a subset of individuals who responded early in the spell, but for the

remaining recipients UI continued to serve an insurance function with limited moral hazard

response. As the optimal UI literature suggests, our results suggest that policymakers have to

tradeoff between moral hazard and insurance when determining the duration of UI.

        Finally, we provide direct evidence on the relative magnitudes of the micro and macro

elasticities with respect to potential UI duration. Unlike Lalive et al. (2015), we find that the

macro elasticity is at least as large as the micro elasticity. Within the framework of Landais et al.

(2010), this finding is consistent with a horizontal aggregate labor demand curve. The finding

suggests that the assumptions of the Baily-Chetty model of optimal UI [Baily (1978), Chetty

(2006)], which assume no spillovers, are appropriate in this setting, providing empirical support




                                                 34
for the theoretical predictions of Kroft and Notowidigdo (2015). The “micro” marginal effect of

potential duration in Lalive et al. (2015) is close to the one we find (≈0.3), but the “macro”

response differs. While we cannot pin down why this finding is different there are several

important differences in the programs and the settings. Lalive et al. study a policy that took place

23 years prior to the one we study, in a country with different institutions and economics

circumstances. 34 In terms of the policies, there are also differences: they examine a benefit

increase rather than benefit cut, the Austrian program was intended to be an early-retirement

program and was targeted to a region that experienced restructuring in the steel sector. Given

these differences it is not necessarily surprising that the relationships differ, and it suggests that

the relationship between the micro and macro elasticity may depend on the particular setting.

         An important caveat for interpretation of our findings is that this is a single state study.

Appropriate caution should be taken when extrapolating these estimates to other settings. At the

same time Missouri is a fairly typical state in many respects. Appendix Table 11 compares the

characteristics of Missouri to the rest of the US. Missouri’s demographic and labor market

characteristics look fairly similar to the average of the other states in many, though not all

dimensions. Using the characteristics in the table we investigate Missouri’s “representativeness”

by summing each state’s rank-distance from the national median for each variable. Using this

criterion, Missouri is fifth closest to the median in these characteristics across all states.

         We also note that while the seasonally-adjusted Missouri unemployment rate was high at

the time of the benefit cut, at 8.6 percent, the labor market nationally was mending, and the

finding that the market largely absorbed the larger number of workers exiting UI without


34
  Institutional differences include the availability of means-tested benefits after unemployment benefit exhaustion,
availability of benefits for voluntary quitters after a waiting period and near universal collective bargaining
coverage. The Austrian labor market was also stronger, by at least some measures. The unemployment rate in
Austria at the time of the policy was only 3.6% (OECD) as compared to 8.6% in Missouri.

displacement may not hold when the unemployment rate is even higher or on an upward

trajectory.

Panel B: Log of the Survivor Functions                        Panel D: Difference in the hazard rates
Notes: Panel A plots the RDD estimate of the survivor function. Each point in the control series is the estimated intercept for the
control group in the local linear regression used to estimate the RDD probabilities of survival up to a given week, shown in in Figure
6. Each point in the treatment is the corresponding estimate for the treatment. The difference in these two series are the RDD
estimates shown in Figure 6. Panel B plots the natural log of the survivor functions. Panel C plots -1 times the numerical derivative of
the smoothed survivor functions. To smooth the survivor functions we estimate a local quadratic regression with a bandwidth of 4
seperately for the 1-20 week and the 21-57 week segments for the treatment group and the 1-26 week and 26-73 week segments for
the control group. The segments are split this way to avoid the discontinuous drop in enrollment from recipients not enrolling into the
EUC program. Panel D shows the difference in the estimated hazards in Panel C.

Notes: Observations are state by month units. UR is the unemployment rate, ln(U) is the natural log of the number of unemployed, and ln(LF) is the natural log of
the size of the labor force. Variables are derived from the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics and deseasonalized as described in the text. The sample
spans January 2009 to August 2013. SE is the OLS standard error, PCSE is the panel corrected standard error, and the permutation %-tile rank is the percentage
of states that have a more negative “effect” when estimating the same model 51 times, assigning each state to be the “treated” state in each permutation.
MO*trend allows for a Missouri specific trend. The synthetic control uses weights from the synthetic control method described in the text to form a control
group. Predicted change is the change in UR and ln(U) that is predicted by the RDD estimates of the change in the survivor function assuming no spillover
effects. “Pred. chg. no outlier” is the same prediction without the outlier cohort.

Notes: Each column reports the t-statistic and corresponding two-tail p-value with N-2 degrees of freedom for the two sample t-test of equality of the difference
between the Missouri and comparison group unemployment rate before and after the potential duration cut, where the monthly Missouri – comparison group
unemployment rate differences have been collapsed into the specified number of blocks. In Panel A the comparison group is the equally weighted average of the
monthly unemployment rate for all states and the District of Columbia excluding Missouri. In Panel B the comparison group is the synthetic control discussed in

Notes: This table uses LAUS unemployment data from 2009 through 2013 where an
observation is the unemployment rate in a county-month. We match each treatment county
on Missouri’s border to a neighboring untreated county in the adjoining state which we call
county pairs. UR is the unemployment rate, ln(U) is the natural log of the number of
unemployed, and ln(LF) is the natural log of the size of the labor force. MO*trend allows for
a Missouri specific trend.

Notes: This figure shows the placebo distribution of estimates for three outcomes where we vary the placebo
treatments for each week, starting one month prior to the real policy change through six months after the policy
change. All estimates use an IK bandwidth. The purpose of the figure is to show placebo estimates for a period when
the labor market in Missouri was improving. The RDD estimate for the real policy change is denoted by the vertical
line.

   changed UI benefit duration over the same period. See text for details on the
   construction of the synthetic control. The control group consists of the following
   weighted average of states: 38.7% Illinois, 5.6% Nebraska, and 55.7% Kentucky. The
   vertical solid line denotes the month of the cut in potential UI duration. The vertical
   dotted lines denote the month of April in other years.

     the estimated RDD change in the survivor function assuming no spillover effects and excluding the
     outlier cohort. “Actual – All states” is the difference between the Missouri unemployment rate and the
     unweighted average of the unemployment rate in all other states relative to March 2011. “Actual –
     Synthetic” is the difference between the Missouri unemployment rate and the synthetic control
     unemployment rate. “Actual – Neighbor states” is the difference between the Missouri unemployment
     rate and the unemployment rate of neighboring states. See text for details on the construction of the
     synthetic control.

Notes: To deseasonalize UI spell duration we regress this variable on week-specific fixed effects in non-treatment
years and subtract out the resulting seasonal effects in the treatment-year data. We present several estimates using
alternative years to estimate seasonality (Recession Era Control includes 2008-2011, All Years Control estimates
the seasonal variation using all years other than the treatment year, 2010).

Notes: We test whether the estimates we obtained in column (1) of Table 3 are robust to the exclusion of the more
seasonal industries. To this end, we first estimate seasonality by regressing claim quantities on month dummies and
calculating the variance in the month dummies for each two-digit NAICS industry. We then re-estimate our main
effect while excluding the most seasonal 25% of industries (column 1). We also test whether the estimate is robust
to excluding manufacturing claims (column 2).

Notes: Observations are state by month units. UR is the unemployment rate, ln(U) is the natural log of the number of unemployed, and ln(LF) is the natural log of
the size of the labor force. Variables are derived from the BLS Current Population Survey and deseasonalized as described in the text. The sample spans January
2009 to August 2013. SE is the OLS standard error, PCSE is the panel corrected standard error, and the permutation %-tile rank is the percentage of states that
have a more negative “effect” when estimating the same model 51 times, assigning each state to be the “treated” state in each permutation. MO*trend allows for
a Missouri specific trend. The synthetic control uses weights from the synthetic control method described in the text to form a control group. Predicted change is
the change in UR and ln(U) that is predicted by the RDD estimates of the change in the survivor function assuming no spillover effects. “Pred. chg. no outlier” is
the same prediction without the outlier cohort.

Notes: Each column reports the t-statistic and corresponding two-tail p-value with N-2 degrees of freedom for the two sample t-test of equality of the difference
between the Missouri and comparison group unemployment rate before and after the potential duration cut, where the monthly Missouri – comparison group
unemployment rate differences have been collapsed into the specified number of blocks. In Panel A the comparison group is the equally weighted average of the
monthly unemployment rate for all states and the District of Columbia excluding Missouri. In Panel B the comparison group is the synthetic control discussed in
the text. We limit the sample to 28 months on each side of the policy change. Unemployment rates are derived from BLS CPS data.

Notes: Variables derived from the March 2010 Current Population Survey. All descriptive statistics are sample weighted by the CPS
household weight. Columns (1) and (2) compare the demographics of all Missourians to Americans that do not live in Missouri. In
Columns (3) and (4), we compare the demographics of Missouri’s unemployed to unemployed Americans that do not live in Missouri.
Unemployed is as a percentage of the population.
