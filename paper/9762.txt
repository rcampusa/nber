Despite growing empirical evidence of the link between environmental policy and innovation, most
economic models of environmental policy treat technology as exogenous. For long-term problems
such as climate change, this omission can be significant. In this paper, I modify the DICE model of

climate change (Nordhaus 1994, Nordhaus and Boyer 2000) to allow for induced innovation in the
energy sector. Ignoring induced technological change overstates the welfare costs of an optimal

carbon tax policy by 8.3 percent. However, cost-savings, rather than increased environmental
benefits, appear to drive the welfare gains, as the effect of induced innovation on emissions and
mean global temperature is small. Sensitivity analysis shows that potential crowding out of other
R&D and market failures in the R&D sector are the most important limiting factors to the potential

of induced innovation. Differences in these key assumptions explain much of the variation in the
findings of other similar models.

       When studying solutions to long-term environmental problems such as climate change, it

is important to consider the role that technological change may play.         Nonetheless, most

economic models of climate change treat technology as exogenous. Since policies adopted to

combat climate change are likely to have a large impact on the pace and direction of

technological change, these models miss the important link between policy and innovation. In

this paper, I make use of empirical results on technological change in the energy industry (Popp

2002, 2001, 1998, 1997) to incorporate endogenous technological change into the DICE model

of climate change (Nordhaus 1994). In the model, technological change that enhances energy

efficiency is stimulated by changes in the price of energy, including carbon taxes. I use the new

model, named the ENTICE model (for ENdogenous Technological change), to compare the

overall global welfare costs of carbon policy to the results of models in which technological

change is exogenous. I show that ignoring induced innovation overstates the welfare cost of

reducing carbon emissions. However, cost-savings appear to drive the welfare gains, as the

effect of induced innovation on emissions and mean global temperature is small. Sensitivity

analysis reveals that market imperfections and potential crowding out effects limit the overall

effect of endogenous technological change.

       To date, few models of climate change include endogenous technological change that

affects carbon emissions. The most prominent examples of models with endogenous

technological change are Goulder and Schneider (1999), Nordhaus (2002), and Buonanno et al.

(2003). However, none of the existing models make use of empirical estimates on the nature of

technological change to calibrate the model. I use the estimates obtained in previous work to

guide the development and calibration of a model of endogenous technological change that is

supported by empirical evidence.

         Although the DICE model is a greatly simplified macroecomic representation of the

global economy and the environment, its use offers two advantages for this work. First, because

of its relative transparency, sensitivity analysis of key assumptions is straightforward. Existing

models of technological change and the environment include differing assumptions about

features such as imperfect research markets and the potential crowding out effects of energy

R&D.      I use the ENTICE framework to provide a detailed sensitivity analysis of these

assumptions. Second, since the DICE model framework explicitly models both the costs and

benefits of greenhouse gas reduction, I hope to provide a better understanding of how

consideration of endogenous technological change affects the optimal policy decision. One can

imagine two offsetting effects of endogenizing R&D. Increased innovation allows a given

abatement target to be achieved more easily, thus lowering the carbon tax needed to meet a given

emission target. At the same time, lower abatement costs make greater emissions reductions

feasible, offsetting the desire to lower the carbon tax.1 Using the DICE model framework, I

solve for the optimal path of carbon taxes with and without endogenous technological change.

         The paper begins with a review of the literature on induced innovation and the

environment.       A discussion of existing climate models with induced technological change

follows. Section II presents the modifications to the DICE model necessary to endogenize

technological change in the energy sector. Two policy simulations are presented in section III:

one representing an optimal policy, in which the marginal benefits and marginal costs of carbon

emission abatement are equal, and one restricting global emissions to 1995 levels. Section IV

includes sensitivity analysis on key assumptions, and uses this analysis to contrast the results of

 In a theoretical model, Goulder and Mathai (2000) find that the first effect dominates, justifying a lower carbon tax
when innovation is considered. Parry (1995) offers a similar conclusion.

ENTICE and other climate change models with endogenous technological change. Section V

concludes.



I. Literature Review

A. Induced Innovation and Environmental Policy

        In this paper, I endogenize technological change by including policy-induced innovation

in the energy sector. The notion of induced innovation was first introduced by Hicks (1932),

who noted that changes in factor prices would lead to innovation to economize on usage of the

more expensive factor. In the environmental literature, the relationship between innovation and

policy has been explored under two broad themes.2 Papers such as Magat (1978), Milliman and

Prince (1989), and Fisher et al. (1998) use theoretical models to compare the effects of various

environmental policy mechanisms (e.g. command and control regulation, emissions taxes, or

tradable permits) on environmentally-friendly innovation. In general, these papers predict that

market-based policies, such as a tax or tradable permit, will induce more environmentally-

friendly innovation than a command and control policy.

        Recently, empirical economists have begun to estimate the effects that prices and

environmental policies have on environmentally-friendly innovation. Both Lanjouw and Mody

(1996) and Jaffe and Palmer (1997) find correlations between pollution abatement expenditures

and measures of environmental innovation. Jaffe and Palmer (1997) estimate a positive elasticity

of pollution control R&D with respect to pollution control expenditures of 0.15.

        Other papers use energy prices and related regulations as the mechanism that induces

innovation. Although the observed price changes might not be policy-related, the results can be


2
 A comprehensive survey of the literature on technological change and the environment may be found in Jaffe,
Newell, and Stavins (2003).
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                         4


applied to situations where policy affects prices, such as a carbon tax. Using hedonic techniques

to study the effect of energy prices and energy efficiency regulations on air conditioners and

natural gas water heaters, Newell et al. (1999) find energy prices to have the largest technology

inducement effect. However, they do not estimate a price elasticity. Popp (2002) uses patent

data from 1970-1994 to estimate a long run price elasticity between energy prices and energy

patents of 0.35. Important for long-term modeling, Popp also finds evidence of diminishing

returns to this R&D, so that the effect of a carbon tax on R&D will be smaller in the long run.

Finally, Popp (2001) uses the same patent data to estimate the industrial energy savings resulting

from new energy patents. The average patent generates approximately 7.9 million dollars over

the life of a patent. To put this figure in perspective, consider that an average of 2.25 million

dollars of R&D is spent per patent in these energy fields.



B. Induced Innovation in Climate Change Models

         Despite the growing evidence that environmental policy influences the direction of

technological change, few climate change models directly incorporate links between policy and

technology.3 Those that do typically model innovation in one of two ways. Bottom-up models

include a detailed specification of energy systems. These models typically do not include

detailed modeling of the overall macroeconomy, and typically model induced technological

change in a learning-by-doing framework, in which the costs of various technologies decrease

with experience. Examples include Gerlagh and van der Zwaan (2003), Manne and Richels


3
  The results of Chakravorty, Roumasset, and Tse (1997) show why considering the link between policy and
technological change is important. They present a simulation showing that the development of alternative fuels
lowers the projected temperature increases caused by global warming from 3-6 degrees centigrade to just 1-2
degrees centigrade. Unfortunately, they do not model the development of such technologies, but rather assume that
they continue to develop at historical rates. Since much of the development of alternatives such as solar energy
occurred during the period of high energy prices during the late 1970s, assuming that historical rate of technological
progress will continue without policy stimulation is unrealistic, and may lead to overly optimistic results.

(2002), Grübler and Messner (1998), and Messner (1997). Top-down models focus on the links

between environmental policy and macroeconomic performance. Endogenous technological

change in these models typically comes through accumulated investment in research and

development (R&D). Recent models of this nature include Goulder and Schneider (1999),

Nordhaus (2002), and Buonanno et al. (2003). The ENTICE model builds on the work of the

top-down models.

        Goulder and Schneider’s model is a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model

including both a carbon-based energy sector and an alternative energy sector. They find induced

R&D lowers the cost of achieving a given abatement target, but also increases the gross costs

(costs before accounting for environmental benefits) of the carbon tax, as the economy now

responds more elastically to the tax. They do conclude that the net benefits of a carbon tax are

larger when induced innovation is considered—the cost of achieving any given level of

abatement is lower when induced innovation is included in the model.4

        Nordhaus (2002) introduces the R&DICE model, a variant of the global DICE model

using a fixed proportions production function to model induced technological change. R&D is

modeled as shifting the minimum level of carbon/energy inputs required for production. Factor

substitution is not allowed in the model. As a result, Nordhaus is able to compare the role of

induced innovation to the role of factor substitution in reducing greenhouse emissions.

However, he is not able to combine the two effects to show how the optimal carbon tax is

affected. Nordhaus concludes that induced innovation is less important than factor substitution

for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.              In comparison, Buonanno et al. (2003) introduce

technological change to the RICE model, which is a regional version of the DICE model. They


4
  These cost savings can be significant. For example, the cost of achieving a 30% reduction in cumulative emissions
falls by nearly 25% using their central case parameter values.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                 6


find that technological change is able to significantly lower abatement costs in this model,

although the exact magnitude varies by region and whether or not trading of emissions rights is

allowed.

        One key difference in the approaches used by Nordhaus and Buonanno et al. is the

assumption each makes about the potential opportunity costs of R&D. Nordhaus assumes that

there is a fixed amount of total R&D spending in the economy. Thus, any increases in energy

sector R&D must come at the expense of R&D aimed at increasing the overall level of

productivity.    In contrast, Buonanno et al. model a single R&D stock, which accumulates

endogenously. The accumulated stock of R&D has two effects: it increases total factor

productivity and decreases the carbon intensity of the economy. Thus, rather than policy-

induced R&D crowding out other research efforts, in their model policy-induced R&D actually

enhances overall productivity as well!

         A look at recent data suggests that neither assumption is correct. Figure 1 presents data

on energy R&D and non-energy R&D performed by U.S. industries from 1972-1998. The data

are normalized so that 1982 = 100. Although increases in energy R&D do lead to decreases in

non-energy R&D, there is no evidence of a dollar for dollar tradeoff.5 Rather, the data suggest

only partial crowding out occurs.

        To improve upon the results of these papers, my model includes a specification of

production that allows for both endogenous technological change and factor substitution. As

such, I am able to study how endogenous technological change affects the optimal policy



5
  Further evidence can be found by regressing non-energy R&D on energy R&D. Complete crowding out results in
a coefficient of –1 on energy R&D. Using data from 1972-1998, and correcting for autocorrelation, I obtain the
following regression results (standard errors in parenthesis):
         non-energy R&D = -9320.351478 –0.41energy R&D + 19.82GDP + ε
                                (4762.59) (1.09)               (0.73)
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                         7


decision. In addition, the model will be calibrated based on empirical estimates of energy-saving

R&D derived in previous work. These studies show that the reaction of R&D to changes in

energy prices is quick, but that it may not be long-lasting, as there are diminishing returns to

R&D over time. Finally, the model is set up to allow straightforward sensitivity analysis of the

opportunity cost of energy R&D. The results show that assumptions on this opportunity cost

have a significant effect on the magnitude of the welfare gains possible from induced innovation.



II. The Model

           I begin by modifying the latest version of Nordhaus’ DICE model (Nordhaus 2000) to

accommodate induced technological change. The DICE model (Nordhaus 1994, 2000) is a

dynamic growth model of the global economy that includes links between economic activity,

carbon emissions, and the climate. A related model, the RICE model, extends the DICE model to

include 13 regions of the world. Documentation of the most recent modifications of the model

(RICE-99 and DICE-99) can be found in Nordhaus and Boyer (2000).6

           My model, the ENTICE model (for ENdogenous Technological change), combines

features of both models. In particular, following the RICE-99 framework, I model carbon-based

energy sources as an input to production, rather than a by-product requiring control. However, I

use the global framework of the DICE model, rather than the regional framework of the RICE

model. This offers a couple of advantages. Most importantly, a particular goal of this research is

to calibrate technological change in a way that is consistent with existing empirical studies.

Calibrating a regional model would not only require estimates of induced innovation that varied

by region, but also information on flows of knowledge across regions. Given the limited

empirical evidence available, calibrating a regional model is left for future research. In addition,

the DICE model is simpler in structure, and thus is more accurate for long-time frames

(Nordhaus and Boyer 2000). Because of the long-term nature of technological change, trading

off regional detail for greater long-term accuracy seems worthwhile.

        In both the DICE and ENTICE models, the goal of the model is to maximize per capita

utility, equation (1), subject to the economic constraints below [equations (2)-(10)].7

                              T
(1)               max V = ∑ U t [ct , Lt ]Rt
                             t =0


In this equation, Ut represents utility at time t, ct is per capita consumption, Lt represents

population, and is also the measure of labor inputs. Rt is a discount factor to represent the rate of

time preference.8

        The objective function, (1), is maximized subject to the following constraints. First,

production is defined. The ENTICE model follows the RICE model by including emissions as

an input to the production process. Below, Qt represents output produced at time t. Overall

technological progress comes through changes in total factor productivity, At. In addition to

labor, other inputs are the physical capital stock, Kt, and Ft, which represents the level of fossil

fuels used at time t. The cost of these fuels is pF. Et is a measure of effective energy units that

  As many economists have recently noted, discount rates that seem appropriate for single-generation projects may
be inappropriate for long term projects that span several generations. Although there is no consensus on how to deal
with this problem, a constantly declining discount factor is consistent with suggestions that a lower discount rate
should be used for the distant future. Thus, following Nordhaus, the pure rate of social time preference, R, declines

accounts for both fossil fuel inputs and technological change in the energy sector. The cost of

these fossil fuels are subtracted from total output in the ENTICE model:9

(2)               Qt = At K tγ L1t−γ − β Etβ − p F Ft

         Labor is determined by exogenous population growth. The capital stock, Kt, equals the

sum of current investment, It, and the previous capital stock, adjusted for depreciation, δ:

(3)               Kt = It – δKt-1.

In equilibrium all output must go to either consumption or investment, so that:

(4)               Qt = Ct + It.

         To begin, consider the case of exogenous technological change only. Following the

RICE model, exogenous technological improvement comes through changes in the ratio of

carbon emissions per unit of carbon services, Φt. Φt increases over time as defined below, where

gtz is the growth rate of Φt per decade, and δz is the rate of decline of this growth rate. Given

this, actual carbon emissions are represented in the model as:

                         Ft
(5)               Et =      , where
                         Φt

                             g z
                  Φ t = exp  tz
                                     
                                      (         (
                                      1 − exp − δ z t   ))
                             δ                          

The parameters defining Φt are calibrated to match the emissions path of the DICE model.

         Since the ENTICE model includes carbon-based energy as an input to production, it is

necessary to include a cost for this input. Following the RICE model, the price of carbon is the

sum of the marginal cost of carbon extraction, qF, and a markup that captures the difference




9
  Energy consumption, represented by fossil fuel usage, F, is measured in tons of carbon. The price of fossil fuels is
thus the price per ton of carbon.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                        10

between consumer prices and the marginal costs of extraction. Nordhaus notes that this markup

includes transportation costs, distribution costs, and current taxes.

(6)        PF = qF + markup

In the RICE model, the markup varies by region. To adopt this parameter for the global

ENTICE model, I use a weighted average of regional markups from RICE, weighting by each

region’s share of total carbon consumption in the base year. This value equals 163.29.

           Following Nordhaus, the marginal cost function, qF, takes the following form:

(7)         q F = 113 + 700[CumC t / CumC*] 4


CumCt represents cumulative carbon extraction up to year t, and CumC* represents the

maximum possible extraction. In this equation, the marginal cost independent of exhaustion is

$113 per ton. Marginal costs increase as extractin increases. Note that the price equation is

extremely convex – the carbon price equation is relatively elastic in the short run.10

           Having added carbon fuels as an input to production in the DICE model, the next step is

to add induced technological change to the ENTICE model. For this, I create a stock of

knowledge that relates to energy efficiency. Similar to a physical capital stock, this knowledge

capital stock is created by the accumulation of previous research and development (R&D) in the

manner described below.

(8)                 H E ,t = h( RE ,t ) + (1 − δ H ) ⋅ H E ,t −1 ,                        i = A,E

           Equation (8) states that the stock of knowledge, HE,t, increases due to increases in R&D

net depreciation of old knowledge. The function h(RE,t) is the innovation possibility frontier. It

models the process by which energy R&D, RE,t, creates new knowledge. The parameter δH

allows for the possibility of knowledge decay over time.


10
     A more detailed discussion of the derivation of these parameters can be found in Nordhaus and Boyer (2000).
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                             11

         As noted earlier, empirical work suggests that there are diminishing returns to energy

research over time. The assumption here is that, since energy R&D is specialized within a given

field, it becomes more and more difficult to find new inventions as the knowledge frontier moves

out. Thus, any functional form for the innovation possibility frontier must have the following

properties. First, the derivative of h with respect to R should be positive, but the second

derivative should be negative, so that there are diminishing returns to research at any given time.

In addition, the derivative ∂2H/∂R∂H should be negative, so that there are diminishing returns to

research over time. One functional form that satisfies these assumptions is a constant elasticity

relationship between research and knowledge:

(9)                h(RE,t) = aRbE,tHφE,t

A similar innovation possibilities frontier is often used in the endogenous growth literature.11

Equation (9) satisfies the two assumptions regarding diminishing returns to R&D as long as both

b and φ are between 0 and 1.

         Having defined this stock of knowledge, total energy use is now modeled as a

combination of carbon-based fossil fuels and energy-related human capital.                                Energy-based

human capital can be thought of as knowledge that allows output to be produced with less carbon

emissions, either because of increased energy efficiency or more effective emissions control:

   See, for example, Jones (1995) and Porter and Stern (2000). Romer’s (1990) original specification of the
endogenous growth model is a special case of this where φ = 1. By setting φ = 1, Romer generates increasing
returns to knowledge over time. While this may be appropriate for macro-level R&D, for more specific R&D in a
given field, it is reasonable to assume that the returns fall over time as the pool of potential ideas in the field dries up
[see, for example, Griliches (1989 p. 317)]. Popp (2002) uses energy patent citations to provide evidence of
diminishing returns to energy R&D.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                   12

       Equation (10) states that the total energy requirements for production must be met either

by the use of fossil fuel or by technological advances that substitute for fossil fuels. The

technological advances may be thought of as improvements in the energy efficiency of existing

production processes, as fuels that are substitutes for fossil fuels, or as improvements in

emissions control technology. In this equation, ρ represents the ease of substitution between

fossil fuels and knowledge.      The case of perfect substitution is ρ = 1. The elasticity of

substitution between them is 1/(1–ρ). αH is a scaling factor that determines the level of energy

savings resulting from new energy knowledge.        αΦ is a scaling factor for any remaining

exogenous reductions in carbon intensity.

       The scaling factor αΦ is included to allow for other potential exogenous changes that may

lower carbon intensity (the carbon/output ratio). The R&D modeled through the innovation

possibilities frontier captures purposeful short-term efforts to improve energy efficiency or

otherwise reduce carbon emissions. However, such R&D is not the only way in which carbon

intensity falls over time. Examples of other potential influences on carbon intensity include

changes in consumption patterns and switching to less carbon intensive fuels (e.g. from coal to

oil to natural gas) over time.    Because the DICE model and its variants are a one-sector

macroeconomic growth model, such changes are not explicitly modeled. As Nordhaus calibrates

exogenous technological change based on historical rates of decarbonization, it is impossible to

separate out these effects from the effects of R&D in his rate of exogenous technological change.

Removing these exogenous influences from the model completely would not only remove the

results of any energy R&D included in Nordhaus’ calibration, but also would remove the effect
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                         13

of these other long-term changes in carbon intensity. As a result, long-run emissions simulated

without any exogenous decline in carbon-intensity are unrealistically high.12

         Because of the public goods nature of knowledge, the role of market failures in R&D

must be considerd. Virtually all empirical studies of R&D find that the social returns to R&D

are greater than the private returns to R&D.13 Since firms will invest until the private rates of

return to R&D are equal to the rates of returns on other investments, underinvestment in R&D

will occur. To model the positive externalities that result from the creation of new knowledge,

the private return on R&D investment is constrained to be four times that of investment in

physical capital.14

         Finally, we need to account for the opportunity cost of R&D. First, equation (4) is

modified to include R&D:

(4’)              Qt = Ct + It + RE,t

Second, the potential effects of crowding out must be considered. The opportunity cost of a

dollar of energy R&D is that one less dollar is available for any of three possible activities:

consumption, physical investment, or investment in other R&D. The opportunity costs of the

first two are simply valued at one dollar. However, since the social rate of return on R&D is four

times higher that of other investment, losing a dollar of other R&D has the same effect as losing

four dollars of other investment. Thus, the price of any research that crowds out other research is

four dollars.


12
   Fortunately, sensitivity analysis suggests that the percentage of exogenous technological change remaining does
not affect the net economic impact of induced technological change. The intuition is that it is the level of R&D
induced between an exogenous and endogenous R&D simulation that affects this difference. Changing the scaling
factor only changes the level of emissions in each simulation, but not the difference between them. This is discussed
more thoroughly in the sensitivity analysis presented in section IV.
13
   There is a large body of empirical work that verifies the social returns to R&D are greater than the private returns.
Examples include Mansfield (1977, 1996), Pakes (1985), Jaffe (1986), and Hall (1995).
14
   This is done by calculating the marginal products of physical capital investment and energy R&D, and
constraining the latter to be four times higher than the former.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                         14

         To implement this, four dollars of private investment are subtracted from the physical

capital stock for each dollar of R&D crowded out by energy R&D, so that the net capital stock

is:

(3’)              Kt = (It – 4*crowdout*RE,t)– δKt-1,

where crowdout represents the percentage of other R&D crowded out by energy R&D. The base

ENTICE model assumes 50% crowding out.

         To calibrate the R&D sector of the ENTICE model, several new parameter values are

needed. These include:

         • the initial value of energy research, RE0. This value is 10 billion dollars.15

         • ρ, the substitution parameter in equation (10),

         • parameters in the invention possibilities frontier (9): a, b, and φ, and

         • the initial level of energy human capital, HE0,16

         • αΗ , the scaling factor for the effect of this human capital, and

         • αΦ , the percentage of exogenous reductions in carbon intensity remaining.

         I calibrate these parameters to yield results consistent with empirical work on induced

innovation in the energy sector. I focus on several key results:

         • Estimates of the elasticity of energy R&D with respect to changes in energy prices

            suggest that the response is inelastic. Using a distributed lag model, Popp (2002) finds

            a long run elasticity of 0.35. In a similar study, Jaffe and Palmer (1997) estimate an



15
   To get this value, I begin with an estimated level of total global spending on R&D of $500 billion. This figure is
based largely on data from OECD countries. Energy R&D data is not available on a global basis. However, it is
available for the United States. In the U.S., two percent of R&D spending in 1995 went to energy-related R&D.
The $10 billion figure used in this paper is simply two percent of the global level of R&D. This figure is also close
to the initial value of R&D used by Nordhaus (1999).
16
   Note that, since human capital enters the invention possibilities frontier multiplicatively, the initial value cannot
be zero.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                      15

            elasticity of pollution control R&D with respect to pollution control expenditures of

            0.15.

        • There are diminishing returns to energy R&D. Although energy prices peaked in

            1982, patenting activity in these energy-related technologies began to drop during the

            late 1970s. Popp (2002) provides evidence that this decline can be explained by

            diminishing returns to R&D over time. Thus, the inducement effect of energy prices

            will fall over time.

        • Energy R&D has a significant impact on energy consumption. Using energy patent

            data from 13 energy-intensive industries, Popp (2001) finds that each new energy

            patent leads to 8 million dollars of energy savings. To put this figure in perspective,

            consider that an average of 2 million dollars of R&D is spent per patent in these

            energy fields – suggesting a 4:1 ratio of energy savings to energy R&D.17 This ratio is

            consistent with other empirical studies, such as those cited in footnote 13.

        • Both the response of energy R&D to price changes and the energy savings resulting

            from these new technologies occur quickly.                   Using the lag parameter from a

            distributed lag regression, Popp (2002) finds that mean lag for the effect of energy

            prices on energy patenting is 3.7 years, and the median lag is 4.9. In addition, the

            energy savings resulting from new patents occur quickly. Popp (2001) estimates rates

            of decay and diffusion for the knowledge embodied in new patents in 13 industries. It

            takes just three years for an invention represented by a patent application to have its

            maximum effect on energy consumption. Since the responses are fairly quick, and


17
  Popp (2001) is a micro-level study focusing on specific industries and technologies. Since the industries included
are energy-intensive industries, the total impact of energy R&D on the global economy may be somewhat smaller.
As a result, the sensitivity analysis includes results of simulations using a 2:1 ratio of energy savings to energy
R&D.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                       16

            since each time period in the ENTICE model represents one decade, I assume that the

            full effects of price changes on energy R&D occur within each decade.

         Table 1 lists the parameter values used for both the base case simulations, as well as for

various alternate scenarios considered in section IV. A complete discussion of the steps required

for calibration is available in an appendix.



III. Policy Simulations

         With the completed ENTICE model in hand, I proceed to simulate the results of imposing

a carbon emissions policy on the global economy. The goal in each simulation is to compare the

results of imposing a policy under exogenous technological change to the results of imposing a

policy under endogenous technological change in the energy sector. I simulate exogenous

technological change by restricting energy R&D to equal the levels found in a base-case no

policy simulation. In each, a carbon tax will be used as the policy instrument to achieve reduced

emissions.18 I calculate the net economic impact of a policy as the present value of consumption

under the policy minus the present value of consumption in the base case, in which carbon

emissions are uncontrolled. Two policy options are considered: an optimal policy in which the

marginal costs of carbon abatement equal the marginal environmental benefits of reduced carbon

emissions, and restricting emissions to 1995 levels. The more restrictive policy is included




18
   Of course, other policy instruments, such as international permit trading, have received more attention in recent
climate negotiations. In a global model such as ENTICE, trading among countries is not possible. Nonetheless,
since a successful permit market would equate marginal abatement costs across countries, a carbon tax set at the
marginal cost of abatement can also be thought to represent the price of a permit that would result. One difference is
that, under permit trading, new innovations would result in cost savings, but not in emissions reductions, since the
number of permits is fixed. A discussion of such a simulation follows.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                      17

because most climate policies proposed in the policy arena aim for far greater restrictions than

called for in an optimizing economic model.19



A. Optimal Policy

        Because the DICE model and its variants incorporate environmental damages into the

model, it is possible to calculate an optimal carbon policy, in which the marginal costs of carbon

abatement equal the marginal benefits of lower emissions. Typically, simulations involving

these models find that the optimal policy is to go slow. Since carbon emissions remain in the

atmosphere for several hundred years, the marginal damages resulting from any new emissions

are modest. Thus, gradually phasing in carbon reduction lowers the opportunity cost of reducing

emissions without having much impact on the global climate. As an example, Nordhaus and

Boyer (2000) calculate an optimal carbon tax in 2005 of $9.13 per ton.                           In comparison,

restricting emissions to 1990 levels would require a carbon tax of $52.48.

        The first row of table 2 shows the welfare gains for the optimal policy scenario.

Including endogenous technological change increases welfare by 8.3%. An optimal carbon tax

with exogenous technological change improves welfare by $1.74 trillion. This welfare gain

increases to $1.88 trillion when the effects of R&D induced by the policy change are considered.

        Although the effect of endogenous technological change on overall welfare is significant,

its effect on key economic and environmental variables is small. Table 3 provides more detail on

the effect of endogenous technological change on key variables. Note that the magnitude of the

optimal policy does not change when technology is endogenous. Both the optimal carbon tax


19
  For example, the Kyoto Protocol requires industrialized country emissions to be reduced by 5 to 8 percent below
1990 levels. Since the DICE model is global, capturing regional differences, such as the lack of restrictions on
developing countries, is not possible. Thus, I use a slightly higher global emissions constraint to allow for higher
emissions from developing countries.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                  18

and optimal control rate are virtually unchanged. Moreover, although emissions fall somewhat

when technological change is endogenous, the slight decrease in emissions has little effect on

average global temperature. Figure 2 plots the deviation from 1900 temperature levels with no

policy, optimal policy with and without endogenous R&D, and the more restrictive policy

limiting emissions to 1995 levels. Even including induced technological change, an optimal

carbon policy does not come close to reaching the temperature limits imposed by more restrictive

policies. There is almost no variation in global mean temperature between the endogenous and

exogenous R&D case. In fact, after 100 years the temperature is just 0.04% lower when the role

of endogenous technological change is included.

        One reason for the small change in atmospheric temperature is that much of the welfare

gains from induced technological change come from cost savings that make meeting

environmental goals cheaper.           To explore this further, I re-ran the model allowing for

endogenous energy R&D and a carbon tax, but fixing emissions in the policy run to equal those

found with exogenous R&D and a carbon tax. In this case, the only benefits coming from

increased energy R&D are potential cost savings, as emissions, and thus climate, do not change

from the exogenous R&D case.20 In this case, considering endogenous energy R&D increases

welfare by 8.1%, rather than the 8.3% increase found when emissions were allowed to change.

In the ENTICE model, the primary gains from energy R&D come not from climate

improvements, but from reducing the opportunity cost of reducing fossil fuel emissions.

        To help interpret the magnitude of the energy R&D performed in the simulations, Table 3

includes the level of energy R&D activity with both exogenous and endogenous R&D and the




20
  This simulation could also be thought of as the effect of using tradable permits, rather than a carbon tax, to
implement an “optimal” emissions path.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                   19

elasticity of energy R&D with respect to carbon price. 21 This figure is calculated for each year

based on the difference in both energy R&D and carbon prices in simulations with and without

policy. Based on the results of Popp (2002), the model is calibrated so that this elasticity equals

0.35 in 2005. Because diminishing returns to energy research reduce the inducement effect over

time, the elasticity of energy R&D falls over time, as shown in Figure 3.22 Thus, diminishing

returns to research have the effect of lowering energy R&D somewhat in the long-run.

        These results present a puzzle. The changes in individual variables are small, yet the

welfare gains are more significant. Examining the effect of the carbon tax on energy R&D helps

explain this finding. The additional induced R&D from the optimal carbon tax is small, as the

tax is just a small percentage of the overall price of carbon.23 In addition, energy R&D is just a

small part of the overall economy. Because energy R&D is a small part of the overall economy,

and the elasticity of energy R&D to energy prices is also small, adding induced innovation to the

DICE model has little effect on the optimal policy.                  Nonetheless, because knowledge is

cumulative, small changes in R&D in any given year have important long-run effects.

        The finding that technological change has just a small effect on these annual measures

emphasizes that it is important to look not at the change in individual variables, but at the overall

welfare change. Although the annual value of these benefits may be small, the accumulated

value over a 300-year time span is important. The creation of new knowledge not only offers

benefits to current generations, but also provides the building blocks for future research. As a

result, long-run welfare gains are larger with endogenous technological change.                         This is



21
   Recall that the level of energy R&D with exogenous technological change is simply the level of energy R&D
from the base case simulation without policy.
22
   To account for the effect of economic growth, all elasticities are calculated using the ratio of energy R&D to
output.
23
   For example, the $10.16 in 2005 is just 3.5 percent of the total price of carbon.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                          20

illustrated by Figure 4. Figure 4 compares the cumulative welfare gain in the endogenous and

exogenous technology cases.24 In the years immediately after implementation of a carbon tax,

benefits actually accumulate more quickly with exogenous technological change. Early on, the

opportunity cost of additional R&D reduces welfare gains. However, by 2125, the welfare gains

with endogenous technological change begin to outpace those with exogenous technological

change, with the difference between them soon stabilizing.

           To further illustrate the effects of additional R&D spending, Figure 5 shows the

accumulation of welfare gains over time resulting from an additional $1 billion energy R&D

spent in the base year of 1995. Note that welfare initially falls after the introduction of $1 billion

of energy R&D, before reaching an eventual increase of $5.12 billion.                             This 5:1 ratio is

consistent with the notion that the social returns to R&D should be significant, due to the public

goods nature of research.



B. Restricting Emissions to 1995 Levels

           Adding induced innovation to the ENTICE model also increases welfare in the more

restrictive carbon abatement policies, although the effect is smaller. Indeed, the net economic

impact of restricting emissions to 1995 levels is negative even with endogenous technological

change. Section B of Table 2 presents the net economic impact of these restrictions. Induced

innovation improves welfare by 5.6% under the more restrictive policy, compared to 8.3% under

the optimal policy. As shown in Figure 6, with either endogenous or exogenous energy R&D,

the net economic impact is initially positive, but becomes negative beginning in 2035. As the

restriction becomes more binding, requiring more control, the economic costs become too great



24
     That is, the figure shows the net economic impact of the optimal policy through the year given on the x-axis.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                       21

to justify the policy. For example, in 2025, the restrictive policy calls for a 29.1% reduction in

emissions, compared to 5.4% with the optimal policy.

       Innovation has a more limited effect under a restrictive policy because increased energy

R&D crowds out other investment.          To see this, note that net welfare gain from induced

innovation improves from 5.6% to 8.3% if no crowding out is assumed. A similar experiment in

the optimal policy scenario only increases the welfare gain from 8.3% to 9.5%.25 Stronger

emissions restrictions induce more R&D, which amplifies the welfare effects of crowding out.

       Table 3 shows how other variables change when energy R&D is endogenized. Including

induced innovation lowers the carbon tax needed to restrict emissions to 1995 levels by about

one percent. Unlike the optimal policy, emissions do not change after induced innovation is

included in the model, since this is a command and control policy. Thus, the changes in the

carbon tax provide a guideline as to how much tax rates could potentially fall in the optimal

scenario if the level of emissions did not change. As before, there is little change in the levels of

consumption and output between the endogenous and exogenous cases.



IV. Sensitivity Analysis

       In developing a model such as the ENTICE model, several key assumptions must be

made. To calibrate the model, future projections of energy R&D are based on historical energy

R&D performance. Although these are useful in providing a guide to future energy R&D

performance, there is no guarantee that energy R&D trends will remain the same. Thus, it is

important to consider the potential effects of changes in the behavior of the energy R&D sector.

Furthermore, critical assumptions about the behavior of the R&D sector, such as the potential

role of crowding out, also affect the results.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                         22

         In this section, I focus on the sensitivity of the model to key assumptions used to calibrate

the model.26 I begin by examining three assumptions about the R&D sector: the opportunity cost

of R&D, deviation between the private and social rates of return to R&D, and the decay rate of

knowledge. I then examine three key choices made in calibrating the model: the percentage of

exogenous R&D remaining, the elasticity of energy R&D, and the energy savings resulting from

such R&D. For each simulation, changes in the parameters were needed. Table 1 shows the

parameter assumptions for each scenario. Table 2 presents the net economic impact of each

scenario.



A. The Opportunity Cost of R&D

         The results of section III, along with previous research on induced innovation and climate

policy, suggest that the potential for energy R&D to crowd out other forms of R&D may limit

the gains from induced innovation. Goulder and Schneider (1999) first noted that models

ignoring such costs underestimate the costs of carbon policy.                       I examine this claim more

carefully here, and show that assumptions about the opportunity cost of R&D are crucial in

explaining the limiting role of induced technological change found by many recent models.

         In the ENTICE model, increases in the opportunity cost of energy R&D come from

potential crowding out of other, more general R&D. The base model assumes 50% of energy

R&D comes at the expense of other research opportunities. To examine the importance of this

25
  The sensitivity analysis in section IV provides more detail on the effect of crowding out.
26
   Although it is possible to check the sensitivity of the model to the individual R&D parameters, these results are
less meaningful, as the resulting energy R&D would not be consistent with real-world data. Upon changing one
parameter, it is possible to adjust more than one parameter at a time to get other patterns of energy R&D that closely
match the data. In these cases, the results are similar to those presented above. In general, changing any of the
R&D parameters has little effect. The only variable experiencing significant effects is energy R&D, but since
energy R&D is such a small portion of the total economy, other variables are not affected. The one exception is that
increasing the elasticity of substitution, ρ, increases the elasticity of energy R&D with respect to price, and thus the
level of R&D induced in each simulation. Sensitivity analysis based on this is presented below. Results of
sensitivity analysis for other individual parameters are available from the author by request.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                      23

assumption, I consider a low opportunity cost case with no crowding out, and a high opportunity

cost case with complete crowding out. In doing so, it is important to note that changing the

opportunity cost of R&D changes the level of energy R&D. However, the model is designed to

be calibrated to actual values of energy R&D. Thus, I present lower bound and upper bound

values for the sensitivity to potential crowding out effects. The upper bound scenario allows

R&D to adjust as a result of changes in the opportunity cost. This, for example, could be thought

of as the maximum gains possible from government policy that was able to alleviate potential

crowding out effects.27 As a lower bound, I run the model changing the opportunity cost of

R&D, but constrain energy R&D in each case to equal energy R&D in the corresponding base

case scenario. Here, for example, welfare gains in the low opportunity cost case should be

interpreted as the gains from removing the assumption of partial crowding out. They are not the

gains that would result if the government intervened to remedy the problem of partial crowding

out.

        Beginning with the optimal policy simulations, the upper bound scenarios suggest

policies that could alleviate potential crowding out effects would have large impacts.

Completely removing crowding out of R&D increases the welfare gain from induced innovation

in the optimal simulation from 8.3 percent to 43.6 percent. Similarly, simulations with complete

crowding out lead to just a 1.8% gain from induced innovation. The more conservative lower

bound simulations, which change the opportunity cost of R&D but constrain energy R&D to

historical levels, also suggest that assumptions about crowding out are important. However, the

magnitude of the effect is smaller. Assuming no crowding out increases the welfare gain from

induced R&D from 8.3% to 9.5% in the optimal simulation, whereas assuming full crowding out

27
  In these simulations, energy R&D levels change in both the base case and in the policy scenarios. The effect of
policy that addressed opportunity costs only in conjunction with a climate policy will fall in between the upper and
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                  24

lowers the gain from 8.3% to 7.6%.        In the more restrictive emissions policy case, the

opportunity cost is more harmful, since more R&D is induced by the policy change. Thus, as

discussed before, changes in the opportunity cost have a greater impact on net economic welfare

than with the optimal policy.

        These results suggest that assumptions about the opportunity cost of R&D are a key

difference among models. For example, Nordhaus (2002) assumes complete crowding out of

R&D, which limits the potential welfare gains from his model. In comparison, models such as

Buonanno et al. (2003) that do not include crowding out are more optimistic about the possible

effects of induced technological change. More importantly, this suggests that models using

learning-by-doing as the avenue for technological improvement will overstate the potential of

technological change, as such crowding out does not occur in learning by doing models.

Although such models have an opportunity cost to increasing investment in alternative energy

technologies, this cost is simply the loss of one dollar of potential investment elsewhere, as

opposed to the loss of more productive R&D funds from elsewhere in the economy. For

example, both Gerlagh and van der Zwaan (2003) and Manne and Richels (2002) use learning by

doing to model technological change, and both find welfare gains from technology to be

significantly higher than in ENTICE.28



B. Deviation Between the Private and Social Rate of Return

        The base model constrains the social rate of return on R&D to be four times greater than

that of the return on other investment. This assumption is consistent with the empirical finding

that firms underinvest in research, as they are unable to capture the entire social returns.


lower bounds.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                25

However, the problem of underinvestment could be addressed by subsidies to energy R&D, if

government investments in R&D are set so that all social returns are captured. Models that do

not include market failures, such as Buonanno et al. (2003) implicitly assume that government

R&D subsidies are sufficient to correct all market failures.

        Simulations removing the constraint on returns to R&D suggest that the returns on such

subsidies could be quite significant. The gain from ETC for the optimal policy improves to

14.0% when energy subsidies are considered. Only the upper bound of the low opportunity cost

scenario has a higher welfare gain. Similarly, adding R&D subsidies to the endogenous R&D

case increases the net welfare gain to seven percent in the more restrictive policy case.



C. Decay Rate

        Many models of R&D assume that the stock of accumulated knowledge decays over

time, due to obsolescence. The base model assumes no such decay, as such an assumption is

necessary for the base (no policy) run to accurately simulate both energy R&D and emissions

levels. Here, I evaluate the effect of knowledge decay by assuming a ten-percent decay of

knowledge. I consider two possible scenarios. In the first scenario, base emissions are calibrated

correctly, but long-run energy R&D levels are higher than justified by historical standards. This

is because some energy R&D now serves the purpose of simply replacing decayed knowledge,

rather than providing new energy savings. I calibrate the second scenario so that energy R&D

levels are consistent with historical levels. Since there is not enough R&D to replace decayed

knowledge in this instance, the resulting long-run emissions are higher than the base model.29

Not surprisingly, adding decay decreases the welfare gains from induced innovation, although

28
  Gerlagh and van der Zwaan (2003) report that welfare improves by a factor of three when learning-by-doing is
included. Manne and Richels find that cost fall from 42-72 percent when learning-by-doing is considered.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                    26

the effect is not large. In the first scenario, the welfare gain from endogenous energy R&D falls

from 8.3% to 7.1%. The effect of knowledge decay is more noticeable in the second scenario, in

which the welfare gain is only 4.4%.                 Similar results are found with the more restrictive

emissions policy.



D. Return to energy R&D

           The previous three subsections include sensitivity about assumptions made for modeling

the R&D sector. The remaining three subsections address sensitivity to the values used to

calibrate the model. Although these values are based on historical energy R&D performance,

there is no guarantee that energy R&D trends will remain the same. Understanding the potential

effects of changes in these values is crucial. The simulations suggest that assumptions about the

potential savings from energy R&D are most important.

           Following Popp (2001), in the base model I assume each dollar of energy R&D leads to

$4 of energy savings. Here, I re-calibrate the model assuming that each dollar of energy savings

leads to only $2 of energy savings. As would be expected, reducing potential energy savings in

half reduces the potential welfare gains from induced innovation by approximately one-half.

Welfare increases only 4.3% when energy R&D is endogenous, compared to 8.3% in the base

case.      Similarly, the welfare increase falls from 5.6% to 3.7% under the more restrictive

emissions policy. Thus, uncertainty about the potential savings resulting from future energy

R&D is an important consideration. Unfortunately, most simulations to not report the energy

savings that occur per dollar of R&D spending, so evaluation of other models on this important

assumption is not possible.30

E. Elasticity of R&D

       The base model is calibrated so that this elasticity equals 0.35 in 2005, and declines over

time. This is consistent with the results of Popp (2002). In this section, I re-calibrate the model

to yield elasticities approximately twice as high as those of the base case. Figure 3 shows the

elasticities in the base case and alternative scenario. Interestingly, doubling the response of

R&D does not have a large impact on welfare. Under an optimal carbon policy, the welfare

gains from induced innovation increase by just 6%, from 8.3% to 8.8%. One reason for the

small effect is that some of the gains are canceled by potential crowding out. When the

assumption of partial crowding out is removed, welfare gains rise by 33%, from 9.5% to 12.7%.

       Under a more restrictive carbon policy, changes in the elasticity appear more important.

Here, adding induced energy R&D increases welfare by 14.4%, compared to 5.5% in the base

case. Because the costs of a restrictive policy are much greater, a higher elasticity of energy

R&D with respect to energy prices leads to a significant increase in R&D under the restrictive

policy. Unfortunately, most other models do not report the elasticities resulting from parameter

choices, making evaluation of other models on this feature difficult.



F. Exogenous Reduction of Carbon Intensity

       One potential concern is that, in order to maintain realistic projections for baseline

emissions, much of the exogenous reduction of carbon intensity described in section II remains

in the model with endogenous R&D. This assumption is necessary for the base (no policy)

model to accurately simulate both the energy R&D sector and projected carbon emissions. It

does not, however, affect the potential welfare gains from induced innovation. As Figure 7

shows, lowering this percentage leads to significantly higher levels of long run emissions.

However, what matters for the welfare gains is not the baseline level of emissions, but rather the
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                      28

changes that occur when policy is enacted, both with and without endogenous technological

change.     Since the level of induced R&D does not change much, the welfare gains from

endogenous R&D are similar to the previous results, with a net economic impact of 7.1%.31



V. Discussion

         These results suggest that omitting induced innovation from the DICE model overstates

the costs of complying with carbon change policies. Using the base parameters, welfare under

an optimal carbon tax improves by 8.3% when induced innovation is considered. Furthermore,

the model allows for straightforward testing of key assumptions about knowledge markets. Most

important is the finding that removing crowding out may lead to large increases in welfare. This

calls into question the results of models such as Buonanno et al. (2003), that not only do not have

crowding out of R&D, but allow for complementarities between energy R&D and other forms of

R&D. In addition, it suggests that modeling technological change solely by learning by doing

overstates the potential of new technologies to lower cost.32

         In addition, assumptions about market failures in knowledge markets are important.

When R&D is left to the private sector, the inability to completely appropriate returns will lead

to underinvestment. Removing the deviation between private and social rates of return in the

model increases the net welfare gain to 14%. Thus, models that neglect to include some notion

of R&D market failure will provide more optimistic results. While such results are attainable, it

is important to note that R&D subsidies from government would typically be needed for that to

occur.

31
   Alternatively, one can calibrate the model so that emissions fit the desired pattern by having R&D rise
substantially to adjust for the lack of exogenous technological change. This leads to a more significant increase in
welfare, but also very unrealistic R&D levels. For example, energy R&D is 300% higher in 2005 in this simulation.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                                  29

        The results of this paper suggest several important lessons for policymakers tempted to

rely on technology as a cure-all for climate change. First, and most obvious, is that these

technological gains will not occur without some policy signal to innovators that energy

efficiency research will be profitable. Second, although induced innovation can lower the cost of

any climate change strategy, the effect on the environment was minimal. Most of the welfare

gains from induced innovation in the optimal policy scenario came from cost savings, not

temperature reductions. Achieving significant reductions in future warming will not be possible

without restrictive climate change policies. As the simulations restricting emissions to 1995

levels show, these are likely to come at a cost to society, even when the potential of induced

innovation is realized.

        Third, as other researchers have also noted (see, for example, Goulder and Schneider

1999), new energy research comes at a cost, as other investments are reduced. In particular, any

reductions in other R&D will limit the welfare gains from new energy R&D. As shown in the

sensitivity analysis, going from complete crowding out of other R&D to no crowding out of

other R&D increases the potential welfare gains from induced innovation by as much as a factor

of five. More research on both the magnitude of any crowding out that may occur, as well as

policies that could help alleviate crowding out, would both be helpful.

        Fourth, the limiting effect of market failures in R&D markets suggest that R&D subsidies

and government financed R&D could improve the potential gains from new technologies. In

deciding on government R&D projects, policymakers can focus on the social, rather than private

rates of return. As shown in the sensitivity analysis, doing so could increase the potential gains

from induced technology by nearly two-thirds.


32
  This is not to say that learning-by-doing is not important. Rather, it is that learning-by-doing should not be
modeled as the only way in which technology evolves.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                           30

           Finally, limitations of the ENTICE model must be discussed. First, by modeling the

world as a single region, the ENTICE model simplifies policy dramatically. Expanding these

results to a regional model, based on Nordhaus’ RICE model, would be beneficial. However, to

do so would require research on how innovative effects vary by region, and how technology

diffuses across regions. In general, new innovations are developed in the industrialized world

and diffuse slowly to developing countries. For example, of the $500 billion spent on R&D in

the 28 OECD countries in 1997, 85% occurred in just 7 countries (National Science Board,

2000).

           Second, the ENTICE model only includes innovation designed to improve energy

efficiency. Yet, one of the most important long-term research goals is providing alternative fuels

that provide an emissions-free energy alternative. Policies such as a carbon tax are likely to

induce R&D aimed at substitutes for fossil fuels, such as solar energy. In fact, the energy crisis

of the 1970s led to a dramatic increase in R&D for alternative fuels. By speeding the invention

of a non-carbon based backstop technology, induced innovation may have a more significant

effect than is found in the ENTICE model.33 Adding such backstop technologies to the model is

another important step for future research.

           Third, the ENTICE model does not include uncertainty. Not only are the future returns to

R&D uncertain, but the potential impact of climate change itself is also uncertain. Uncertainty

may produce an option value for increased R&D, which could provide a cushion should the

climate problem turn out to be more severe than anticipated. Adding endogenous technological

change to a model allowing for uncertain climate effects, such as Nordhaus and Popp (1997),

would be a useful extension.

The figure shows the cumulative gains in welfare from an optimal carbon tax. Note that welfare in the induced innovation is initially
lower than exogenous R&D, but that induced innovation leads to larger long run improvements than in a simulation with exogenous
technological change.

The figure shows the welfare effects of an additional $1 billion of energy R&D spent in 1995. The initial effects are negative, as the
immediate environmental benefits do not justify the opportunity cost of additional energy R&D. However, by also enhancing the
productivity of future R&D, the cumulative effect of marginal energy R&D is positive.

The table shows the net economic impact, measured by the difference in the present value of
consumption between the policy and a no policy simulation, for various model scenarios. The
table shows the net economic impact with both endogenous and exogenous energy R&D, as well
as the increase in welfare resulting from endogenizing energy R&D. Base case results are
presented in section III, and the remaining trials are presented in the sensitivity analysis of
section IV. The top half of the table shows the net economic impact for an optimal carbon
policy, and the bottom half shows the impact for a policy restricting emissions to 1995 levels.

                              Appendix B – Calibration of the ENTICE Model



           This appendix describes the steps taken to calibrate the ENTICE model. As a global

macroeconomic model, ENTICE uses Nordhaus’ DICE model (2000) as its basic building block.

Since the current version of Nordhaus’ DICE model does not include carbon emissions as an

input, but rather simply models emissions as a byproduct of output requiring control, the first

step to constructing the model is to add a fossil fuel sector that mimics the behavior of the

original DICE model. I do this using the same modeling structure as Nordhaus’ RICE model,

except that I apply the equations at a global, rather than regional, level. Key equations of the

economic sector of the DICE model, along with the modifications necessary to include carbon

emissions as an input, are included in the modeling appendix. I calibrate this basic model, with

no energy R&D, so that the results are comparable to Nordhaus’ DICE model. To begin, I take

the initial value of F from the latest version of the DICE model. I then solve for initial values of

A and K that reproduce the initial output found in the DICE model. Next, I calculate the

elasticity of output to with respect to energy, β, as the percentage of output spent on fossil fuels

in the initial period, using the 1995 price of carbon based on equations (6) and (7).34 Finally, the

growth rate of Φ, gz (-15.49), and the rate of decline of this growth rate, γz (23.96), are chosen to

produce an emissions path as close as possible to the DICE model. These values represent the

rate of exogenous decline in carbon intensity without any energy R&D in the model. Figures B1

and B2 compares the emissions and output that result from this calibration.

           Having added carbon fuels as an input to production in the DICE model, the next step is

to add induced technological change to the ENTICE model. The modeling for this stage is

described the main text of the paper. Calibration requires choosing values for the following

parameters:

         • the initial value of energy research, RE0.

         • ρ, the substitution parameter in equation (10),

         • parameters in the invention possibilities frontier (9): a, b, and φ, and

         • the initial level of energy human capital, HE0,35

         • αΗ , the scaling factor for the effect of this human capital, and

         • αΦ , the percentage of exogenous technological change remaining.

         To calibrate the energy R&D sector, three goals must be met. First, R&D levels should

be consistent with historical levels. A starting value of $10 billion is chosen for the base year of

1995. To get this value, I begin with an estimated level of total global spending on R&D of $500

billion. This figure is based largely on data from OECD countries. Energy R&D data is not

available on a global basis. However, it is available for the United States. In the U.S., two

percent of R&D spending in 1995 went to energy-related R&D. The $10 billion figure used in

this paper is simply two percent of the global level of R&D. This figure is also close to the

initial value of R&D used by Nordhaus (2002).

         Second, the behavior of energy R&D should be consistent with empirical studies both

across time and across policy dimensions. Based on Popp (2002), I use an elasticity of energy

R&D with respect to energy prices of 0.35 for the base model. As the price of carbon rises over

time, the time path of energy R&D should follow the path predicted by this value as closely as

possible.36 In addition, elasticities of energy R&D calculated on differences in the carbon price

35
   Note that, since human capital enters the invention possibilities frontier multiplicatively, the initial value cannot
be zero.
36
   Note that, to account for growth in the level of economic activity, all elasticities are calculated based on a ratio of
energy R&D to global output.
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                      B3

with and without a carbon tax in the optimal policy simulation should also equal 0.35. Since the

goal of this paper is to explore the consequences of omitting endogenous technological change

from earlier climate change models, when these two goals are incompatible, the second takes

precedence.    Furthermore, since Popp (2002) also notes that energy R&D experiences

diminishing returns over time, the calibrated elasticity should fall over time. Figure B3 shows

the calibrated levels of energy R&D and what would be predicted by a constant elasticity over

time of 0.35. Figure 3 in the main text shows the elasticity across the policy outcomes.

       Finally, Popp (2001) estimates a 4:1 ratio on the returns to energy R&D. Thus, each

dollar of energy R&D should lead to a four dollar reduction in energy savings. The model is

calibrated so that a weighted average of energy savings each period (weighted by the discount

factors used in the model) produce a 4:1 ratio of energy savings to energy R&D.

       Using these goals as guidelines for choosing the parameters, I first choose the value of

HE0 to approximate baseline emissions in early years of the simulation. Next, I choose ρ to

approximate the elasticity of energy R&D between the no-policy and optimal policy simulations.

Third, the value of the scaling factor αH is chosen to yield the appropriate rate of return on

energy R&D. To calibrate the inventions possibility frontier, the value a is chosen so that the

change in energy R&D between 1995 and 2005 in the optimal policy simulation is consistent

with the elasticity of 0.35. Values of b and φ are chosen so that future elasticities fit the desired

time path – falling slowly in the near future due to diminishing returns to R&D. Once the

desired time path of R&D is calibrated, the scaling factor αΦ can be adjusted to change the level

of baseline emissions as appropriate. A value of 0.8 is used in the base model, meaning that 80

percent of exogenous technological change remains in the ENTICE model.                 As a result,

purposeful R&D efforts to improve energy efficiency are only a small portion of the changes that
ENTICE: Endogenous Technological Change in the DICE Model of Global Warming                   B4

take place over time to reduce energy intensity. Table 1 in the paper presents a complete list of
