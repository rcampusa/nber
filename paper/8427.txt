1        Introduction
To a first order, an emerging economy external crisis can be described as an event in
which a country‚Äôs international financing needs significantly exceed its international financial
resources. Given that these events are a ‚Äúfact-of-life‚Äù in these economies, it is puzzling that
domestic agents do not undertake measures to precaution against them. Indeed, quite the
contrary, they often increase the likelihood of these events by over-borrowing during capital
inflow booms, contracting dollar liabilities, and so on.
    A common explanation for this behavior is that it is due to distortions created by
anticipated official interventions, such as crony capitalism, fixed exchange rates, and IFI‚Äôs
bailouts.1
    We have argued elsewhere that the external underinsurance problem in these economies
is more structural in nature than one concludes from just pointing at potentially misguided
interventions. Underdeveloped financial markets, a basic feature of emerging economies,
leads to a distorted valuation of international resources that in turn leads to external un-
derinsurance. In this paper, we take this structure as given, and explore a series of canonical
solutions to the underinsurance problem. Since the strategies we discuss are all used in vary-
ing form by governments in emerging markets, our main interest is in providing guidance
on which strategies may work better under different constraints. We identify the strate-
gies that work within our model and discuss some of the difficulties they may encounter in
implementation.
    In our framework, when a country‚Äôs international financing needs exceed its international
collateral (or liquidity), the domestic price of the latter rises vis-√†-vis that of domestic
collateral (or liquidity). A depreciation of the exchange rate, for example, is a manifestation
of this phenomenon.2
    However, when domestic financial markets are underdeveloped ‚Äì in our terminology,
when the domestic collateral value of projects is less than their expected revenues ‚Äî agents‚Äô
external insurance decisions are distorted. The reason is that domestic agents in need of
external resources cannot transfer the full surplus generated by these resources to other
participants in domestic financial markets that do have access to the scarce external funds.
Thus, in equilibrium, the scarcity value of external resources is depressed, and private deci-
sions are biased against hoarding international liquidity and thereby insuring against these
events. The underinsurance with respect to external shocks takes many forms: excessive

        See Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2001c).


                                                      1
external borrowing during booms, a maturity structure of private debt that is distorted
toward the short term, dollarization of international liabilities, limited international credit
lines, and so on.3
    In this paper we study in a unified framework several of the main solutions to this
underinsurance problem. Section 2 presents the environment that we have used in earlier
work, and reproduces the result of collective external underinsurance in the competitive
equilibrium with only spot loan markets. One difference in the current model is that we
suppress all aggregate shocks. The reasons is that our focus is on domestic arrangements
to deal with the underinsurance problem. To keep matters simple, we do not discuss at all
international credit lines and other valuable insurance mechanisms that involve foreigners.4
Alternatively, one can think of our discussion as net of these external insurances. A binding
aggregate external constraint will be fully anticipated and still occur. External underinsur-
ance, in its many forms, will simply collapse into excessive international borrowing during
capital inflow booms.
    While aggregate shocks have no role in the analysis, idiosyncratic ones are central since
they generate the need for domestic financial transactions. Frictions in these transactions
are at the root of the external underinsurance problem. In section 3, we show that if
domestic agents are able to write complete insurance contracts with each other, the exter-
nal underinsurance problem disappears. More domestic insurance increases the distressed
firms‚Äô collateral ex-post, and hence their capacity to bid for the external resources held by
other domestics. In equilibrium, this raises the relative price of international to domestic
collateral, increasing the incentive to hoard international resources.
    An important aspect of financial underdevelopment, however, is the absence of these
private insurance markets. In section 4, we assume that idiosyncratic shocks are unobserved
so they cannot be written into insurance arrangements. We solve the mechanism design
problem associated with the private information constraint within our structure, and show
that the social planner can in principle get around this informational constraint and achieve
the competitive equilibrium with complete idiosyncratic insurance markets. We then turn
to implementation of the social planner‚Äôs mechanism. We begin by analyzing a solution
whereby private agents form a conglomerate and extend credit lines to each other. While
this arrangement is individually incentive compatible, it is not coalition incentive compatible
and hence is not robust to the presence of spot markets, as in Jacklin (1987). Finally, we

explore two sets of solutions that require government intervention: Capital flows taxation
or mandated international liquidity requirements, and sterilization of capital inflows. These
solutions can also work, but they are subject to other forms of the coalition incentive
compatibility problem as well.

2     A model of external underinsurance
We begin by laying out the model and describing the external underinsurance in the com-
petitive equilibrium with only spot loan markets. In the next sections we shall discuss how
this result is affected by better domestic insurance arrangements, or in their absence, by
centralized arrangements to directly deal with the external underinsurance problem.

2.1   The environment

Consider a three date, t = 0, 1, 2, economy with a single consumption good. There are two
classes of agents in the economy: a unit measure each of domestics and foreigners. Both
take as objective to maximize date 2 expected consumption of the good,
                                  U   = E[c2],       c2   ‚â• 0.
    Each domestic is an entrepreneur/manager who owns and operates a production tech-
nology within a firm. Investing c(k) units of the good at date 0 results in capital of k units,
where c(k) is strictly increasing, positive, and strictly convex with c(0) = 0, c (0) = 0.
                                                                                



    As part of the normal ongoing restructuring of an economy, one-half of the firms (ran-
domly chosen) need to re-inject resources into the firm at date 1 to achieve full output. Let
j ‚àà {i, d} be the type of the firm at date 1. Firms that are not hit by this idiosyncratic

shock are i-types (‚Äúintact‚Äù) and go on to produce date 2 output of Ak. Firms that receive
the shock are d-types (‚Äúdistressed‚Äù). Their output falls to ak, but by reinvesting I ‚â§ k
units of good, the d-firm can obtain I ‚àÜ additional units of goods at date 2. We normalize
‚àÜ = A ‚àí a, and assume that ‚àÜ > 1. With full reinvestment, I = k, a distressed firm
obtains the same output as an intact firm, Ak. In all cases of interest below, I < k, thus we
henceforth drop this maximum reinvestment constraint from our discussion (while ensuring
that it does not bind in our technical assumptions).
    The domestic economy has no goods at either date 0 or date 1. All investment needs
are met by importing goods from abroad, which are paid for with funds raised from loans.
We assume that foreigners have large endowments of goods at all dates, and have access to
storage with rate of return one.
    Firms face significant financial constraints. Neither the plants nor their expected output
are valued as collateral by foreigners. Instead, we assume that each domestic is endowed
with w units of a good that arrives at date 2 and can be pledged as collateral to a foreign
lender ‚Äî i.e. domestics can take out loans against w that will be enforced by international
courts. Tangibly, we might think of w as revenues from oil exports that reside in foreign
bank accounts.
                                                 4
Assumption 1 (International collateral)
Domestics may take on loans at either date 0 or date 1 from foreign lenders against the
international collateral of   w,   and must satisfy a full collateralization constraint:

                                              d0,f   + d1,f ‚â§ w.
   A domestic can also take on a loan from another domestic. Unlike foreigners, domestics
do accept the plants as collateral. However we shall assume that these contracts are also
imperfect in the sense that not all of the output of Ak is collateral.
Assumption 2 (Domestic debt and collateral)
We assume that domestic courts are additionally able to enforce domestic (local) debt con-
tracts up to an amount of     Œªak     where   Œª   ‚â§ 1. Thus, the domestic lending constraint is:
                               d0,l   + d1,l ‚â§ Œªak + w ‚àí (d0,f + d1,f )
    Assumptions 1 and 2 are how we define an emerging economy. Thus, we think of the
latter as an economy where pledgable assets are limited, and a large share of these assets
are part of domestic but not international collateral.
    We define an external crisis as a date 1 event in which the financing needs of the economy,
1 k, exceeds the international financial resources available to it, (w ‚àí d ). Since they are
2                                                                          0,f
not central to our concerns and results in this paper, we suppress all aggregate shocks. The
external crisis happens despite being fully anticipated. This simplifies our discussion and
means that external underinsurance will only take the form of overborrowing at date 0 (see
below). With some abuse of terminology, we will continue referring to the latter as external
underinsurance. The following assumptions on parameters guarantee that a crisis occurs
at date 1 in all the equilibria we study throughout the paper, and that there is external
underinsurance in the spot loan market equilibrium:

2.2   Spot loan markets

Let us begin by studying the equilibrium in this economy when agents are restricted to
borrowing via a sequence of spot loan contracts. Thus what we rule out for now are
domestic insurance arrangements.
                                                       5
    All of the investment needs of domestics (date 0 and date 1) have to be met by importing
goods from foreigners. The goods are paid for by issuing date 2 debt claims. Suppose that
each firm takes on foreign debt at date 0 of d0,f and invests all of these resources in building
a plant of size k. Since firms are ex-ante identical, without loss of generality we can assume
there is no domestic debt at time 0.
    A firm at date 1 finds itself either distressed or intact. If distressed, it borrows up to
its maximum international debt capacity in order to take advantage of the high return of
rebuilding/restructuring the firm:
                                              d1,f   = w ‚àí d0,f .
These resources are then invested until date 2, yielding d1,f ‚àÜ.
    After this, it must turn to intact domestic firms for funds. Intact firms have no output at
date 1 either, so they must borrow from foreigners if they are to finance the distressed firms.
This they can do up to their w ‚àí d0,f of financial slack. Unlike foreigners, domestics are
willing to lend to other domestic against their projects. Since firms can use this collateral
to borrow up to Œªak, we refer to this quantity as domestic collateral.
    Denote the gross interest rate in this domestic loan market as L1. Then the firm takes
out the maximum loan as long as ‚àÜ ‚â• L1 :
                                                d1,l   = Œªak.
                                                                                L1 ‚àÜ at date
As a result of domestic borrowing the firm raises dL11 for investment, to yield Œªak
                                                                ,l



2.
    Combining the above transactions, and taking into account that date 0 investment
yielded ak at date 2, the profits accumulating to this firm at date 2 are,
                              V
                                  d
                                      = (w ‚àí d0,f )‚àÜ + Œªak
                                                       L1
                                                           ‚àÜ + (1 ‚àí Œª)ak.
   Intact firms, on the other hand, have the opportunity to lend to distressed firms at date
1. As long as L1 ‚â• 1, the intact firm will borrow up to its maximum foreign debt capacity,
                                              d1,f   = w ‚àí d0,f ,
and invest these resources in the domestic loan market to yield L1. Denote x1 as the face
value of date 2 claims that the intact firm purchases. Then the intact firm makes date 2
profits of,
                 V
                     i
                         = x1L1 + Ak + (w ‚àí d0,f ‚àí d1,f ) = (w ‚àí d0,f )L1 + Ak.

   Finally, at date 0, firms are equally likely to be distressed or intact. Thus they solve,
                spot
                       = k,d
                         max       1 (w ‚àí d0,f )(L1 + ‚àÜ) + 1 A + (1 ‚àí Œª)a + Œªa ‚àÜ k

   The only market clearing condition is that the loans issued by distressed firms must
equal the loans purchased by intact ones:
                                               1 d1,l = 1 x1,                                    (1)

where the one half in front of each microeconomic decision reminds us that distressed and
intact firms form equally sized groups.
Definition.     Equilibrium      in the economy with only sequential spot loan markets consists
of decisions, (k, d0,f , d1,f , d1,l , x1) and the domestic interest rate, L1 . Decisions are optimal
given L1 , and given these decisions, the market clearing condition (1) holds.

    Figure 1 illustrates the market clearing. On the horizontal axis is the quantity of im-
ported goods lent by intact firms/borrowed by distressed firms. The vertical axis is the price
of loans L1. The supply is elastic at L1 = 1 up to the point that the intact firms saturate
their international collateral constraint of d1,f = w ‚àí d0,f , at which point it is completely
inelastic. Demand for loans is given by the curve, Œªak2L1 , which is downward sloping in L1 .
    It is easy to see from the figure that ‚àÜ ‚â• L1 ‚â• 1. The figure represents three alternatives
for demand: The highest dashed line is the case where there is sufficient domestic collateral
that ‚àÜ = 1; the middle solid line is the case where L1 lies strictly between one and ‚àÜ;
the lower dashed line is the case where Œª is small and as a result demand is so collateral
constrained that intact firms have excess supply of funds and the interest rate is one.
    The parameter assumptions in Technical Assumption 1 ensure that equilibrium will have
L1 strictly between ‚àÜ and one ‚Äî i.e. the solid line. In this case, substituting date 1 decisions

into the market clearing condition gives,
                                       L1   = w Œªak
                                                ‚àí d0,f .                                     (2)
    Note that L1 lies above the international interest rate of one. The reason for this is
the asymmetry between domestic and foreign agents embedded in assumptions 1 and 2. If
foreigners were willing to hold claims against Œªak, then arbitrage between these and foreign
assets would imply that L1 = 1. Alternatively, if w were large so that on the margin some
domestic investor was holding claims against both w and Œªak in their portfolio, then again
it must be that L1 = 1.
    Given this price, the first order condition for the date 0 program can be written as:
                                  + ‚àÜ A + (1 ‚àí Œª)a + L ‚àÜ

Proposition 1 Consider two economies indexed by Œª and Œª , where Œª > Œª . Then,
                                                                              

    The proposition highlights the role of Œª on welfare, decisions, and prices. Fixing k, from
the market clearing condition we can see that L1 is increasing in Œª. Thus as Œª rises, L1
rises toward the marginal product at date 1 of ‚àÜ. This has an important effect on date 0
decisions. A firm that decides to borrow less, is essentially ‚Äúsaving‚Äù these resources until
date 1. At date 1, these resources are either used internally to yield ‚àÜ, or lent externally,
in which case, despite the fact that the resources yield ‚àÜ to the borrower, the lender
only internalizes L1 of this return. Again, this occurs because the borrower is collateral
constrained. As Œª rises, the spread between ‚àÜ and L1 falls causing firms to save more at
date 0. This leads to greater investment at date 1 and welfare increases. Essentially, as Œª
rises prices are less distorted by the credit constraint and the intertemporal savings decision
better reflects marginal products.

3       Public information of types and date 0 domestic insurance
        markets
Our aim in this section is to show that welfare can be improved through the use of a domestic
insurance contract at date 0 that shuffles resources from intact to distressed firms at date
1.5 At first glance this may seem odd because at date 1 under our spot market equilibrium,
all of the international resources find their way into the hands of the distressed firms.
That is, intuition may suggest that the ex-post allocation cannot be enhanced by further
reallocating domestic collateral to distressed firms since the scarcity is on international
collateral, and this has already been fully transferred. However, in our setup, the welfare
gain from domestic insurance comes entirely from affecting the ex-post price of international
resources, L1 , and bringing this closer to ‚àÜ so that ex-ante the borrowing/investment
decision of k is less distorted. Moreover, reallocating ex-post wealth beyond what is needed
to set L1 = ‚àÜ, affects V i ‚àí V d , but not decisions, equilibrium, or ex-ante welfare.
Assumption 3 (Public information)
The shock at date 1 is public information and insurance contracts can be written contingent
on j .
     Consider the following domestic insurance contract: All firms sign a grand insurance
contract at date 0 with repayments in date 2 goods of x0,l (j), where x0,l (i) = ‚àíx0,l and
x0,l (d) = x0,l > 0. Since the types are observable, this contract can be made contingent on
type-j . Repayments are enforceable as long as,
                                          x0,l   ‚â§ w ‚àí d0,f + Œªak
Since there are an equal measure of each type, the insurance payments to distressed firms
are exactly funded by the receipts from the intact firms.
     At date 1, an intact firm sees the domestic interest rate of L1 ‚â• 1 and has international
collateral of w ‚àí d0,f , and an insurance liability of x0,l . Suppose that the firm lends all of
its international collateral at L1, then its total resources are date 2 goods of,
                                            (w ‚àí d0,f )L1 + Ak
Against this it has the liability of x0,l giving date 2 profits of,
                                    Vi   = (w ‚àí d0,f )L1 + Ak ‚àí x0,l .
   Recall that our focus is not on the possibility of more or less insurance from foreigners, rather it is on
    5


domestic arrangements given the limited access to international financial markets.

                                                      10
    The distressed firm borrows against its international collateral of w ‚àí d0,f and invests
the proceeds in production to yield a date 2 return of ‚àÜ. As long L1 ‚â§ ‚àÜ, it borrows d1,l
in the domestic debt market, satisfying the constraint that,
                                               d1,l   ‚â§ Œªak + x0,l .                          (4)
Thus it makes date 2 profits of,
                          = (w ‚àí d0,f )‚àÜ + (‚àÜ ‚àí L1) dL11,l + Œªak + x0,l .
                            Vd

   Consider (4) a little more closely. We know that if x0,l = 0, we are back in the situation
we studied in the previous section and that d1,l = Œªak. Since increasing x0,l from this point
only loosens d1,l , without loss of generality we can set,
                                               d1,l   = Œªak + x0,l .
That is, if the inequality in (4) was strict, then x0,l can be reduced until equality, while only
loosening the insurance enforceability constraint and affecting the level of V d and V i , but
not decisions or date 0 welfare (recall that agents are risk neutral). Given this, the date 0
problem is just,
       V ins   = k,dmax          1 (w ‚àí d0,f )(‚àÜ + L1) + 1 (A + a)k + 1 (‚àÜ ‚àí L1) Œªak + x0,l

Lemma 2 In the insurance market equilibrium:
                                                      L1   =‚àÜ
    Proof: We can see this in two steps. First, from the program, as long as ‚àÜ > L1 ,
firms will increase x0,l . Second, the only limit on x0,l is the enforceability constraint that
x0,l ‚â§ w ‚àí d0,f + Œªak. Suppose that x0,l = w ‚àí d0,f + Œªak ‚àí Œ¥, with Œ¥ > 0. As Œ¥ ‚Üí 0, the

intact firms at date 1 have no international resources, and market clearing in the domestic
loan market would require that L1 = ‚àÜ. As a comment, there is a large interval within
which x0,l can fall for this to hold.
    Substituting L1 = ‚àÜ into the program gives the first order condition for investment,
                                                
                                               c k  ( )‚àÜ = A +2 a .                           (5)
Contrasting this expression with the first order condition in the spot market equilibrium,
(3), implies:
                                                           11
Proposition 3     Let   kins   be the solution to (5) and   kspot   be the solution to (3). Then:

  1. If   ‚àÜ ‚àí Lspot
               1    > 0,


                             spot        ins                               ins        spot
                         k          >k             and                 V         >V          .



  2. If   ‚àÜ‚àíLspot
             1    = 0, the two first order conditions coincide and decisions as well as welfare
     are the same.

    By signing date 0 insurance contracts firms bid up the price of international collateral
at date 1 until it reaches ‚àÜ. As a result, firms borrow less at date 0 and invest less, thus
leading to a better allocation of external resources across date 0 and date 1. Note that
the insurance solution leaves no role for Œª. Indeed this is the point. Since the loan market
at date 1 is affected by collateral frictions, the date 0 insurance market circumvents these
frictions by loosening the domestic collateral constraint.

4     Private information of types and planning solutions
We shall henceforth set Œª equal to one, as it plays a limited role in what follows. More
importantly, from now onwards we shall acknowledge the many difficulties encountered by
domestic insurance contracts in emerging economies and assume:
Assumption 4 (Private information)
The shock at date 1 is private information of the firm.

     This assumption means that the insurance contracts of the previous section are not
possible since, at face value, all firms will prefer to claim to be distressed and avoid payment.
However the spot loan market is still feasible. We now investigate whether it is possible to
still implement the full insurance solution.

4.1   Mechanism design problem

We take a standard mechanism design approach. The types at date 1 are private information
and must be elicited by the mechanism. As usual, we appeal to the revelation principle to
focus on direct revelation mechanisms.
    Consider the following mechanism. At date 0, agents hand over w of international
collateral to the planner. The mechanism is defined by,
                                     m   = (k, yi, yd, xi, xd).
At date 0, the planner hands resources to create capital of k to each firm. At date 1, agents
send a message of their type, j ‚àà {i, d}. They then receive an allocation of international
collateral (or imported goods) of yj and a claim on date 2 domestically produced goods of
xj .

     Thus the planner solves the following problem:
                          m
                           = max     1 (Ak + yi + xi) + 1 (ak + yd‚àÜ + xd)
                     V
                                m    2                   2

                           (RC 1)    1 (yi + yd) + c(k) ‚â§ w

                          (RCX )     xi + xd ‚â§ 0

                          (DCC)      xi , xd   ‚â• ‚àíak
                            (I Ci)   Ak + yi + xi ‚â• Ak + yd + xd
                            (I Cd)   ak + yd ‚àÜ + xd ‚â• ak + yi ‚àÜ + xi


                                                 13
    The constraints are as follows: RC0 and RC1 are date 0 and date 1 resource constraints
on importing goods for investment. Since agents hand over all of their international collat-
eral to the planner at date 0, the transfer to them, yj , must be non-negative. The planner
can shuffle claims on date 2 goods ‚Äìi.e., domestic collateral‚Äì at date 1. RCX requires
that this shuffling does not create new collateral in the aggregate. DCC states that the
maximum the planner can shuffle away from any of the agents is given by their domestic
collateral constraint, ak. The last two constraints impose incentive compatibility so that
each type prefers the bundle intended for it.
    The asymmetry between Assumptions 1 and 2 are embedded in RC0, RC1 and DCC.
To import goods for investment, only international collateral can be used ‚Äî hence RC0
and RC1. On the other hand, these goods can be shuffled around among domestics by
transferring claims against domestic collateral ‚Äî hence DCC. We think this asymmetry is
a distinguishing feature of an emerging economy. In a developed economy most assets are
both domestic and international collateral, in which case we could do away with DCC and
rewrite the RC‚Äôs to include the domestic collateral of ak.
    Given linearity in y‚Äôs and x‚Äôs, we will arrive at corner solutions in them. Since c(k) is
convex, we will have an interior solution in k. In order to see which corners determine the
solution, rewrite the two incentive compatibility constraints as,
                                       + yi ‚â•
                                        xi                 xd + yd
                        xd + yd + (‚àÜ ‚àí 1)yd ‚â•              xi + yi + (‚àÜ ‚àí 1)yi .


Note that (xi + yi ) appears as a sum everywhere in the program except in this last incentive
compatibility constraint. If we were at an interior point on xi and yi then the incentive
compatibility constraint can be slackened by lowering yi and increasing xi . Thus consider
the solution of yi = 0 and xi at its highest value. Applying the same argument to (xd + yd )
dictates a solution of yd to be at its highest value and xd to be at its lowest. Thus,
yd = 2(w ‚àí c(k )), and xd = ‚àíak. Combining, gives us,


                   m   = (k, yi = 0, yd = 2(w ‚àí c(k)), xi = ak, xd = ‚àíak).
and rewriting the optimization problem gives,
                                m
                                    = max 1 (A + a)k + ‚àÜ(w ‚àí c(k)).
                                       k 2
                            V


The first order condition to the planning problem is
                                         c k
                                             
                                                 ( )‚àÜ = A +2 a .
                                                      14
Let k be the solution. The last step is to verify that the solution satisfies the incentive
        ‚àó



compatibility constraints. That is,
                                       ‚àÜ(yd ‚àí yi) ‚â• xi ‚àí xd ‚â• yd ‚àí yi

Proposition 4          The optimal mechanism under private information of types implements the
full-insurance public information solution.

This follows directly from comparing the first order conditions in this solution and the
insurance solution of the previous section.
    The mechanism works because it exploits the differential valuation of imported goods
between distressed and intact firms. If a firm claims to be distressed rather than intact it
receives 2(w ‚àí c(k )) imported goods, but forgoes 2ak claims on date 2 goods. The interest
                        ‚àó                                             ‚àó



rate implicit in this choice is,
                                         = w ‚àíakc(k ) ,
                                                              ‚àó
                                                 ‚àó
                                                L1
                                                                  ‚àó



where the technical assumption ensures that ‚àÜ > L1 > 1.6 A distressed firm values the
                                                                      ‚àó



imported goods at ‚àÜ, while the intact firm values it at one. Thus distressed firms effectively
borrow at L1 and intact ones lend at L1. Both types‚Äô welfare is enhanced, and the full-
                ‚àó                                    ‚àó



insurance solution is achieved.
    We now turn to the implementation of the planning solution and consider three sets of
alternatives, noting that each requires the planner ‚Äìwhich in some instances could be a
private consortium‚Äì to act (and hence be able to monitor) on a different margin.

4.2      Domestic credit lines

The first solution we consider is a credit-line/banking arrangement akin to Diamond and
Dybvig‚Äôs (1983) deposit contracts in the context of consumption insurance.
   Suppose that all firms hand over w ‚àí c(k ) to the bank at date 0. This leaves each firm
                                                         ‚àó



with c(k ) for the purpose of building a plant. The bank then offers each firm the right to
            ‚àó



withdraw w ‚àí c(k ) at date 1 as well as a credit line to borrow an additional w ‚àí c(k ) at
                        ‚àó                                                                ‚àó


  6
      Also note that   L‚àó1 < L1 since k‚àó < k.


                                                         15
the interest rate of L‚àó1. Funds not withdrawn at date 1 earn the interest rate of L‚àó1 until
date 2.7
    At date 1, distressed firms return to the bank and withdraw w ‚àí c(k‚àó ). In addition,
they choose to take out a further loan against domestic collateral of ak‚àó at the rate of L‚àó1 .
This gives them imported goods of exactly 2(w ‚àí c(k‚àó )) which they invest until date 2 at
the private return of ‚àÜ.
    Since intact firms‚Äô alternative use of imported goods returns only one, intact firms choose
not to withdraw their funds at date 1 and instead wait until date 2 providing them a total
return of L‚àó1(w ‚àí c(k‚àó)) = ak‚àó.
    This structure clearly implements the planner‚Äôs solution. However as was first pointed
out by Jacklin (1985) it requires the fairly strong restriction that agents not be allowed
to make any side trades. That is, all firms must be restricted to exclusively trade with
the bank and be barred from trading in a market. If we drop this restriction, the banking
arrangement is no longer coalition incentive compatible and the allocation reverts to the
competitive equilibrium.8
    In our context, Jacklin‚Äôs critique can be formulated as follows. Suppose that one firm
chooses to opt out of the banking arrangement, and privately makes an investment decision
of k. At date 1, the firm is either distressed or intact. If distressed, suppose that it
approaches a firm within the banking arrangement and offers to borrow at the interest rate
of L‚àó1 against domestic collateral of ak. Since this return is as good as the return in the
banking arrangement, the firm withdraws some of its international collateral and offers it
to the rogue firm. The return to the rogue firm is,
                                      Vd   = ‚àÜ(w ‚àí c(k)) + Lak‚àó ‚àÜ,
                                                                 1
while the firm in the banking arrangement is unaffected. If the firm is intact, it instead
offers to lend to a firm in the banking arrangement at the interest rate of L‚àó1 . Once again,
the banking firm accepts, and the rogue firm‚Äôs profits are,
                                       Vi   = L‚àó1(w ‚àí c(k)) + Ak
Combining these last two expressions gives us the date 0 program of,
                                    1                      1  a     
                          ( ) = max
                  V rogue L‚àó1
                                 k 2
                                      (w ‚àí c(k))(‚àÜ + L1) + 2 ‚àÜ L‚àó + A k.
                                                      ‚àó
                                                                1
   7
     We do not impose a sequential service constraint as in Diamond and Dybvig (1983), which means that
L1 is left free to adjust in the out-of-equilibria event that more than half of the firms decide to withdraw.
Thus there is no ‚Äúbank-run" equilibrium.
   8
     The result that competitive spot markets may undermine insurance arrangements arises in many settings.
See for example, Rothschild and Stiglitz(1976), Atkeson and Lucas (1992), or Bisin and Rampini (2000).

                                                     16
The first order condition for this program is,
                                      ( )(‚àÜ + L1) = ‚àÜLa + A.
                                     c k             ‚àó
                                                                   ‚àó
                                                                   1

Comparing this to the first order condition of the planning problem, we can see that for
L1 < ‚àÜ the rogue firm makes a choice of k > k and attains strictly higher utility than
 ‚àó                                                             ‚àó



if it participated in the banking arrangement. Given this, the banking arrangement would
unravel.
   We can take this to its logical end by explicitly accounting for the possibility of side
trades in the planning problem. This is done by adding a constraint that,
                                            Vm    ‚â• V rogue(L1)    ‚àó




Now the objective in the planning problem is,
                                Vm   = (w ‚àí c(k ))‚àÜ + 21 (a + A).
                                                      ‚àó




Substituting in L1 = w akc(‚àók‚àó ) , this can be rewritten as,
                   ‚àó
                         ‚àí


                                                                  
                       Vm    = 12 (w ‚àí c(k ))(‚àÜ + L1) + 21 ‚àÜ La + A k .
                                            ‚àó              ‚àó
                                                                       ‚àó
                                                                           ‚àó


                                                                       1

Note that this is the same as the expression for V rogue if evaluated at k = k . Since both
                                                                               ‚àó



objectives in V m and in V rogue are strictly concave, they each have a unique maximum,
with the maximum in V rogue weakly exceeding that of V m. Given this, we can conclude
that the best that the planner can do is to choose k = krogue so that,
                                                                   ‚àó



                                                           rogue
                                        L‚àó1     = w ‚àíakc(krogue) .
These are the same optimality and market clearing conditions that arose in the spot loan
markets of section 2.2. In summary,
Proposition 5
(a) The credit-line arrangement implements the full-insurance solution as long as the plan-
ner can restrict agents from making side trades. (b) In the absence of this exclusivity
restriction, the credit-line arrangement collapses to the competitive equilibrium with spot
loan markets.

4.3     Capital inflow taxation/Liquidity requirement

Let us consider next a tax/transfer scheme based on date 0 borrowing (or investment of
k). Since the primitive problem in the spot loan market equilibrium is that agents over-

borrow/over-invest at date 0, a tax has the potential of achieving the optimal solution.
   The planner taxes all date 0 external borrowing at the rate of œÑ and redistributes the
proceeds (T ) in a lumpsum fashion at date 0,
                                        T   = œÑ d0,f = œÑ c(k‚àó)
The program for a firm is,
               max      1 (w ‚àí c(k) ‚àí œÑ c(k) + T )(L1 + ‚àÜ) + 1 A + ‚àÜ a  k.
                k       2                                    2       L1

This gives the first order condition,
                                                                         
                             
                             c k ( )(1 + œÑ )(L1 + ‚àÜ) =       A   + ‚àÜ L1
                                                                     a
                                                                              .


Thus,
                                                   A+ L a
                                     1 + œÑ = ‚àÜ 2‚àÜ
                                                       ‚àÜ
                                                        1
                                               + L1 A + a
where,
                                              = L1.
                                               L1
                                                         ‚àó




It is straightforward to verify that for L1 < ‚àÜ, the optimal tax will be positive.
                                              ‚àó




      An alternative, but similar in spirit, implementation of the borrowing tax is an interna-
tional   liquidity requirement. For example, suppose that the planner insisted that a fraction,
w d‚àó0,f
  d‚àó0,f , of all foreign borrowings be retained as a liquidity requirement for one-period (i.e.,
 ‚àí




until a crisis arises). Then, since firms choose to borrow d0,f , this arrangement has them
                                                                     ‚àó



saving exactly the right amount until date 1.
      While unlike the credit line arrangement each of these solutions can co-exist with the
market for loans, they do require that the planner observe all external borrowings. If agents
could evade the tax/return scheme or liquidity requirement, and trade in the loan market
at date 1, they would prefer to. Moreover, this incentive rises as more firms fall under the
planner‚Äôs control since L1 falls.
      Finally, it is worth pointing out that this arrangement requires the planner to tax at
date 0 and then remove the tax at date 1. If the tax is left active for both periods, the
equilibrium would be exactly as in section 2.2, with the exception that the interest rate on
international collateral would rise to 1 + œÑ . In general, this will lead to a worse outcome
than the case of no-taxation.
                                                    18
Proposition 6      If the planner can observe all external borrowings, a borrowing tax or liq-
uidity requirement implements the full-insurance solution.

4.4     Capital inflow sterilization

Consider a government that issues b face value of two period bonds at date 0 in return for
international reserves of Lb0 . Thus the interest rate on these bonds is L0, and in order to
purchase these bonds, firms increase their external borrowings by Lb0 .
    At date 1, the government simply buys the bonds plus claims against domestic collateral
using its international reserves of Lb0 . Finally, at date 2, the government raises lumpsum
taxes of T in order to balance its budget. Since the investment of reserves at date 1 is done
at the interest rate of L1 , the budget constraint for the government is,
                                            b
                                            L0
                                                 L1   + T = b,
where we note that if L0 = L1 , budget balance is achieved without having to raise taxes.
   There are two assumptions we make on the government. First, we assume that future
tax liabilities are rationally anticipated and constitute a reduction in seizable endowments.
Thus the collateral of each firm is reduced by T , so that, for example, the domestic loan
capacity becomes,
                                        d1,d    ‚â§ w + ak ‚àí T
Second, we assume that the government bonds that are sold are only domestic collateral.
That is they are like ak and hence foreigners do not purchase these bonds.9
   In this context, suppose a firm purchases b bonds at date 0. Then its program can be
written as,
           max     1 (w ‚àí c(k) ‚àí b )(L1 + ‚àÜ) + 1 Ak + b ‚àí T + ‚àÜ (ak + b ‚àí T )
            k,b    2            L0             2               L1

                   c(k) +    ‚â§w
                           b
            s.t.
                          L0

      Market clearing is,
                                       L1   = wak‚àí c+(kb)‚àí+T b
                                                                 L0
   There are two cases to consider, depending on whether or not the international borrowing
constraint is slack or not. Consider first the case that, c(k) + Lb0 < w. Since firms are at
  9
    See the appendix in Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2000b) for a model justifying this assumption in
terms of a risk of suspension of convertibility.



                                                      19
an interior in their purchase of bonds, it must be that L0 =                            L1   , and therefore   T   = 0.
Substituting this back into the market clearing condition:
                                    ( ‚àí c(k) + Lb1 ) =
                                  L1 w                                  ak   +b
                                                           L1       =   w
                                                                             ak
                                                                             ‚àí c(k) .
In other words, intervention has no effect in this case.
    The other case is where the international constraint binds. Suppose that the government
sells enough bonds so that c(k ) + Lb0 = w. The first order condition for the private sector
                                    ‚àó



is,
                                     
                                    c k  ( ) LL01 L1 +2 ‚àÜ = 12 (A + a L‚àÜ1 )
As always, the RHS is the return from an extra unit of k. The LHS is the opportunity cost
of these resources. c (k) could otherwise be invested in the government bonds at L0 , sold
                         



at L1 at date 1, and the proceeds reinvested at either L1 or ‚àÜ. Given the intervention,
optimality for the private sector requires that the interest rate on these bonds be,
                                                      + L‚àÜ‚àó1 a

                                                   A+ L‚àÜ‚àó1 a 2‚àÜ
                                          L0   =                L .
                                                   A + a ‚àÜ + L1 1       ‚àó
                                                                                 ‚àó




For L1 < ‚àÜ, we have that L0 > L1. Since after purchasing these bonds the private sector has
        ‚àó                                 ‚àó



exactly c(k ) left, firms invest the optimal amount of k , and the full-information solution
                    ‚àó                                                        ‚àó



is achieved.
    Essentially, the implementation has the government ‚Äúsubsidizing‚Äù savings by offering a
bond with an interest rate exceeding L1. It requires no knowledge of date 0 borrowing or
investment. However, it does require that the government be able to tax and issue bonds.
    On the one hand, since we have assumed that taxes come out of otherwise privately
seizable endowments, this tax power is not any stronger than what we gave the private
sector.10 On the other hand, it does come with a buried assumption. As in the banking
arrangement we first discussed, if agents had the option to not pay taxes, not buy govern-
ment bonds, but be allowed to trade with the firms who are paying taxes, they would prefer
this option. As in the banking arrangement, the sterilization policy is not coalition incentive
 10
      See Holmstrom and Tirole (1998) or Woodford (1990) for the converse case.

compatible. However, it seems reasonable to believe that coalition incentive compatibility
with respect to taxes is easier to achieve than that of ruling out side trades in a private
banking arrangement.
    We label this policy as sterilization because, in practice, emerging markets that sterilize
accumulate international reserves on the one hand, and issue government bonds on the
other. However our bond policy is ‚Äúreal" and may seem closer to fiscal than to monetary
policy. In Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2001b) we have argued that emphasizing this
‚Äúreal" side of a sterilization policy sheds light on observed outcomes that are puzzling when
only the standard, purely monetary, side of it is considered.
Proposition 7 Sterilizing capital inflows at date 0 by issuing two period government bonds,
and consequently reversing the transaction at date 1, achieves the full-insurance solution as
long as the planner has the power to tax endowments and bonds are not viewed as interna-
tional collateral by foreign investors.

5    Final Remarks
As in our previous papers, we have synthesized emerging markets‚Äô volatility in terms of
two basic ingredients: weak links with international financial markets and underdeveloped
domestic financial markets. The need for external insurance stems from the former insuffi-
ciency, while the latter is behind the external underinsurance problem.
     The contribution of this paper is twofold: First, we have explicitly modeled the infor-
mational constraint on domestic insurance markets and have thereby been able to discuss
the feasibility of contractual arrangements to solve the underinsurance problem. Second,
we have explored in a unified setting several of the main international liquidity management
strategies available to these countries.
     If domestics can write complete insurance markets with each other, external underin-
surance disappears. However the mechanism behind this result is not a standard insurance
channel. The main problem of the economy during a sudden stop is not in the domestic
allocation of its limited international collateral but on the aggregate amount of the latter.
Domestic insurance improves efficiency by aligning the price of international collateral with
its marginal product. In this sense, domestic insurance relates to our discussion in Caballero
and Krishnamurthy (2001c) of the incentive ‚Äìas opposed to the standard liquidity‚Äì virtues
of a countercyclical monetary policy in economies subject to sudden stops. In fact, there we
argue further that such policy could in some instances substitute for the absence of domestic
insurance.
     If domestic insurance is not possible ‚Äî i.e when types are unobservable ‚Äî we showed
that it was possible to design mechanisms that could attain the same aggregate outcomes
and welfare of the full information case. The common Achilles‚Äô heel of these solutions,
however, is their failure to meet a coalition incentive compatibility constraint; which in
practice means that they may not be robust to the existence of secondary markets or ways
to opt out of the mechanism. Among the solutions of these type we studied, we argued
that bond-policy is probably more robust than the others, but this policy can also have
potentially large drawbacks if the intervention is not large enough and public bonds have
illiquid secondary markets during crises (see Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2001b)).
