                                        ABSTRACT

This paper defines and analyzes a new monotonicity condition for the identification of
counterfactuals and treatment effects in unordered discrete choice models with multiple
treatments, heterogenous agents and discrete-valued instruments. Unordered monotonicity
implies and is implied by additive separability of choice of treatment equations in terms of
observed and unobserved variables. These results follow from properties of binary matrices
developed in this paper. We investigate conditions under which unordered monotonicity arises as
a consequence of choice behavior. We characterize IV estimators of counterfactuals as solutions
to discrete mixture problems.

1         Introduction
The evaluation of economic policies is a central goal of econometrics.1 Economists
have long used instrumental variables (IV) to identify policy-relevant parameters.2
Early econometricians used IV to identify parameters in systems of linear simulta-
neous equations. In that framework, economists can safely be agnostic about the
models generating choices in estimating a variety of interesting policy counterfactuals
if their instruments satisfy rank and exogeneity conditions.
    This agnostic stance is not justified in models with heterogeneous responses in
which decisions to take treatment are based on unobserved3 components of those
responses. Without additional assumptions, instrumental variables do not identify
interpretable causal parameters. Choice mechanisms play a fundamental role in in-
terpreting what instruments identify.
    For binary and ordered versions of IV models, Imbens and Angrist (1994) show
that monotonicity facilitates identification of certain instrument-defined causal pa-
rameters. This condition requires that responses to changes in instruments move all
people toward or against the same choices.4 It is a condition about the uniformity of
the direction of responses across persons in responses to changes in instruments.5 In
binary and ordered choice models, monotonicity coupled with standard IV assump-
tions permits economists to identify certain causal effects on outcomes of changes
in the choices induced by variation in the instruments with different instruments
generally identifying different parameters.6
    For a nonparametric binary choice Generalized Roy model, Vytlacil (2002) shows
that monotonicity is equivalent to assuming that treatment choice equations can
be characterized by an additively-separable latent-variable threshold-crossing model.

      This concept is more accurately interpreted as “uniformity” and does not correspond to ordinary
mathematical definitions of monotonicity. See Heckman and Vytlacil (2005, 2007a).

      See Heckman et al. (2006b).
    6
      For the binary choice model, these are the LATE parameters of Imbens and Angrist (1994). Their
extension of LATE to situations with multiple choices assumes that indicators of choice are naturally
ordered (e.g., years of schooling). It assumes a meaningful scalar aggregator can be constructed that
is monotonic in the ordered indicators of choice (Angrist and Imbens, 1995). They identify a mixture
of LATEs where the weights, but not the LATEs, are identified individually. In general, LATE does
not identify a variety of policy relevant parameters. See Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b) or Heckman
(2010).


                                                    1
Separability is defined in terms of observed and unobserved (by the economist) vari-
ables. Vytlacil (2006) extends his analysis to the case of ordered multiple choice
models where the order is placed on the possible outcome variables (e.g., years of
schooling).
    This paper contributes to the literature by extending the analysis of instrumental
variables to a general model of unordered choices. We develop a natural generaliza-
tion of monotonicity—unordered monotonicity—that applies to models with multiple
choices without a natural order among the choice values. For example, the choice of a
pet among the set { cat, dog, bird } is only ordered by the preferences of agents across
choices and not necessarily by the characteristics of the outcomes of choices. Un-
ordered monotonicity preserves the intuitive notion of weak uniformity of responses to
changes in instruments across persons without assuming any cardinalization on choice
outcomes. We demonstrate how unordered monotonicity arises in choice models and
examine which counterfactuals and causal parameters and weights are identified by
different configurations of instruments. Like its counterpart in ordered choice models,
unordered monotonicity identifies a mixture of LATEs with identifiable weights. We
cannot identify the causal effect subcomponent of the mixture of LATEs, but we can
identify certain counterfactuals.
    Identification of causal effects in unordered choice models is studied by Heckman
et al. (2006b), Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b) and Heckman et al. (2008) who identify
a variety of economically interpretable treatment effects. They assume that the equa-
tions generating treatment choices are governed by additively separable threshold-
crossing models. Their identification strategy relies critically on instruments that
assume values on a continuum. They also invoke “identification at infinity,” as does
a large literature in structural economics.7 In this paper, we show that these assump-
tions can be relaxed and identification of causal effects can still be secured. We rely
only on discrete-valued instruments—the case commonly encountered in empirical
work.8
    This paper introduces economists to the identifying and interpretive power of
binary matrices. We state the necessary and sufficient conditions for identification of
   7
    See Heckman and Vytlacil (2007b) and Blevins (2014).
   8
    Continuity of instruments and full support produce identifiability in our model, but are not
required. See Heckman and Pinto (2015a). In related work, Lee and Salanié (2016) use a general
framework to investigate multivalued choice models defined by separable threshold-crossing rules.
They show that the identification of causal effects is possible with enough variation in instrumental
variables that assume values on a continuum (“identification at infinity”).

counterfactuals in terms of conditions on binary matrices. We establish an equivalence
result that connects unordered monotonicity and separability of choice equations.
Separability is not imposed on the underlying choice equations.
    However, unordered monotonicity implies and is implied by representations of
choice equations that are additively separable in observed and unobserved variables.
We show that this equivalence result stems from the properties of binary matrices that
characterize choice sets. We determine the counterfactual outcomes that are identified
under unordered monotonicity and present equations that facilitate estimation of the
identified parameters.9
    This paper proceeds in the following way. Section 2 defines a general model of
multiple choices and categorical instrumental variables. Section 3 presents a gen-
eral framework for studying identification of counterfactuals and causal parameters
in the general model. Our framework is based on partitioning the population into
strata corresponding to counterfactual treatment choices. Section 4 presents a new
characterization of the IV identification problem using a finite mixture model with
restrictions on admissible vectors of counterfactual choices. We state necessary and
sufficient conditions for identifying causal parameters. We illustrate these conditions
for a binary choice (LATE) model. We show the simplicity and power of our an-
alytical framework by deriving Vytlacil’s equivalence result (2002) in a transparent
way. Section 5 defines unordered monotonicity and illustrates how is arises in choice-
theoretic models. Section 6 presents equivalence theorems that relate the properties
of unordered monotonicity and the separability of choice equations. We interpret
these equivalence results in light of economic theory. Section 7 applies this analy-
sis to identify causal parameters. We establish the role of choice theory in securing
identifiability. Section 8 concludes.


2       A Choice-Theoretic Model of Instrumental Vari-
        ables
Our model consists of five (possible vector-valued) random variables defined on prob-
ability space (Ω, F, P ), two policy-invariant (vector) equations that determine causal

                   Choice Equations : T = fT (Z, V )                                          (1)
                Outcome Equations : Y = fY (T, V , Y )                                       (2)
          Independence Condition : V , Z, Y are mutually independent,                        (3)

Variables (Z, T, Y, Y , V ) have the following properties. P1: Instrument Z is a cat-
egorical random variable with support supp(Z) = {z1 , . . . , zNZ }; 11 P2: Treatment
(or Choice) indicator T is a discrete-valued random variable with support supp(T ) =
{t1 , . . . , tNT }; P3: Y is an observed random variable denoting outcomes arising from
treatment; P4: Y is an unobserved error term; 12 P5: V is a confounder—an unob-
served random vector (possibly infinite dimensional) affecting both choices and out-
comes. We assume that the expectation of each component of Y exists. We also
assume that the distribution of T varies conditional on each value of Z, that is,
P (T = t|Z = z) > 0 for all t ∈ supp(T ) and z ∈ supp(Z). Vector (Zω ; Tω ; Yω ; Vω )
denotes the realization of these variables for an element ω ∈ Ω. To simplify nota-
tion, background variables unaffected by treatment are kept implicit. Our analysis is
conditional on such variables.
     Counterfactual outcome Y (t) is defined by fixing the argument T of the outcome
Equation (2) to t ∈ supp(T ), that is, Y (t) = fY (t, V , Y ), The observed outcome Y
(Equation (2)) is the output of a Quandt (1972) switching regression model:
                                  X
                          Y =                Y (t) · 1[T = t] ≡ Y (T ),                       (4)
                                t∈supp(T )


where 1[α] is an indicator function that takes value 1 if α is true and 0 otherwise.
Counterfactual choice T (z) = fT (z, V ) is defined by fixing the argument Z of the

     By policy-invariant, we mean functions whose maps remain invariant under manipulation of the
arguments. This is the notation of autonomy developed by Frisch (1938) and Haavelmo (1944). For
a recent discussion of these conditions, see Heckman and Pinto (2015b).
  11
     The assumption that Z is a multiple-valued scalar is a convenience. We can vectorize a matrix
of instruments into a scalar form. Thus, we accommodate multiple instruments defined in the usual
way.
  12
     Such errors terms are often called “shocks” in structural equation models. fT is a random
function that could be written as a deterministic function if we introduced shock T of arbitrary
dimension as an argument of the function, where T is independent of V and Y .

Remark 2.1 . The binary Generalized Roy Model (Heckman and Vytlacil, 2007a) is
a special case of this model in which V is a scalar random variable V, the choice is
binary T ∈ {0, 1}, and the choice equation is defined by an indicator function that
is separable in Z and V, namely T = fT (Z, V ) ≡ 1[τ (Z) ≥ V ]. In this paper, we
analyze multiple choices and impose no restriction on the functional forms of the
choice equations (1) or outcome equations (2). Instead, we make restrictions on
counterfactual choices and examine how those restrictions affect the characterization
of choice equations.
       Independence condition (3) generates the following properties:

                                          Exclusion Restriction: (V , Y (t)) ⊥⊥ Z                        (6)
       Conditional Independence (Matching) Property: Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |V .                                     (7)

Equation (6) states that instrument Z is independent of counterfactual outcome Y (t)
and the confounding variable V that generates selection bias. It implies that in-
strument Z affects Y only through its effect on T . Equation (7) states that Y (t) is
independent of treatment choice T after conditioning on V . Counterfactual outcomes
can be evaluated by conditioning on V :
                                                                                      !

Any solution to the problem of selection bias requires that the analyst control for, or
balance, unobserved V across treatment and control states.14
    We control for V by partitioning the sample space Ω so that the treatment indica-
tor T is independent of counterfactual outcomes within each partition set. Consider
                                                        0                        0

      Fixing is a causal operation that captures the notion of external (ceteris paribus) manipulation.
It is central concept in the study of causality and dates back to (Haavelmo, 1943). See Heckman

      Counterfactual E(Y (t)) and conditional expectation E(Y R |T = t) differ if the conditional

unconditional distributions of V are different: E(Y (t)) = E(Y (t)|V = v)dFV (v) 6= E(Y |V =
v, T = t)dFV |T =t (v) = E(Y |T = t) where FV is the CDF of V and FV |T =t is the CDF of V
conditional on T = t. See Heckman and Pinto (2015b).

Hω =      n=1   n · 1[ω ∈ Ωn ]. If the following relationship holds within each partition,

T is effectively randomly assigned conditional on H = n. If such partitions were
known, one could apply the logic underlying Equation (8) to evaluate counterfactual
outcome E(Y (t)|H = n) using E(Y |T = t, H = n). If T takes the value t with
strictly positive probability in all partition sets, i.e., Pr(T = t|H = n) > 0; n ∈

{1, . . . , N }, E(Y (t)) can be constructed from E(Y (t)) =       n=1 E(Y |T = t, H =
n)P (H = n). Our identification strategy uses instrumental variable Z to generate
partitions {Ωn }N  n=1 that satisfy Equation (9). To do so we use response vectors which
we define next.


3      Response Vectors and Identifying or Bounding
       of Mean Counterfactuals and Weights on Coun-
       terfactuals
Response Vector S is defined as a NZ -dimensional random vector of counterfactual
treatment choices T for Z fixed at each value of its support:

       S = [T (z1 ) , . . . , T (zNZ )]0 = [fT (V , z1 ) , . . . , fT (V , zNZ )]0 ≡ fS (V ),     (10)

where T (z) denotes a counterfactual treatment choice when instrumental variable Z
is fixed at z ∈ supp(Z). Let supp(S) = {s1 , · · · , sNS } denote the finite support of
S. The NZ -dimensional vectors s ∈ supp(S) are termed response-types or strata.15
  15
     Different notions of response vectors are used in the literature. In our notation, response vectors
correspond to the choices a person of type V would make when confronted by different values of
Z. Robins and Greenland (1992) initiated the literature. Frangakis and Rubin (2002) use the term
“principal strata.” They do not explicitly model V or use the econometric framework (1)-(3) so the
relationship between strata and V and the fact that conditioning on S is equivalent to conditioning
on regions of V is only implicit in their analysis. T (z) can potentially take as many as NT values
for each value z ∈ supp(Z). Since Z has | supp(Z)| = NZ elements, supp(S) can have at most NTNZ
elements.




                                                   6
S plays a fundamental role in our analysis. T is related to S in the following way:

                   T = [1[Z = z1 ] , . . . , 1[Z = zNZ ]] · S ≡ gT (S, Z).16              (11)

Equation (10) uses the fact that after fixing Z = z, S is a function only of unobserved
V . Conditioning on S effectively conditions on the regions of V that map into S by
Equation (10).17 It is a coarse way of conditioning on V .


3.1     Properties of Response Vectors
Lemma L-1 establishes four useful properties of response vectors analogous to prop-
erties shared with V .

Lemma L-1. The following relationships for S hold for IV model (1)–(3):

      (i) Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |S,   (ii) S ⊥⊥ Z,   (iii) Y ⊥⊥ T |(S, Z),    (iv) Y ⊥⊥ Z|(S, T ).

    Relationship (i) states that counterfactual outcomes Y (t) for all t ∈ supp(T ) are
independent of treatment choices conditional on S. Thus S shares the same condi-
tional independence (matching) properties as V in (7). Relationship (ii) states that
the potential treatment choices in S are independent of the instrumental variables.
Relationship (iii) states that outcomes are independent of treatment choices condi-
tional on S and Z. Indeed, from (11), T is deterministic conditional on S and Z.
Relationship (iv) is closely related to (iii). It states that outcome Y is independent
of instrumental variable Z when conditioned on S and T .

Remark 3.1 . Response vector S generates a partition of the sample space Ω that has
independence property (9). Function fS : supp(V ) → supp(S) in (10) is constructed
using function fT defined by (1). Thus, for each ω ∈ Ω, there is a single value
v ∈ supp(V ) such that Vω = v and a single value s ∈ supp(S) such that fS (v) = s.
We define a partition of the sample space Ω by:

                   Ωn = {ω ∈ Ω; fS (Vω ) = sn } for each sn ∈ supp(S).                    (12)

In partition (12), Sω = sn and ω ∈ Ωn are equivalent. This partition satisfies (9)
because Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |(ω ∈ Ωn ) holds due to item (i) of Lemma L-1. Hence treatment

Acyclic Graph (DAG).

    The regions are distinct because fT (·) is a function.

                                              7
choice can be interpreted as being randomly assigned conditional on S. Indeed, con-
ditional on S, treatment T only depends on Z which is statistically independent of
V.
    Response vector S is a balancing score for V .18 It exploits the properties of instru-
ments Z to generate a coarse partition of unobserved variable V while maintaining
the independence properties arising from conditioning on V . The matching condition
Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |S is analogous to Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |V in (7). If S (or V ) were known, coun-
terfactual outcomes (conditional on S (or V )) can be identified by conditioning on
S or V .19 Thus, S plays the role of a control function (Heckman and Robb, 1985).
From Equation (8), Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |S implies that E(Y (t)|S = s) = E(Y |T = t, S = s).
If P (T = t|S = s) > 0 for all s ∈ supp(S), counterfactual mean outcomes can be
expressed as:
               X                                          X
E(Y (t)) =               E(Y (t)|S = s)P (S = s) =                 E(Y |T = t, S = s)P (S = s).
             s∈supp(S)                                 s∈supp(S)

                                                                                               (13)

S acts as a coarse surrogate for V and identifies treatment effects within strata by
balancing unobservables V across treatment states.


3.2     The Strata Identification Problem
The problem of identifying counterfactual mean outcomes defined for each stratum
consists of identifying unobserved E(Y (t)|S = s) and P (S = s) for s ∈ supp(S) and
t ∈ supp(T ), from observed E(Y |T = t, Z = z) and P (T = t|Z = z) for z ∈ supp(Z)
and t ∈ supp(T ). Theorem T-1 uses the relationships of Lemma L-1 to express
unobserved objects in terms of observed ones.

Theorem T-1. The following equality holds for the IV model (1)–(3):
                         X
 E(κ(Y ) · 1[T = t]|Z) =     1[T = t|S = s, Z]E(κ(Y (t))|S = s)P (S = s), (14)
                              s∈supp(S)


where κ : supp(Y ) → R is an arbitrary known function.
  18
      S being a balancing score means that properties of V are inherited by S. Formally, S = fS (V )
is a surjective function of V that satisfies Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |V ⇒ Y (t) ⊥⊥ T |fS (V ), and σ(S) ⊆ σ(V )
where σ denotes a σ-algebra in the probability space (Ω, F, P ).
   19
      See Heckman (2008) for a survey of a wide array of methods that implement this principle.


                                                 8
Proof. See Web Appendix A.2.

       Setting κ(Y ) to 1 generates the propensity score equality:20
                                        X
                P (T = t|Z = z) =                1[T = t|S = s, Z = z]P (S = s).                (15)
                                     s∈supp(S)


Replacing κ(Y ) by any variable X such that X ⊥⊥ T |S, we obtain:21
                                       X
 E(X|T = t, Z)P (T = t|Z) =                     1[T = t|S = s, Z]E(X|S = s)P (S = s). (16)
                                    s∈supp(S)




Remark 3.2 . Equation (14) characterizes the problem of identifying counterfactual
outcomes within strata. There are NZ observed objects on the left-hand side for each
t ∈ supp(T ) totalling NZ · NT . Without further restrictions, the total number of
latent response-types on the right-hand side is NTNZ , i.e., the number of strata. Thus,
the number of observed quantities (NT · NZ ) grows linearly in NZ while the number
of possible response-types (NTNZ ) grows geometrically in NZ .22 Identification requires
that constraints be placed on the number of admissible strata (S). Choice theory can
produce such restrictions, as can other assumptions, such as those about functional
forms.
    Indicator 1[T = t|S = s, Z = z] in Equation (14) is deterministic because T is
deterministic given Z and S in Equation (11). Our identification strategy develops
economically interpretable restrictions on these indicators that govern the choice of
treatment as Z varies. Such restrictions reduce the number of admissible response-
types and characterize the indicators 1[T = t|S = s, Z = z], facilitating identification
of causal parameters.
    We note, for later use, that the probability of treatment choice conditional on
  20
     If we set κ(Y ) = Y, we equate expected values of observed outcomes with expected counterfactual
outcomes. Setting κ(Y ) = 1[Y ≤ y], we equate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the
observed outcome with the unobserved CDF of counterfactual outcomes.
  21
     Candidates for X are baseline variables caused by V . Knowledge of the X variables helps to
identify the observed characteristics of persons within strata.
  22
     Across the two equation systems for T and scalar Y there are (2·NT −1)·NZ observed quantities
and (NT )2·NZ +1 unknown parameters.

where the last equality is a consequence of S ⊥⊥ Z (item (ii) of Lemma L-1).
    Note that Equation (14) is a discrete mixture latent class model, a feature we
exploit below.23 Our paper differs from previous work on nonparametric instrumental
variables. Instead of forming the usual nonparametric IV moment equations (see, e.g.,
Carrasco et al., 2007), we use instruments to construct strata that generate the kernels
of finite mixture equations and choice theory to place restrictions on the kernels. We
then use finite mixture methods to examine the identification of the individual causal
parameters on the right hand of Equations (14)–(16).


4       Identifying Response Probabilities and Counter-
        factual Outcomes
We now present general conditions for identifying response probabilities, counter-
factual outcomes, and pre-program variables conditioned on strata. To do so, it
is useful to express Equations (14)–(15) as a system of linear equations. Define
PZ (t) = [P (T = t|Z = z1 ), . . . , P (T = t|Z = zNZ )]0 , the vector of observed choice
probabilities (“propensity scores”). Define PZ as the vector that stacks PZ (t) across
t ∈ supp(T ): PZ = [PZ (t1 ), . . . , PZ (tNT )]0 . QZ (t) is defined in an analogous fash-
ion for outcomes defined for different values of T (i.e., multiplied by the treat-
ment indicators). In a similar fashion, LZ (t) stands for vector X such that X ⊥⊥
T |S, Z. The left-hand sides of Equations (14) and (16) are given respectively by:
QZ (t) = [E(κ(Y ) · 1[T = t]|Z = z1 ), . . . , E(κ(Y ) · 1[T = t]|Z = zNZ )]0 , and
LZ (t) = [E(X · 1[T = t]|Z = z1 ), . . . , E(X · 1[T = t]|Z = zNZ )]0 , where LZ =
[LZ (t1 ), . . . , LZ (tNT )]0 .
    Let PS be the vector of unobserved response probabilities PS = [P (S = s1 ), . . . ,
P (S = sNS )]0 and LS = [E(X ·1[S = s1 ]), . . . , E(X ·1[S = sNS ])]0 be the unobserved

vector of X-expectations times response indicators. We denote the vector of the
expected outcomes multiplied by response indicators by: QS (t) = [E(κ(Y (t)) · 1[S =
s1 ]), . . . , E(κ(Y (t)) · 1[S = sNS ])]0 .
     The following notation and concepts are used throughout the rest of this paper.
Define response matrix R as an array of response-types defined over supp(S), i.e.,
R = [s1 , . . . , sNS ]. To avoid trivial degeneracies we delete redundant rows (where
different values of Z produce the same pattern for T ) and redundant columns (where
the same choices are made for the same value of Z). Matrix R has dimension NZ ×NS .
An element in the i-th row and n-th column of R is denoted by R[i, n] = (T |Z =
zi , S = sn ); i ∈ {1, · · · , NZ }, n ∈ {1, . . . , NS }. We use R[i, ·] to denote the i-th row
of R, R[·, n] for the n-th column R.
     Let Bt denote a binary matrix of the same dimension as R and whose elements
take value 1 if the respective element in R is equal to t and zero otherwise. No-
tationally, we define an element in the i-th row and n-th column of matrix Bt by
Bt [i, n] = 1[T = t|Z = zi , S = sn ]; i ∈ {1, · · · , NZ }, n ∈ {1, . . . , NS }. We also
use the short-hand notation Bt = 1[R = t] to denote Bt . Let BT be a binary
matrix of dimension (NZ · NT ) × NS generated by stacking Bt as t ranges over
supp(T ) : BT = [Bt01 , . . . , Bt0N ]0 .
                                      T
     In this notation, Equations (14), (15), and (16) can be written respectively as

                                      QZ (t) = Bt QS (t),                                    (18)
                                         P Z = BT P S                                        (19)
                                         L Z = BT L S .                                      (20)

    If Bt and BT were invertible, QS (t), PS , and LS would be identified. However,
such inverses do not always exist. In their place, we can use generalized inverses.
    Let BT+ and Bt+ be the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverses24 of matrices BT and
Bt ; t ∈ supp(T ) respectively. The following expressions are useful for characterizing
the identification of response probabilities and counterfactual means:

              KT = INS − BT+ BT and Kt = INS − Bt+ Bt ; t ∈ supp(T ),                        (21)
  24
     The Moore-Penrose inverse of a matrix A is denoted by A+ and is defined by the four following
properties: (1) AA+ A = A; (2) A+ AA+ = A+ ; (3) A+ A is symmetric; (4) AA+ is symmet-
ric. The Moore-Penrose matrix A+ of a real matrix A is unique and always exists (Magnus and
Neudecker, 1999).



                                               11
where INS denotes an identity matrix of dimension NS . KT and Kt are orthogonal
projection matrices that depend only on binary matrices BT and Bt ; t ∈ supp(T ).25
   Applying the Moore-Penrose inverse to (18) and (19), we obtain:

                                    PS = BT+ PZ + KT λ                                     (22)
                                 QS (t) = Bt+ QZ (t) + Kt λ̃                               (23)

where λ and λ̃ are arbitrary NS -dimensional vectors (same dimension as PS ). In
this notation, Theorem T-2 states general conditions for identification of response
probabilities and counterfactual means:

Theorem T-2. For IV model (1)–(3), if there exists a real-valued NS -dimensional
vector ξ such that ξ 0 KT = 0, then ξ 0 PS and ξ 0 LS are identified. In addition, if there
exists a real-valued NS -dimensional vector ζ such that ζ 0 Kt = 0, then ζ 0 QS (t) is
identified.
Proof. See Web Appendix A.3.

    Theorem T-2 shows the identifying properties of the response matrix. For ex-
ample, suppose that BT has full column-rank. Then BT+ BT = INS and KT = 0 .
Therefore ξ 0 PS is identified for any real vector ξ of dimension NS . In particular, ξ 0 PS
is identified when ξ is set to be each column vector of the identity matrix INS . In
that case, each n-th column of INS identifies P (S = sn ) and all the response-type
probabilities are identified.26
    Note that full-rank for BT does not imply full-rank for each Bt ; t ∈ supp(T ).
Therefore, the identification of the response-type probabilities does not automatically
produce identification of corresponding mean counterfactual outcomes. Corollary C-1
formalizes this discussion.

Corollary C-1. The following relationships hold for the IV model (1)–(3):

              Vectors PS and LS are point-identified ⇔ rank(BT ) = NS .                    (24)
                     Vector QS (t) is point-identified ⇔ rank(Bt ) = NS ,                  (25)

Also, if (25) holds, then E(κ(Y (t))) is identified by ι0 Bt+ QZ (t), where ι is a NS -
dimensional vector of 1s.
  25
     See Appendix A.3.
  26
     See Section A.4 of the Web Appendix for bounds on the response-type probabilities and coun-
terfactual outcomes.


                                              12
Proof. See Web Appendix A.5.

    Versions of Corollary C-1 are found in the literature on the identifiability of
finite mixtures.27 Given binary matrices BT , and Bt ; t ∈ {1, ·, NT }, the problem
of identifying PS , LS and QS (t) is equivalent to the problem of identifying finite
mixtures of distributions where the BT and Bt play the roles of kernels of mixtures.
Mixture components are the corresponding counterfactual outcomes conditional on
the response types and mixture probabilities are the response-type probabilities.
    One approach to identifiability is to simply assume that conditions (24) and (25)
apply to R. A more satisfactory approach, and the one taken here and in Pinto
(2016a), investigates how alternative specifications of choice relationships generate
response matrices R that satisfy the identifiability requirements of Theorem T-2 and
Corollary C-1.
    It is important to note that we have given conditions for identifying counterfactual
means within strata, E(Y (t)|S). Treatment effects are derived from, but are distinct
from, these counterfactual means. Mean treatment effects are comparisons of different
counterfactuals within the same set of strata: E(Y (t) − Y (t0 )|S ∈ Σ) for t 6= t0 ,
where Σ ⊆ supp(S) is a subset-set of strata that might consist of a single element.
In Section 7 we discuss identification of mean treatment effects, which is a more
demanding problem.


4.1       Example: Binary Choice (LATE)
To familiarize the reader with our notation and concepts, and anticipate our general-
ization of it, consider the binary choice model implicit in the Local Average Treatment
Effect – LATE. Treatment variable T takes two values: Tω = t1 if agent ω chooses to
be treated and Tω = t0 if not. Instrument Z is binary valued (supp(Z) = {z0 , z1 })
with the property 0 < P (T = t1 |Z = z0 ) < P (T = t1 |Z = z1 ) < 1. A standard
example is the problem of identifying the causal effect of college education on income
Y . Agent ω decides between going to college (Tω = t1 ) or not (Tω = t0 ). Instrumental
variable Z represents randomly assigned college scholarships. For example, Zω = z1
if a scholarship is assigned to agent ω and Zω = z0 if agent ω does not receive a
scholarship.
 27
      See, e.g., Yakowitz and Spragins (1968) and Prakasa Rao (1992).




                                                13
   The response vector is S = [T (z0 ) , T (z1 )]0 . Without further restrictions, S can
take four possible values described by the following response matrix:
                                     s1    s2   s3    s4
                                 "                         #
                                     t1    t0   t1   t0        values for T (z0 )
                            R=                                                    ·               (26)
                                     t1    t1   t0   t0        values for T (z1 )

In the language of LATE, the response-types s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 are always-takers, compliers,
defiers, and never-takers, respectively. Bt1 is the binary matrix that has the same
dimension as R, whose elements take value 1 if the corresponding element in R is t1
and value 0 if the element in R is t0 . Thus, Bt1 = 1[R = t1 ] and Bt0 = 1[R = t0 ]
indicate whether elements in R are equal to t1 or t0 , respectively.28
     The 4 × 4 binary matrix BT = [Bt00 , Bt01 ]0 has rank equal to 3, which is less
than the number of response-types NS = 4. Therefore, by C-1, neither response-type
probabilities nor the counterfactual outcomes are point identified. To identify them,
it is necessary to reduce the number of response-types.
     LATE solves this non-identification problem by assuming that each agent ω can
only change his decision in one direction as the instrument varies. The monotonicity
condition of Imbens and Angrist (1994) is:

Assumption A-1. Monotonicity for the Binary Choice Model: The following
inequalities hold for any z, z 0 ∈ supp(Z) :

1[Tω (z) = t1 ] ≥ 1[Tω (z 0 ) = t1 ] ∀ ω ∈ Ω or 1[Tω (z) = t1 ] ≤ 1[Tω (z 0 ) = t1 ] ∀ ω ∈ Ω.29
                                                                                           (27)

   In our example, condition A-1 assumes that each agent is inclined to decide
towards college if a scholarship is granted, i.e., 1[Tω (z1 ) = t1 ] ≥ 1[Tω (z0 ) = t1 ] for all
ω ∈ Ω. This eliminates the response-type s3 (the defiers) in matrix (26), generating
the following matrices:
     28
          We also have that Bt1 = ιNZ ι0NS − Bt0 , where ιN denotes a N -dimensional vector of elements
1.
     29
    Imbens and Angrist (1994) do not use indicator functions. This is one innovation of our analysis.
They compare the values of the counterfactual choices directly, e.g., Tω (z) ≥ Tω (z 0 ), assuming the
T are ordered. In their analysis, the values that choice T takes must be ordered. Our approach
does not require T to be ordered. The two monotonicity criteria are equivalent for the binary choice
model.

    Under monotonicity condition A-1 the three response-type probabilities
(P (s1 ), P (s2 ), P (s4 )) and the four counterfactual outcomes
(E(Y (t0 )|S = s2 ), E(Y (t0 )|S = s4 ), E(Y (t1 )|S = s1 ), E(Y (t0 )|S = s4 )) are identi-
fied. These claims can be demonstrated by applying T-2 and C-1. For instance the
rank of the binary matrix BT in (28) is 3, which is also the number of response-types.
Thus, by C-1, all the response probabilities PS are identified. The identification
of counterfactual outcomes depends on the properties of matrices Kt0 , Kt1 that are
calculated using the pseudo-inverse matrices Bt+0 , Bt+1 as described in (21):

                                                               

Bt+0 =  1 −1  ⇒ Kt0 =  0 0 0  and Bt+1 =  −1 1  ⇒ Kt1 =  0 0 0  .

     The observed vectors of propensity scores and conditional outcome expectations
are PZ = [P (T = t|Z = z0 ), P (T = t|Z = z1 )]0 and QZ (t) = [E(Y · 1[T = t]|Z =
z0 ), E(Y ·1[T = t]|Z = z1 )]0 , for t ∈ {t1 , t0 }. The unobserved 3×1 vectors of response-
type probabilities and counterfactual outcomes are given by

PS = [P (S = s1 ), P (S = s2 ), P (S = s4 )]0                                                                             (29)
and
QS (t) = [E(Y (t)|S = s1 )P (S = s1 ), E(Y (t)|S = s2 )P (S = s2 ), E(Y (t)|S = s4 )P (S = s4 )]0 .
                                                                                                                          (30)

 Equations (29) and (30) enable us to write the counterfactual E(Y (t0 )|S = s2 )
                            0
as E(Y (t0 )|S = s2 ) = ζ Q       S (t0 )
                              ζ 0 PS
                                          where ζ = [0, 1, 0]0 , so that ζ 0 PS = P (S = s2 ) is
the population probability of the switchers. Note that ζ 0 Kt0 = 0, thus, by T-2,
E(Y (t0 )|S = s2 ) is identified. From Equation (22)–(23), we have:

                          ζ 0 Bt+0 QZ (t0 )   E(Y · 1[T = t0 ]|Z = z0 ) − E(Y · 1[T = t0 ]|Z = z1 )
E(Y (t0 )|S = s2 ) =        0   +           =                                                       .
                          ζ Bt0 PZ (t0 )            P (T = t0 |Z = z0 ) − P (T = t0 |Z = z1 )


                                                            15
                                                                                                     ζ 0 QS (t1 )
   By a parallel argument, the counterfactual outcome E(Y (t1 )|S = s2 ) =                               ζ 0 PS
                                                                                                                  .
Since ζ 0 Kt1 = 0, by T-2, E(Y (t1 )|S = s2 ) is identified from the expression

                    ζ 0 Bt+1 QZ (t1 )   E(Y · 1[T = t1 ]|Z = z1 ) − E(Y · 1[T = t1 ]|Z = z0 )
E(Y (t1 )|S = s2 ) = 0 +              =                                                       .
                    ζ Bt1 PZ (t1 )            P (T = t1 |Z = z1 ) − P (T = t1 |Z = z0 )

     LATE is the causal effect for compliers E(Y (t1 ) − Y (t0 )|S = s2 ). Since P (T =
t0 |Z = z) = 1 − P (T = t1 |Z = z), ζ 0 Bt+1 PZ (t1 ) = ζ 0 Bt+0 PZ (t0 ) = P (S = s2 ).
Putting these ingredients together,
         E(Y (t0 ) − Y (t0 )|S = s2 )
         ζ 0 Bt+1 QZ (t1 ) − Bt+0 QZ (t0 )
                                          
                                                   E(Y |Z = z1 ) − E(Y |Z = z0 )
       =                +                   =                                            .
                   ζ 0 Bt1 PZ (t1 )           P (T = t1 |Z = z1 ) − P (T = t1 |Z = z0 )

    LATE is the causal effect conditioned on the values of V associated with strata
s2 . It does not identify the average treatment effect E(Y (t1 ) − Y (t0 )) because we
cannot identify Y (t1 ) for s4 (t0 -always-taker) nor Y (t0 ) for s1 (t1 -always-taker). The
counterfactual outcomes for the always-takers can be expressed in terms of QS (t) and
PS by:

                       ζ00 QS (t0 )                  0                            ζ10 QS (t1 )
E(Y (t0 )|S = s4 ) =                ; ζ 0 = [0, 0, 1]  and E(Y (t 1 )|S = s 1 ) =              ; ζ1 = [1, 0, 0]0 .
                          ζ00 PS                                                     ζ10 PS

Since ζ00 Kt0 = 0 and ζ10 Kt1 = 0, by Theorem T-2, E(Y (t0 )|S = s4 ) and E(Y (t1 )|S =
s1 ) are identified. In Section 7, we use the properties of the generalized inverse to
extend our analysis to a general model of multiple choices and extend the notion of
compliers to the general unordered choice model.


4.2     Revisiting Vytlacil’s Equivalence Theorem
A by-product of our analysis is a simple derivation of Vytlacil’s (2002) fundamental
equivalence result. He shows that monotonicity condition A-1 holds if and only if
the treatment choice can be expressed as a function that is separable in Z and V ,
i.e., there exist deterministic functions, ϕ : supp(V ) → R and τ : supp(Z) → R such
that:
                                                         
                            1[T = t1 ]|V = v, Z = z = 1[τ (z) ≥ ϕ(v)].                                     (31)

   Monotonicity A-1 generates a key property of the binary matrix Bt1 = 1[R = t1 ].


                                                     16
We can always reorder its rows and columns so that Bt1 becomes a lower-triangular
matrix.30 Consider the binary choice model where T takes values in {t0 , t1 } and Z
takes values in {z1 , . . . , zNZ } that are indexed by increasing values of the propensity
score, i.e., P (T = t1 |z1 ) ≤ · · · ≤ P (T = t1 |zNZ ). Arrange the columns of binary
matrix Bt1 in decreasing order of the column-sums. Under Monotonicity A-1, Bt1
has dimension NZ × (NZ + 1) and is lower triangular. An explicit expression for Bt1 is
given by Equation (28) for NZ = 2.31 Under triangularity, for all i ∈ {1, · · · , NZ }, n ∈
{1, · · · , NZ + 1},

                  Bt1 [i, n] = 1 for i ≥ n         and        Bt1 [i, n] = 0 for i < n.        (32)

Propensity score equality (15) generates the following expressions:

                                      NS
                                      X
             P (T = t1 |Z = zi ) =            1[T = t1 |Z = zi , S = sn0 ] · P (S = sn0 )
                                      n0 =1
                                      NXZ +1

                                  =            Bt1 [i, n0 ] · P (S = sn0 )
                                      n0 =1
                                      Xi
                                  =           P (S = sn0 ).                                    (33)
                                      n0 =1


The second equality uses the definition of an element in the i-th row and n-th column
of Bt1 [i, n0 ], that is Bt1 [i, n0 ] = 1[T = t1 |Z = zi , S = sn0 ] and that NS = NZ + 1 due
to monotonicity A-1. The third equality uses triangularity property (32). Thus the
following inequalities hold:

                                                 i
                                                 X
             Since P (T = t1 |Z = zi ) =                 P (S = sn0 ),
                                                 n0 =1
                                                 X n
              then P (T = t1 |Z = zi ) ≥                 P (S = sn0 )             for i ≥ n    (34)
                                                 n0 =1
                                                 n
                                                 X
            and     P (T = t1 |Z = zi ) <                P (S = sn0 )             for i < n.   (35)
                                                 n0 =1

   Recall R does not have redundant rows or columns. Otherwise stated, .
  31
   In Section 6, we present a generalization of the triangular property for matrices called “lonesum
matrices.”



                                                     17
      We can combine Equations (32) and (34)–(35) to express the elements Bt1 [i, n]
as:

                      Bt1 [i, n] = 1 [P (T = t1 |Z = zi ) ≥ φ(sn )] ,                         (36)
                                                               n
                                                               X
                   where φ(sn ) = P (S ∈ {s1 , . . . , sn }) =   P (S = sn0 ).                (37)
                                                              n0 =1


Vytlacil’s theorem emerges since Bt1 [i, n] = 1[T = t1 |Z = zi , S = sn ] and S is a
balancing score for V , i.e., S = fS (V ). Thus, for any v ∈ supp(V ) there is an
s ∈ supp(S) such that s = fS (v), and
                                                                                     
    1 T = t1 |Z = z, V = v =1 T = t1 |Z = z, S = fS (v) = 1 P (T = t1 |Z = z) ≥ φ(fS (v))     (38)
                                                             |     {z       } | {z }
                                                                      τ (z)        ϕ(v)


 This expression captures the key idea that the response variable S summarizes V .
Section 6 establishes separability properties for a general unordered choice model. The
triangularity property generating separability carries over to that general setting.


5       Multiple Unordered Choices
In the published literature, when LATE is extended to analyze multiple choices, T
is assumed to be a scalar index defined over an ordered finite set of natural num-
bers {1, . . . , NT } where the index is monotonically increasing (or decreasing) in the
indicators of t (Angrist and Imbens, 1995). Treatment effects are defined in terms of
variations in this index:

Assumption A-2. Ordered Monotonicity. The following inequalities hold for
any z, z 0 ∈ supp(Z), and each treatment t ∈ supp(T ):

                   Tω (z) ≥ Tω (z 0 ) ∀ ω ∈ Ω or Tω (z) ≤ Tω (z 0 ) ∀ ω ∈ Ω.                  (39)

    Under standard assumptions about IV, A-2 is equivalent to the assumption that
choices are generated by an ordered choice model (Vytlacil, 2004). To extend mono-
tonicity to the unordered case, we retain the core feature of a monotonic relationship:
shifts in Z move all agents toward or against making treatment choice t in supp(T ).
We do not require any order among the values of T , nor do we rely on a scalar repre-
sentation of T . Instead, we replace comparisons of T with inequalities that compare


                                                18
indicator functions of the values taken by T for each pair of values z, z 0 in supp(Z).
If the support of T has no natural order, Assumption A-2 is meaningless.
    This section extends the literature to define a concept of monotonicity for an
unordered choice model. We discuss restrictions on the response matrix R that follow
from this definition. We present some examples that build intuition.


5.1    Monotonicity for Unordered Models

Assumption A-3. Unordered Monotonicity. The following inequalities hold for
any z, z 0 ∈ supp(Z), and each treatment t ∈ supp(T ):

   1[Tω (z) = t] ≥ 1[Tω (z 0 ) = t] ∀ ω ∈ Ω or 1[Tω (z) = t] ≤ 1[Tω (z 0 ) = t] ∀ ω ∈ Ω,
                                                                                       (40)

where 1[Tω (z) = t] indicates whether or not agent ω chooses treatment t ∈ supp(T )
when Z is set to z.

    Using indicator functions, we can make pairwise comparisons for all values of Z
for each choice t ∈ supp(T ) without imposing an arbitrary ordering on the values of
the treatment choices T or creating a scalar index of T . Condition (40) preserves the
key intuitive notion of monotonicity: a shift in an instrument moves all agents uni-
formly toward or against each possible choice. A-3 prohibits non-uniform movements
induced by the instruments and is ruled out in Theorem T-3 below.
    In the case of binary treatment, Ordered Monotonicity A-2 and unordered mono-
tonicity A-3 generate the same monotonicity restriction A-1.32 In Appendix C, we
present a simple example that demonstrates the benefits of using choice indicators
rather than cardinal measures of outcomes to define monotonicity.


5.2    Linking Unordered Monotonicity to Choice Theory
Under unordered monotonicity, treatment choice can be characterized as the solu-
tion to a problem in which agents maximize utility Ψ(t, z, v), the utility arising from
choosing t ∈ supp(T ) for agent ω whose unobserved variable V takes value v when the
instrument Z is set at z. We present a formal analysis of the properties of Ψ(t, z, v)
generated by unordered monotonicity in Section 6. In this section we build economic
  32
   Heckman and Pinto (2015c) show that in the general case of multi-valued treatments, Ordered
Monotonicity A-2 and unordered monotonicity A-3 do not imply each other.


                                             19
intuition of how unordered monotonicity arises. We use revealed preference argu-
ments to restrict R and generate monotonicity conditions. We give examples where
plausible restrictions on choice theory, coupled with standard instrumental variable
conditions, produce identification of various strata counterfactuals and response-type
probabilities. We also examine cases in which the point identification of response-type
probabilities fails.
    Consider a model of car purchase in which each agent buys a single car from three
                    
possible options: a, b, c . Let Tω = tj if agent ω buys car j in supp(T ) = {ta , tb , tc }.
Instruments are randomly assigned car-specific vouchers that offer price discounts to
the car (or cars) specified by an offered voucher. We use za , zb , zc for vouchers that
offer a discount to cars a, b and c respectively. We use zbc for the voucher whose
discount can be used to buy car b or c. zno denotes no discount. If the voucher
assigned to agent ω is za , then he faces a price-discount if he decides to buy car a.
Agent ω pays full if decides to buy car b or c. If the agent were assigned voucher
zbc then the cars b and c become cheaper while car a has full price. We compare
experimental designs that randomly assign different combinations of 3 out of the 5
voucher-types described above. Each agent ω is assumed to buy some car. In this
section and in Web Appendix D, we give some examples of how choice restrictions
facilitate identification and where they fail.
    Our main example carried throughout the rest of this paper considers vouchers in
supp(Z) = {zno , za , zbc }. The response vector S is given by the 3-dimensional vector
of counterfactual choices: S = [T (zno ), T (za ), T (zbc )]0 . Each of the three counterfac-
tual choices T (z); z ∈ {zno , za , zbc } takes values in {ta , tb , tc }, which gives a total of
27 (= 33 ) possible response-types.33 Without restrictions on admissible strata, the
model of strata-contingent counterfactuals is not identified.34 There are four intuitive
monotonicity relationships arising from changes in z:

                               1[Tω (zno ) = ta ] ≤ 1[Tω (za ) = ta ],                        (41)
                                1[Tω (zbc ) = ta ] ≤ 1[Tω (za ) = ta ],                       (42)
                          1[Tω (zno ) ∈ {tb , tc }] ≤ 1[Tω (zbc ) ∈ {tb , tc }],              (43)
                           1[Tω (za ) ∈ {tb , tc }] ≤ 1[Tω (zbc ) ∈ {tb , tc }].              (44)
  33
    See Web Appendix Table D.1.
  34
    If we assume an ordered choice model, we can readily secure identification. If we only assume a
partially ordered model we lose identification. Heckman and Pinto (2015c) discuss these cases.




                                                   20
Relationship (41) states that the agent is induced toward buying car a when the in-
strument changes from no voucher (zno ) to a voucher for car a (za ). Relationship (42)
states that the agent is induced toward buying car a when the instrument changes
from a voucher to buy b or c (zbc ) to a voucher for car a (za ). Relationship (43)
states that the agent is induced toward buying either car b or c when the instrument
changes from no voucher (zno ) to a voucher for either car b or c (zbc ). Relationship (44)
states that the agent is induced toward buying either car b or c when the instrument
changes from a voucher for car a (za ) to a voucher that applies to either car b or c
(zbc ). Monotonicity relationships (41)–(44) eliminate 12 response-types out of the 27

    Thus, by Corollary C-1, our model for counterfactuals is not identified. In addi-
tion, some of the remaining strata are not consistent with unordered monotonicity A-
3. More stringent application of revealed preference analysis can generate additional
choice restrictions. Let Λω (z, t) be the consumption set of agent ω when assigned
instrument z ∈ supp(Z) when treatment is set to t ∈ supp(T ). Let γ ∈ Λω (z, t)
represent a consumption good. Agent ω is assumed to maximize a utility func-
tion uω defined over consumption goods γ and choice t. Thus, the choice function
Chω : supp(Z) → supp(T ) of agent ω when the instrument is set to value z ∈ supp(Z)
is:
                                                            
                        Chω (z) = argmax      max uω (g, t) .                    (45)
                                                  t∈supp(T )    g∈Λω (z,t)

                                                           21
       For budget set Λω (z, t) for agent ω, we assume the following relationships:

                               Λω (zno , ta ) = Λω (zbc , ta ) ⊂ Λω (za , ta ),                          (46)
                                Λω (zno , tb ) = Λω (za , tb ) ⊂ Λω (zbc , tb ),                         (47)
                                Λω (zno , tc ) = Λω (za , tc ) ⊂ Λω (zbc , tc ).                         (48)

Relationship (46) compares the budget sets of agent ω for each possible voucher
assignment given the car choice is fixed at a. The budget set of agent ω is enlarged
when she has a voucher for car a (za ) compared to when she does not (za is the only
voucher that applies to car a). Thus, assigning consumer ω who buys car a, voucher
za provides additional income. Vouchers zno and zbc offer no discount for car a and
produce the same budget set for this choice. Relationship (47) examines the agent’s
budget set if ω purchases car b. The budget set of agent ω is enlarged if she has
a voucher that subsidizes car b when compared to vouchers that do not affect the
choice set (za , zno ). Relationship (48) examines the agent’s budget set when car c is
assigned and is consistent with the budget analysis of relationship (47).36 For this
example, the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference (WARP) generates the following
choice rule:

   if Chω (z) = t and Λω (z, t) ⊆ Λω (z 0 , t) and Λω (z 0 , t0 ) ⊆ Λω (z, t0 ) ⇒ Chω (z 0 ) 6= t0 .37    (49)

In particular, Choice Rule (49) applied to budget set relationships (46)–(48) generates
the choice restrictions 1–6 in Table 2.

supp(Z) = {zno , za , zbc }

 Choice    Restriction   1:    Chω (zno ) = ta     ⇒       Chω (za ) = ta
 Choice    Restriction   2:    Chω (zno ) = tb     ⇒       Chω (za ) 6= tc            and     Chω (zbc ) 6= ta
 Choice    Restriction   3:    Chω (zno ) = tc     ⇒       Chω (za ) 6= tb            and     Chω (zbc ) 6= ta
 Choice    Restriction   4:    Chω (za ) = tb      ⇒       Chω (zno ) = tb            and     Chω (zbc ) 6= ta
 Choice    Restriction   5:    Chω (za ) = tc      ⇒       Chω (zno ) = tc            and     Chω (zbc ) 6= ta
 Choice    Restriction   6:    Chω (zbc ) = ta     ⇒       Chω (zno ) = ta            and     Chω (za ) = ta
 Choice    Restriction   7:    Chω (zno ) 6= ta    ⇒       Chω (zbc ) = Chω (zno )


  36
     Under this rationale, it follows that: Λω (zb , ta ) = Λω (zno , ta ), Λω (zb , tb ) = Λω (zbc , tb ), and
Λω (zb , tc ) = Λω (zno , tc ).

                                                      22
    Under additional assumptions about choice, we generate additional restrictions on
the admissible strata. It is reasonable to assume that if an agent decides to buy a car
without a discount, then the agent will not alter his choice if assigned a voucher that
makes his choice of car cheaper. Specifically consider the agent who decides between
cars b and c when voucher assignment shifts from zno to zbc . There is no discount
under zno whereas zbc offers a discount for either car. If most of the income increase
is spent on goods, then the agent’s car choice likely remains the same.38 Under this
condition, an income increase should not decrease its consumption of a good. If the
agent is already consuming one unit of car b and his income is increased, then the
agent will not decrease his car consumption, hence the agent still buys car b if the
voucher changes from zno to zbc .39 This restriction on choice generates the 7 admissible
response types in Table 2. The choice restrictions of Table 2 eliminate 20 out of the
27 possible response-types generating the admissible response matrix in Table 3.40

    For the response matrix of Table 3, the rank of the indicator matrix BT associated
with this response matrix is equal to 7 which is also equal to the number of response-
types. From Corollary C-1, response-type probabilities are identified. We can also
identify mean counterfactual outcomes defined in terms of the strata in the table.
The response matrix of Table 3 is generated by the nine unordered monotonicity
relationships of Table 4.41 The choice restrictions generated by the revealed preference
analysis in Table 2 produce unordered monotonicity A-3.


Remark 5.1 . The response matrix in Table 3 is uniquely generated by the unordered

monotonicity relationships of Table 4. By uniquely we mean that a change in the
direction of any of these inequalities produces a response matrix that differs from the
one in Table 3. This property is useful for testing the model assumptions as each
monotonicity relationship implies a propensity score inequality that can be tested on
observed data.

    Unordered monotonicity can arise under different configurations of the instru-
mental variable. Thus, in the previous example, consider changing the support of
the instrumental variable Z from {zno , za , zbc } to {zno , zb , zbc }. We can apply the
same revealed preference analysis of the first example to {zno , zb , zbc }. This analysis
generates the response matrix shown in Table 5 which is also uniquely generated by
nine inequalities consistent with unordered monotonicity A-3. The response matrix
also identifies response-type probabilities and an associated set of counterfactual out-
comes. However, three out of seven response-types in Table 5 differ from the ones in
Table 3.

   Choice restrictions alone do not necessarily produce identifiability. For an ex-

ample, see Web Appendix D.2. We further note that unordered monotonicity A-3
is not a necessary condition for identification of model parameters. In Web Ap-
pendix D.3, we modify the example of Table 5 by assuming that Z takes values in
supp(Z) = {zc , zb , zbc }. WARP alone generates the response matrix described in Ta-
ble 6.42 The rank of its associated binary matrix BT is equal to 7. Thus, response-type
probabilities are identified. However, the response matrix in Table 6 is not consistent
with unordered monotonicity A-3. There is no sequence of monotonic relationships
consistent with A-3 that generates this response matrix. For example, consider the
change in voucher assignment from voucher for c (zc ) to voucher for b (zb ) in Table 6.
This change induces those in s4 to move towards ta (from tc to ta ), while those in
s2 to move away from ta (from ta to tb ). This pattern of counterfactual choices is
inconsistent with monotonicity.43 Moreover, revealed preference analysis may or may
not identify the choice model, depending on the patterns of restrictions imposed on
the variation in the instruments.44

6      Equivalent Conditions for Characterizing Un-
       ordered Monotonicity
This section presents and interprets general properties shared by all response matrices
that satisfy unordered monotonicity A-3. We explore a variety of ways to express
A-3 including separability of choice equations.
  42
     See Table D.13 in Web Appendix D.3 for the elimination analysis.
  43
     This claim is formally proved in the next section using Condition (iii) of Theorem T-3.
  44
     This paper does not consider issues of estimation and inference. If certain parameters are over-
identified from different instrument configurations, the obvious approach is to combine estimators
using efficient GMM (Hansen, 1982).

6.1     Properties of Binary Matrices
To establish a relationship between identifiability and the properties of response ma-
trix R, it is helpful to use concepts from the literature on binary matrices. A binary
matrix is lonesum if it is uniquely determined by its row and column sums.45 We
establish that response matrix R is an unordered monotone response matrix (hence-
forth “monotone”) if each binary matrix derived from it, Bt = 1[R = t]; t ∈ supp(T ),
is lonesum. Lonesum matrices can be used to characterise monotonicity conditions
in choice models. We show that identification and equivalence results arise from the
properties of lonesum matrices.
    Let ri,t be the i-th row sum of the binary matrix Bt : ri,t = N
                                                                  P S
                                                                          Bt [i, n]. Let cn,t
                                                            PNZ n=1
denote the sum of the n-th column of Bt , that is, cn,t = i=1 Bt [i, n]. The maximal
of matrix Bt is a matrix whose i-th row is given by ri,t elements 1 followed by 0s.
Two matrices are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by a series of
row and/or column permutations.
    Table 7 displays matrix Bta = 1[R = ta ], where R is the response matrix of
Table 3. The first column of Table 7 gives the row sums of Bta . The last row of
Table 7 presents its column sums. To show that matrix Bta is lonesum, reorder its
columns and rows based on decreasing values of column sums and increasing values
of row sums. The maximal of Bta is obtained by a reordering of Bta based only on
row and column sums. Note that there are different orderings for different t. The
reordered matrix of Table 3 is given in Table 8. It is a maximal matrix because the
matrix rows are described by elements 1 followed by 0s. For example, if a maximal
matrix has 7 columns and its first row sum is 1, the first row is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Thus
a maximal matrix is uniquely determined by its row sums. Therefore we conclude
that Bta is a lonesum matrix. One can check that matrices Btb and Btc of Table 3
are also lonesum. Thus, following our definition, response matrix R of Table 3 is
unordered monotone. In our analysis of LATE in Section 4.1, Bt1 and Bt0 are both
lonesum.

6.2    Characterizing Unordered Monotonicity
The following conditions are necessary and sufficient for characterizing unordered
monotonicity A-3:

Theorem T-3. The following statements are equivalent characterizations of A-3 for
the IV model (1)–(3):
  (i) R is an unordered monotone response matrix, i.e., each binary matrix Bt =
      1[R = t]; t ∈ supp(T ) is lonesum;
 (ii) For any t, t0 , t00 ∈ supp(T ), there are no 2 × 2 sub-matrices of R of the type:

                          t t0                 t0 t
                                                        
                                     or                        , where t0 6= t and t00 6= t.46            (50)
                         t00 t                 t t00


                                                      27
(iii) Unordered monotonicity: For any z, z 0 ∈ supp(Z), and for each treatment
      t ∈ supp(T ), we have that: 47

        1[Tω (z) = t] ≥ 1[Tω (z 0 ) = t] ∀ ω ∈ Ω or 1[Tω (z) = t] ≤ 1[Tω (z 0 ) = t] ∀ ω ∈ Ω.

 (iv) Unordered Separability: treatment choice can be represented by separa-
      ble choice functions in V and Z, i.e., there exist functions ϕ : supp(V ) ×
      supp(T ) → R and τ : supp(Z) × supp(T ) → R such that:

                  1[T = t|V = v, Z = z] = 1[Ψ(t, z, v) ≥ 0] = 1[ϕ(v, t) + τ (z, t) ≥ 0].           (51)

Proof. See Web Appendix A.6.

     Condition (i) states our main condition for equivalence: if and only if response ma-
trix R is unordered monotone, each indicator matrix formed from it (Bt = 1[R = t])
is lonesum, and conversely. Condition (ii) states that if R is an unordered monotone
response matrix, each 2 × 2 sub-matrix in R is not of the form in (50). Condition
(iii) states that the conditions preceding it hold if and only if unordered monotonic-
ity A-3 holds. As previously noted, condition (iii) implies monotonicity A-1 for the
binary choice model. Condition (iv) is a separability property that characterizes the
choice functions. Vytlacil’s equivalence theorem (2002) is generated by the equiva-
lence of conditions (iii) and (iv) when we specialize the model to the case of a binary
treatment.48


6.3       Interpreting T-3
Condition (i) describes a key property of response matrices: the lonesum property of
treatment choice indicators. Lonesum matrices are not only useful for characterizing
unordered monotonicity, but they are key concepts for investigating properties of

      Alternatively, this can be written as: for any z, z 0 ∈ supp(Z) and t ∈ supp(T ), we have that:

                  1[T = t]|Z = z, V = v ≥ 1[T = t]|Z = z 0 , V = v for all v ∈ supp(V )

             or 1[T = t]|Z = z, V = v) ≤ 1[T = t]|Z = z 0 , V = v for all v ∈ supp(V ).

choice models.49
    Condition (i) of T-3 implies that Bt is fully characterized by its column and row
sums. This condition implies that the response matrix R is also characterized by
its row and column sums. However, the reverse is not true. We illustrate this in
Remark 6.1 :

Remark 6.1 . If R is an unordered monotone response, each matrix Bt is lonesum
and therefore fully characterized by its column and row sums ri,t , cn,t ; t ∈ supp(T ), i ∈
{1, . . P
        . , NZ }, n ∈ {1, . . . , NS }. Since Response matrix R can be written as
R=          tBt , R is characterized by its column and row sums ri,t , cn,t as well. However,
   t∈supp(T )
the reverse is not true. R being characterized by its column and row sums does not
imply that R is an unordered monotone response. To illustrate this claim, let response
matrix R be defined by:
                  
           t1 t2                  r1,t1 = 1, r1,t2 = 1, r1,t3 = 0,      c     = 1, c1,t2 = 1, c1,t3 = 0,
R=                     , thus                                       , : 1,t1
           t2 t3                  r2,t1 = 0, r2,t2 = 1, r2,t3 = 1,      c2,t1 = 0, c2,t2 = 1, c2,t3 = 1.
                                |                {z                } |                 {z                }
                                             row sums                             column sums

R is not unordered monotone because it violates condition (ii) of T-3. Moreover
Bt2 = 1[R = t2 ] exhibits one of the prohibited patterns (52) and it is not lonesum.
Nevertheless, R is fully characterized by its column sums and row sums: r1,t1 =
1 and c1,t1 = 1 ⇒ R[1, 1] = t1 ; r2,t3 = 1 and c2,t3 = 1 ⇒ R[2, 2] = t3 ; r1,t2 =
1 and R[1, 1] = t1 ⇒ R[1, 2] = t2 ; r2,t2 = 1 and R[2, 2] = t3 ⇒ R[2, 1] = t2 .
   All response matrices for the case of binary treatment are equivalent under mono-
tonicity A-1. This property does not hold for the general unordered case:

Remark 6.2 . Consider the binary choice model in which the instrument takes NZ
values and T takes values in {0, 1}. Unordered monotonicity generates a monotonicity
inequality for each pair of Z-values. Different sets of inequalities generate different
response matrices. However, each of these response matrices is equivalent to the
same lower triangular binary matrix with NZ rows and NZ + 1 columns (see the
example in Section 4.1) and produces an identified model. However, in the case of
multiple choices, unordered monotonicity does not generate response matrices that are
equivalent to the same matrix. For example, the response matrices of Tables 3 and
5 are monotone responses but they are not equivalent, because one matrix cannot be
transformed into another by row and/or column permutations. The response matrices
  49
    Heckman and Pinto (2015c) show that lonesum matrices also play a key role in equivalence
results for ordered monotonicity. Pinto (2016b) develops a framework for the design of social in-
terventions using lonesum matrices that rely on revealed preference relationships to identify causal
parameters. He shows that incentive designs based on lonesum matrices generate a range of mono-
tonicity conditions.


                                                        29
in Tables 3 and 5 consist of seven response-types for NT = 3 and NZ = 3. There are 27
possible response-types for NT = 3 and NZ = 3. The combination of 7 response-types
out of these 27 generates 888,030 possible response matrices, although some may not
be identifiable. Among them, 66 response matrices satisfy unordered monotonicity
condition (iii).50 Response matrices of Tables 3 and 5 are two examples of these
matrices.
    Condition (ii) of T-3 imposes a restriction on counterfactual choices that does not
depend on the number of treatment choices in supp(T ) or the number of values that
Z takes. The condition rules out two-way flows generated by changes in instruments.
Thus the response matrix of Table 6 is not unordered monotone. The forbidden type
of condition (ii) is obtained using the first and second rows of response-types s2 and
s4 in Table 6.51 The change from zc to zb shifts people away from a in s2 but toward
a in s4 .

Remark 6.3 . We note that a consequence of condition (ii) in T-3 is that under A-3,
no 2 × 2 sub-matrix of any Bt ; t ∈ supp(T ) is of the type: 52
                                                             

    Unordered monotonicity A-3 holds if and only if no prohibited patterns (52) occur
for any Bt ; t ∈ supp(T ). An example clarifies the equivalence between the require-
ments for unordered monotonicity A-3 and the absence of prohibited patterns (52).

that s = fS (v) (see (10)) and (T |S = s, Z = z) = (T |V = v, Z = z). Inequality (53)
generates three possible sub-vectors of dimension 2 × 1 that indicate whether T is

other hand, suppose that v, v 0 ∈ supp(V ) are such that (1[T = t]|Z = z, V = v) >
(1[T = t]|Z = z 0 , V = v) and (1[T = t]|Z = z, V = v 0 ) < (1[T = t]|Z = z 0 , V = v 0 ).
Then there must exist s, s0 ∈ supp(S) where s = fS (v), s0 = fS (v 0 ) that generates
the prohibited pattern:

The equality of the first columns in the right and left side of Equation (55) means that,
for some type s, treatment t is chosen when the instrument shifts from z 0 to z. The
equality of the second columns of Equation (55) states the opposite. For some type s0 ,
the instrument shift from z 0 to z causes treatment t not to be chosen. This behavior
violates both the intuitive notion and formal definition of monotonicity because the
instrument shifts some agents to change their choice towards t while others change
their choice away from t.53 Condition (iii) is implied by super (or sub) modularity
of Ψ(t, z, v) in terms of v and z for all t, but that condition is stronger than what is
required to produce A-3. Strictly speaking, the requirement is that component-wise,
sgn( ∆Ψ(T,z,v)
         ∆z
               ) is the same for all V = v for each T = t and Z = z.
  53
    Violation of Condition (ii) is not necessarily a violation of rationality. Table 6 is based on an
application of WARP, but violates Condition (ii) and unordered monotonicity.

6.4     Understanding Condition (iv) of T-3
We draw on and generalize the binary-treatment model of Sections 4.1–4.2 to build
the intuition underlying condition (iv). In the binary case, monotonicity implies
that Bt1 is lower triangular (28).54 Triangularity generates Equation (38) which
expresses treatment choice T as an indicator function that is separable in the observed
propensity score P (T = t1 |Z), which depends on Z, and a sum of response-type
probabilities, which depends on V.
    Theorem T-3 applies to choice models with multiple treatments, which include
the binary case. If unordered monotonicity (condition (iii) of T-3) holds, then each
binary matrix Bt ; t ∈ supp(T ) is characterized solely by its row and column sums so
that Bt ; t ∈ supp(T ) are lonesum (Item (i) of T-3). This property can be understood
as a generalization of the lower triangular property in the binary case, but applied
to each Bt .55 Generalized triangularity generates condition (iv) which characterizes
treatment choice as an indicator function that is separable in Z and V . We present
a detailed discussion of this condition in Appendix G.
    To interpret separability condition (iv), suppose that agent ω with Vω = v ∈
supp(V ) chooses t ∈ supp(T ) when an instrumental variable is set to z ∈ supp(Z),
so that 1[T = t|V = v, Z = z] = 1. According to condition (iv), there exist functions
ϕ and τ such that ϕ(v, t) + τ (z, t) ≥ 0.56 It is clear that expressions of this type
rule out the prohibited patterns (52) and therefore generate unordered monotonicity.
What is less obvious is that (iii) implies representation (iv), which is not necessarily
unique.57
    Note that 1[T = t|V = v, Z = z] = 1 implies that 1[T = t0 |V = v, Z = z] = 0 for
all t0 ∈ supp(T ) \ {t}. Therefore it must be the case that ϕ(v, t0 ) + τ (z, t0 ) < 0 for all
  54
     Recall that we eliminate all redundancies in the rows or columns of R.
  55
     With the caveat that we eliminate any redundancies in the rows and columns of R.
  56
     Web Appendix H discusses the threshold property of condition (iv) in greater detail.
  57
     Consider a binary choice model: T = 1[α + V · Z ≥ 0] T ∈ {0, 1} where (α, V ) is a random
vector and V , Z, and α are scalar. Suppose that we impose the requirement that V > 0 while
Z is unrestricted. This is a monotone response model that is nonseparable. However, it can be
represented as a separable model: T = 1[ Vα + Z ≥ 0]. This highlights the non-uniqueness of
the representation of Ψ(t, Z, V ) and that separability is only one characterization of preferences
consistent with A-3.

t0 that differs from t. In particular, condition (iv) implies that:

1[T = t|V = v, Z = z] = 1 ⇔ t = argmax Ψ(t0 , z, v) = argmax ϕ(v, t0 ) + τ (z, t0 ) .
                                                                                  
                                          t0 ∈supp(T )                     t0 ∈supp(T )

                                                                                                  (56)

Condition (iv) does not claim that the functions ϕ and τ are unique. Indeed if t
maximizes ϕ(v, t0 ) + τ (z, t0 ), it also maximizes m(ϕ(v, t0 ) + τ (z, t0 )) where m is any
strictly increasing function.
    Condition (iv) does not impose rationality or perfect foresight on agent decision
making. Suppose that agent ω decides among t1 , t2 , t3 and that his treatment choice is
generated by maximization of a utility function Ψ(t, z, v) where Vω = v and Zω = z.
Condition (iv) states that if unordered monotonicity A-3 holds, the maximized choice
value Ψ(t, z, v) can be characterized as arising from the maximization of a separable
function ϕ(v, t) + τ (z, t). Specifically, if ω chooses t1 , then t1 is the maximum among
Ψ(t, z, v) for t ∈ {t1 , t2 , t3 }. In this case, t1 also maximizes ϕ(v, t) + τ (z, t) for
t ∈ {t1 , t2 , t3 } :
                                                                                   
             t1 = argmax Ψ(v, t, z)          ⇔       t1 = argmax ϕ(v, t) + τ (z, t) .
                   t∈{t1 ,t2 ,t3 }                       t∈{t1 ,t2 ,t3 }


Condition (iv) does not imply that the ranking of treatment utilities generated by
Ψ(t, z, v) is necessarily the same as the ranking generated by ϕ(v, t) + τ (z, t). For
instance, if Ψ(t1 , z, v) > Ψ(t2 , z, v) > Ψ(t3 , z, v) then ω prefers t1 to t2 , and t2 to
t3 . This does not necessarily imply that ϕ(v, t1 ) + τ (z, t1 ) > ϕ(v, t2 ) + τ (z, t2 ) >
ϕ(v, t3 ) + τ (z, t3 ). Indeed, ϕ(v, t1 ) + τ (z, t1 ) > ϕ(v, t3 ) + τ (z, t3 ) > ϕ(v, t2 ) + τ (z, t2 )
may also occur. It is the ranking of t1 relative to the next best that generates agent
choices of t1 . Variation in instruments only identify preferences relative to the next
best choice and not an order among the remaining elements in the choice set.
     To formalize this discussion, we establish that unordered monotonicity arises if we
assume that utilities of a choice compared to the next best choice can be represented

then the response matrix R associated with this choice model is unordered monotone.
Proof. See Web Appendix A.7.

As before, the separable representation is not necessarily unique.

    Heckman et al. (2006b, 2008) assume separability in the underlying preference
functions and show that IV estimates a LATE that compares the outcome of one
choice to the outcome for the next best option. Our condition is weaker. Theorem T-
4 states that unordered monotonicity only requires that the utility of a choice relative
to the next best choice be separable. To clarify, the impact of instrument Z on the
treatment choice is summarized by the term h(z, t). Suppose Z changes from z 0 to
z. If h(z, t) − h(z 0 , t) > 0, each agent is induced towards t. If h(z, t) − h(z 0 , t) < 0
agents are induced against t. This analysis applies for all pairwise values of (z, z 0 ) ∈

supp(Z) × supp(Z) and for all t ∈ supp(T ). The collection of all of these inequalities
characterizes unordered monotonicity A-3.


6.5    Verifying Unordered Monotonicity Condition A-3
Verifying condition (ii) of Theorem T-3 is a daunting combinatorial task. It would
require checking each 2 × 2 sub-matrix in R, which is impractical for large R. We
show that a single calculation based on a simple multiplication of binary matrices
suffices to check condition A-3. Our criterion is based on a binary matrix M :

           For each tj ∈ supp(T ) = {t1 , . . . , tNT },
                 let Mtj = [1NZ ,NS , · · · , 1NZ ,NS , Btj , 0NZ ,NS , · · · , 0NZ ,NS ],
                            |          {z           }         |          {z           }
                                        j − 1 times                   NT − j times

               then M =     [Mt01   , ... ,   Mt0N ]0 ,                                      (57)
                                                  T



where 1NZ ,NS is a matrix of elements 1 and 0NZ ,NS is a matrix of elements 0 of same
dimension. Matrix M is block diagonal with matrices Bt on the diagonal, where,
again, we eliminate any redundancies. M has elements 1 below this diagonal and
elements 0 above it.

Theorem T-5. For the IV model (1)–(3), the response matrix R is an unordered
monotone response, that is, each binary matrix Bt = 1[R = t]; t ∈ supp(T ) is
lonesum, if and only if,
                                                        
                  0      0  0
                                         0    0
                                                      0
                 ιc M (ιr ιc − M )      M (ιr ιc − M ) ιc = 0,          (58)

where ιr is an NT · NZ vector 1s and ιc is an NT · NS vector 1s. Moreover, if Equa-
tion (58) holds, then matrix M is lonesum.
Proof. See Web Appendix A.8.

    Unordered monotonicity condition A-3 holds if and only if this value is equal to
zero. Moreover, if equation (58) holds, then all the conditions stated in Theorem T-3
also hold.

7     Identification of Counterfactuals and Treatment
      Effects
This section applies our analysis to determine which counterfactuals and treatment
effects are identified and for which strata. We build on our analysis of binary LATE
presented in Section 4.1. We generalize the notions of “compliers,” “always takers”
and “never-takers” to a general unordered choice model.
    To this end, it is helpful to introduce some additional notation. Let Σt (i) be the
set of response-types in which t appears exactly i times:
                                                      NZ
            (                                                                  )
                                                      X
 Σt (i) =   sn , such that sn ∈ supp(S) and                    Bt [j 0 , n] = i    where i ∈ {0, . . . , NZ }. (59)
                                                      j 0 =1


 For example, Σta (2) for the response matrix of Table 3 consists of the response-types
for which the value ta appears exactly twice. They are Σta (2) = {s2 , s3 } (see Table 9).
Those are also the response-types whose column-sum of Bta in Table 7 is 2.

                   Response-types in Σta (1)                                      s4        s6
                   Response-types in Σta (2)                       s2     s3
                   Response-types in Σta (3)               s1

                         ta -Switchers                             s2     s3      s4        s6
                       ta -Always-takers                   s1
                        ta -Never-takers                                               s5        s7



    For each t ∈ supp(T ), we can partition the set of response-types by the number
of times a treatment value t appears: supp(S) = ∪N         i=0 Σt (i). Table 9 displays these
                                                             Z


partitions for Σta (i); i = 0, . . . , 3 based on the response matrix in Table 3. Let bt (i)

                                                      36
be the NS -dimensional binary row-vector that indicates if response-type s belongs to
Σt (i), that is, bt (i)[n] = 1 if sn ∈ Σt (i) and zero otherwise. For Table 3, bta (2) =
[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Using this notation, we prove the following identification theorem:

Theorem T-6. If unordered monotonicity A-3 holds for the IV model (1)–(3) then
the following response-type probabilities and counterfactuals are identified:

   P (S ∈ Σt (i)) and E(κ(Y (t))|S ∈ Σt (i)) ∀ t ∈ supp(T ) and i ∈ {1, . . . , NZ }.              (60)

Moreover, those parameters can be evaluated by the following equations:

                                                                             bt (i)Bt+ QZ (t)
  P (S ∈ Σt (i)) = bt (i)Bt+ PZ (t) and E(κ(Y (t))|S ∈ Σt (i)) =                              ,    (61)
                                                                             bt (i)Bt+ PZ (t)

where κ : supp(Y ) → R denotes an arbitrary function in the support of Y .
Proof. See Web Appendix A.9.

    Note that, in general, we cannot identify counterfactuals within every stratum.
Nonetheless, it can be shown that under unordered monotonicity, at least one treat-
ment effect can always be identified.59
    Table 10 lists the mean counterfactual outcomes that are identified by applying
Equation (60) of T-6 to the response matrix R in Table 9. Those are E(Y (t)|S ∈
Σt (i)) for i ∈ {1, 2, 3} and t ∈ {ta , tb , tc }.

                                                 Counterfactual Outcomes
       Response-type Sets            Y (ta )                  Y (tb )                Y (tc )

             Σt (1)         E(Y (ta )|S ∈ {s4 , s6 })   E(Y (tb )|S = s2 )    E(Y (tc )|S = s3 )
             Σt (2)         E(Y (ta )|S ∈ {s2 , s3 })   E(Y (tb )|S = s4 )    E(Y (tc )|S = s6 )
             Σt (3)         E(Y (ta )|S = s1 )          E(Y (tb )|S = s5 )    E(Y (tc )|S = s7 )



Remark 7.1 . A direct implication of Theorem T-6 is that if there exists t, t0 ∈ supp(T )
and i, i0 ∈ {1, . . . , NZ } such that Σt (i) = Σt0 (i0 ) then E(Y (t)−Y (t0 )|Σt (i)) is identified.
This expression is the mean treatment effect of t relative to t0 for the set of strata Σt (i).
   Expression (61) uses the tools for identification based on the generalized inverse
developed in Section 4. For instance, we can apply Equation (61) of T-6 to generate
  59
    In general, a richer class of treatment effects can be identified in the unordered model than in
the ordered or binary models. See Heckman and Pinto (2016).

                                                 37
the following identifying relationships:

                                                          bta (1)Bt+ QZ (ta )
       E(Y (ta )|S ∈ {s2 , s3 }) = E(Y (ta )|S ∈ Σta (1)) =
                                                          bta (1)Bt+ PZ (ta )
                                  E(Y · 1[T = ta ]|Z = zno ) − E(Y · 1[T = ta ]|Z = zbc )
                                =                                                         .          (62)
                                        P (T = ta |Z = zno ) − P (T = ta |Z = zbc )

 See Web Appendix A.10 for the derivation of Equation (62). Counterfactuals
E(Y (tb )|S = s2 ) and E(Y (tc )|S = s3 ) are also identified (See Table 10). Thus we
can identify the effect:

         E(Y (ta ) − Y (tb )|S = s2 )P (S = s2 ) + E(Y (ta ) − Y (tc )|S = s3 )P (S = s3 )
                                                                                           .         (63)
                                     P (S = s2 ) + P (S = s3 )

 Let ta designate the choice values other than ta . We use the notation E(Y (ta ) −
Y (ta )|S ∈ {s2 , s3 }) to designate treatment effect (63), which stands for the effect of
choosing ta versus not choosing ta for response-types s2 , s3 . (See Web Appendix A.19
for its derivation.)
    We generalize the terminology of Angrist et al. (1996) to the case of multiple
treatments. The appropriate generalization is t-specific. In the binary case, there is
no need to specify a particular t since the specification of one value automatically
implies the other possible value. The t-Never-takers are those in the set of response-
types in Σt (0), for which t does not occur. Σt (NZ ) consists of a single response-type
whose elements are all t. It is the set of the t-Always-takers. The set of remaining
                                       SNZ −1
response-types are t-Switchers ≡ i=1          Σt (i) consists of all strata for which the
choice of treatment t varies as Z ranges in its support.60 Those sets are formally
defined as:

           t-Never-takers = {s ∈ supp(S); P (T = t|S = s) = 0} ≡ Σt (0);
         t-Always-takers = {s ∈ supp(S); P (T = t|S = s) = 1} ≡ Σt (NZ );
                                                                                    Z −1
                                                                                   N[
              t-Switchers = {s ∈ supp(S); 0 < P (T = t|S = s) < 1} ≡                       Σt (i).
                                                                                    i=1


These sets for the response matrix of Table 3 are: ta -Always-takers = {s1 },
ta -Never-takers = {s5 , s7 }, and ta -Switchers = {s2 , s3 , s4 , s6 } (see Table 9). Corol-
laries C-2–C-3 present identification results for the various categories
  60
       An alternative terminology would be t-Compliers.

     P (S ∈ t-Never-takers) = P (S ∈ Σt (0))
                            = 1 − P (S ∈ t-Always-takers) − P (S ∈ t-Switchers).

Corollary C-2 relies on the result in T-6 that P (S ∈ Σt (i)) is identified for all
i ∈ {1, . . . , NZ }. Corollary C-3 is obtained by setting κ(Y ) = Y and using the fact
that E(κ(Y (t))|S ∈ Σt (i)) is identified for all i ∈ {1, . . . , NZ }. To illustrate these
corollaries we present the following example.

Remark 7.2 . Corollary C-2 states that the expected value of counterfactual mean
outcomes for response-types s ∈ supp(S) such that P (T = t|S = s) = 1 (the
t-Always-takers) or 0 < P (T = t|S = s) < 1 (t-Switchers) are identified. According
to Remark 3.1, these response-types refer to the values v ∈ supp(V ) such that 0 <
P (T = t|V = v) ≤ 1. Therefore, C-3 implies that E(Y (t)|V ∈ {v; 0 < P (T = t|V =
v) ≤ 1}) is identified. The remaining set of response-types are the t-Never-takers,
which consists of the response-types s ∈ supp(S) such that P (T = t|S = s) = 0. This
set refers to the set of values v ∈ supp(V ) such that P (T = t|V = v) = 0. If the set
of t-Never-takers is empty, then all response-types belong to either t-Always-takers or
t-Switchers and E(Y (t)) is identified.

Web Appendix A.17 presents additional results on identification. Web Appendix A.21
shows that E(Y (ta )−Y (ta )|ta -Switchers) is also identified. In contrast with the binary
case, there is no response-type s ∈ {s1 , . . . , s7 } of response matrix R in Table 3 such
that E(Y (t) − Y (t0 )|S = s) is identified for any t, t0 ∈ {ta , tb , tc }.
    It is important to distinguish identification of counterfactuals within sets of strata
from the identification of treatment effects within sets of strata. An example is help-
ful. Consider the response matrix for a two-valued instrument with three treatment
choices under unordered monotonicity. It has five response types:

                                           s1       s2    s3     s4 s 5

                                                     40
     Five counterfactual mean outcomes are identified: E(Y (t1 )|S = s1 ), E(Y (t1 )|S =
s2 ), E(Y (t2 )|S = s3 ), E(Y (t3 )|S = s4 ), E(Y (t3 )|S = s5 ). E(Y (t2 ) − E(Y (t̄2 )|t̄2 −

ment, which may vary among members of the t2 switchers.61


7.1       Maximum Number of Admissible Response-types to Se-
          cure Identification
The identification of strata probabilities P (s), ∈ S can be achieved under weaker con-
ditions than are required for identifying counterfactual outcomes. The identification
of response-type probabilities depends on the column-rank of BT while the identifica-
tion of counterfactual outcomes for a choice t ∈ supp(T ) depends on the column-rank
of Bt . The rank of BT is always greater than the rank of each Bt ; t ∈ supp(T )
because BT is generated by stacking Bt across t ∈ supp(T ) (Equation (24)).
    We characterize the maximum number of response-types NS in R that facilitate
the identification of all response-type probabilities, that is, the maximum NS such
that NS ≤ rank(BT ).

Theorem T-7. Consider the IV model (1)–(3). Let R be the response matrix con-
sisting of NS response-types. If response-type probabilities are point identified, then it
must be the case that:
                                            NZ X
                                            X  NT
                 NS ≤ 1 + (NT − 1)NZ −                 1[P (T = tj |Z = zi ) = 0],
                                             i=1 j=1


where NZ is the number of possible values that the instrument takes and NT is the
number of possible values that the treatment choice T takes. In particular, if P (T =
t|Z = z) > 0 for all z ∈ supp(Z) and t ∈ supp(T ) then the maximum number of
response-types NS in R for the model to be identified is:

                                   NS = 1 + (NT − 1)NZ .

Proof. See Web Appendix A.13.

       To identify choice-response probabilities, choice restrictions should eliminate at
  61
    See Heckman et al. (2006a). This analysis readily generalizes to any columns of switchers.
This treatment effect can always be identified under the assumption of unordered monotonicity.
Treatment effects for other categories of switchers can also be identified under these conditions.
Additional treatment effects can sometimes be identified. See Heckman and Pinto (2016).

least NTNZ − [1 + (NT − 1)NZ ] response-types to generate identification of response-
type probabilities. T-6 shows that even if we are not able to identify each probability
P (S = s); s ∈ supp(S), it may still be possible to identify counterfactual means
E(Y (t)|S ∈ Σt (i)) and associated probabilities P (S ∈ Σt (i)) for strata Σt (i). See
Web Appendix A.14 for additional results on identification of strata probabilities.


8    Summary and Conclusions
This paper extends the literature on instrumental variables to general unordered
choice models with heterogenous responses which affect choice. We generalize the
notion of monotonicity to unordered choice models. Using discrete instruments, we
present conditions under which certain counterfactuals and treatment effects associ-
ated with general unordered multiple discrete choice models can be identified. We
demonstrate how to characterize the set of identified counterfactuals and treatment
effects.
    We represent IV equations using discrete mixtures. Identification is achieved by
imposing restrictions on the kernels of the mixtures. We do not invoke separability
of preferences or identification at infinity to achieve these results. Nonetheless, sep-
arability of choice equations emerges as one representation of the underlying choice
process.
    Unordered monotonicity can sometimes be justified by economic choice models. It
can be represented in multiple ways. Unordered monotonicity implies and is implied
by a form of separability in the equations generating choices. These representations
are linked to properties of binary matrices that characterize the admissible response-
types generated by the available instrumental variables. We develop a variety of
criteria to determine if Unordered Monotonicity is satisfied. We interpret each of
these criteria and explain how they can be used in practice. We show that “principal
strata” in the statistics literature are coarse versions of control functions.
    This paper demonstrates the power of binary matrices in generating and inter-
preting identification conditions and in unifying apparently diverse approaches to
identification of mean counterfactuals and mean treatment effects. The broader les-
son of this paper is that in general unordered discrete choice models restrictions on
choice behavior, encoded in the kernel of the mixture representing the IV equations,
play a fundamental role in identifying counterfactuals using instrumental variables.
