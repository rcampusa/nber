This paper examines how the public policy environment in the United States affects work by new
mothers following childbirth. We examine four types of policies that vary across states and affect the
budget constraint in different ways. The policy environment has important effects, particularly for
less advantaged mothers. There is a potential conflict between policies aiming to increase maternal
employment and those maximizing the choices available to families with young children. However,
this tradeoff is not absolute since some choice-increasing policies (generous child care subsidies and
state parental leave laws) foster both choice and higher levels of employment.

INTRODUCTION

        American women begin work quickly after giving birth compared with their counterparts

in other developed nations – for example, 41% have worked by three months after the birth

compared with only 7% in the UK.1 The public policy environment facing new mothers in the

United States also differs substantially from those in other nations in terms of parental leave

rights, provision of universal child care, and cash assistance for families with young children

(Waldfogel 2001). A number of studies have explored the association between parental leave

rights and longer work absences (Jaumotte 2004; Pettit and Hook 2005; Baker and Milligan

2007; Han, Ruhm and Waldfogel 2009) yet these are not the only public policies that shape the

choices available to new parents. In this paper we consider the work incentives generated by

leave laws alongside three other policies that affect budget constraints in different and

potentially conflicting ways. Specifically, we examine how state parental leave laws, child care

subsidies, cash welfare and Food Stamp benefit generosity, and welfare work requirements for

mothers of infants affect the employment patterns of mothers of newborns and young

children. Fundamental to our analysis is the recognition that the opportunities available vary

substantially with socio‐economic status and geographic location, and that the policies we

examine target different groups and have varying effects on work incentives.

        We know surprisingly little about how the policy environment affects the work decisions

of American women with infants and young children. This study begins to fill this gap through

analysis of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study‐Birth Cohort (ECLS‐B), a nationally

Study (2000/1) respectively
                                                                                                    2


representative sample of more than 10,000 U.S. women giving birth in 2001. We exploit both

cross‐state variation and differential targeting of the policies to identify plausibly causal effects

on work participation, as measured by the probability of working at or before 12 weeks and by

9 months post‐birth, with limited additional analysis of longer‐term effects on employment

around the time of the child’s fourth birthday. These estimates are used to illustrate potential

effects of different policy packages implemented at the national level, paying special attention

to the results of implementing a bundle of “work maximization” policies, designed to increase

early work participation, and of a “choice promotion” package, intended to provide mothers

with the greatest freedom of opportunities. Three of the four focal policies are targeted at

relatively disadvantaged women, so our conclusions are particularly relevant for them.

       The policy environment matters. Moving from a package of policies with the weakest to

the strongest employment incentives is predicted to increase the fraction of mothers working

at or before their child’s ninth month by around eight percentage points, with much stronger

effects for single or less educated mothers. It is noteworthy that some policies increasing the

choices available to new mothers – child care subsidies and parental leave laws – are also

associated with increased employment, suggesting that the twin goals of providing choice and

encouraging work may not be incompatible.

       That said, the most work promoting policies include those that decrease nonearned

incomes (e.g. by limiting welfare work exemptions and providing low levels of transfer

payments) and have the potential to reduce the well‐being of mothers. Thus we provide

information about but can not determine the “optimal” mix of public policies. Doing so requires

evaluation of tradeoffs between the potentially conflicting goals of protecting the employment
                                                                                                                 3


rights of mothers and incomes of families during the period surrounding a birth versus

attempting to maximize the employment of mothers (particularly the disadvantaged), which

has been a key policy goal of welfare reform.


STATE POLICIES

        This section details our focal policies, discusses their likely effects on early maternal

employment, and illustrates the geographical variation in each type of policy.

State parental leave laws

        Parental leaves laws increase the choices available to new mothers by extending the

time they can take off work without forfeiting their pre‐birth jobs. Klerman and Leibowitz

(1997) point out that these entitlements are expected to increase leave‐taking but have

ambiguous effects on work, primarily because some parents may choose a short job‐protected

leave rather than a longer absence that requires finding a new job (see Ruhm 1998 and

Waldfogel 1999 for related discussions). One result is that the effects of such laws may differ in

the short‐term and medium‐term. For instance, work might decrease during the leave period

but rise subsequently, because covered women can more often continue in their pre‐birth

positions rather than having to search for new jobs.

        Mothers of the ECLS‐B cohort children gave birth in 2001 and so were all covered by the

federal 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Therefore we cannot evaluate the impact of

the FMLA but rather focus on state leave laws.2 Fewer than one‐half of private sector workers


2
 Prior research indicates that the FMLA has no overall effect on post‐childbirth employment but is associated with
more leave‐taking and so some initial decreases in work (Han, Ruhm, and Waldfogel, 2009). Ross (1998),
Waldfogel (1999) and Han and Waldfogel (2003) provide further evidence on the FMLA, and Klerman and
Leibowitz (1997) analyze state leave laws in the period prior FMLA enactment.
                                                                                                               4


meet the qualifying conditions for FMLA (Waldfogel 2001), but 15 states have state parental

leave laws more generous than the federal law. Many increase coverage by relaxing the FMLA

conditions on firm size, tenure, or work hours requirements (see Appendix Table 1).3 Some

states allow for unpaid leaves in excess of 12 weeks, and five states have temporary disability

insurance (TDI) laws that provide a short (typically six weeks) period of paid leave. Our main

analysis uses a binary indictor distinguishing states with any leave law, regardless of its terms,

from those with just the federal FMLA. We explored the differential effects of the various types

of state leave laws, but collinearity and small samples precluded meaningful analysis of this

issue.

         Figure 1a depicts the geographical variation in state leave laws. Generous leave

entitlements tend to be located in the west coast, great lakes, and northeast regions.

Child care subsidies for low income families

         Child care subsidies raise the net income a mother receives from given work hours and

so are likely to increase rates of employment. Subsidies also lower the cost of paid versus

unpaid care, and so make (relatively costly) formal child care more affordable, presumably

leading to a substitution of paid and formal care for unpaid and informal care.

         Although Blau and Currie (2004) argue that previous research suggests a small overall

elasticity of employment with respect to child care prices, Blau and Tekin (2007) emphasize that

child care subsidies are typically much larger for low‐income families and are targeted towards


3
  The FMLA provides 12 weeks of unpaid parental leave to those in firms of 50 or more employees who worked at
least 1,250 hours in the prior year. We do not code state laws that are restricted to state government employees
as these cover only a small share of the workforce. Han, Ruhm, and Waldfogel (2009) provide a detailed discussion
of state leave laws.
                                                                                                     5


certain population sub‐groups, whose responsiveness may be relatively high. Support for this is

obtained from studies of local subsidy programs implemented prior to the 1996 welfare

reforms (Berger and Black 1992; Anderson and Levine 2000; Meyers et al. 2002), which found

substantial positive employment effects for low income or disadvantaged groups.

         Under welfare reform, child care funding was consolidated into the Child Care and

Development Fund (CCDF) block grant, with total state and federal subsidies increasing from

$1.7 billion in 1992 to $9.5 billion in 2000 (Gish 2002). The CCDF allows states to serve families

with incomes up to 85 percent of state median income (many states set lower thresholds) and

where the parents are working or in school. States determine child care prices and parent co‐

payment rates, and must offer a choice of child care types and providers. They can also transfer

funds from their TANF block grants to CCDF and may use TANF funds to directly purchase some

child care. A small amount of funding is also available through the federal Social Services Block

Grant.

         Evidence on the employment effects of these dramatic expansions in child care

subsidies is limited. Blau and Tekin (2007), using data for 13 states in 1999, estimated that child

care subsidy receipt increased the employment of single mothers by 33 percentage points.

Tekin (2007) estimated that a one dollar wage subsidy raised the employment of single mothers

by 7 percentage points versus 3.7 points for a corresponding child care subsidy. However per

dollar of government funds, the latter is more cost‐effective, because it only targets working

mothers using paid child care and not all employed mothers. Magnuson, Meyers, and

Waldfogel (2007) find that increased child care subsidies explained 14 to 16 percent of the rise

in formal child care enrollment occurring between 1992 and 2000, among preschool‐age
                                                                                                                      6


children from low‐income families, but they did not examine maternal employment. Lefebvre

and Merrigan (2008) show that Quebec’s $5‐a‐day day‐care policy had large and statistically

significant effects on the employment of Canadian mothers with young children. A general

limitation of previous research is that it does not focus on parents of newborns, who might be

especially sensitive to child care subsidies because of the relatively high costs of infant care.

Conversely, preferences for parental versus non‐parental care could be relatively price‐inelastic

during this period.

        We measure child care subsidies through a continuous variable capturing federal and

state Child Care Development Fund (CCDF) expenditures in fiscal year 2000 (in 2001 dollars) per

poor child under the age of 6.4 The timing is not ideal since fiscal year 2000 covers October 1,

1999 to September 30, 2000, whereas the first 9 months of the ECLS‐B cohort extend from

January 1, 2001 to September 30, 2002 but expenditure data for the relevant period is not

available. We experimented with using a weighted average of child care subsidy allocations

(rather than expenditures) in FY 2001 and 2002. However, CCDF allocations and expenditures

vary substantially because some states roll funds over from one fiscal year to the next and the

correlation between the two in FY2000 – when both series are available ‐‐ is just 0.59. As the

correlation between expenditures in FY2000 and FY2003 is 0.97, we believe that the

expenditure series for 2000 fairly accurately reflects the subsidies available to ECLS‐B parents

during the first 9 months after the birth.

  States receive a federal block grant earmarked explicitly for the CCDF and may transfer up to 30 percent of their
TANF block grant directly to the CCDF. They can also use remaining TANF funds to subsidize child care directly
(largely through vouchers). Our measure includes all three sources of child care subsidies.
                                                                                                   7


       Figure 1b shows that the geographical variation in average annual CCDF spending per

poor child under 6 follows a fairly strong north‐south divide. Spending is divided into low,

middle, and high categories in the figure but measured continuously in our multivariate

analysis.

Welfare work exemptions and benefit levels

       Welfare work exemptions and generous transfer payments reduce the net gain from

employment and so are expected to discourage work participation. Consistent with this,

previous research finds that more work‐oriented welfare rules and lower welfare or Food

Stamp benefits raise the employment of single mothers (Blank 2002; Grogger and Karoly 2005).

However, few prior studies focus on those with young children or explicitly examine infant work

exemptions, which are among the most dramatic welfare reforms. (Before TANF, women were

generally exempted from welfare work requirements until their youngest child reached 36

months of age.) The limited available research finds that new mothers work more and breast‐

feed for shorter durations in states that do not exempt them from work requirements

(Jacknowitz and Schoeni 2003; Hill, 2007).

       Other potential measures of welfare generosity include time limits on receipt and the

stringency of sanctions for families not complying with work requirements. However, these

measures are likely to be strongly correlated at the state level, and since we are examining the

behavior of families with newborns, the welfare work exemptions seem most relevant. We do

not examine the effects of expansions in the EITC program since most policy variation occurred

at the federal level.
                                                                                                                    8


        We measure state welfare work exemptions for parents of infants using a dummy

variable equal to one for the 27 states providing an exemption of 12 months or more. Since 23

states had exemptions lasting exactly 12 months (see Appendix Table 2), this seems like a

sensible threshold. However, our results are robust to the use of other cut‐offs.

        Transfer payment generosity is proxied by the maximum dollar value of TANF plus Food

Stamp (TANF‐FS) benefits in the state for a family of three.5 Again, we treat this as a continuous

variable in our multivariate analysis, but define low, middle and high categories for our

graphical presentation.

        Figures 1c and 1d show that prolonged welfare work exemptions tend to be

concentrated in the south, southeast, and midwest , while TANF and Food Stamp benefits are

most generous in the northeast, upper midwest, and west, and least so in the south.

Other state policies and characteristics

        Figures 1a to 1d showed that each of the four policies tend to be clustered

geographically but that the patterns differ markedly across the types of policies. These

variations are likely to be associated with differences in other state policies and characteristics,

as documented in Appendix Table 3. For instance, states with generous maternity leave tend to

have relatively high family incomes, union coverage, abortion rates, and Democratic state

legislators, but low rates of infant mortality or uninsured children. Generous leave rights are

 Three is the most representative family size: in FY2001 the average size of TANF families was 2.6, such families
averaged two recipient children, and 60 percent had only one adult recipient (2002 TANF Annual Report to
Congress, available at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/data‐reports/annualreport5/chap10.pdf).
                                                                                                     9


also correlated with TANF‐FS benefits, child care subsidies, stringent child care regulations, high

child care worker wages, and more licensed child care centers.


EARLY CHILDHOOD LONGITUDINAL STUDY‐BIRTH COHORT

           The ECLS‐B contains a nationally representative sample of children born in 2001, and

oversamples of Asian and Pacific Islanders, American Indian and Alaska Natives, Chinese

children, twins, and low birth weight infants.6 Information is available from the birth

certificate, baseline parent interviews, and child assessments when each child was

approximately 9 months old. Further survey waves were conducted when the child was 24

months old, and in the years immediately before and after kindergarten entry. The 9‐month

interview provided rich information on parental employment, demographic characteristics,

lifestyles, and behaviors. State of residence at birth, taken from the birth certificate, was used

to define the state policies relevant to each mother. We also made use of data on maternal

employment status from the pre‐kindergarten wave.

Outcomes

           At the 9‐month interview, mothers were asked if they had worked for pay during the

last week and, if not working or on vacation/leave at that time, if they had done so at any time

since giving birth. If the answer to either question was yes, they were asked how old the child

was when they first went back to work. Using this information, we constructed dichotomous

work participation variables indicating whether the mother started working less than 12 weeks




6
    Further information on the ECLS‐B is available at http://nces.ed.gov/ECLS/index.asp.
                                                                                                                10


post‐birth and whether she had worked by 36 weeks (9 months) after it.7 Longer‐term effects

were examined by measuring whether the mother was working (or on vacation) in the fall of

the year prior to the child’s entering kindergarten. Eighty percent of sample children were 4

years old at this interview and, for the sake of brevity, we refer to this below as employment at

or around age 4. The sample size for this variable is reduced by attrition (N=8760), an issue we

address in our empirical estimation below.

        Approximately 28 percent of mothers in our sample worked within 12 weeks of

childbirth, and 59 percent within 9 months, with a similar fraction working when their child was

around 4 years old (see Appendix Table 4). Figure 2 shows the geographical variation in work

participation rates by 9 months and indicates that mothers return to work relatively quickly in

the midwest, south, mid‐atlantic and mountain states, and slowly in the west and northwest.

Control Variables

        We use the rich ECLS‐B data (detailed in Appendix Table 4) to control for differences in

maternal and family characteristics. These include standard demographic variables (e.g. marital

status, race/ethnicity, and education), information on the mother’s experiences in childhood

and later life, health‐related behaviors, attitudes towards motherhood, and her desired number

of children.

        We also include additional controls to proxy characteristics that may affect the mother’s

propensity to work but differ systematically between states. However, in doing so, we exclude


7
 The first (second) variable is coded as one if the answer to the age question was one or two months, or one to 11
weeks (one to 9 months, or one to 36 weeks). Mothers on leave are classified as not working. Observations for
whom the respondent is not the biological mother (N = 146) were dropped from the sample, as were those for
whom employment timing data was missing (N = 62), leaving an analysis sample of 10,480.
                                                                                                        11


factors potentially affected by post‐birth employment (such as breast feeding), since their

inclusion might absorb a portion of the true policy effect. Specifically, we control for education

of the mother’s parents, whether she lived continuously with her biological mother and father

until age 16, and whether her family received welfare in childhood. We also include indicators

of long‐term health behaviors such as body mass index and alcohol use before pregnancy,

smoking, drinking/drug problems, criminal behavior, and psychological problems.


METHODS

        Our analysis utilizes a difference‐in‐difference (DD) strategy that identifies “treatment”

and “control” groups for each policy. This is possible because the policies are likely to affect the

post‐birth employment of some groups of mothers but to have little or no effect on others.

Operationally, some individuals in our treatment groups may not actually be influenced by the

policies, while some in the control groups might be affected by them, with the result that our

estimates are likely to understate the true policy effects.

        We take two further steps to reduce the effects of potential confounding factors. First,

we include state fixed effects, to sweep out influences that are common to all mothers in a

given state. Second, we include controls for the exhaustive set of characteristics detailed in

Appendix Table 4.

        Formally, our estimating equation is:

                                   {             (            )}
        y is = α s + X 'is β + ∑ γ p ITisp + θ p STs p × ITisp + ε is ,                 (1)
                               p



where y is is the outcome for individual i in state s, α s is a state fixed effect (a vector of state

dummy variables), X 'is is a vector of individual, child, and family characteristics, ITisp equals
                                                                                                                 12


one if the woman is in the treatment group for policy p and zero otherwise, and STs p is the

state policy variable (e.g. a maternity leave entitlement more generous than the FMLA, a

welfare work exemption of a year or more, and levels of CCDF expenditures and TANF‐FS

allowances). θ p , the estimated “treatment effect”, captures the treatment versus control

group difference in states with the specified policy relative to those without it.8

        We report results of linear probability (LP) models for our dichotomous work

participation outcomes because LP coefficients are easier to interpret than corresponding

probit or logit estimates, especially when including interaction terms.9 However, prior to doing

so, we compared the results for LP and probit models for specifications that included all

covariates except the interactions. The magnitudes and statistical significance of the marginal

effects were quite similar, indicating that the linear probability results are informative. All

estimates are weighted to adjust for disproportionate sampling, survey nonresponse, and

noncoverage of the target population. The standard errors account for complex survey design.10

        In addition to estimating treatment effects, we simulate overall effects of the policies,

either singly or in combination, on the work participation of new mothers. For these estimates,

each mother retains her individual characteristics, state fixed effect, and individual treatment

 A standard difference‐in‐difference model also contains state policy variable “main effects” (not interacted with
the individual treatment indicators). These are captured by the vector of state dummy variables in equation (1)
and are directly controlled for in the models not including the former.
9
 Ai and Norton (2003) show that probit or logit coefficients may have the opposite sign as the predicted effect of
the interaction on the dichotomous dependent variable.
10
  The standard errors tend to be somewhat larger than those obtained by clustering at the state level (Bertrand,
Duflo and Mullainathan, 2004), which is less geographically disaggregated than the stratum and primary sampling
unit clustering we use.

status. The state treatment indicator for each policy is then “switched on” or “off” to

correspond to a particular policy package, and the mother’s participation probability is

predicted from the estimated coefficients. We average this predicted probability over all

mothers (in the specified group) to obtain the simulated employment rate. The difference

between this prediction and an alternative is the estimated “effect” of the specified policy

change. Because the state policy variable is interacted with the individual treatment indicator,

only the treatment groups are assumed to be affected by the change in policies. For example,

the participation probability of married mothers is assumed to be unaffected by infant work

exemption policies, because the treatment group indicator (single parenthood) is set to zero.

Since our model is linear and additive, the effect of the policy on the participation rate is equal

to the coefficient on the interaction term multiplied by the proportion of women affected by

the policy change. The latter varies across policies and sub‐groups.

        Formally, we estimate

                                      {               (

Where STs p* is a set of values for the state treatment indicators corresponding to a specific

policy scenario, yˆ is* is individual i’s simulated probability of participation, and the “hats”

indicate regression estimates. For example, in one scenario we define STs p* such that all states

offer leave entitlements beyond the FMLA, have infant work exemptions lasting at least one

year, and provide CCDF and TANF‐FS allowances at the 90th percentile, a configuration we refer

to as “choice‐promoting”. The effect of switching to this policy scenario from the current one

Treatment and control groups

        When evaluating state leave laws, our treatment group is mothers employed at some

point in the 12 months prior to the birth; those not so employed are the controls. The rationale

is that mothers who do not work during pregnancy are ineligible for leave and so cannot be

affected by leave rights.11 As mentioned, the treatment group contains some women

unaffected by the state policies. This occurs because most state laws relax qualifying conditions

for FMLA‐like benefits (although longer leaves are sometimes provided), implying that women

already eligible under the FMLA gain no additional rights. Mothers covered by employer leave

policies at least as generous as those provided by state laws will also be unaffected, as will

women remaining ineligible under the state laws.

        We performed sensitivity analysis using mothers who separated from their pre‐birth

employers prior to delivery as an alternative control group (dropping from the sample those

who did not work in the year before birth). Such women have no access to maternity rights and

so cannot be affected by the terms of laws. This specification has the advantage of not being

affected by differences in the characteristics of mothers who did and did not work in the year

before birth (e.g. if high female employment rates affect the decision by states to adopt leave

laws). However, these are not our “preferred” estimates, because leave entitlements might

influence the decision of whether or not to quit jobs during pregnancy.


11
   This assumes that the decision to work during pregnancy is not influenced by state leave policies, which seems
reasonable in the U.S., since the leaves are short and mostly unpaid (in contrast to Europe where women often
have strong incentives to work prior to birth, so as to qualify for lengthy paid leave).
                                                                                                              15


        The treatment group for child care subsidies is families where no parent has a high

school diploma. We define our treatment group according to parental education, even though

child care subsidies are targeted to low income families, to reduce the endogeneity problem

whereby child care costs influence work and therefore earnings. Our choice of educationally‐

disadvantaged households (the lowest 19% of the population) means that some proportion of

the control group will be eligible for child care subsidies. Nevertheless, since the subsidies are

awarded on a sliding scale (parental co‐payments depend on family income), they are likely to

provide far stronger incentives for less than more educated households. In sensitivity analyses

we widen the treatment group to include parents with high school diplomas and then those

with some college.

        The treatment group consists of single mothers when considering infant welfare work

exemptions or TANF‐FS benefits. Based on evidence that state welfare policies do not

substantially affect marital status (Moffitt, 1998), this is an effective way to define welfare

eligibility. For instance, 66% of ECLS‐B mothers claiming welfare in the first 9 months post‐birth

were single (at the end of the period), compared with just 16% of those not on welfare. By

contrast, defining the treatment group by education yields equivalent figures of 47% and 17%

(79% and 37%) if less than 12th grade (high school graduate) is the threshold.12


UNADJUSTED DD ESTIMATES

        Figures 3a through 3d use our difference‐in‐difference strategy to provide descriptive

evidence of how the four types of work‐family policies are related to the post‐birth work


12
  These numbers are only suggestive since welfare participation does not identify all women whose decisions are
affected by features of the system.
                                                                                                 16


participation of mothers. For example, the dashed line in Figure 3a displays the extent to which

mothers who worked during the year before birth (the treatment group) are more likely to be

employed after it than those who did not work in the preceding year (the controls), for women

in states with a leave law. The solid line shows corresponding disparities for women in states

without leave laws. The difference between these two lines is the unadjusted (for other

characteristics) DD estimate, since it shows how the treatment‐control gap differs in states with

and without the specified policy.

       The descriptive patterns suggest substantial and plausible policy effects. State leave

laws are associated with lower rates of work beginning 6 weeks after birth, with the largest

differences occurring between 8 and 15 weeks; the two groups have virtually identical

employment probabilities from 17 to 23 weeks, with some evidence of higher rates of work for

the treatment group 6 months or more after birth. Such patterns are consistent with findings

from the U.K. (Gregg, Gutierrez‐Domenech and Waldfogel, 2007) and make sense, since state

leave laws allow some women to take additional leave shortly after pregnancy but may

eventually raise work participation by increasing job continuity.

       High child care subsidies (>$2500 per poor child under 6) are associated with substantial

increases in post‐birth work, as shown in Figure 3b, compared with either medium ($1500‐

$2500) or small (<$1500) amounts. Employment begins to rise within a month after birth and is

sustained throughout the first nine months. There is also some suggestion that intermediate

subsidy levels elevate work participation in the second and third months, but these differences

are small and disappear quickly.
                                                                                                  17


       Short welfare work exemptions are associated with higher rates of work beginning 12

weeks after the birth (figure 3c). This is exactly when an effect is expected, since the exemption

expires at exactly three months in 16 states. Employment rates increase further for the

treatment group at four months, which makes sense since the exemptions expire at that time in

four additional states.

       The results for TANF‐FS benefits (figure 3d) are less clear. Inconsistent patterns are

found in the first 8 weeks after birth. The largest relative increases in work thereafter are found

in states offering intermediate benefits ($700‐$850 per month), with smaller growth predicted

for the most generous states (>$850 per month).


ECONOMETRIC ESTIMATES

       We next present econometric estimates. The “parsimonious” difference‐in‐difference

specifications in Table 1 control only for the state policies and their interactions with the

treatment group indicators. These correspond to the “unadjusted” DD estimates above, except

that they assume a linear dose‐response effect and consider all the policies simultaneously. The

“fully conditioned” models, in Table 2, incorporate state fixed‐effects and the wide variety of

mother, family, and child covariates. Both tables display coefficients on the interactions

between the policies and relevant treatment group indicators. To use leave laws as an example,

the parameter estimate on the main effect (not shown) captures differences in the probability

of working for the control group in states with leave laws relative to those in states without

them. Since such mothers are not expected to be affected by the policies, any observed

relationship is assumed to result from uncontrolled confounding factors. The interaction
                                                                                                  18


coefficient then provides the estimated leave law effect – the differential effect for the

treatment group relative to the controls.

       The parsimonious estimates in Table 1 largely accord with the descriptive relationships

provided previously. The first two rows show that state leave laws are associated with a

statistically significant 6.7 percentage point reduction in the work probabilities within 12 weeks

of birth but a 4.7 point increase at 9 months. Lengthy welfare work exemptions have no effect

at 12 weeks but predict a significant 8.2 percentage point employment reduction at 9 months.

An extra thousand dollars of child care subsidies (per poor child) correlates with a 4 point

employment increase at both 12 weeks and 9 months. TANF‐FS benefits are unrelated to work

at 12 weeks but are negatively correlated with it at 9 months.

       To assess longer‐term effects, we estimated how the policies were related to the

probability of the mother working at the age 4 interview. Since attrition shrinks the sample by

around 16 percent, we first repeated the <12 week and ≤9 month models on the sample of

mothers for whom we have information at the later date. The results, shown in the fourth

through sixth columns of Table 1, suggest that most effects observed at 9 months continue

through age 4, although the magnitudes and statistical significance are often reduced. For state

leave laws, the age 4 effect (4.4 percentage points) is only slightly smaller than at ≤9 months

(4.6 points for the same sample), although the standard error increases. Conversely, the work

reduction predicted by lengthy welfare work exemptions is just over half as large as at 9

months (4.7 versus 8.3 percentage points) and is not significant. CCDF spending is predicted to

have considerably larger effects at four years of age than earlier, but the estimates are

imprecise and the coefficients at <12 weeks and ≤9 months are substantially attenuated from
                                                                                                    19


those for the full sample. Finally, the work reducing effects of TANF‐FS benefits are of similar

magnitude at age 4 as at 9 months, but the standard errors are large.

        Most estimates are little affected by controlling for state fixed‐effects and the extensive

set of child, individual, and family characteristics. The results, shown in Table 2, confirm that

state leave laws are predicted to lower rates of work prior to 12 weeks but increase them by 9

months post‐birth. The welfare work exemption estimates are nearly identical to those

previously obtained and indicate reductions in work at ≤9 months and 4 years old. The findings

for child care subsidies are also unchanged, continuing to predict positive although not always

significant effects in all time periods. Finally, TANF‐FS benefits have similar or somewhat more

negative predicted effects on work in all periods and the coefficients more often approach or

reach statistical significance.

Robustness Checks

        The similarity of the results between Tables 1 and 2 increases our confidence in the

estimation strategy, since it suggests even the parsimonious difference‐in‐difference

specifications control well for potential confounding factors. The findings are also robust to the

use of a variety of alternative specifications, as detailed next.

        As discussed, we used an alternative control group for leave laws, consisting of mothers

who worked during some part of the year before the birth but were no longer employed at the

time of it. These specifications suggest somewhat stronger (11.1 percentage point) reductions

in work by 12 weeks and marginally weaker increases at ≤9 months or four years old.

        When considering child care subsidies, our main specifications used families where no

parent had a high school diploma as the treatment group. Broadening the treatment group to
                                                                                                 20


also include those with high school diplomas but no college or, alternatively, some college

attendance but no degree, weakened the estimated subsidy effects, as expected since the

alternative treatment groups include more families unlikely to receive subsidies. For example,

when the treatment group included parents with some college (but no degree), the child care

subsidy parameters were small and insignificant.

       We also estimated models using funds allocated to child care subsidies in FY 2001 and

2002, rather than child care subsidy expenditures in FY 2000. As discussed, these data

correspond more closely to the timing of the period following the births of the ECLS‐B cohort

but are imperfectly correlated with contemporaneous expenditures. The results are similar to

the main specification, but somewhat smaller in magnitude and less precisely estimated. This is

expected if there is greater measurement error in the allocations series.

       When evaluating welfare work exemptions and TANF‐FS benefits, we examined the

effect of dropping from the analysis families where a parent had attended college, so that the

treatment group includes less educated single mothers and the controls are corresponding

married women. These specifications yielded somewhat weaker effects than for the full

sample: welfare work exemptions of ≥12 months reduced the predicted probability of working

at 9 months by 5.1 percentage points and an extra hundred dollars per month of transfer

payments decreased it by 1.0 points. Neither estimate was statistically significant although this

may be partly because the sample size was reduced by three‐fifths. These estimates compare to

statistically significant reductions of 8.2 and 1.6 percentage points in the main model.

       Next, we varied the definition or timing of the dependent variables. When we examined

work at ≤16 weeks rather than <12 weeks after birth, the effects of state leave laws weakened
                                                                                                   21


considerably (falling from 6.7 to an insignificant 2.7 percentage points) whereas longer welfare

work exemptions strengthened from virtually no effect to predicting a significant 6.7

percentage point employment. Both results are plausible and reinforce our confidence that we

are obtaining causal estimates. Specifically, most state leave laws phase out between 12 and 16

weeks, so that there should be a rapid return to work during this period for the treatment

group. Similarly, since the duration of welfare work exemptions is exactly 3 months in 16 of 24

control states, differential rates of work should show up most strongly between 3 and 4

months.

       Finally, we ran models where the outcome was a dichotomous variable indicating if the

mother was working at nine months post‐birth, rather than at any point up to that time. The

results were similar but with slightly stronger increases associated with state leave laws or child

care subsidies, and marginally weaker reductions predicted for welfare work exemptions. The

most significant change was the more than 60 percent decrease (from ‐0.016 to ‐0.006) in the

coefficient on TANF‐FS benefits. This suggests that the early work promoted by low levels of

transfer payments is often unstable, so that many mothers beginning jobs have left them by

nine months after birth.


SIMULATIONS

       We next use results from the fully conditioned models in Table 2 to project how

different configurations of work‐family policies affect maternal work participation after birth.

These simulations assume that the policies have no effect on the control groups and may

understate the total effect, to the extent this is not the case. This exercise is limited by the

policy variation observed in the United States so that we cannot, for example, estimate the
                                                                                                                22


effects of providing the lengthy parental leave entitlements common in Canada and many

European countries but nonexistent in the U.S. Our results explore scenarios in which currently

existing state policies are implemented nationally. For the dichotomous policy variables –

parental leave laws and infant work exemptions – our simulations model turning the policy

“on” or “off”. For the continuous policy variables – CCDF and TANF‐FS spending – we compare

benefits at the 10th and 90th percentiles of the actual national distribution, referred to

respectively “low” and “high” expenditures.13

        Table 3 summarizes results for the full sample. Under existing policies, just over one

million mothers (roughly 28 percent) were working within 12 weeks of giving birth and 2.3

million (nearly 60 percent) by 9 months. Rows 1‐8 show the predicted influence of changing

single policies. For instance, abolishing all state leave laws increases predicted employment

rates at or before 12 weeks by 1.7 percentage points and reduces the probability of work within

9 months by 1.0 point (row 1). Conversely, instituting leave laws in all states decreases

predicted employment rates by 3.1 percentage points before 12 weeks and raises them by 1.8

percentage points by 9 months (row 2). Generous child care subsidies are associated with

substantial increases in post‐birth work while transfer payments and welfare work exemptions

have smaller predicted effects.

        The last two panels of Table 3 show results for policy combinations. Row (9) displays the

simulated effect of a set of policies that restrict the choices available to new mothers.




13
  The 10th and 90th percentiles for CCDF annual spending are $974 (South Carolina) and $3,863 (District of
Columbia), per poor child under 6. The 10th and 90th percentiles for TANF‐FS are $545 per month (Alabama) and
$928 per month (Connecticut), where these amounts refer to the maximum allowance for a family of 3.
                                                                                                               23


Specifically, states are assumed to offer no parental leave (beyond the federal legislation), child

care subsidies and TANF‐FS payments are at the 10th percentile, and welfare work exemptions

are shorter than 12 months. Row (10) shows the opposite case, where women have the most

choice: all states have leave laws, offer at least a one year welfare work exemption, and child

care spending and TANF‐FS payments are at the 90th percentile. The last two rows provide

information for different counterfactuals, where policies are selected according to the direction

of their effect on participation rates by 9 months post‐birth. Row (11) refers to policies

estimated to promote work participation: all states have a leave law; none have a welfare work

exemption lasting a year or more; CCDF and TANF‐FS spending are at the 90th and 10th

percentiles respectively. The second examines the reverse situation where no state has a leave

law, welfare work exemptions last at least one year, and states have low child care subsidies

and high transfer payments.14

        The combined predicted effect of policies promoting choice is relatively modest –work

participation falls at <12 weeks by 1.6 percentage points and increases at ≤9 months by 2.0

points. Switching from policies offering the least choice to those supplying the most –

calculated by subtracting row (9) from row (10) – is predicted to decrease work before 12

weeks by 2.9 percentage points but increase employment at ≤ 9 months by 2.1 points. This is

noteworthy, because it implies that legal and financial supports for new mothers can be

structured to allow them to spend a longer period of time at home with infants, without




14
  Leave laws are predicted to decrease work in the first months but increase it thereafter. We characterize them
as an employment‐promoting policy, focusing on the 9 month effects, since we think that medium to long term
effects are most relevant in terms of policies to encourage work.
                                                                                                           24


reducing employment in the medium‐term. The relatively small effect of the “choice package”

occurs partly because some components (lengthy work exemptions and generous transfer

payments) reduce employment incentives while others (high child care subsidies and leave

laws) either promote work or have different effects in the short‐term and medium‐term.

        Public policy nevertheless has potentially powerful effects. A set of policies designed to

maximize maternal employment has large effects, as can be seen by taking the difference

between rows (12) and (11). Moving from the least to the most work‐promoting policies is

predicted to reduce work probabilities before 12 weeks by 2.1 percentage points but increase

rates at ≤9 months by 7.8 points. The reason that the “work maximization” package reduces

employment before 12 weeks is that universal leave laws discourage employment during the

first three months but increase it subsequently.

        Table 3 provided estimates for all U.S. mothers. Since three of the four focal policies

target the disadvantaged, we anticipate stronger effects for such women. Table 4 confirms that

this occurs. The simulations suggest that married/cohabiting mothers (results shown in the first

two columns) are moderately affected by state leave laws and minimally influenced by child

care subsidy policies.15 By contrast, all four policies have strong predicted effects on single

mothers (see columns 3 and 4). We focus our remarks on the packages of policies, summarized

in the last four rows of the table, since these show most explicitly the effects and tradeoffs

implied by different types of policies.




15
  When a group represents the control group for a specified policy (e.g. married/cohabiting mothers when
considering infant work exemptions or TANF‐FS spending), the policy effect is set to zero by assumption.
                                                                                                  25


       The effects of a choice promotion package differ substantially across groups. Such a

package is associated with increased work participation by ≤9 months for married mothers and

in less educated families, with those in the latter group appearing to be particularly constrained

by the high costs of child care. Single mothers are the only group where greater choice is

associated with a lower work probability by ≤9 months. This reflects the relatively strong

employment‐reducing effect of welfare work exemptions.

       Increased choice generally has a more negative predicted influence on work

participation before 12 weeks (than at ≤9 months), suggesting that many mothers are

constrained in their ability to stay home with infants and would take advantage of policies that

make it easier for them to do so. The least educated families again represent an exception; here

the results suggest an unfulfilled demand for early work participation that is constrained by a

lack of affordable child care.

       The package of work promoting policies is predicted to have a sizable medium‐term

effect on single mothers, raising their employment at ≤9 months by 12.6 points (relative to the

baseline of 61 percent). The difference between this and the set of policies that encourage

early work the least is an extremely large 22.3 percentage points. By comparison, the

corresponding change for married/cohabiting mothers, moving from the least to most work

promoting policies, is 4.2 percentage points.

       The estimated effects for women with less than a high school education are, if anything,

even bigger than for single mothers. The medium‐term effects (by 9 months) are of similar

magnitude but larger in relative terms because of their lower (46.5 percent) baseline

employment rate, and the short‐term (<12 weeks) predicted effects are also greater. As already
                                                                                                26


mentioned, the employment of this group is particularly sensitive to CCDF spending levels,

suggesting the importance of child care costs as a constraint on work.

       Conversely, the policies have much smaller effects on more highly educated mothers, as

expected, since they constitute the control group for CCDF funding and are relatively frequently

married or cohabiting (and thus in the control group for TANF‐FS benefits and welfare work

exemptions). However, the effects of state leave laws appear to increase with maternal

education, consistent with evidence recently presented by Han, Ruhm and Waldfogel (2009).

Notice also that a long‐term “work maximization” package of policies is predicted to reduce

early employment (<12 weeks) among highly educated and married/cohabiting mothers, while

increasing that of their less advantaged counterparts.


DISCUSSION

       The types of public policies currently enacted in the United States have potentially

powerful effects on the employment of new mothers, particularly the disadvantaged. For

instance, implementing a set of policies designed to maximize work participation 9 months

after the birth is predicted to increase the employment of single or less educated mothers by

30 to 50 percent, compared to corresponding policies providing weak work incentives.

       Evidence that disadvantaged mothers are highly sensitive to the net returns of working

does not, however, identify the optimal mix of policies, because there may be a tradeoff

between policies that maximize the choices available versus those that increase the

employment of mothers with young children. On the one hand, evidence on the possible

adverse consequences of very early employment for child health and development (e.g.,

Smolensky and Gootman 2003; Ruhm, 2004; Waldfogel 2006) suggests that policy should seek
                                                                                                             27


to discourage early work. On the other hand, proponents of welfare reform view early work to

be desirable in its own right and as a route out of poverty, hinting at the opposite conclusion.

The timing of employment effects also matters. For instance, we may be less concerned about

policies that deter work during the infancy period if they promote it later in the child’s life.

        However, the tradeoff between choice and employment is not absolute. As mentioned,

parental leave policies relax constraints immediately after the birth but are also associated with

significantly higher work participation rates by nine months. Child care subsidies targeted to the

most disadvantaged mothers also increase choice (particularly if they are offered alongside paid

leave policies) and have strongly positive effects on employment, suggesting that the costs of

high quality infant care are a real barrier to work among those with lower incomes.16

        The results should be interpreted in light of several caveats. First, the data are for a

single cohort of births and so cannot exploit policy variation occurring over time. One

implication is that we cannot investigate federal policies (such as the FMLA) enacted

simultaneously throughout the country. Second, our identification strategy involves a series of

difference‐in‐difference estimates where policies are anticipated to affect some groups but not

others. Alternative but corresponding policies targeting our current control groups might have

different consequences. For instance, child care subsidies for middle‐ or high‐income mothers

may have smaller effects than CCDF funding, which assists low‐income mothers. Similarly,

income support policies to married families (such as those in many European countries) may




16
  Rosenbaum and Ruhm (2007) provide evidence that child care expenditures, as a share of income, are larger for
low‐income than high‐income families, and that the disparity would increase dramatically if not for the lower
employment rates and cheaper sources of child care used by the former.
                                                                                                     28


have weaker disemployment effects than TANF‐FS benefits targeting single women. Finally,

although we analyze a wider constellation of work‐family policies than previous research, we

neither include all possibly relevant policies nor consider interactions between government and

employer policies. In particular, our discussion has assumed a policy environment where

disadvantaged mothers face a simple trade‐off between poverty and work. Cash assistance

policies, such as a system of child allowances, suggest a third alternative – one currently

available to more advantaged mothers – in which staying home to care for an infant is an

affordable option.

       Notwithstanding these qualifications, our results are new and noteworthy. Packages of

policies designed to promote or discourage maternal employment are likely to have strong

effects. Policies maximizing the choices available to women have smaller but frequently positive

predicted employment impacts, because some of them (parental leave entitlements and child

care subsidies) promote work in the medium‐term. The responsiveness of less educated

women to child care subsidies was of particular interest because it was unanticipated when we

began our investigation. Future research is needed to verify this result and identify mechanisms

for it. More generally, our findings highlight the need for further investigation into the effects

of work‐family policies, using techniques and approaches that address the limitations in this

work and include an even wider array of policies.

* p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001. Stars relate to a t‐test of difference in the means. Where there are three categories (i.e. for CCDF and TANF+FS
levels), the test is relative to the mean of the middle category. All numbers are for 2001, with the exception of the abortion rate (2000) and the
child care worker’s median wage (2002). Dollar values are in constant 2001 prices. Abortion rate is per 1000 women age 15‐44. Infant mortality
rate is per 1000 live births. Number of licensed child care centers/family day care providers is per 1000 children under 6. Median income is for a
family of four.
