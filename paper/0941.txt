 Introduction and Sunimar

       For   many years a system of leading, coincident, and lagging economic

indicators, first developed in the 1930s by the National Bureau of Economic

Researth (NBER), has been widely used in the United States to appraise

the state of the business cycle. Since 1961 the current monthly figures

for these indicators have been published by the U.S. Department of

Commerce in Business Conditions Digest. Similar systems have been

developed by government or private agencies in Canada, Japan, the

United Kingdom, and more recently in many other countries. A few years

ago the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) set

up a working party to develop this type of analysis and most of the member

countries participated. The Center for International Business Cycle

Research at Rutgers University has given guidance in this field to some

fifteen countries during the past three years, In Europe, Asia, the

Middle East, Africa and South America.


       Our purpose in this paper is to explain briefly the theory arid

rationale underlying this approach to economic forecasting, describe

the more important statistical procedures used, and review the evidence

on how the indicators have performed in practice. The tests of performance

concentrate on data notused in the selection of the indicators, in the

United States and nine other countries. We conclude with some suggestions

for future research and development, including the application of the

approach to the analysis of inflation.


The Indicator System: Rationale and US Experience

        The leading, coincident, and lagging indicators cevor a wide v;n-ety

 of   economic processes that have been found to be iniport.int   in business

 cycles. The leading indicators are for the most pirt invasurts of
                                       —2—



anticipations or new commitments. They have a "look—ahead" quality and

• are highly sensitive to changes in the economic climate as perceived in

 the marketplace. The coincident indicators are comprehensive measures

of economic performance, pertaining to output, employment, income, and

 trade. They are the measures to which everyone looks to determine whether

a nation is prosperous or depressed. The lagging indicators are more

 sluggish in their reactions to the economic climate, but they serve two

 useful functions. First, since they are usually very smooth, they help

 to confirm changes in trend that are first reflected in the more erratic

 leading and coincident indicators. Second, their very sluggishness can

 be an asset in cyclical analysis, because when they do begin to move, or

 when they move rapidly, they may show that excesses or imbalances in the

 economy are developing or subsiding. Hence the lagging indicators

 frequently provide the earliest warnings of all, as when rapid increases

 in costs of production outstrip price increases and threaten profit

 margins, thus inhibiting new commitments to invest, which are among the

 leading indicators.

      The procedure in selecting and classifying indicators, therefore,

 is one in which economic theory and empirical observation closely interact.

 The indicator that has a near—perfect record of performince during a

 business cycle, but whose behavior cannot be explained, will not comm3nd or

 warrant much attention, since faith depends on understanding.   On the

 other hand, the indicator that is suggested by theoretical considerations

 but has not been tested or does not perform as theory predicts will not

 command much attention either, since faith depends on performance.     With

 these precepts in mind let us look at the classification of U.S. indicators
                                        —3—



that we have been using for some years in our work in developing an

international system of business cycle indicators (Table 1).

      The first column on the left lists six broad types of economic

process, of the kind that figure in most theories of the business cycle.

Most of the variables that are employed in econometric models can be

found under one or another of these categories. There are, however, some

important exceptions. Foreign trade is not shown explicitly, although it

is implicit in the second group (production, income, consumption and trade).

Taxes and government expenditures do not appear explicitly either, although

they are conspicuous in most models. Here the reason is not that

government has no impact on the business cycle, but rather that most

measures of its activity have not performed very consistently as indicators.

The same comment could be made about agricultural production.

      The indicators in the body of the table were selected from the six

types of economic process, again with a view both to their contribution to

theory and empirical performance. Performance has been judged primarily

with respect to the consistency with which the measure has conformed to

business cycles and led, coincided or lagged behind the cycles' turning

points. An indicator can have too many cycles or too few; one—to--one

correspondence is preferable. An indicator can lcid on some occasions

and lag at other times; uniformity in timing is preferable. Other

criteria play a role too. Comprehensive coverage of the economy        is
preferable to narrow coverage. Prompt availabi.llty of curr'nt fi;ures
is   important and coupled with that, monthly figures   ire 1)1ef(rr1(I 10

Note:The list and classification Is substantiallythe same as that prepared in 1966 and publishedin Geoffrey H. Moore and Julius Shiskin,
Indicators of Business Expansions and Contractions (New York: National Bureau of Economic Research. 1967). The thief modification is
that those series marked with 'are converted to constant prices. The timing classification for each series is the same as shown in Busi-
ness Conditions Digest for all turns (see Table 1, column 1, in any recent issue), except as follows: Unemployment is unclassified (U)
at all turns in BCD because it leads at peaks and lags at troughs, but here it is classified roughly coincident, as in the 1966 list. Four
series that here are in constant prices are shown in BCD only in current prices: change in consumer installmentdebt, investment ex•
pendtures for plant and equipment, commercial and industrial loans outstanding, and change in output per man-hour, manufacturing.
inverted, which is the constant price equivalent of laborcost per unit of output. The constantprice series are assigned the same classi-
fication as the current price series.

     Within each of the economic process groups, reading across the table,

are indicators that lead as well as those that coincide or lag. That is

one reason for thinking of them as processes. The activities represented

normally follow a sequence. The average workweek, for example, is one

of the first variables pertaining to employment that manufacturing

enterprises change, either by increasing or reducing the amount of overtime

work or by changing the number of persons working short hours or fewer

days per week. Changes in the number employed usually occur a few months

later, because such changes are less easily reversed and are more expensive

to accomplish.

     Every entry in Table 1 has been supported by detailed studies showing

that the indicators not only behave in the manner specified by the

classification but also that there are cogent economic reasons for this

behavior. These studies have considered not only the sequences across

columns but also the more or less simultaneous relationships among the

indicators within each column: how stock prices are related to profits,

materials prices to inventory investment, production to employment, sales

to income, etc. Finally, these studies have developed the reasons for

and evidence underlying a relationship not explicitly shown in the

table——a relationship that helps to explain why one business cycle tends

to generate the next one.


     This   relationship has to do with the influence of the li',giig
indicators upon the subsequent movements of the idin, indlc.itors. An
increase in the level of inventories, especially in rel;ition to si1es,
if it proceeds far enough is likely to cause buyer; to cut btck their
                                             —6—




orders.     Here a lagging indicator, inventories, has an inverse effect UI)Ofl

a leading indicator, new oders. Similarly, a rapid increase in expenditures

for new plant and equipment may, as output and capital utilization rates

build up, result in a cutback in contracts for new plant construction.

Likewise, an increase in interest rates on business loans may at some

stage trigger decisions to reduce orders for machinery and equipment and

to reduce the rate at which inventories of materials are accumulated.

In short, there are feedback relationships running from the lagging

indicators to the subsequent, opposite turns in the leading indicators.

These relationships, too, have been documented empirically, as we shall

see.


       The hardest test for a theory or system of indicators to meet, as

with any other economic theory or system, is one that requires it to

perform on data that were not available      when it was formulated. The
U.S.   indicators have experienced many such tests. One that covers a

twenty—five year span, based on data not available when a set of

indicators was selected and classified in 1950, is contained in Table 2.

       The empirical evidence used to select and classify indicators in

the 1950 study covered periods of varying length but ending in 1938,

i.e., before World War II. Twenty—one indicators were selected as ilie

end—product of a study covering some 800 series. Eight of the twenty—one

were classified as leading, eight coincident, and five lagging. Fifteen

of the twenty—one are still shown currently in BsinessConditLonsJ)igtt

and    close   equivalents of the other six are also In that    publication.

1948 to 1975. The indexes have been adjusted for long—run trend, using

a method developed in the 1970's. The turning points in the trend—adjusted

series are compared in Table 2 with the peaks and troughs in a chronology

of growth cycles, a concept of the business cycle that has come into use

in many countries only in recent years, which we shall discuss more fully

below.

     The test in Table 2, therefore, not only confronts the twenty—one

indicators with data not available when they were chosen, but also with

methods of analysis not then available either. The results, recorded in

the left—hand section of the table, show that the expected sequence among

the three groups of indicators occurred at almost every turn throughout

the period. The lagging indicators not only lag as expected but also

lead the opposite turns in the leaders, which is also as expected.

     Even though the indicators selected in 1950 turned in a good record

during the next twenty—five years, research on indicators and business

cycles did not stand still. We have already referred to some of the changes

in methodology. In addition, the indicators themselves have improved.

More of them are available in deflated form, more are published in

seasonally adjusted form, some are available more promptly, there is better

coverage of inventories and of price/cost relationships, and so on.

In 1975 the Department of Commerce established a new list of indicators,

and its record during the preceding twenty—five years is shown on the

right—hand side of Table 2. The results are similar, on the whole, to

those achieved by the 1950 list, partly because the content overlaps to

a considerable extent. The user of indicators would, however, not hesitate

 a moment in opEing for the 1975 list in view oi        vd cuverae of

 significant variables.

    From this brief review of U.S. experience we would contend that the

conceptual   framework underlying the indicator approach to business cycle

forecasting has stood up well under repeated tests on subsequent data.

Much room for error and uncertainty remains, as witness the current

uncertainty about the prospects for recovery from the current U.S.

recession. But we know much more about the merits and limitations

of the system than we did thirty years ago.

     Another kind of test of the system, which has both scientific value

and practical advantages, is to examine comparable data from other

countries and apply similar techniques of analysis to them. If indicators

that have proved to lead or lag consistently in U.S. experience could be

shown to have a similar temporal relationship in other countries, the

case for indicators——both in theory and in application to forecasting

efforts——would be strengthened. This was the task which we set ourselves

in 1973 when we launched the work on international economic indicators

at the National Bureau of Economic Research and are continuing

today at the Rutgers Center for International Business Cycle Research.


Internationalizing the Indicator System

     The 1973 study began by developing growth cycle chronologies for the

major market—oriented economies. Most of the work on indicators for the

United States has been done in terms of the business cycle——or classical

cycle——concept. This concept involves an absolute rise and fall in

aggregate economic activity. In the 1950's and 1960's, however, many

countries did not experience actual declines in activity but did expcricnce

varying rates of growth. To examine these growth cyc1, thcrcfor',

methods of measuring and eliminating long—run trends wi're   dcvelopd.
                                      —11—



From the trend—adjusted data chronologies of growth cycles were derived

in the same manner that had been used, in the United States, to derive

the business cycle chronology. The growth cycle, then, is simply a

trend—adjusted business cycle. The expansion phase is a period when the

short—run growth rate of aggregate economic activity is greater than the

long—run rate, whereas in the contraction phase the short—run growth rate

is less than the long—run rate.


     Problems arise, of course, in deciding precisely what the long—run

growth rate of an economy is, especially on a current basis. Historically

there are fewer difficulties, and the growth cycle chronologies have

proved to be quite robust against variations in techniques of trend—

adjustment, etc. This is especially true of the number and identity

of the cycles, less true of the precise turning dates. For analyzing

sequences among indicators, however, variations in the reference turning

points with which the indicator turns are compared are not crucial.


     Table 3 presents the growth cycle chronologies that have been

developed at the Rutgers Center for thirteen market—oriented economics.

They are based on substantially the same measures of the physical volume

of economic activity in each country, covering output, employment,

unemployment, real income and real volume of trade. The growth cycle

peak and trough dates represent the concensus among the turning points

of these indicators after adjustment for long—run trend.

     It is interesting to note that a very old tendency for the United

States to exhibit more cycles than other market—oriented economies is

visible in the growth cycle chronologies for the last thirLy years as

well. While there was a period of time——roughly the twenty years 1955—1975

when the growth cycles of the countries included in the table were largely

synchronous, there has in recent years been more disparity again in the

timing of growth cycle peaks and troughs. But generally the behavior of

the indicators which enabled us to produce these chronologies is convincing

evidence that market—oriented economies, whatever their differences, still

have much in common and are afflicted with a roughly comparable tendency

to cyclical instability.

     This conclusion is strengthened considerably by the results of our

efforts to develop leading and lagging indicators of growth cycle turns in

other economies by analyzing the behavior of rough equivalents of the U.S.

leaders and laggers. This constitutes a test of the indicator system of

a fairly high order. The list and the classification were established on

the basis of the behavior of indicators in the United States prior to

1966. The test is based on the behavior of comparable indicators in other

countries during the period 1950 to 1980. Note especially that the

indicators are classified into the three groups on the basis of their

U.S. behavior, not their behavior in the respective country.

     A convenient way to obtain a summary view of the behavior of the

indicators is provided by Table 4. This shows the median lead or lag

for composite indexes derived from the leading indicators, the roughly

coincident indicators, and the lagging indicators for each of the ten

major market—oriented economies we have studied. The medians have, of

course, the well—known virtue of not being unduly influenced by extreme

values.   What the table shows, therefore, is how   the composite Indexes
in each country behave at peaks, at troughs, and at all growth cycle
                                            —15—



turning points. The table shows the timing of the lagging indicators in

both positive and inverted form. As noted earlier, one of the most useful

properties of lagging indicators is that if they are considered in inverted

form the turns tend to lead the subsequent growth cycle turn by a longer

period of time than do the leading indicators. Thus the trough in the

lagging indicators precedes the peak in the leading indicators, and the

peak in the laggers precedes the trough In the leaders. This tendency

is throughly grounded in business cycle theory, as noted in our discussion

of the U.S. indicators.

      Concerning the composite indexes whose behavior is summarized in

Table 4, there are two sorts of question we might ask. The simplest is

whether the composite index for each group of indicators in each country

exhibits the timing vis—a—vis growth cycles that we would expect. That

is,do the leaders lead, do the roughly coincident indicators turn within

a few months of the growth cycle turns, and do the laggers lag? The

table shows that among all ten countries there are but six exceptions

to these requirements: in France the composite leading index exhibits

coincident (0) timing at peaks, troughs, and all turns; in Sweden and

the Netherlands the leading index is coincident at troughs; and in

Belgium the coincident index shows a six—month lead at peaks. Apart

from these six exceptions all the other entries conform to the timing

expectations we derived from the behavior of series equivalent to these

in the United States.




      A second question we can ask is whether, regardless of the timing

vis—a—vis     growth cycles, the   sequence among the groups of Indicators is

at   least   what is expected. Even, for example, were all the compo;iLus

for a given country to exhibit a lead, we would find it useful to know

that the leaders turn first, followed (i.e., with a shorter lead) by

the roughly coincident indicators and (with the shortest lead) by the

lagging indicators. Examining the evidence in this way we find only

five exceptions, and four of the five involve coincidence in timing

rather than a reversal. The exceptions are in France, Sweden, the

Netherlands and Belgium.


      In short, there are clearly very few cases of perverse behavior.

If identical timing for two groups of indicators were not considered

"perverse"   Sweden would be    the only case of perverse   sequential behavior,
where the    leading index is coincident at troughs and the coincident

index leads   by   one month. We do not claim too much, therefore, when

we suggest that our experiment in duplicating equivalents of U.S.

indicators    in   other market—oriented economies has a favorable outcome.


      This   is   not, of course, to say that the indicator   system cannot
or   should not be improved in all countries. The U.S. list for classical

cycle analysis has already been revised a number of times over the years.
                                            —17—




In searching, therefore, for ways to improve the performance of indicator

systems one must consider not just composite indexes but how individual

indicators behave in various countries at growth cycle peaks and troughs.

In our ongoing work we have, of course, carefully examined this behavior

turn by turn. Here it will be sufficient to refer briefly to the median

leads and lags of all the indicators for which we have found rough

equivalents to the U.S. series in the other nine countries.

     On this indicator—by—indicator basis there are very few cases

where the median timing at growth cycle turns in other countries fails to

conform   to   the timing one would expect on the basis of timing at U.S.

growth cycle turns. Mong the roughly coincident indicators there are

three countries in which employment fails to turn within three months of the

growth cycle turns. Two countries exhibit lags longer than three months

(France and Italy) and one (West Germany) exhibits a lead longer than

three months. These findings are interesting because of a widespread

belief that employment is either a lagging indicator or is becoming one.

Even in the United States at recent classical cycle turns there has been

a slight tendency for employment to lag, apparently because employers are

increasingly inclined to make marginal employment adjustments before

making major adjustments. In most other countries the      median liming for
employment is a lag of a month or two but no more.

     The other case where three countries exhibit roughly coincident

turns more than three months from the growth cycle turns occurs n

connection with retail sales, where France, Bc1ium, an( Tpn 1Ii1)it

                                            -1.8—




purchases   maybe a factor, since consumer credit change has long been a

leading indicator. If its use is spreading (as it is), it may       be   producing

leads in retail purchases by making consumers less dependent upon income

in making decisions about purchasing.

      Finally we may note that in one country (Belgium) the index of

industrial production shows a long lead in its median timing. This is

noteworthy because of the widespread use of that index as the primary

measure of aggregate economic activity. We have long argued that no

single measure, no matter how aggregative or pervasive, ought to be

relied on in dating business cycles. It is, of course, precisely those

cases in which the major measures of aggregate economic activity fail

to turn in symnchronous fashion that we have the greatest difficulty

in placing business cycle turning points. In Belgium, sole reliance on

industrial production would result in earlier turning points than most

of the other evidence suggests.


      Among the leading indicators in the overwhelming majority of cascs

the indicators in other countries conform in timing to the U.S. experience.

Oneof the exceptions, the ratio of price to unit labor cost——a measure

that reflects profit margins——falls to lead in Canada and the Netherlands.

Industrial materials prices lag in their median timing at growth cycle

turns in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands, and are coincident

in Canada and France. New orders for durable goods unaccountably lag

in Canada, and contracts for plant and equipment lag      In West Ccrmamy.

In all   other cases, the median   timing   in other countries conforms to

the   leading classification these indicators merit In the U.S.
                                       —19—




     The lagging indicators also generally conform well to the U.S.—based

classification. There is but one exception. Business loans outstanding

lead instead of lag in their median timing at German growth cyc].e turns.


     Overall, therefore, the median timing of the indicators and the

composite indexes conforms to our expectations. It is clear that there

is room for Improvement, and the same factors that have led to periodic

revision of the short list of U.S. indicators suggest that the next order

of business in our international work must be to secure such an

improvement. But the results we have described demonstrate that indicator

systems established on a comparable basis in many countries are likely to

have similar properties.


Recent Developments in Practical Application

     One possibility for improving the ability to forecast growth cycles

with leading indicators which we have already explored has involved the

use of so—called "qualitative" indicators. Survey results dealing,

for example, with what entrepreneurs think about their sales possibilities

are now regularly collected both in the United States and in many other

countries. We have already explored some of the possibilities for

augmenting the quantitative indicators with the results of these surveys.

The survey results are available in what is called "net balance" form.

In case of sales, for example, the percent of respondents who think profits

are Increasing less the percent who think they are decreasing gives the

"net balance" of respondents with   respect   to sales. Using survey net

balances presents difficulties. flow the questions arc worded, for example,

determines precisely what the net balances mean    and dictates   whether
                                         —20—




cumulating   the net balances or taking their first differences may be

necessary in some cases before they can be related to the quantitative

indicator to which they pertain.

     Surveys have the advantage of being available often before the

equivalent quantitative measure. While our preliminary investigations

have suggested that the turning points in survey net balances do not

customarily lead turning pointsintheir quantitative equivalents their

greater promptness opens some possibilities for increasing our ability

to forecast by using surveys along with or as proxies for these

quantitative measures.

     Another area which we have explored has been an outgrowth of the

trend—adjustment necessary for growth cycle analysis. We customarily

construct composite indexes of leading, and roughly coincident indicators

for the major countries we have been monitoring. An early decision

involved the question whether to trend adjust the components and then

construct the composite index or whether to utilize the components in

unadjusted form and then trend adjust the composite index. We decided

on the latter because it is useful to have the composite indexes in both

adjusted and unadjusted form. A major use to which we put the indexes

in unadjusted form is to calculate their short—run growth rates on a

continuing current basis. In this way one can observe growth cycles

and yet avoid the uncertainty about what the long-run trend is currently.

Charts   1 and 2, taken from a bi—monthly report prepared by the Rutgers
Center and published by the Conference Board, illustrate the USC of
these growth rates. Their value in comparing the recent changes in each
country against growth rates over a long period as well as in comparing

recent developments in one country against those in other countries

will be readily apparent.

     It might be noted that we find combining composite indexes for

several countries a useful way to monitor growth cycle developments as

well. The charts just presented illustrate several multi—country

composite leading indexes.      Customarily we consider the European

countries alone, the European countries plus Canada and Japan, and

all seven countries together. This has proven particularly useful in

recent years when the tendency of the major countries to exhibit fairly

synchronous cyclical behavior (in the 1950s and 1960s) has been replaced

by considerable divergence. In these composites each country's index is

weighted by its GNP in 1970, measured in dollars. For some purposes,

such as forecasting exports, the use of export weights would be desirable.

Chart 3 shows how the six—country leading Index, weighted by U.S. exports

to those countries, compares with total U.S. exports in constant dollars.

In Chart 4 the year—to—year changes in U.S. exports are shown in relation

to the end—of—preceding—year rate of change In the six—country leading

index. The r2 is . 84   ,   which indicates that the growth rate in the
leading index at the end of the year gives a useful clue to the forthcoming

growth of exports. This technique can readily be extended to other

countries and used to monitor both imports and exports.

     We have experimented as well with leading and coincident indicators

that are focused on a particular economic process, such as employment.

Our leading employment index for the United States includes five leading

indicators   that reflect marginal employment adj ustmc'nts (the average
workweek, overtime hours, part—time employment, layoffs, and initial

unemployment insurance claims. The coincident employment index includes

five series on employment and unemployment. Both indexes use all three

of the major sources of information on employment: the household survey,

the establishment survey, and the unemployment insurance system. This

adds to their reliability and smooths away some of the erratic movements.


     Chart 5 shows these two indexes during the current recession

(solid line), starting six months before the business cycle peak of

July 1981. This is compared with the average patterns durIng three

preceding mild recessions and four preceding sharp recessions.             The

leading tendency of the leading employment index is clearly evident in

these recession—recovery patterns, as we call them. The course that the

indexes have taken during previous recessions and the ensuing recoveries

can readily be used in evaluating a recession as it unfolds and in

judging the prospects for recovery. The method can, of course, also be

applied to indicators for other countries, using the growth cycle

chronologies described earlier.

     The final application of indicator aiialysis that we shall discuss is

a sequential signal system for identifying the beginning and ending dates

of recessions. The system has been developed at the Rutgers Center

using growth rates in the U.S. leading and coincident indexes. The current

rates are compared with certain target rates to determine when they

reach certain critical levels defined in advance. This results in a

sequence of three signals: preliminary, intermediate, and final. The

preliminary signal of recession gives an       early   warning   but has   sometimes

marked only a slowdown in the economy rather than a recc-;sion. When the
prelii nary   is   followed by the intermediate signal the xces;ion i; hut h

closer at hand and more likely to occur. The third and final signal

signifies with almost complete certainty that a recession has begun. A

similar set of signals is defined for the upturns at the end of recessions.


       The method invokes several principles to gain reliability. One is to

use two indexes jointly rather than a single index. Another is to allow

for the possibility of a false signal by using the sequential design. If

the system were to be used to trigger certain policy actions such as the

release of government funds for public works or public employment, the

amount as well as the reversibility of the action can be governed

according to whether the signal is preliminary, intermediate or final.

Equally important are the signals of recovery, which allow anti—recession

policies to be terminated by degrees, depending on how definite the

signals are.

       The historical record of the third signals of business cycle peaks

                                                               rate in Chart 6
(P3) and troughs (T3) is compared with the unemployment

and with the inflation rate in Chart 7. Since neither unemployment nor

inflation was taken into account in defining the stgnals, this provides

a strong test. The results are quite impressive, since when the signals

of   recession are on (shaded areas) unemployment is generally rising and
 inflation declining.

 indicator analysis might take in the future.

ago.   Some were not seasonally adjusted, some were not deflated, some

were not available as continuous series, some required processing to

enhance their properties as leading indicators. In many countries the

coverage of indicators available on a monthly or even quarterly basis

is very limited. Timeliness often does not get a high priority.

Business survey data may not be in most appropriate form or may not

cover the most appropriate questions. In the United States, even though

indicator analysis has been pursued for more than forty years, we continue

to find both needs and opportunities for new and better data.


       Second, the development of leading, coincident and lagging

indicators of inflation is a wide open field. We need to quicken our

awareness of new inflationary trends, ordisinflationary trends. What

are the most reliable indicators for this purpose, and how reliable are

they? Can available measures be improved? The Rutgers Center is

carrying on some research in this field in connection with the new

bi—monthly report, Inflation Watch, but we have barely scratched the

surface.


       Third, an organized effort to develop business cycle indicators in

the countries in the Pacific area is warranted. In Europe, the OECD

and the EEC have been engaged in such an enterprise for several years.

This has stimulated many member countries to undertake research and

development programs, to exchange results and discuss techniques. In

the Pacific area, on the other hand, Japan has pursued this subject for

many years, and more recently Australia, New Zealand, South Korea,

Taiwan and Malaysia have engaged in such studies. But an orgnntzcd
