Are Health Care Services Shoppable? Evidence from the Consumption of Lower-Limb MRI

                                           ABSTRACT

We study how privately insured individuals choose lower-limb MRI scan providers. Despite
significant out-of-pocket costs and little variation in quality, patients often received care in high-
priced locations when lower priced options were available. The choice of provider is such that, on
average, patients bypassed 6 lower-priced providers between their homes and treatment locations.
We show that referring physicians heavily influence where patients receive care. The influence of
referring physicians is dramatically greater than the influence of patient cost-sharing or patients’
home zip code fixed effects. Patients with vertically integrated referring physicians are also more
likely to receive costlier hospital-based scans.

1    Introduction
From 2000 to 2016, U.S. private health insurance premiums for family coverage increased 182 percent in
real terms from $6,438 to $18,142 (Kaiser Family Foundation 2017). In an eﬀort to slow premium growth,
insurers have steadily increased beneficiaries’ cost sharing and deductibles (Schoen et al. 2011; Kaiser Family
Foundation 2015). Government policy encouraged these changes by establishing tax free health savings
accounts (Bumiller 2016). The motivation underlying more demand side cost sharing is that increased cost
exposure would both reduce moral hazard and encourage patients to become more active consumers of health
care services – so-called shoppers (Baicker, Dow, and Wolfson 2006). As a result, at present in the United
States (US), 46 percent of workers now have a deductible of $1,000 or more, one in four are enrolled in a
plan with a deductible of at least $3,000, and average out-of-pocket costs in 2016 were $714 (Kaiser Family
Foundation 2017; JP Morgan Chase & Co. 2017). However, to date, the simple prediction from price theory –
that increasing cost sharing and giving access to price transparency tools would induce patients to shop for
care – has not been well supported by the empirical evidence on consumer behavior (Brot-Goldberg et al.
2017; Desai et al. 2017; Mehrotra et al. 2017). This paper studies whether and why the reality of shopping
for health care services lags behind what price theory predicts.
    Using data from a large commercial insurer, we study how individuals age 19 to 64 with private health
insurance, high out-of-pocket cost exposure, and access to a price transparency tool consume lower-limb MRI
scans. We focus, in particular, on the frequency that patients forgo receiving care at lower priced locations in
lieu of receiving care at more expensive providers. Lower-limb MRI scans are among the least diﬀerentiated
health care services, are relatively expensive, and can generally be scheduled in advance of care. They should,
therefore, be one of the most easily shoppable health care services delivered to patients in the US. Our results
show that patients do not shop for care eﬀectively in this very simple clinical setting. We then take the
next step of explaining why consumers behave as they do. We explore and describe the frictions that are
preventing patients from accessing lower priced care and analyze the factors that are influencing patients’
choices over where to receive treatment. We posit that given our evidence that patients struggle to shop
eﬀectively for lower-limb MRI scans, our evidence is suggestive that patients will also struggle to shop for
more complex health care services.
  In other contexts, economists generally believe that utility-maximizing consumers are capable of eﬀectively
shopping for simple goods and services (Samuelson 1948). Even for more complex goods like automobiles,
there is evidence that consumers can capably observe and consider tradeoﬀs between complex characteristics,
like fuel eﬃciency, horsepower, and cabin luxury (Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes 1995). However, a literature
has developed which questions the extent to which patients can eﬀectively shop for health care services
(see Arrow 1963; Volpp 2016; Brot-Goldberg et al. 2017). There are three factors that are often cited
as impediments to individuals operating as eﬀective health care consumers. The first is the presence of
third-party insurance, which insulates individuals from the true prices of the services they consume. The
second is that there remains very little accurate pricing information available for consumers to use to compare
prices across providers (Mahomed et al. 2018). And lastly, quality in health care can be challenging to
measure, especially for non-experts. As result, patients rely heavily on recommendations of the referring
physician.
    Within our data, the prices of lower-limb MRI providers vary extensively within region. For example,
the MRI provider in the 80th percentile in the typical hospital referral region (HRR) is 1.73 times more
expensive than the MRI provider in the 20th percentile. Much of this variation is a function of the type of



                                                       2
facility where patients receive their imaging study: the average hospital-based lower-limb MRI scan in our
data had a price of $1,474.35, while non-hospital-based lower-limb MRIs were, on average, priced at $642.82.
Our analysis suggests that the clinical quality of MRI scans does not vary substantially across providers. A
low quality scan would need to be repeated. However, of the 50,484 MRIs in our data, only 0.006 percent of
scans (3 scans in total) were repeated within a 90-day window. We will return to the issue of the quality of
reading the scans later in the paper.
   Despite the variation in MRI scan prices across providers, patients often receive care in high-priced
locations when lower priced options are available. Figure 1 is an example typical of the patterns we observe
in our data. It shows the prices of MRI providers in a large urban HRR. Each column is a provider that
delivered at least one lower-limb MRI in 2013. The dots (right vertical axis) show the number of cases treated
at each provider. In this HRR, the provider in the 80th percentile of prices in the area is 2.2 times more
expensive than the provider in the 20th percentile and the most expensive provider is 7.5 times as expensive
as the lowest-cost provider. Notably, in this HRR, the highest priced provider has the highest volume of MRI
scans. This result is present in HRRs across the county. When we analyze the entirety of our sample, ignoring
capacity constraints and general equilibrium (GE) eﬀects, we estimate that if patients went to the lowest
priced provider within a 60-minute car drive from their homes, total MRI spending would be reduced by 55.12
percent, with insurer contributions decreasing by 61.22 percent ($333.39), and patient out-of-pocket costs
decreasing by 44.23 percent ($135.13). We refer to this counterfactual as the ‘maximum potential savings.’
   When we explore the choices consumers make, we do not find that the usual features assumed to drive
demand, such as the distance to potential providers, explain a significant amount of the variation in the
prices of the MRI scans that patients receive. Indeed, a significant portion of the maximum potential savings
is available without patients having to travel farther for care. For example, total spending on lower-limb MRI
scans would be reduced by 35.81 percent if patients accessed the lowest priced provider available within the
same drive time as they already were travelling (26-minutes on average). This result occurs because patients,
on average, bypassed 6 lower-priced providers between their home and the location where they received their
scan.
   Previous research has posited that greater cost-sharing may be necessary to nudge consumers to shop
more eﬀectively for care (Lieber 2017). We do find that patients with higher out-of-pocket costs receive
lower priced MRI scans. This is consistent with evidence that, when faced with substantial price exposure,
a modest number of patients (fewer than 10 percent) will change their provider choice (Robinson, Whaley,
and Brown 2016; Frank et al. 2015). However, despite significant cost-sharing, patients’ out-of-pocket cost
exposure only explains 2.4 percent of variance (4.2 percent of total explained variance) in the price of the
locations where patients receive care.
   Ultimately, we find that the factor that appears to limit patients’ ability to price shop is a factor
underdiscussed in the price transparency literature. In our analysis of variation in patients’ MRI prices,
we find that referring physicians heavily influence where patients receive care. Looking across the nation,
referring physician fixed eﬀects explain 51 percent of the variance (92.1 percent of explained variance) in the
price of MRI scans that patients receive. Indeed, referrer fixed eﬀects explain a significantly larger share of
the variance in the price of patients’ MRIs than patient zip code (ZCTA) fixed eﬀects.
   Further, we oﬀer some of the first evidence on the behavior of referring physicians. We find that orthopedic
surgeons tend to send their patients to a narrow group of imaging locations: the median referring orthopedic
surgeon in our sample sends, on average, 79 percent of all her referrals to a single imaging provider. Likewise,
the median referring orthopedic surgeon sends zero patients to the lowest cost provider within either 30- or



                                                       3
60-minutes from the patient’s home. As a result, a crucial finding from our analysis is that in order to lower
out-of-pocket costs and reduce total MRI spending, patients must diverge from their physicians’ established
referral pathways or insurers must somehow persuade physicians to refer patients to diﬀerent locations. This
pattern points to a role for insurers to educate or incentivize physicians to refer in a more cost-eﬀective
manner and generate price elasticity for MRI scans.
   Decades of literature focusing on health care and other sectors has explored the agency relationship and
found that agency is often imperfect (Hubbard 1998; Levitt and Syverson 2008). The referral decisions of
physicians may be suboptimal for two reasons. First, referring physicians may lack information on the prices
of the facilities where they are sending their patients, and second, physicians may be motivated to refer
patients to specific providers for reasons other than quality or patient costs. Existing evidence suggests that
physicians who are vertically-integrated with a hospital are more likely to refer patients to a hospital (Baker,
Bundorf, and Kessler 2016). Consistent with this evidence, we find when a patient is referred by a vertically
integrated referring physician, the price of their scan is 36.5 percent higher, they pay 31.9 percent higher
out-of-pocket costs, and they are 27 percent more likely to receive a hospital-based scan.
   Ultimately, our results have implications for the academic literature and for policy-makers. Existing models
of patient choice use distance as the primary determinant of where patients receive care (Gowrisankaran,
Nevo, and Town 2015; Capps, Dranove, and Satterthwaite 2003; Ho 2006). These results suggest that,
particularly for planned care, economists should integrate the eﬀect of physician agency into their choice
models. Our results also suggest a mechanism behind findings in the literature showing that introducing
deductibles lowered health spending by over 11 percent without inducing individuals to more actively price
shop (Brot-Goldberg et al. 2017). While deductibles may reduce the probability of individuals accessing
health care services, our results suggest that once patients touch the health system, where they receive
ensuing care is strongly influenced by their referring physician.
   On the policy front, our work highlights the limits of existing demand side cost sharing as a tool to
improve patient shopping. Despite attractive predictions from price theory, these standard incentives do not
perform well on real consumers in health care markets. Going forward, our work suggests that health care
funders could more eﬀectively steer patients towards high productivity providers by equipping physicians with
information on the prices of potential locations for care and incentivizing them to make more cost-eﬃcient
referrals. These results are consistent with Ho and Pakes (2014), which find that insurers with more direct
control over physician referrals are able to get lower priced secondary care and research on payment reform
that suggests that when physicians are incented to make referrals to lower priced locations, they do so (Song
et al. 2014; Carroll et al. 2018).
   This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we describe our data and empirical approach. We
present our results in Section 3. We oﬀer a discussion of our results and conclude in Section 4. Appendix A
includes additional background information on MRI scans, cost-sharing among the privately insured, and a
brief discussion of agency relationships. Appendix B includes additional detail on how we identify MRI scans
in our data, identify patients’ referring physicians, construct price measures, and identify what patients and
the insurer would have paid had patients received care at alternative locations.

2       Data, Identifying MRI Scans, Calculating Prices, and Building
        Patient Choice Sets

2.1     Primary and Secondary Data

Our primary data set is composed of insurance claims provided by a large national insurer that covers tens of
millions of lives annually and is active in all 50 US states. Our main analysis uses data from 2013. We build
an analytic sample of claims for the most common MRI scan in our data: lower extremity MRIs. Our goal is
to identify shoppable, homogenous MRI scans (e.g. those that were not part of an emergency episode or that
occurred during an inpatient stay). In Appendix B1, we describe how we identify lower-limb MRI scans and
the sample restrictions we put in place so that the MRIs in our sample were ones where consumers could
actively make decisions. Appendix B1 also illustrates how each restriction impacts our sample size.
      As we describe in Appendix B2, we are also able to identify the physicians’ who ordered patients’ MRI
scans. This allows us to link the referring physician ID to data from SK&A and infer whether referring
physicians are part of vertically integrated organizations. The SK&A physician-level dataset identifies the
group or hospital that owns a practice at which a given physician is employed. For our purposes, a physician is
said to be in a “vertically integrated” practice if her practice is owned by a hospital. In the case of physicians
practicing in multiple locations, we regard those physicians as being vertically integrated if any of the practices
in which they work is hospital-owned.1
      Our data contributor provides all their policy-holders with free access to a tool to search for providers and
sort providers by distance and price. The tool links to claims data, so beneficiaries can observe their potential
out-of-pocket payments at each location as a function of their plan design and year-to-date spending. We
merge data on the use of this tool into our analysis. The transparency tool data includes a patient ID (which
we use to link to the claims data), the date of the search, and information on what type of procedure the
patient searched for. As a result, we can identify users who searched for MRI prices prior to receiving an
MRI scan.
      Our data include the amounts patients paid for the taking and reading of their MRIs via co-insurance,
co-payments, and payments under their deductibles. Our data also include the prices our data our data
contributor has negotiated with facilities and physicians for the taking and reading of MRIs. More specific
information on how we construct price measures for lower-limb MRIs is described in Appendix B3.


2.2     Inferring MRI Quality

We assume that the taking and reading of MRIs is undiﬀerentiated across providers. While the actual taking
of the MRI scan is undiﬀerentiated, there is evidence of diﬀerentiation in the reading of MRI scans across
radiologists. For example, Briggs et al. (2008) found that in 13 percent of neurological MRI scans, there was
a major diﬀerence in diagnosis when a specialist radiologist reviewed the findings of a general radiologist.
However, most evidence on diagnostic radiology errors have been observed in the documentation of cancers
(Brady 2017). We focus on analysis of lower-limb MRI scans following a referral by an orthopedic surgeon.
As a result, radiologists in our sample are generally looking for structural anomalies (e.g. torn ligaments),
not subtle evidence of a cancer. Moreover, 84 percent of patients in our sample had follow-up visits with
   1 We can link more than 95 percent of the referring physicians in our sample to the SK&A data. We assume physicians we

cannot link to the SK&A data are not in vertically integrated practices. Our results are also robust to the alternative assumption
that those physicians’ practices are vertically integrated.


                                                                5
orthopedic surgeons in the six months after the taking of their MRI. Orthopedists tend to review MRI
results themselves before they initiate surgery, and Kim et al. (2008) and Figueiredo et al. (2018) found no
diﬀerence in the diagnoses made when scans were read by orthopedists versus radiologists. Recall that we
limit our sample to patients who see an orthopedist within 3 months of their scan and whose scan is ordered
by an orthopedist. Thus, the sample of patients we analyze will experience the “reading quality” of their
orthopedist, not the facility where the scan is done. Therefore, we assume that the MRI scan service we
study is undiﬀerentiated with respect to clinical quality across providers.


2.3     Constructing Patient Choice Sets and Estimating Payments at Alternate Providers

For each patient who underwent an MRI in our sample, we construct a choice set of MRI providers within
a 60-minute drive of the patient’s home. Details of how we construct this drive time-based choice set are
described in Appendix B4. By using drive time instead of straight-line distance, we allow patients in rural
areas to travel farther in the same amount of time than patients in densely populated cities.
      The price of an MRI at each provider is calculated as the average of the prices of scans at that provider
during our time period. The price we calculate includes the payments for the taking and reading of an MRI
scan. Our combined price is the allowed amount captures the patient and insurer contributions to total
payment for a scan. We then estimate what patients and our data contributor would pay for a lower-limb MRI
scan at alternate, lower-priced providers. While we do not directly observe beneficiaries’ plan characteristics,
we can infer plan benefit designs from our data (see Appendix B4 for a detailed discussion of our strategy for
identifying counterfactual payments).
      For every case in our data, we identify the lowest priced alternative provider within a 60-minute drive
from the patient’s home zip code. This is a mechanical calculation that ignores capacity constraints and GE
eﬀects. We then calculate the “money left on the table” by patients and insurers. The “money left on the
table” is the amount of money the patient and the insurer would have saved respectively had the patient
received an MRI scan at this lowest-priced location.


3       Results

3.1     Descriptive Statistics

The mean total price of MRI scans in our data (i.e. sum of allowed amounts on both physician and facilities
claims) is $850.07 (Panel A of Table 1). Twenty-five percent of MRIs in our sample were performed in
hospitals. Hospital-based MRIs have an average price of $1,474.35; non-hospital-based scans have an average
price of $642.82.
    Patients in our data contribute $305.53, on average, to the cost of MRIs, while the insurer pays $544.54.
22 percent of patients in our data paid for the entirety of their MRI, 54 percent had non-zero cost-sharing
but did not bear the full cost of their scan, and 24 percent had zero out-of-pocket costs. Of those individuals
who had cost sharing, 31 percent had health care costs over $5,000 in the three months after the taking of
the scan, 38 percent had health care costs over $5,000 in the six months after the taking of the scan, and 19
percent had health care costs over $10,000 in the six months after the taking of the scan.
      As we illustrate in Panel A of Table 1, the median patient in our sample attends a provider that is
approximately a 22-minute car ride from her home. We also find that the median patient had 16 MRI



                                                        6
locations within 30-minutes of her home. In 20 percent of cases, the patient received an MRI on the same
day she saw an orthopedist.


3.2     Within Market Variation in MRI Prices

There is significant variation in the price of MRI providers within HRRs. As we illustrate in Appendix
Table A.1, the median HRR has 10 providers who delivered at least one scan to our sample population in
2013. Across the 302 HRRs in our sample, the median ratio between the 80th and 20th percentile provider
prices is 1.73. In 89 percent of HRRs, the highest-priced provider within the HRR is a hospital. Notably,
despite the fact that hospital-based MRIs tend to be approximately 2.3 times as expensive as MRIs performed
outside of a hospital, in 25 percent of HRRs, the highest volume MRI provider is a hospital.


3.3     Maximum Potential Savings

We calculate how much a patient and her insurer could save if she received an MRI scan from the lowest
priced provider within a 60-minute drive from her home instead of where she currently received care. While
these estimates ignore GE eﬀects and capacity constraints, they give a sense of the potential savings available
if patients attended lower cost providers. We refer to these savings as the ‘maximum potential savings.’
      The maximum potential savings for patients and insurers that we observe are substantial (Panel A of
Table 2). As we illustrate, if patients attended the lowest priced provider within an hour drive from their
homes, there would be a mean savings per case of $468.53 and a reduction in MRI spending of 55.12 percent.
Under this counterfactual, patient out-of-pocket costs for the MRI would decrease, on average, by 44.23
percent from $305.53 to $170.40. Likewise, insurers would lower their average spending on each lower-limb
MRI by 61.22 percent, from $544.54 to $211.15.


3.4     Association of MRI Prices with Quality, Distance, and Out-of-Pocket Costs

When economists write down choice models, the attributes of health care providers that patients are assumed
to value typically include quality, distance from home, and price. We examine, in turn, the extent to which
each of these factors may explain the patterns we observe.
      Quality does not appear to vary across MRI providers. We assume that the reading of the MRI scan is
done by the orthopedic surgeon who ordered the imaging study. The remaining measure of clinical quality is
therefore whether MRI scan is correctly taken or needs to be repeated. However, as we illustrate in Appendix
Table A.2, of the 50,484 MRI scans in our data, only three were repeated within 90 days.
      Likewise, we find that patients can access lower-priced providers and obtain significant savings without
travelling farther than they already went for care. In Panel B of Table 2, we test the share of the maximum
potential savings that would be available if patients travelled no farther than they already went for care,
15-minutes minutes farther, 30-minutes farther, and 45-minutes farther. As we illustrate, if patients attended
the lowest price provider reachable in the same time they traveled to reach their original providers, out-
of-pocket costs could be reduced by 27 percent, insurance spending could be reduced by 41 percent, and
total spending on lower-limb MRIs could be reduced by 36 percent. As a result, 65 percent of the maximum
potential savings outlined in Panel B of Table 2 is available without forcing patients to travel farther than
they already were travelling for care. Savings of this magnitude are possible without forcing patients to travel



                                                       7
farther for care because, on average, patients travelled past six lower priced MRI providers between their
home and the where they received an MRI scan.
      In Appendix Table A.3, we observe, in our conditional correlates, that individuals with higher out-of-pocket
costs receive cheaper lower-limb MRI scans. For example, we observe that relative to individuals who bore
the full cost of their scan in out-of-pocket costs, individuals with zero price exposure had MRIs that were
$101 more expensive, left $97 more dollars on the table, and were three percentage points more likely to
receive a hospital-based scan. However, because of the structure of insurance plans, individuals may have spot
prices (i.e. the price they pay when they access care) that diﬀer markedly from their shadow prices (i.e. the
expected true price given that some individuals will exceed their out-of-pocket maximum). Previous research
has found that when faced with these non-linear contracts (e.g. commercial health insurance plans with high
up front cost-sharing and out-of-pocket maximums), individuals tend to respond to the spot price, not the
shadow price (Einav, Finkelstein, and Schrimpf 2015; Dalton, Gowrisankaran, and Town 2015; Brot-Goldberg
et al. 2017).
      Consistent with previous findings, individuals in our sample do not appear to eﬀectively diﬀerentiate
between spot and shadow prices. While we are unable to identify when individuals are over their deductible,
we can observe individuals’ health spending in the three, six, and 12 months after the taking of their MRI
scan. In Appendix Table A.4, we further subdivide those patients some cost with some or total cost exposure
into those who have health care costs above and below $5,000 in the six months after they received care.
A threshold of $5,000 was chosen as most plans from our insurer have out-of-pocket maximums of $5,000.2
For many individuals, health care costs over $5,000 in the six months after a scan would mean they faced a
shadow price of zero for their MRI scan, depending on when their deductible reset. When we diﬀerentiate
between individuals who bore the full cost of their MRI with low future spending (e.g. those with a spot
price that matches their shadow price) and those who likely bore the full cost of their MRI but had high
future spending (e.g. those who had a shadow price that is considerably lower than their spot price), we find
that there is no statistically significant diﬀerence between the prices of their MRIs. This result is robust when
we split those with cost sharing into groups with other levels of spending and shorter and longer windows in
which we measure spending (see Appendix Tables A.5 to A.8).


3.5     Use of Price Transparency Tools

Of note, as we illustrate in Appendix Table A.9, very few individuals searched for the price of an MRI
scan before receiving a scan. Of the 50,484 lower-limb MRI scans in our sample, patients used the price
transparency tool supplied by the insurer to search for the price of MRI providers prior to receiving care in
only 374 of cases (0.74 percent). This result is consistent with previous analysis from Desai et al. (2017),
which also found that few privately insured individuals use price transparency tools before accessing care.


3.6     Drivers of Money Left on the Table

To better understand the factors that explain the variance in lower-limb MRI scan prices, total amount of
money left on the table, and whether an MRI scan is performed in a hospital, we perform an ANOVA and
include controls for patients’ out-of-pocket price exposure, patient demographic characteristics (year of birth,
   2 We use this strategy because we cannot observe when individuals’ deductibles reset each year and the reset dates diﬀer

across plans in our data.




                                                            8
Charlson comorbidity score, race, and sex), fixed-eﬀects for patients’ home HRR, and fixed-eﬀects for patients’
referring physicians.
      Our results indicate that referring physicians heavily influence where patients receive care. As we illustrate
in Table 3, referrer fixed-eﬀects explain the largest share of the variance in the price of MRIs, money left on
the table, and whether or not a patient received a hospital-based MRI scan. Indeed, referrer fixed eﬀects
explain 51.47, 50.38, and 54.39 percent of the variance in each variable, respectively. As we illustrate in
Appendix Table A.10, this result remains robust when we substitute fixed eﬀects for the zip code where the
patient lives for fixed eﬀects for the HRR where the patient lives. These results are also robust to excluding
the 20 percent of MRI cases that were delivered on the same day a patient saw an orthopedic surgeon.
Likewise, in Appendix Table A.11, we carry out a similar decomposition using an alternative approach, where
we use the price of a patient’s MRI as the dependent variable, and identify the R2 statistic for a series of
regressions including various combinations of covariates (e.g. zip code fixed eﬀects, patient characteristics,
referrer fixed eﬀects) in each regression. Our results using this alternative approach remain qualitatively
unchanged.


3.7     Referring Physicians, Prices, and Money Left on the Table

Orthopedists tend to refer their patients to a narrow group of MRI providers. In our data, the average
referring orthopedic surgeon made 10 referrals for lower-limb MRIs in 2013 (Panel B of Table 1). The median
orthopedic surgeon sent patients to 2.5 locations and the median referring physician’s modal referral location
received 79 percent of her referrals.
      As we illustrate in Panel C of Table 2, one consequence of this is that, in order for patients and insurers
to save money, patients need to diverge from referring physicians’ established referral patterns. Indeed, if
each patient received an MRI from the modal location where his or her orthopedist referred patients, it would
result in only a 10.72 percent reduction in MRI spending and achieve only 19.65 percent of the maximum
potential savings.


3.8     Vertical Integration and MRI Costs

The ownership structure of the practices where referring physicians work also influences where patients
receive care. As we describe in Panel B of Table 1, 14 percent of orthopedic surgeons in our sample
worked in hospital-owned practices. Appendix Figure A.1 shows for each orthopedic surgeon in our data,
the share of the surgeon’s patients she sent from her practice to a hospital to receive a lower-limb MRI
scan. Vertically integrated physicians are more likely to send patients for hospital-based scans. Among
non-vertically-integrated referring physicians, the mean orthopedic surgeon sent 19 percent of her patients for
a hospital-based scan. By contrast, the mean vertically-integrated referring physician sent 52 percent of her
patients for a hospital-based MRI.
      Table 4 presents results from a regression in which each observation is an MRI scan and the dependent
variable is either the total price of an MRI, the patient contribution, the insurer contribution, the money
left on the table, an indicator for whether a patient had a hospital-based scan, or an indicator for whether
an MRI scan was repeated. In addition to controlling for patient characteristics and the patient’s HRR,
we include an indicator for whether a patient’s referring physician is part of a hospital-owned practice. We
observe that patients with a vertically integrated referring physician were 27 percentage points more likely to



                                                          9
receive a hospital-based MRI and had scans that were $277.19 more expensive. This results in an additional
$89.68 in out-of-pocket costs, $187.51 more spending by insurers, and another $270.20 left on the table.3


4     Discussion and Conclusions
We explore the extent to which patients currently shop for health care by examining how individuals with
private health insurance currently consume pre-planned lower-limb MRI scans. Lower-limb MRI scans are a
useful procedure to study for this analysis because they are plausibly homogenous and can be planned in
advance by patients. We posit that if patients do not eﬀectively choose an imaging provider, they are likely
to struggle when they make even more complicated health care consumption decisions.
    We find that, on average, patients travel past six lower-priced providers in route to where they received
care. Indeed, we find that if patients had attended the lowest cost provider within the distance they already
travelled, they could have reduced their out-of-pocket costs by $83.93 (27.47 percent) and insurer spending
by $220.52 (40.50 percent). Patients’ out-of-pocket cost exposure explained only 2.37 percent of the variance
in MRI price prices and 2.29 percent of the money left on the table (these represent 4.24 percent and 4.19
percent, respectively, of the explained variance). Moreover, despite mean out-of-pocket costs of over $300.00
per scan, less than 1 percent of individuals in our sample searched for the price of lower-limb MRI scans
before accessing care.
  Ultimately, we find that a patient’s referring physician is the strongest determinant of the cost of the
MRI scan that a patient receives, the money that they leave on the table, and whether or not they receive a
hospital-based MRI scan. In our decomposition, referring physician fixed eﬀects explain 51.47 percent of the
variance in price of an MRI a patient received (92.08 percent of the explained variance). Our results speak to
the importance of the agency relationship in determining where patients receive care. We observe that the
median referring physician (orthopedic surgeons in our sample) refers patients to three MRI providers, while
the modal location where they send their patients captures 79 percent of their referrals. As a result, in order
to attend a cheaper MRI provider, patients need to be diverted from their physicians’ pre-established referral
pathways. These results indicate that in order to lower MRI spending, insurers could work with physicians
themselves to influence where they sent their patients, narrow provider networks, or introduce such strong
incentives to patients that they request diﬀerent referrals or seek out diﬀerent referring physicians.
    However, modifying referral patterns is complicated because physicians’ referrals are linked to the
ownership structure of their medical practices. Patients who were treated by an orthopedic surgeon working
in a hospital-owned practice received more expensive MRI scans, left more money on the table, and were 27
percent more likely to receive a hospital-based scan.
    Our evidence suggests that, at present, patients in our sample do not ‘shop’ for care. This is in spite
of significant out-of-pocket costs, ready access to a price transparency tool, and the opportunity to reduce
their spot price without traveling longer distances. Going forward, our findings suggest that because of the
weight patients appear to place on the advice of their referring physicians, it is unlikely that a significant
number of patients will use information from an app or from a pricing webpage to diverge from where their
physicians typically send patients for imaging studies. Given that we observe these results for patients
consuming lower-limb MRI scans, it is even less likely that patients will actively price shop for more complex
and diﬀerentiated services.
   3 One argument in favor of vertical integration between physicians and hospitals is that it could increase care coordination

between providers (Baicker and Levy 2013). While this is a possibility we cannot exclude, because the cases we examine are not
emergencies, there is time to get the scan to the orthopedist without any adverse impact on the health of the patient.



                                                              10
   Our work has direct implications for the study of health care markets and for public policy. Most models
of how patients choose where to receive care do not explicitly model the role of referring physicians and often
find that the distance between patients and providers is the primary determinant of where patients receive
care. While the distance from a patient’s home to her hospital may be an important predictor of where she
receives care in an emergency, our work suggests that for care where individuals rely on the advice of their
referring physicians, referring physicians’ preferences may dominate the eﬀects of cost-sharing and distance in
determining where patients receive care. Our work therefore suggests that economists should integrate the
impact of agency into models of patient choice, particularly in non-emergent settings.
   On the policy front, over the last 20 years, much of the focus for insurers has been on determining how to
use demand side cost sharing to drive patients to consume health care more eﬃciently. Our results, consistent
with Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017), suggest that blunt tools such as high deductibles are not very eﬀective at
influencing patients’ choices. Our results indicate that while demand side cost sharing may reduce the rates
that individuals access care (with uncertain impacts on welfare), once individuals meet with their physician,
they rely heavily on their physician’s advice in deciding where to receive subsequent care. This suggests
that insurers should work to steer their beneficiaries towards lower priced providers and towards referring
physicians that make lower-priced referrals, and that policy-makers and insurers should work to incentivize
physicians to make more eﬃcient referrals. In short, price conscious referring physicians are likely to be
crucial for raising the price elasticity of MRI scans.

     Notes: In panel A, each observation is a single lower-extremity MRI that occurred in 2013. A observation in Panel B is an orthopedist that made 5 or more
     referrals in 2013. 1Of the 3,442 referring orthopedist NPIs in our sample, 143 did not appear in the SK&A data; this is why we are only able to calculate the
     proportion of hospital-owned referrers across 3,299 orthopedists in our sample

     Notes: The Mean Payment columns show what the total, patient, and insurer average payment were for a lower-extremity MRI in our sample of patients.
     The Mean Savings columns show what the total, patient, and insurer savings would have been had the patient gone to an alternative location. In Panel
     A, it is the cheapest location within a 60-minute drive from the patient’s home. In Panel B, it is savings by travel distance from where they actually
     received care. In Panel C, it is the savings if patients went to the lowest price provider where their orthopedist referred patients.

     Notes: This table presents the partial R2 s from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of factors in explaining MRI prices,
     the amount of money patients could save themselves and their insurer had the patient gone to the minimum cost provider
     within 60-minutes’ driving time of their homes, and the probability that a patient received a hospital-based MRI. This
     table relies on the same sample of patients described in Table 1. We additionally limit the analysis to patients whose
     referring orthopedists made at least 5 referrals in 2013. This reduces the number of referring orthopedists in the sample
     from 10,921 to 3,442 and reduces the sample size by 14,619 to 35,865 MRIs. Lastly, we eliminate all observations that is
     a singleton in any factor variable category. This reduces the sample size by 13 to 35,852 MRIs. Patient cost sharing
     fixed eﬀects indicate whether a patient had no cost exposure, had some cost exposure, or bore the full cost of her MRI.
     We identify a patient’s referring orthopedist by analyzing 3-months of claims history for each patient before their MRI
     occurred. If a patient saw a physician NPI with a specialty of orthopedic surgeon, then we assign this orthopedist’s NPI
     as the patient’s “referring orthopedist.” Appendix Table A.7 re-runs this ANOVA analysis using patient ZCTA fixed
     eﬀects in lieu of patient HRR fixed eﬀects.

Appendix A              Background on Cost Sharing, MRI Scans, and Agency
Advanced imaging studies – MRIs and computed tomography (CT) scans – account for approximately 3
percent of health spending (Iglehart 2009). In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was double-digit increase
year on year in the rate that advanced imaging studies were being performed, in spite of evidence suggesting
that nearly half of studies performed may have been unnecessary (Lee and Levy 2012; Litkowski 2016). In
addition to increasing cost sharing and promoting price transparency, insurers have increasingly required
that physicians obtain prior approval for advanced imaging studies before the payers will fund them for their
beneficiaries. It is estimated that approximately half of insurance plans involve prior authorizations and that
between 10 and 20 percent of imaging studies are denied during this process (Lee and Levy 2012; Iglehart
2009). While some research has suggested that prior authorizations have reduced the rates at which advanced
imaging studies are performed, there is little evidence that introducing price transparency and encouraging
patient shopping has been eﬀective.
   Most analysis of the impact of health care transparency tools on patient shopping have found that they
have had very little eﬀect, in part, because they are rarely used by patients. Lieber (2017) and Whaley,
Schneider Chafen, and Pinkard (2014) estimate that users of price transparency tools save approximately 15
percent on the price of imaging services. However, Brown (2017) found that only 8 percent of consumers
having an MRI scan used New Hampshire’s transparency website before accessing care. Likewise, Lieber
(2017) found that at a large restaurant chain, only 12 percent of the employees searched for price information
at least once. Similarly, Desai et al. (2017) found that at a sample of large private firms, fewer than 10
percent of individuals oﬀered the transparency tool used it. These results echo findings from a national survey
that suggested only three percent of non-elderly individuals in the U.S. had compared prices across providers
before receiving care (Mehrotra et al. 2017). Our data allows us to identify the date that individuals access
their price transparency tool and observe what services they searched for.
   Both Lieber (2017) and Brown (2017) suggest that the use of transparency tools would increase if
individuals were more directly exposed to the price of health care services. This proposition is supported
by theory modeled by Dionne and Eeckhoudt (1984) and Akın and Platt (2014). Brown (2016) estimates
that if individuals had a 50 percent co-insurance rate, this would lead to a 38 percent increase in the
number of consumers using price shopping tools. Likewise, Lieber (2017) estimated that individuals who
met their deductibles were 1.5 percentage points less likely to search for price information. However, when
Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017) examined the impact of switching individuals at a large firm from first dollar
coverage to high deductible health plans, they did not observe an increase in price shopping in the year the
switch took place or in the second year after the switch. In fact, virtually all the reduction in spending that
Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017) observed following the introduction of deductibles came from patients reducing
the quantity of health care consumed.
   In the face of lackluster results from increasing deductibles and introducing price transparency tools, some
private employers have introduced reference pricing schemes to steer individuals to lower cost providers. In
a reference pricing program, beneficiaries are enrolled in plans where the payer will only fund care up to
the price of the provider in the (for example) 60th percentile of prices in the region where the patient lives.
These programs involve even greater potential out-of-pocket exposure for patients, although they can be
simpler if there is a list of providers that are below the threshold. A recent analysis found that individuals in
a reference pricing program received MRIs that were 12.5 percent lower priced than matched individuals that
were not in a reference price program (robinson2016).



                                                       21
   One understudied potential explanation for why consumers do not price shop is the weight patients place
on advice from their referring physicians about where to receive care. Survey data suggests that patients rely
heavily on the advice of their physicians when determining where to receive care (Harris 2003) though they
may not know the reason why a particular provider is being recommended (e.g. location, friendship tie, etc).
Patients can be uncertain about many aspects of their care, including what services are necessary and the
quality of providers from whom they could receive treatment. This, as Arrow (1963) noted, gives rise to the
need for physicians to serve as agents for their patients.
   Decades of literature focusing on health care and other sectors has explored the agency relationship and
found that agency is often imperfect (Hubbard 1998; Levitt and Syverson 2008). Within the health care
sector, there is a large literature that suggests the presence of supplier induced demand, where patients are
encouraged by providers to utilize services they do not need in order to reap financial gain (Gruber and
Owings 1996). Physicians may also gain directly or indirectly from the imaging referrals they make. In the
1990s, laws were passed that prohibited physicians from referring patients to facilities where the physicians
had an ownership stake (these are often referred to as the Stark laws). However, the law allows physicians
to own their own imaging equipment, refer patients to receive scans from inside their owned facilities, and
benefit directly. Physicians may also gain indirectly from making referrals within the system where they are
employed (Baker, Bundorf, and Kessler 2016).
   If physicians were perfect agents for patients, we would expect that aspects of care that are important to
the patient (such as out-of-pocket costs) to influence referral choices even if the patient had no direct input
into the decision. However, the referrals physicians make may diﬀer from the choices that would be made
by a perfectly informed patient, both because the physician may not be fully informed about the patient
preferences and patients’ out of pocket costs, and because maximizing patient welfare may not be physicians’
only objective when they refer patients.


Appendix B                Description of Data, Data Cleaning, and Methods

B.1    Identifying Shoppable Lower-Limb MRIs

We build an analytic sample of claims for the most common MRI scan in our data: lower extremity MRIs
performed without contrast.4 We identify lower-limb MRIs in our data as those cases involving either a
physician or facility claim with a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code of 73721. We identify whether
or not a scan was performed in a hospital using the place of service codes on a claim.
   Our goal is to identify shoppable, homogenous MRI scans. As a result, we limit our analysis to MRI scans
taken during visits where no health care services were provided on the claim other than the “reading” and
“taking” of the MRI (this excludes 14 percent of observations). We also exclude MRIs performed during an
inpatient stay or as part of an emergency episode, since patients in these cases are unlikely to be able to
actively choose where to receive care (less than 1 percent of cases). We limit our analysis to individuals age 19
to 64, exclude cases where there were coordinated benefits (i.e. our insurer co-funded the care with another
insurer) (10 percent of cases), exclude cases where the MRI provider was more than a two hour drive from
the patient’s home ZIP code (3 percent of cases), and exclude cases performed at out-of-network facilities (2
   4 MRI scans can be carried out with or without contrast. MRIs with contrast have higher image clarity and can better show

soft tissue, but require the patient to be injected with a contrasting agent called gadolinium. In this analysis, we focus on
lower-limb MRI scans performed without contrast. MRI scans without contrast make up the vast majority of scans in our data.




                                                             22
percent of cases).5 We also restrict our analysis to MRI scans performed on individuals who were continuously
enrolled for at least three months in a point of service (POS) insurance product (the modal insurance product
oﬀered by our data contributor). We focus on individuals with POS plans because network breadth and the
prices insurers have negotiated with providers may diﬀer across the types of insurance products they oﬀer.
Applying these restrictions to our data leaves us with an initial sample of 88,292 MRI scans.


B.2    Identifying Patients’ Referring Physicians

Nearly all of the beneficiaries in our data needed to have their MRI scan prior authorized by the insurer before
the scan would be funded by the insurer. We have data that identifies the physician who requested each
patient’s prior authorization. We can identify the specialties of physicians who ask for prior authorization of
lower-limb MRI scans. The prior authorization data from our insurer indicates that the majority of physicians
who order prior authorizations for lower-limb MRI scans are orthopedic surgeons. As a result, in order to
identify the referring physicians for each lower-limb MRI scan in our data, we use the claims history of each
patient in our sample to find patients who receive a lower-limb MRI scan and have at least one oﬃce visit
with an orthopedic surgeon within three months of the taking of an MRI scan.6 We restrict our analysis to
patients who saw an orthopedist within three months of a scan so that we can assume that the orthopedist a
patient saw before a scan is the referring physician.
    Restricting our analysis to patients who saw an orthopedist three months before a lower-limb MRI scan
eliminates 36,652 of 88,292 cases. The remaining 51,640 cases are divided as follows. In 93 percent of these
cases, patients only saw a single orthopedic surgeon before a scan took place. In 7 percent of cases, however,
the patient saw two or more diﬀerent orthopedic surgeons before a scan occurred. For such patients, we
identify whether the patient saw an orthopedic surgeon after the scan. We assume that the orthopedic surgeon
who saw the patient both before and after the scan was the referring physician. This captures 68 percent
of the cases where patients saw two or more orthopedists before a scan. We exclude the remaining 1,153
cases (2 percent of 51,640 cases) that cannot be categorized this way.7 After excluding those observations
and three observations for which the patient was the only person in their HRR to receive a lower-limb MRI
scan, we are left with a final analytic sample size of 50,484.8 When we transition to analyzing the behavior of
referring physicians, we further limit our analysis to referring physicians who ordered at least 5 lower-limb
MRIs for patients in our sample population. Doing so excludes 14,619 patient observations.


B.3    Measuring MRI Providers’ Prices

We use place of service codes to identify whether an MRI scan was delivered inside or outside a hospital.
For hospital-based MRIs, we observe a physician claim for the “reading” of the MRI scan and a facility
claim for the “taking” of the MRI scan (this is identified via the presence of a CPT code of 73721). We
calculate the total price of a hospital-based MRI scan as the sum of the service lines on the physician and
facility claims with a CPT code of 73721 that occurred on the same date with the same patient identifier.
   5 Our data divides patients into five-year age bands. However, individuals aged 18 years are lumped in with individuals under

age 18. Since 18 year-old individuals could not be distinguished from minors, we focused on individuals aged 19 to 64.
   6 We identify an orthopedic surgeon by the physician’s National Provider Identifier (NPI) number.
   7 These include cases where 1) the patient saw multiple orthopedists both before and after a scan; 2) the patient visited with

multiple orthopedists before the scan but none afterwards; and 3) the patient saw multiple orthopedists before the scan and saw
one or more orthopedists after the scan who were not the same orthopedists as the ones they saw before the MRI.
   8 We do this to remain consistent with rules in our data use agreement that preclude us from analyzing HRRs with very small

numbers of cases.



                                                               23
For non-hospital-based MRIs, providers typically bill for both the taking and reading of an MRI scan on a
physician claim. As a result, we calculate the total price of a non-hospital-based MRI scan as the physician
claim with a CPT code of 73721.


B.4    Constructing Patients’ Choice Sets and Identifying Counterfactual Payments

For each patient who underwent an MRI in our sample, we construct a choice set of MRI providers within a
60-minute drive of each patient’s home. To do so, we begin by identifying every provider that delivered an
MRI scan to a patient in our sample. Next, we calculate travel times between each patient’s home ZIP code
(ZCTA) and the addresses of all providers within 100 miles of the patient’s ZIP. This is done using the online
routing API (application programming interface) provided by “Here”, a commercial mapping company. The
“Here” software uses average traﬃc patterns and user reported data to estimate travel time, by car, between
two locations. By using travel time instead of distance, we allow patients in rural areas to travel farther in
the same amount of time than patients in densely populated cities.
    The price of an MRI at each provider is calculated as the average of the inflation-adjusted prices of scans
at that provider during our time period. The price we calculate includes the payments for the taking and
reading of an MRI scan.9 Our combined price is the allowed amount, so it includes both the patient and
insurer contributions to total payment for a scan. We then estimate what patients and our data contributor
would pay for a lower-limb MRI scan at alternate, lower-priced providers.10 While we do not directly observe
beneficiaries’ plan characteristics, we can infer plan benefit designs from our data. To infer what patients
would have paid at lower-priced locations, we rely on two facts. First, when moved to a lower priced provider,
a patient will never pay more towards her deductible than she did on her original episode. Second, coinsurance
rates can be inferred for all patients who exceed their deductible and need to pay coinsurance.11 Our task of
inferring co-insurance is made easier by the fact that patients in our sample do not pay fixed co-payments.




   9 Non-hospital-based scans include the reading and taking of an MRI scan on a single physician service line. Hospital-based

scans include a physician and a facility claim. Because two diﬀerent hospital-based MRI cases may involve diﬀerent radiologists,
when we calculate the average combined price of the taking and reading of a scan at a hospital, we also use the average price of
the readings of scans at that facility.
  10 We do not need to calculate the level of counterfactual prices at facilities with a higher allowed amount than the chosen

facility because these are not used in our counterfactual calculations.
  11 We assume the coinsurance rate c that we observe for patient i who received care at provider j would be the same co-insurance

rate that patient i would pay at other locations. This is an assumption that our data contributor has told us applies in virtually
every case in the data. The insurer in our data does not have co-payments for MRI scans.

Notes: Each observation is an HRR. These statistics are derived from the same set of MRIs described in
Table 1. There are a total of 306 HRRs in the United States. Two provider HRRs are not represented in our
sample. Additionally, because we exclude singleton patient HRRs, this reduces the number of provider HRRs in
our sample to 302. There is an additional provider HRR where only a single MRI was provided in that HRR
to our sample of patients in 2013; this is why we are only able to calculate the coeﬃcient of variation for 301
provider HRRs. The “largest” provider is the location that performs the greatest number of MRIs within an
HRR.

with standard errors clustered around providers. The regressions include controls for patient
characteristics, including sex, race, year of birth, and 6-month Charlson comorbidity score.
We also include patient HRR fixed eﬀects. This table compares the average MRI price, the
probability a patient received a hospital-based MRI, and the average amount of combined
patient and insurer savings that could be achieved if patients had gone to the cheapest provider
within a 60-minute drive of their home (i.e. how much “money [they] left on the table”) between
patients who bore the full cost of their MRIs and had “low” future health care costs with four
other groups of patients: 1) those who had no price exposure for their MRI (i.e. paid nothing)
2) those who had some price exposure, but “high” future health care costs (i.e. those whose
shadow price was zero), 3) those who had some price exposure and “low” future health care
costs and 4) those who bore the full cost of their MRI and had “high” future health care costs.
We define “high” future health care cost patients as those who generated at least $5,000 in
health care costs in the six months following their MRIs. Of the 50,484 MRIs in our sample,
19,483 patients (38.6%) were “high” future health care cost patients.

Notes: ⇤ p < 0.10, ⇤⇤ p < 0.05, ⇤⇤⇤ p < 0.01. These regressions are run at the patient-level
with standard errors clustered around providers. The regressions include controls for patient
characteristics, including sex, race, year of birth, and 6-month Charlson comorbidity score.
We also include patient HRR fixed eﬀects. This table compares the average MRI price, the
probability a patient received a hospital-based MRI, and the average amount of combined
patient and insurer savings that could be achieved if patients had gone to the cheapest provider
within a 60-minute drive of their home (i.e. how much “money [they] left on the table”) between
patients who bore the full cost of their MRIs and had “low” future health care costs with four
other groups of patients: 1) those who had no price exposure for their MRI (i.e. paid nothing)
2) those who had some price exposure, but “high” future health care costs (i.e. those whose
shadow price was zero), 3) those who had some price exposure and “low” future health care
costs and 4) those who bore the full cost of their MRI and had “high” future health care costs.
We define “high” future health care cost patients as those who generated at least $10,000 in
health care costs in the twelve months following their MRIs. Of the 50,484 MRIs in our sample,
13,445 patients (26.6%) were “high” future health care cost patients.

     Notes: This table presents the partial R2 s from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of factors in explaining MRI prices
     and the amount of money patients could save themselves and their insurer had the patient gone to the minimum cost
     provider within 60-minute drives of their homes. For example, the entry in the first column and last row of the table
     indicates that 47.58% of the variation in MRI prices cannot be explained if you exclude referring orthopedist fixed eﬀects
     from the model. This sample is limited to the same sample of patients described in Table 1. However, instead of removing
     patients in singleton HRRs, we remove patients in singleton ZCTAs; this changes the sample size from 50,484 to 46,652.
     In addition, we limit the analysis to patients whose referring orthopedists provided at least 5 referrals in 2013. This
     reduces the number of referring orthopedists in the sample from 10,039 to 3,441 and reduces the sample size by 12,358 to
     34,294 MRIs. Lastly, we eliminate all observations with singleton values within each factor variable. This reduces the
     sample size by 1,241 to 33,053 MRIs. Patient cost sharing fixed eﬀects indicate whether a patient had no cost exposure,
     had some cost exposure, or bore the full cost of her MRI. We identify a patient’s referring orthopedist by analyzing
     3-months of claims history for each patient before their MRI occurred. If a patient saw a physician NPI with a specialty
     of orthopedic surgeon, then we assign this orthopedist’s NPI as the patient’s “referring orthopedist.”

     Notes: The numbers reported in this table are R2 values where the dependent variable is either the total price of an

     MRIs described in Table A.7. The money left on the table is the amount patients could have saved themselves and
     their insurer if they went to the lowest cost provider within a 60-minute drive from their home. Patient controls include
     sex, race, year of birth, and 6-month Charlson comorbidity score. Patient cost sharing fixed eﬀects indicate whether
     a patient had no cost exposure, had some cost exposure, or bore the full cost of her MRI. Each column includes a
     diﬀerent combination of controls.

Notes: Each bar is an orthopedic surgeon. The sample of referrers is limited to the same set used for the analysis in Table A.10
(i.e. orthopedists who made at least five referrals in 2013, excluding singleton patient HRRs). The bar height indicates the
proportion of cases an individual orthopedist refers her patients to a hospital. Black bars indicate referrers who are vertically-
integrated with a hospital. Grey bars indicate referrers who are not vertically-integrated.
