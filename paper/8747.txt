                                            ABSTRACT


        While the old systems competition took place with closed borders, globalisation has brought
about a new type of systems competition that is driven by the mobility of factors of production. The new
systems competition will likely imply the erosion of the European welfare state, induce a race to the
bottom in the sense that capital will not even pay for the infrastructure it uses and erode national
regulatory systems. In general, it will suffer from the same type of market failure which induced the
respective government activity in the first place. The new systems competition will force inefficient
governments to seek national efficiency, but national efficiency does not imply that systems competition
will itself be efficient.

The new systems competition

The unbridled economic strength of capitalist economies brought communism to its knees.

Centrally planned economies took their leave from the stage of history in disgrace. Who

would deny that this systems competition produced beneficial results?

          This was of course a form of systems competition that has lost most of its importance

today and that has given way to a new systems competition. The goal of the old systems

competition between communism and capitalism was economic, cultural and military

dominance, and it took place amidst closed borders in the form of mutual observation,

imitation and innovation. The new systems competition, however, is a competition for

locational advantage that is primarily driven by the international migration of people and

production factors. In the words of Albert Hirschman (1970), exit, or voting with one’s feet,

characterises the new systems competition. Voice and loyalty were forces that used to play

the more important roles in the competitive processes of the past.

          All national economies today are confronted with the forces of globalisation. Goods

and capital have been able to cross borders unrestricted for some time, and international direct

investment is gaining importance. A growing number of firms are shifting their locations to

low-wage and low-tax countries in order to prevail in increasingly intense international

competition. At the same time, poverty refugees from all over the world are pressing into the

richer industrial countries to participate in the blessings of the welfare state.

          Globalisation is not a completely new phenomenon.1 Under the old colonial system,

international trade and capital flows as a percentage of the national product reached significant

levels. At the end of the nineteenth century one can even speak of a world labour market. This

is at least the impression left by the enormous migration flows at the time. Nevertheless, with

                                                 4

multinational corporations, the problem has now taken on new dimensions that were hardly

conceivable not too long ago.

       The mobility of people, goods and production factors places great competitive

pressures on the countries of this world. They create a systems competition that is entirely

different from the already concluded competition between communist and market-economy

systems or also from the competition that the European nation states faced during the past two

centuries. It is no longer a matter of implementing wise, internal policies to guide a largely

autarkic economy to a position of economic strength, social peace or military dominance. The

strategies of Bismarck, Stalin or Roosevelt are no longer called for. Governments today must

be aware of the effects that national institutions have on the cross-border transfer of economic

activities. Taxes, social transfers, public goods, regulatory systems, laws and many other

factors are just as influential in motivating the movement of people and production factors as

wages and other economic fundamentals that are not directly influenced by government. No

state can afford to frighten off mobile capital as a result of grossly inefficient institutions, just

as no state can afford to be a magnet for the poor of this world. Similar to a private company,

a state competes for good customers and tries to ward off the freeloaders.




The euro, capital markets and systems competition

Understanding the new systems competition is especially important for Europe, since what has

been said about the world applies in particular measure for Europe. The mobility of economic

factors, the driving force of systems competition, will have a much greater impact on inner-

European relations than brought about by the previous imitation and innovation competition

of systems.

       The introduction of the euro is a particularly important step in this connection because

the euro is a symbol of a new liberalism and enhanced economic integration in Europe.
                                               5

People, goods, services and capital can pass borders without restrictions. The four basic

freedoms, guaranteed in the Treaty of Rome already in 1957, have finally been implemented.

       The euro has not only helped to open doors in Europe politically. It is also directly

increasing the inner-European mobility of production factors and goods. In the past, the

uncertainty of     exchange-rate movements has burdened cross-border trade with not

inconsiderable risks and hedging costs. For Germany, The Netherlands and Austria, which

were protected by the D-Mark, this brought the advantage of unmatched, low interest rates.

All this no longer applies. Interest rate convergence, as shown in Figure 1, is nearly complete.

The euro has created a nearly perfect inner-European capital and goods market and thus the

prerequisite for a free unfolding of the forces of systems competition.

         The German tax reform of 2000 can be seen as a reaction to this development since it

was explicitly justified – as was the so-called Locational Safeguarding Law of 1994 – by the

locational competition that Germany is engaged in. Germany has come in last among EU

countries in recent years in terms of economic growth. The lowering of the corporation tax

rate to only 25% is meant to bring a trend reversal and to prevent capital from leaving the

country.

         Sweden and Austria have also had extensive debates on their attractiveness as

investment locations which have led to courageous tax reduction measures. Sweden and

Austria have even eliminated the synthetic income tax by taxing interest income at a lump-

sum rate of only 30% and 25% respectively.
                                               7

         Capital reacts particularly sensitively to the taxation of interest income. After the

German government announced the introduction of a 10% source tax on interest income in

Autumn 1987, considerable amounts of capital left the country during the following six

quarters. Long-term capital imports of DM 3 billion in the year before the announcement

turned into long-term capital exports of DM 95 billion in the year after the announcement.2

The evasive reactions were so great that Germany was forced to rescind the law only four

months after its introduction. The second attempt made in 1992 to tax interest income at

source was only apparently successful since evasive reactions failed to materialise only

because the government this time did not tax interest income earned in Germany by

foreigners.

         The erosive effects were not limited to the tax on interest income. Corporation income

tax is also having a difficult time in systems competition. Since the dramatic income tax rate

reduction from 46% to 34% that the United States introduced in 1986, many countries

responded with similar tax reforms and also lowered their rates. As a result, the average

effective tax burden that the present fifteen EU countries impose on US companies that

operate in the EU fell by more than 12 percentage points between 1986 and 1992 (see Figure

2). Germany was merely a follower in implementing these reforms.

         Ireland has pursued a particularly aggressive locational-safeguarding policy by

sufficing itself with a corporation income tax rate of only 10% for an increasing number of

sectors. In 1987 Ireland extended this regulation, which was originally limited to

manufacturing and special service industries, also to financial services within the International

Financial Service Centres in Dublin and Shannon Airport. This led to considerable capital

flows to Ireland. Other governments reacted by changing legislation on external tax relations

of domestic firms which allowed the revenue authorities to tax income from borrowing

transactions.

          The Netherlands and Belgium have also followed the Irish example by granting

special conditions to the financial and service industries that locate in special areas. In
nominal terms they tax income at the normal corporate income tax rate, but they permit a very

generous way of calculating lump sum profits which effectively reduces the corporate income
tax rate to 7% (Netherlands).

Note:     The average tax burden was calculated from information from US companies on income and taxes paid
          for companies they control in Europe, i.e. firms of which they earn least 50% of the shares. The
          average tax burden is defined as the ratio of paid taxes to profits, the latter being determined by US
          accounting procedures. Changes in the valuation principles for determining profits are also reflected in
          this way in the average tax rates. The EU-15 average is calculated using GDP shares as weights.

          There is no doubt that capital is the most mobile of all production factors. It is more

mobile than labour and of course more mobile than land. For this reason it is not surprising

that taxes have shifted to other factors. The factor land is not lucrative enough because of

insufficient income mass. Accordingly, more and more taxes have been placed on the factor

labour.

        Figure 3 shows a clear time trend of the percentage of wage tax on total tax revenue in

the OECD countries, which despite the exceptions of Turkey and the UK, is evident for most

of the OECD countries. Over the past fifty years the share of wage taxes has risen from 45%

to nearly 60%. The factor labour is the victim of globalisation.

Migration in Europe

Despite this trend we must not ignore the actual mobility of the labour force in Europe. Today

the percentage of German residents born abroad is 8.9% of the total population. This is not

much less than the 9.8% of the United States, a country of traditionally large immigration.3

         Migration will increase with the eastward enlargement of the EU. No fewer than 106

million Eastern Europeans are seeking entry into the EU, and the first wave of accession will

include eight countries and about 75 million people. The wage of these people is currently

between one fifth and one tenth of that in west Germany, compared to about half in Spain and

Portugal when they joined the EU. According to estimates by the Ifo Institute between three

and four million people will migrate to Western Europe over a period of 15 years.4 Added to

this is the immigration from other parts of the world.

         The immigration from very poor countries to Western Europe could touch off

considerable competitive pressure in the labour market. A person who decides to leave his

home country to seek his fortune in the West will be guided above all by economic criteria in

his choice of countries and will react to even the slightest differences. Even though

considerable income differences are necessary to set off migration, the differential migration

between the European countries is nevertheless extremely high. The theoretical ideal of

perfect mobility is very close to being realised in this area.

         Under these circumstances, the countries of Western Europe will be forced to engage

in a warding-off competition so as not to attract too many people that the state would have to

support. Immigrants in Germany are net recipients of government benefits during their first

ten years of residence, according to a study by the Ifo Institute. Per capita and year they

receive about 2,300 euros more in terms of public goods and transfers than they pay in taxes

and fees. It is foreseeable that this condition will not continue. The Western European

countries will scrutinise their social welfare systems and try to avoid becoming welfare

magnets. A successive dismantling of the European social welfare state is the likely outcome.5

        This process will, of course, be much slower than the competition for capital. It took

fourteen years for Germany to adopt the American tax-cut cum base-broadening. The

warding-off competition among the welfare states will be much slower. It will certainly

stretch out over decades and can only be gauged in an historical perspective.

        An impression of the importance of labour-force migration on the behaviour of

countries can be seen in the US example. In America, labour force mobility has always been

very high and at the same time the system of government is decentrally organised. Under these

circumstances it was impossible to establish a European-type welfare state, and attempts that

pointed in this direction failed miserably. When New York City expanded its welfare benefits

under Mayor John Lindsay at the end of the 1960s as a means of combating poverty, it

attracted the poor from all over America. The result was rapidly mounting debt that led to near

bankruptcy in 1975, forcing a turnaround in anti-poverty policies.6




The Invisible Hand and the Selection Principle

The major trends of systems competition are obvious and can be observed empirically.

Economists also know full well what individual countries must do in the competition to attract

investment. The recommendations of the various councils of economic advisors and the

economic research institutes are quite unanimous in matters of tax policies and regulations.

This is no wonder: economists are the “managers” of their countries. They help their

respective countries to optimise their collective policy decisions. They help them survive in

systems competition.

5  Network effects have little influence on this. To be sure, wherever a network already exists, the economic
   incentives for migration decisions are no longer so important. Then competition has already occurred.
   However, the expectation of future networks that may result from current migration will induce states all the
   more to cut back their welfare benefits. Ex ante, the competition is then all the stronger. See Thum (2000).
6 During the Lindsay’s first term of office, social welfare expenses rose from 12.5% to 23% of the budget
   (Glaeser/Kahn 1999, p. 124; Shefter 1985, p. 86).
                                                     12

          What is less clear is the result that systems competition produces on the whole and

especially how this result should be assessed. Can we trust this competition as an

organisational process? Is there an Invisible Hand, as there is for private competition, that

regulates everything for the better from the viewpoint of the community of nations? Do the

Main Theorems of Welfare Economics also hold for systems competition, or is pessimism

called for? Are central government solutions needed to correct the market failures in systems

competition? Should policies in a variety of areas be harmonised to reduce competition? How

much Brussels does Europe need? These are the fascinating questions that the theory of

systems competition deals with.

          It is certainly possible to construct models of systems competition whose assumptions

in analogy to market competition are adjusted to producing a functional competition among

states.7 But it is not clear whether such models can capture the essence of systems

competition.

          The reason for doubt lies in what I once termed the Selection Principle (Sinn, 1997a,

1997b). This principle maintains that states take over those economic activities that the private

market is unable to carry out. Since the state acts as a stopgap, replacing lacking markets and

correcting the failings of existing markets, we cannot hope that the reintroduction of the

market through the backdoor of systems competition will lead to sensible allocation results. It

is more likely that the failings that led the state to act will reappear on the higher level of

competition between states.

          According to the Selection Principle, drawing analogies between competition in the

private sphere and competition between states is completely inadmissible because the states

administer the exceptions in the competitive allocation processes. Precisely because

competition functions well in the private sphere it must be feared that it will fail in the public

sphere.


7   See, for example, S. Sinn (1992), Richter (1994, pp. 223-340), Wellisch (1995) or Oates/Schwab (1988, pp.
    333-54) and Oates (2001).

Three examples of the Selection Principle

To show how the Selection Principle works in reality, three examples will be briefly

presented, without looking at the underlying, formal models.8



The erosion of the social welfare state

Among the reasons for government redistribution, the insurance motive is probably the most

important. Behind a veil of ignorance, wise constitutional fathers – or also median voters –

have agreed on the social welfare state to cover the life and career risks of their children.

Those who suffer misfortunes in life are net recipients of state resources, the more fortunate

are net payers. From an ex-ante perspective the expected utility of risk-averse citizens

increases.

         In establishing the redistribution measures, attention must be paid of course to the

behaviour changes that they induce. Ex ante, as in all insurance contracts, the efforts to reduce

the insured danger decrease, but, and this is a good thing, the willingness to take more risks in

the choice of occupation and other decisions in life is greater than would otherwise be the

case. Moreover, ex post, the incentive is lacing of acquiring more income through one’s own

efforts, which is, of course, a disadvantag.

         Assume the case that a national redistribution system is optimally designed by having

found the best possible mixture of these various advantages and disadvantages. Would this

redistribution system survive in systems competition or was it even brought into being by this

competition?

         The answer is surely negative since the free migration of net payers and net recipients

of state benefits would induce precisely the effect that was described in the previous two

sections. Every state would have an incentive to treat the net recipients a bit worse and the net



8   For the underlying models, see Sinn (2002), Chapters 3, 2 and 7, in this order.
                                                       14

payers a bit better that their neighbours do in order to ward off the latter and attract the former

and in so doing create a budget surplus.

         From the position of the individual country, given the behaviour of other countries, the

utility effect for those who are induced to migrate because of this marginal decision is a

negligible, second-order effect. However, the budget effect, as a first-order effect, is strictly

positive. On balance with the scaling back of the social welfare state, national welfare in the

sense of expected utility of the citizens increases since the budget surplus can be used to the

advantage of all. From the position of all countries, however, nothing can be gained by such

actions since no migration takes place when all act in this way. What happens is only that the

redistribution is reduced and the expected utility of the citizens declines.

         The result can also be understood by using the theory of externalities. The social

welfare state creates positive external effects for other social welfare states by means of the

international migration that it induces. It drives away the rich, increases the supply of factors

offered by them in other countries and in this way lowers their factor payments abroad. And it

attracts the poor, whereby their factor payments rise elsewhere. In this way the income

distribution in other countries becomes more even and the degree of goal performance of

social policy in these countries rises. Since the positive external effects are not taken into

consideration in national social policies, systems competition brings about an underprovision

of social policy.

         The underlying cause for this flaw in systems competition can be seen in the Selection

Principle since the protection against inequality in lifetime income that the social welfare state

offers cannot be provided by private enterprise. Private insurance contracts presuppose that

the signers are of age and can only be concluded with adults. For an adult, however, the dice

of fate have already been cast, the veil of ignorance has been lifted.9 Redistribution contracts

do not come into being on a private enterprise basis since the mobile net payers would not

participate. Adverse selection prevents the private insurance market from coming into

existence.

          The migration processes that create a failure in the competition among social welfare

states can also be interpreted as adverse selection. The migration of the successful and the

unsuccessful is a choice that takes place ex post, that is after the veil of ignorance has already

been lifted. Since the successful net payers do not participate, the social welfare state cannot

survive.

          A possible policy implication of this lies in the harmonisation of redistribution rules,

but this is not easily achievable between countries with differing average incomes. What is

better is a delayed integration of migrants in the national social system, as has been

recommended by the Advisory Council to the German Ministry of Finance or recently by the

Ifo Institute.10



Infrastructure goods and the race to the bottom

It is often maintained that there is no need to fear the erosive forces of systems competition.

There is no race to the bottom since the net payers do not orient themselves on the taxes that

they pay but on the public goods that are placed at their disposal. There is especially no need

to fear a race to the bottom in the competition to attract mobile capital since companies are

prepared to pay an appropriate price for good infrastructure. This argument is true on the

surface, but it is only half the truth.

          First of all, it would be bad enough for the social welfare state if the taxes that are paid

on the factor capital would only suffice to pay for the infrastructure made available to this

factor. They would lose their fiscal character and become pure benefit taxes, because this

would mean foregoing redistribution and insurance protection.

       Secondly, it is not even certain that the taxes on mobile capital generate enough

revenue to pay for the infrastructure. In systems competition, countries behave like competing

firms that demand marginal cost prices, or to be more precise, tax rates that reflect the

marginal congestion costs for a given infrastructure. It is not to be expected that these tax rates

will provide enough income to cover the costs of providing the infrastructure.

       The reason for this lies in the Selection Principle. When states are designed in

accordance with this principle, they offer those goods which because of sufficiently strongly

increasing returns to scale in production and use cannot be offered by the private sector, since

private competition would be ruinous and would not achieve equilibrium. For such goods, tax

rates or prices as high as the marginal congestion costs are not enough to finance the

infrastructure. A chronic deficit arises that must be covered by other means. The private

market failure that led to state intervention has renewed, problematic implications at the

higher level of competition between countries.

       When the immobile production factors are sufficiently important this does not

automatically mean that there is no equilibrium in systems competition. Also competition is

not inefficient. It is in the interest of the owners of immobile factors, which are

complementary to mobile factors, to co-finance the infrastructure used by the mobile factors.

Moreover, the individual state has the incentive of providing the right quantity and quality of

infrastructure. Nevertheless, the result for the social welfare state is still worse than if only

benefit taxes can be levied. The owners of immobile factors, which include very many infirm,

weak, or those who offer simple labour, receive no money from the rich capital owners but

subsidise these capital owners in systems competition. This is not a race to the bottom but in a

certain sense a race below the bottom.

       The policy implications of this observation are similar to those that can be derived

from the erosion of the social welfare state. In addition, locational competition can be limited

if cross-border profit flows are taxed according to the residence principle instead of the source
                                                         17

country principle. The US Internal Revenue Service with its world-wide income concept and

its regulations for taxing passive foreign income has gone quite far in this direction.

           A harmonisation of corporate income tax in the European context does not follow

from this because such a step would likely lead countries to conduct locational competition

with infrastructure goods which would lead to an oversupply of such goods. When there is

harmonisation it must also be assured that the infrastructure used by the mobile factors is

completely paid by them. This could be achieved by an extension of the EU subsidy bans to

include indirect assistance from infrastructure gifts. Given that the EU is just now considering

new proposals for a harmonisation of company taxes, this is a timely issue.



Lemon banks and bank regulation

The third and last example to be considered deals with bank regulation.11 The Asia crises, the

US Savings and Loan crisis and various bank failures have shown that regulation of the

banking sector is an important task for the state and that there are possibly problems with a

free regulatory competition. Not least as a result of these crises, the Bank for International

Settlements is currently improving its rules for bank regulation (Basel II) to promote, on this

basis, a further harmonisation of national rules.

           The purchaser of a bank bond does not receive a guaranteed redemption claim. Instead,

the likelihood of the agreed redemption depends on whether the bank has not gone bankrupt

before the repayment date, and the amount of repayment in case of bankruptcy depends on

how much capital reserves the bank has, to service their creditors even in a worst-case

scenario. Banks are not able to completely avoid bankruptcy because the companies to whom

the banks pass on the funds they received from the purchasers of bonds are also not immune

to bankruptcy. The expected redemption value is the key quality feature of a bank bond. If the

true expected value cannot be determined by the bank’s creditors because the creditors cannot


11   For the formal model underlying the analysis of this section see Sinn (2001).
                                               18

effectively monitor the bank's actions, the bank bond is a lemon good whose quality is

exposed to erosive forces similar to those that effect physical lemon goods.

          In the case of asymmetric information between a bank and its creditors there is the

danger of excessively negligent bank behaviour. The bank may have an incentive to conduct

its business with excessively low capital reserves and to finance particularly risky enterprises.

In the choice between an extended loan that has a high probability of a modest return and one

with a low probability of a high return, it can be worthwhile to choose the second alternative

even if a smaller expected rate of return is associated with it. The reason lies in what I once

called the BLOOS rule which states that you cannot get blood out of a stone.12 Since a bank

cannot lose more than its capital reserves, the acceptance of a smaller chance of success and

thus a larger risk of bankruptcy has the advantage that the expected redemption value that the

bank must give its own creditors is reduced. The expected profit of the bank can be enlarged

in a similar way as the profit of a lemon supplier can be enlarged by a quality deterioration of

the sold product.

          If all banks in a market behave this way, then the buyers of bank bonds can conclude

from observing the occasional bank failure that they are buying lemon bonds and they will

demand appropriate risk premia on top of the agreed interest rate. To this extent they are not

cheated in the final analysis and to this extent banks as a whole do not succeed in putting

themselves in a better position by increasing the risk of bank failure. On the contrary, because

they choose excessively risky and unprofitable financing projects the lessening of expected

loan repayments from these projects will be expressed in a reduction of expected bank profits.

The welfare loss that results from the lemon bonds will be borne entirely by the banks

themselves.

          It is in the interest of the banks to prevent the development of such a lemon

equilibrium by means of collectively agreed or government ordered rules on capital reserves.



12   See Sinn (1980, 1982).
                                               19

Strict bank supervision, as is carried out in Western industrial countries, solves the allocation

problem.

       Unfortunately, the Selection Principle again indicates dangers if bank supervision itself

is exposed to international competition. Assuming that bank customers are neither able to

reliably assess the risk situation of the individual bank nor the importance of national rules on

bank reserves, the national regulatory agency has an incentive to be generous in controlling

the banks under its supervision if foreigners are among the holders of bank bonds. The

loosening of the regulatory restrictions behind the backs of the creditors leads to a

redistribution from these creditors to the national banks, and the larger the percentage of

foreigners among the creditors, the larger the national welfare gain that arises. National

market failure translates into a competition of laxity of the regulatory agencies and thus to a

failure of systems competition.

       Noted economists have attributed the Asian crisis of 1997 and 1998 to an excessively

lax regulation of Asian banks, and there are many indications that systems competition

resulted in overly lax regulation. In this regard, the efforts of the Bank for International

Settlements to achieve a better de facto harmonisation of bank regulation with the Basel II

accord is a step in the right direction.



Concluding remarks

Similar examples could be added from environmental policy, health care or other areas. They

would confirm that because of the Selection Principle the more likely outcome is a failure

rather than a smooth functioning of systems competition.

       The implications for the necessity of international agreements and harmonisation

measures including the development of a new level of government in Europe are obvious and

must be taken seriously. Of course, we know all too well that market failure is not a sufficient

reason for government intervention or, for that matter, that a failure of the competition among

the European nation states is not a sufficient reason for Brussels to step in. The danger that the
                                               20

central authority will do an even poorer job than the market participants is too great. We

should be careful, however, not to throw out the baby with the bath water. The proof of failure

in systems competition is the necessary prerequisite for considering international regulations

in the first place. In this respect the Selection Principle is important for a new design of

Europe and the world. It destroys the wishful thinking that some economists, enamoured by

their firm belief in competitive processes, engage in.

       A counter-thesis to the pessimism that follows from the Selection Principle is that

systems competition is desirable because it forces inefficient countries to become more

efficient. This thesis follows the same logic as the view that private competition eliminates

inefficient companies or forces them to act efficiently. Indeed, much can be said for this thesis

under ideal market conditions. Inefficiently managed firms have high average costs and are

forced to mimic efficiently managed firms with lower costs, if they do not want to perish. The

Main Theorems of Welfare Economics probably also apply, if the managers selected by the

market process are too stupid to actively implement the conditions for a profit maximum, but

clever enough to mimic successful competitors who by chance picked the right policies.

       The problem, however, is the assumption of ideal market conditions. If such

conditions are not present, is not easy to talk about the efficiency promoting effects of

competition. Consider the example of environmental pollution to clarify the point. Without

competition, a management with a romantic, nature-loving orientation could survive but under

competition it has no chance. Businesses that maximise their profits and minimise their

operating costs will prevail, and these are the environmental polluters.

       The Selection Principle states that ideal market conditions tend to exist in private

competition but not in competition between states, and this raises doubts as to the efficiency

of systems competition even if national governments are too ignorant to actively pursue a

policy of national welfare maximisation. For a similar reason as in the case of private firms,

competition will force even the badly functioning governments to mimic their successful

neighbours which managed to find better policy mixes with regard to the mobile factors of
                                               21

production, but, as explained, such policy mixes need not be better from an international

welfare perspective. In the above-mentioned examples a maximum of nation state efficiency

was assumed. The behaviour of individual countries served the goal of maximising national

welfare. Despite, or better, because of the perfect achievement of this goal, systems

competition turned out to be defective. As correct as the thesis that systems competition forces

the nation state to seek national efficiency is, it does not follow from this that systems

competition itself is efficient.

        The Selection Principle is in accord with the positive view of the state that stems from

traditional public sector economics as represented by Schäffle (1880), Sax (1887), Wagner

(1876), Wicksell (1901), Lindahl (1939), Musgrave (1959), Timm (1961) and others. For this

tradition the modern state is a necessary accompanying feature of industrialisation and

urbanisation touched off by the Industrial Revolution. It arose above all to correct the

deplorable conditions that were characteristic of the late nineteenth century. Cities choked in

filth, the pitiable living conditions of the proletariat, poverty among the elderly, catastrophic

hygienic conditions, and many other evils gave rise to a general need for government

intervention in the market process. The modern European state is not a ruling instrument of

feudal powers. Despite all its weakness and problems, it must be seen as an instrument for the

fulfilment of collective tasks that cannot be accomplished by the private market. It is not the

result of an error of history but its logical consequence. In systems competition, however, its

chances are no longer all too great.

        The historical selection of government tasks came about in part by competitive

processes. But this was not a systems competition forced by the international mobility of

production factors, but the innovation and imitation competition described at the outset, which

among other things was guided by the objective of economic, cultural and military dominance

and which took place within largely sealed borders. Such competition follows completely

different laws than competition induced by the mobility of production factors. Indeed, in the

light of the Selection Principle it is conceivable, or even likely, that the new systems
                                              22

competition will destroy the results of the old if we do not succeed in drastically limiting its

scope.
