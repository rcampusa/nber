Who Uses the Roth 401(k), and How Do They Use It?

                                           ABSTRACT

Using administrative data from twelve companies that added a Roth 401(k) option between 2006 and
2010, we describe the characteristics of Roth contributions. Approximately one year after the Roth
is introduced, 9% of 401(k) participants have positive Roth balances. Roth participation is more than
twice as high among 401(k) participants who were hired after the Roth introduction than among 401(k)
participants who were hired before the Roth introduction. In essence, once an employee joins a 401(k)
she becomes passive/inattentive, thereby reducing the likelihood of reacting to the introduction of
a new Roth option. Conditional on contributing to the Roth, 66% of employee contributions go to
the Roth, and half of employees contribute to both the Roth and another 401(k) account, consistent
with a tax diversification motive. Roth usage is decreasing in age, less likely among women, and only
weakly correlated with salary and tenure once we control for other employee characteristics.

       The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 allowed plan
sponsors to add a Roth 401(k) option to defined contribution savings plans starting on
January 1, 2006. Like contributions to a Roth IRA, employee contributions to a Roth
401(k) or 403(b) are not deductible from current taxable income, but withdrawals of
principal, interest, and capital gains in retirement are tax-free. The Plan Sponsor Council
of America (2012) reports that 49% of 401(k) plans offered a Roth option in 2011.
       In this paper, we describe the characteristics of employees who utilize the Roth
401(k). We also describe how employees use the Roth 401(k). Roth contributions are
advantageous to households whose current marginal tax rate is lower than their marginal
tax rate in retirement. If households understand this fact, then we would expect younger
employees to be more likely to allocate contributions to the Roth. Employees with
transitorily low income would also be expected to utilize the Roth 401(k). If households
are uncertain about whether their marginal tax rate will be higher or lower in retirement,
they may wish to hedge this risk by contributing to both Roth and before-tax accounts in
their 401(k).
       We use administrative 401(k) plan data from twelve companies that introduced a
Roth 401(k) option between 2006 and 2010. We find that approximately one year after
the Roth has been introduced, 8.6% of all 401(k) participants have a positive balance in
their Roth account. Roth balances make up only 1.8% of total 401(k) balances at these
companies on average, a small proportion that partially reflects the short amount of time
Roth contributions have been possible relative to other contributions. Looking at flows
instead of stocks, Roth contributions constitute 5.4% of employee contributions. Roth
contributions are much more significant for those who choose to make them. Conditional
on having a positive Roth contribution rate, 65.8% of employee contributions go to the
Roth. Consistent with the existence of a tax diversification motive, 54.8% of employees
who contribute to the Roth also contribute to another 401(k) account.
       Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988), Choi et al. (2002, 2004), and Beshears et al.
(2008) document that many employees are passive in their retirement savings accounts.
The low usage of the Roth 401(k) may reflect an active preference against the Roth, but it
can also be partially explained if employees who enrolled in the 401(k) when the Roth
was unavailable fail to update their 401(k) elections in response to the introduction of the



                                             2
Roth. Supporting the importance of the passivity channel, we find that 19.0% of 401(k)
participants who were hired after the Roth’s introduction have a positive balance in the
Roth approximately one year after its introduction. This percentage is much higher than
the 7.9% of 401(k) participants hired before the Roth’s introduction who have a positive
balance in the Roth.
       Turning to the demographic covariates of Roth usage within the 401(k)
participant population, we find that those with positive Roth balances are younger and
more likely to be male. Higher-salary workers are less likely to have a positive Roth
balance among 401(k) participants who are post-Roth hires, but more likely among
401(k) participants who are pre-Roth hires. The negative correlation among post-Roth
hires is consistent with the Roth being more attractive to workers in temporarily low
current tax brackets. However, once age is controlled for, salary has at best a weak
association with Roth usage in this group. The positive correlation among pre-Roth hires
may be explained by a negative correlation between income and passivity, which would
cause higher income employees to be more likely to update their 401(k) elections in
response to the Roth’s introduction. There is likely also a positive correlation between
income and financial literacy, including knowledge of the rules that govern the Roth
401(k). At a given point in calendar time, those with higher tenure at the company are
less likely to use the Roth among pre-Roth hires, although the association is small once
other variables are controlled for.
       Conditional on the employee having a positive 401(k) contribution rate, the Roth
contribution rate as a fraction of income is initially declining with age but rises again
starting in middle age. Men contribute more to the Roth than women, and participants
with higher tenure contribute less. Among pre-Roth hires, higher salaries are associated
with a small increase in the Roth contribution rate. The demographic patterns are similar
for the Roth contribution rate as a fraction of the total employee contribution rate (before-
tax plus after-tax plus Roth). Conditional on contributing to the Roth, being middle-aged
and female are associated with also contributing to another account in the 401(k). Among
pre-Roth hires, low salary and high tenure are associated with mixing contributions.
       The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section I, we summarize some
of the institutional rules of the Roth 401(k). Section II describes our data. Section III



                                              3
discusses summary statistics on how employees use the Roth 401(k) and the
characteristics of Roth users. Section IV investigates the correlates of Roth usage in a
multivariate regression framework. Section V concludes.


I. The rules and economics of the Roth 401(k)
       We begin by describing the tax treatment of three different types of 401(k)
contributions: Roth contributions, before-tax contributions, and after-tax contributions.
Roth contributions to a 401(k) are not deductible from current-year taxable income, but
principal, interest, and capital gains may be withdrawn tax-free if the withdrawal is
considered “qualified” because (i) the account has been held for at least five years and (ii)
the account owner is either older than 59½, disabled, or deceased. Therefore, the
marginal dollar of pre-tax income can purchase (1 – τ0)(1 + r) of future consumption if a
Roth account is used as the savings vehicle and the balance is accessed through a
qualified withdrawal, where τ0 is the household’s marginal ordinary income tax rate plus
the marginal reduction in means-tested benefits (such as the Earned Income Tax Credit)
due to the additional dollar of taxable income in the year of the contribution, and r is the
return earned on the contribution between the contribution and withdrawal dates. Put
another way, each dollar contributed to a Roth account buys 1 + r of future consumption.
For non-qualified withdrawals, the withdrawn principal is not taxed, but the interest and
capital gains are subject to ordinary income tax and may reduce means-tested benefits
and increase taxation of Social Security benefits received in the year of the withdrawal. If
the account owner is younger than 59½, the withdrawn earnings are also assessed a 10%
tax penalty under most circumstances.
       In contrast, before-tax 401(k) contributions are deductible from current-year
income, but the principal, interest, and capital gains are taxed at the ordinary income tax
rate upon withdrawal. Hence, the marginal dollar of pre-tax income buys (1 + r)(1 – τ1) of
future consumption if it is contributed to a before-tax account, where τ1 is the household’s
marginal ordinary income tax rate in the year of the withdrawal plus an adjustment if the
withdrawal generates a marginal increase in taxation of Social Security benefits or a
reduction in means-tested benefits. An additional 10% tax penalty applies to both the
principal and earnings withdrawn if the account owner is younger than 59½.



                                              4
        After-tax 401(k) contributions are not deductible from current taxable income. At
withdrawal, principal is not taxed but interest and capital gains are taxed at the ordinary
income tax rate, and this interest and capital gains income may affect means-tested
benefits and taxation of Social Security benefits. The marginal dollar of pre-tax income
can buy (1 – τ0)[1 + (1 – τ1)r] of future consumption if an after-tax 401(k) account is used
as the savings vehicle. Equivalently, each dollar contributed to an after-tax account buys
1 + (1 – τ1)r of future consumption. An additional 10% tax penalty applies to earnings
that are withdrawn by account owners younger than 59½.
        If there are no employer matching contributions in the 401(k) and withdrawals
occur late enough to be considered qualified by the Roth criteria, then saving the next
pretax dollar in the Roth is a better financial deal than saving it before-tax if and only if
τ0 < τ1. In a progressive tax system whose rules stay fixed over time, τ1 will typically be
less than τ0 because non-401(k) income in retirement will typically be lower than current
income, causing most before-tax 401(k) withdrawal dollars to be taxed at a lower rate
than the last dollar of income today. McQuarrie (2008) uses this observation to argue that
the Roth 401(k) is inferior to a before-tax 401(k) for many households whose current
income pushes them above the lowest marginal tax bracket.1
        The relative appeal of the Roth increases with the probability of withdrawal
before age 59½, since Roth principal is exempt from the 10% early withdrawal penalty
but before-tax principal is not. Roth contributions are always a better deal than after-tax
contributions if the money is held in the 401(k) long enough to meet the Roth qualifying
withdrawal criteria and investment earnings are positive. However, after-tax
contributions are sometimes more liquid before age 59½, since some 401(k) plans allow
younger employees to make withdrawals from after-tax balances while still employed by
the company without demonstrating financial hardship.
        Although employers can structure their savings plans to allow Roth, before-tax,
and after-tax employee contributions, employer matching contributions must be made
using before-tax dollars, meaning that the entire principal and earnings of the match
balance are subject to ordinary income tax upon withdrawal. A company might not match


1
 McQuarrie (2008) also considers how tax laws may change in his analysis. Burman, Gale, and Weiner
(1998) find that between 1980 and 1995, changes in tax laws had a much larger effect on individuals’


                                                   5
certain types of employee contributions (e.g., after-tax contributions), but among the
types of contributions it does match, the match formula typically does not vary by the
type of contribution. This invariance reduces the attractiveness of Roth and after-tax
contributions if the employee’s marginal 401(k) contribution dollar is being matched. To
see this, let m be the rate at which employee contributions are matched. The marginal
pre-tax dollar can earn m match dollars if it is saved using a before-tax account, but only
(1 – τ0)m match dollars if it is saved using a Roth or after-tax account (since τ0 dollars
must be paid in taxes and given up in benefits, thereby preventing the entire dollar from
being contributed to the savings plan). The condition under which employees who have
no probability of making a non-qualified withdrawal are better off contributing to the
Roth rather than the before-tax account is now more restrictive; with an employer match,
the Roth is a better financial deal than contributing before-tax if and only if
                               (1 – τ0)[1 + m(1 – τ1)] > (1 – τ1)(1 + m).                     (1)
       Another factor affecting the attractiveness of Roth versus regular before-tax
contributions is whether employees are constrained by the contribution limits on 401(k)
plans. Internal Revenue Service regulations stipulate that the combined before-tax plus
Roth contributions in a calendar year cannot exceed a certain limit that is adjusted each
year. For people younger than 50, this limit was $14,000 in 2005 (the last year before
Roth contributions were allowed); it has been raised several times since then and stands
at $17,500 in 2013. The dollar values for each year in the interim are listed in the matrix
below. People age 50 and older are allowed an additional “catch-up” contribution; this
additional amount was $4,000 in 2005 and has since been increased to its 2013 level of
$5,500. In addition to the limits on employee contributions, there is a limit on the
combined employer plus employee contribution to 401(k) accounts. This aggregate limit
was set at $42,000 in 2005 and has since been raised to $51,000 in 2013 for people under
the age of 50. Because a dollar of Roth balances buys (weakly) more retirement
consumption than a dollar of before-tax balances, people who are constrained by the
before-tax plus Roth contribution ceiling could find it advantageous to make Roth
contributions instead of before-tax contributions in order to extend the 401(k) tax shelter
over more effective dollars.

II. Data description
       To analyze the utilization of Roth accounts, we use 401(k) administrative data
from Aon Hewitt, a firm with a large U.S. benefits administration and consulting
business. We selected twelve companies that introduced a Roth option to their 401(k)
plan between 2006 and 2010. The data are repeated cross-sectional snapshots of all
employees at each calendar-year-end. Each snapshot contains individual-level data on
every employee’s current plan participation status, plan enrollment date, monthly
contribution rates, plan balances, birth date, hire date, salary (for nine of the twelve
companies), and gender. We restrict our sample to employees between the ages of 20 and
69.
       Table 1 shows the characteristics of each company as of year-end 2010. In order
to preserve these companies’ anonymity, we refer to each company by the letters A
through L and only disclose approximate employee counts. The companies are all large,
ranging from approximately 10,000 employees to 100,000 employees. Eight of the twelve
companies are in the financial services industry, and average salaries exceed $100,000 for
Companies A, E, F, and I. Hence, the employees at these firms are likely to be more
financially sophisticated than the typical U.S. employee. Average age ranges from 35 to
48 years; average tenure at the company ranges from five years to sixteen years; and male
percentage ranges from 33% to 76%.
       Table 2 summarizes the features of the 401(k) plan at each company as of 2010.
Five companies introduced the Roth option in 2006, one in 2007, three in 2008, one in
2009, and two in 2010. Five companies automatically enroll their employees in the


                                              7
401(k) at before-tax contribution rates of between 2% and 6% of income. The automatic
enrollment companies have an average participation rate of 88%, which is higher than the
average participation rate of 77% among the companies that have opt-in enrollment
schemes. Nine companies match employee contributions up to a threshold between 3%
and 8% of income at rates between 25% and 133%. The maximum percent of a paycheck
that can be contributed to the 401(k) ranges from 20% to 100%. These maximums are
subject to IRS restrictions described earlier on the total dollars that can be contributed
within a calendar year.


III. Summary statistics on Roth usage and Roth users
       In this section, we present basic summary statistics on how employees use the
Roth 401(k) and the characteristics of employees who use the Roth. We report these
statistics for each company as of the end of the first calendar year in which the Roth
401(k) was available for at least eleven months. Thus, for the nine companies that
introduced the Roth in a January, the numbers in Table 3 reflect usage exactly twelve
months after Roth introduction. For Company E, which introduced the Roth on February
1, 2006, the numbers come from the eleventh month after Roth introduction. For
Companies B (which introduced the Roth on September 1, 2006) and L (which
introduced the Roth on July 1, 2010), we report numbers from sixteen months and
eighteen months, respectively, after Roth introduction.
       The first column of Table 3 shows that the Roth is used by only a small minority
of 401(k) participants. Only between 3.9% and 16.0% of 401(k) participants have a
positive balance in the Roth; averaging across the sample (weighting each company by its
401(k) participants), 8.6% of participants have used the Roth. The sample-wide average
is affected by the five companies that automatically enroll their employees with default
contribution elections that allocate nothing to the Roth (and everything to the before-tax
account). However, if we restrict the sample to companies without automatic enrollment,
the fraction of participants with positive Roth balances rises only to 11.5%. Plan Sponsor
Council of America (2012) reports that a higher proportion of their sample (17.4%)
contributes to the Roth, but this number is not directly comparable to ours. Their sample
comes entirely from 2011, whereas our sample comes from years ranging between 2006



                                              8
and 2011. Their sample includes companies that have offered a Roth option for many
years, whereas we capture the state of Roth participation approximately one year after the
Roth’s introduction. Nevertheless, our sample may have a lower inherent propensity to
contribute to the Roth than the PSCA sample. Aon Hewitt (2012) reports that during
2011, 8.1% of 401(k) participants in the companies in their database with a Roth option
contributed to the Roth, which is similar to the 8.6% figure we calculate for the fraction
that have positive Roth balances.
        The fraction of employee contribution balances held in the Roth is considerably
lower than the fraction of employees with positive Roth balances, ranging from 0.4% to
6.5%. The average is 2.4% among all companies, and 4.3% among companies without
automatic enrollment. Roth balances as a percent of total 401(k) balances, which also
include balances from the employer match and profit-sharing contributions, are even
lower, averaging 1.8% across all companies and 3.4% among companies without
automatic enrollment. The small size of Roth balances partially reflects the fact that the
numbers in Table 3 are calculated shortly after Roth introduction (eleven to eighteen
months). Examining just contribution flows, a somewhat larger fraction of employee
contributions during the last pay period of the calendar year is going to the Roth: 5.4% on
average across all companies (8.5% excluding automatic enrollment companies), with
individual companies ranging from 2.0% to 12.2%.
        Although Roth usage is relatively rare, conditional on being used, Roth
contributions constitute the majority of an employee’s contributions. On average, Roth
contributors at year-end are putting 65.8% of their employee contributions in the Roth
account. At the individual company level, this conditional average is no lower than
53.8%, and it is as high as 99.9% at Company E, which does not allow employees to
contribute to both the Roth account and the before-tax account.2
        Recall that employer matches are required to be made in before-tax dollars, so any
Roth contributor at a company with a match is necessarily engaging in some tax
diversification. If employees are unaware that their match is in before-tax dollars, this tax
diversification is unwitting. However, a majority of Roth users (54.8%) are actively


2
 There is only one person in our Company E data who anomalously has both a positive before-tax
contribution rate and a positive Roth contribution rate.


                                                  9
engaging in tax diversification by simultaneously making employee contributions to both
the Roth and another 401(k) account. This average is diminished by Company E, which
does not allow tax diversification of employee contributions and also does not have a
match. Much of the diversification we observe is not consistent with employees
following a naïve 50-50 rule; conditional on having a positive Roth contribution rate,
only 15.0% has a Roth contribution rate that is equal to the before-tax contribution rate
(not shown in tables), which is far below the 54.8% engaging in active tax
diversification.3
         Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988), Choi et al. (2002, 2004), and Beshears et al.
(2008) document that many employees are passive in their retirement savings accounts.
Therefore, the low usage of the Roth may partially reflect a sluggish response to its
introduction rather than an active preference against the Roth. To explore the role of
inertia, we examine how Roth participation differs between 401(k) participants who were
hired before Roth introduction and participants who were hired after Roth introduction.
Inertia can be generated both by the (possibly time-inconsistent) desire to delay incurring
action costs (Carroll et al., 2009) and inattention (Cadena and Schoar, 2011; Choi et al.,
2012). Attention to 401(k) plan features is likely to be especially high at the point
employees join the company. Therefore, employees who were hired after Roth
introduction are more likely to be aware of the Roth’s presence than employees who were
hired before the Roth was an option in the plan. At companies without automatic
enrollment, the marginal action cost to contribute to the Roth conditional on being a
401(k) participant is also lower for post-Roth hires than for pre-Roth hires. This is
because for a 401(k) participant hired after Roth adoption, the Roth option can be chosen
while the employee is actively enrolling and has already paid the cost of finding the
human resources website or phone number, his password, etc. For a 401(k) participant
hired before Roth introduction who enrolled before the Roth was available, the marginal
cost of contributing to the Roth includes the cost of regaining access to his 401(k)
elections through a website or phone number.

  The fraction that has a Roth contribution rate equal to the sum of the before-tax and after-tax contribution
rates, conditional on having a positive Roth contribution rate, is 13.6%.


                                                     10
       Figure 1 plots the fraction of 401(k) participants with a positive Roth balance at
the end of the first calendar year in which the Roth 401(k) was available for at least
eleven months. The horizontal axis is the participant’s hire month relative to the Roth
introduction month. In both companies with and without automatic enrollment, Roth
usage is lower among participants who are pre-Roth hires than participants who are post-
Roth hires. Higher Roth usage begins with participants hired in the month prior to Roth
introduction, perhaps reflecting when the 401(k) plan literature was revised to show the
Roth option. The increase in Roth usage is about 8 percentage points in companies
without automatic enrollment and 5 percentage points in companies with automatic
enrollment.
       Tables 4 and 5 expand the figure’s sample to include all pre- or post-Roth hires,
not just those hired in a narrow window around Roth introduction. Table 4 shows that
among 401(k) participants who were hired after the Roth’s introduction, 19.0% have a
positive balance in the Roth, 13.5% of employee contribution balances and 11.4% of total
401(k) balances are held in the Roth, and 14.3% of employee contribution flows are
going to the Roth at year-end. These numbers are much higher than the corresponding
numbers in Table 5 for 401(k) participants who were hired before the Roth: 7.9% have a
positive Roth balance, 1.7% of employee contribution balances and 1.1% of total 401(k)
balances are held in the Roth, and 4.7% of employee contribution flows are going to the
Roth at year-end.
       Conditional on using the Roth, post-Roth hires allocate a greater fraction of their
contributions (75.8%) to the Roth than pre-Roth hires (63.9%). This gap narrows
considerably when we exclude companies with automatic enrollment from the average;
conditional on using the Roth, post-Roth hires in this subsample make 77.4% of their
contributions to the Roth, versus 72.8% for pre-Roth hires. Among all of the firms in our
study, post-Roth hires are less likely than pre-Roth hires to mix their Roth contributions
with other contributions—41.4% versus 57.3%. This difference is smaller when we study
only companies without automatic enrollment—39.6% versus 46.5%.
       In light of the differences in Roth usage between pre- and post-Roth hires, our
analysis going forward will analyze these two populations separately.




                                             11
       Table 6 shows the average age, average salary, and gender composition of 401(k)
participants among post-Roth hires who do and do not have positive Roth balances.
Relative to non-Roth users, Roth users are on average younger by 3.4 years and have a
salary that is $11,500 lower, but gender composition is similar across the two groups.
Excluding companies with automatic enrollment does not qualitatively change the results
of these comparisons. Since Roth contributions are advantageous for households whose
current marginal tax rate is lower than their marginal tax rate in retirement, the finding
that younger, lower-income households are more likely to contribute to the Roth could
indicate that households are responding in the correct direction to the tax incentives
created by the Roth. The young are more likely to have higher income in retirement than
they do currently, and lower-income individuals are more likely to be among the 47% of
tax units that have no current income tax liability (Williams, 2009), so their marginal tax
rate in retirement is more likely to be weakly greater than it is today.
       The picture changes somewhat for 401(k) participants among pre-Roth hires
(Table 7). Roth users are still younger than non-Roth users, but Roth users have a higher
average income and are more likely to be male. Roth users also have lower average
tenure at the company. Restricting the sample to companies without automatic enrollment
causes the salary relationship to flip sign, however, so that Roth users have a lower salary
than non-Roth users, as in the post-Roth hire population.
       The instability of the salary effect is somewhat surprising, but the patterns can be
rationalized. In principle, the Roth should appeal to tax payers with temporarily low
income, not permanently low income. If our income variable is highly correlated with
permanent income, we should not expect to see a robust relationship between Roth usage
and income. In fact, there are even countervailing effects. Workers with high observed
income are likely to be more financially literate, leading them to use the Roth account
with greater frequency, since relatively literate households are more likely to know about
and understand the Roth accounts and to act upon preferences to contribute to a Roth.


IV. Regression analysis of correlates of Roth usage
       In this section, we analyze the correlates of Roth usage in a multivariate
regression framework. The dependent variables vary, but all of them are measured as of



                                             12
the end of the first calendar year in which the Roth was available for at least eleven
months. The explanatory variables are measured as of the same date and do not change
across regressions: age in excess of 20 years, age in excess of 20 years squared, a male
dummy, log salary (when available), and log tenure. The two age terms are often divided
by 100 or 10,000 so that more significant digits appear in the table. The top rows of the
tables show results for regressions that are run separately by company, but the last two
rows show coefficients from regressions that pool either all companies with complete
data on employee characteristics, or all companies with complete data on employee
characteristics that do not have automatic enrollment. Regressions that contain more than
one company also control for company dummies. Our discussion will mostly focus on the
pooled company regressions with the most comprehensive set of companies.
       Table 8 shows coefficients from regressing a dummy for having positive Roth
balances on the control variables. Among both post- and pre-Roth hires, older 401(k)
participants are less likely to use the Roth. The second derivative with respect to age is
positive, but Roth usage with respect to age does not reach its minimum until age 52
among post-Roth hires and age 59 among pre-Roth hires, when the probability of Roth
usage is 18.2 percentage points and 12.9 percentage points lower, respectively, than for
20 year olds. Men are 2 to 3 percentage points more likely to use the Roth. Salary has at
best a weak relationship with Roth usage. There is no significant salary relationship
among post-Roth hires, indicating that the negative correlation between Roth usage and
salary in Table 6 is driven by Roth users being younger than non-Roth users. In
companies without automatic enrollment, the salary coefficient is in fact negative and
significant, although small in magnitude—a 10% increase in salary decreases the
probability of Roth usage by only 0.1 percentage points. The salary coefficient is
significantly positive but small in magnitude for pre-Roth hires—a 10% increase in salary
increases the probability of Roth usage by 0.1 percentage points. Unlike for the univariate
comparison of means in Table 7, the positive pre-Roth hire relationship with salary in the
regression holds even when the sample excludes automatic enrollment companies.
Tenure has no correlation with Roth usage in the post-Roth hire cohort, and a significant
but small negative correlation with Roth usage in the pre-Roth hire cohort. In the latter




                                             13
group, a 10% increase in tenure decreases the probability of Roth usage by 0.1 percentage
points.
          In Table 9, we examine the demographic correlates of the Roth contribution rate
as a fraction of income, conditional on having a positive total 401(k) balance. Roth
contributions initially fall with age before rising. Among post-Roth hires, the Roth
contribution rate falls by 1.5% of income from age 20 to 45 and then rises. At age 69, the
Roth contribution rate is only 0.12% of income lower than at age 20. Among pre-Roth
hires, the Roth contribution rate falls by 1.0% of income from age 20 to 53 and then rises,
but at age 69, the Roth contribution rate is still 0.8% of income lower than at age 20. Men
contribute 0.5% of income more than women to the Roth in the post-Roth hire cohort,
and 0.2% of income more than women in the pre-Roth hire cohort. Salary is uncorrelated
with the Roth contribution rate among post-Roth hires, but is positively correlated with
the Roth contribution rate among pre-Roth hires. In the latter group, a 10% increase in
salary is associated with a 0.03% of income increase in the Roth contribution rate. Tenure
is negatively correlated with the Roth contribution rate; a 10% increase in tenure is
associated with a 0.02% of income decrease in the Roth contribution rate among post-
Roth hires and a 0.002% of income decrease among pre-Roth hires.
          The Roth contribution rate reflects both the desired overall savings rate in the
401(k) and the desired fraction of 401(k) balances in the Roth. In Table 10, we isolate the
latter by using as the dependent variable the Roth contribution rate as a fraction of the
total employee contribution rate (i.e. the before-tax plus after-tax plus Roth contribution
rate). Among post-Roth hires, the fraction is initially decreasing with age but bottoms out
at age 48, when participants allocate 18.8 percentage points less to the Roth than 20 year
olds. At age 69, participants allocate 9.0 percentage points less to the Roth than 20 year
olds. For pre-Roth hires, the fraction also decreases with age until 54, when participants
allocate 10.3 percentage points less to the Roth. Men allocate 3.0 percentage points more
to the Roth if hired after Roth introduction and 1.7 percentage points more if hired before
Roth introduction. Salary has a minor effect, being insignificant for post-Roth hires
(unless automatic enrollment companies are excluded, in which case a 10% increase in
salary is associated with a 0.1 percentage point decrease in the Roth fraction) and a
significant but economically small effect among pre-Roth hires, where a 10% increase in



                                               14
salary increases the Roth fraction by 0.09 percentage points. Higher tenure decreases the
Roth fraction for both post-Roth hires (0.1 percentage points per 10% increase in tenure)
and pre-Roth hires (0.06 percentage points per 10% increase in tenure).
        Because matching contributions are required to be in before-tax dollars, the
fraction of employee contributions going to the Roth is greater than the fraction of total
401(k) contributions going to the Roth in companies that match contributions. However,
we find in untabulated results that the demographic patterns do not change materially
when we use the fraction of total 401(k) contributions going to Roth as our dependent
variable instead of the fraction of employee contributions going to the Roth.
        Finally, in Table 11, we examine the demographic correlates of having a positive
non-Roth employee contribution rate conditional on having a positive Roth contribution
rate, which is a sign of a deliberate tax diversification strategy. Among post-Roth hires,
contributing to both accounts increases with age until age 43, when employees are 42.1
percentage points more likely than 20 year olds to do so, and then decreases to the point
where at age 69, employees are 8.5 percentage points less likely to contribute to both
accounts than 20 year olds. Contributing to both accounts is 5 percentage points less
likely for males, but there is no relationship with salary or tenure. Among pre-Roth hires,
contributing to both accounts also increases with age until age 47, when employees are
32.1 percentage points more likely to do so than 20 year olds, but even 69 year olds are
10.3 percentage points more likely to contribute to both accounts than 20 year olds. As
with post-Roth hires, pre-Roth men are 6 percentage points less likely to contribute to
both accounts, but unlike post-Roth hires, pre-Roth employees with low salaries and high
tenure are more likely to contribute to both, although the effect sizes are economically
small and salary is not significant when automatic enrollment companies are excluded.


V. Conclusion
        Roth 401(k) usage is relatively uncommon in our sample of firms; approximately
one year after the Roth is introduced, only 8.6% of 401(k) participants have positive Roth
balances. But among those who do contribute to the Roth, Roth contributions constitute a
large fraction of their total contributions. The young are more likely to use the Roth and
to allocate a larger fraction of their contributions to it. This correlation could be



                                              15
consistent with a rational response to the Roth’s tax incentives, since Roth contributions
are advantageous to those whose current marginal tax rate is lower than the marginal tax
rate at which those contributions will later be withdrawn.
        Roth participation is more than twice as high among 401(k) participants who were
hired after the Roth introduction relative to 401(k) participants who were hired before the
Roth introduction. Because of passivity or inattention, 401(k) participants do not react
quickly to the Roth option when it is introduced after they have already joined the 401(k)
plan.

           Table 8. Demographic correlates of having positive Roth balance
Each row of this table reports coefficients from a separate ordinary least-squares
regression where the dependent variable is a dummy for having a positive Roth balance at
the end of the first calendar year in which Roth was available for at least eleven months.
We exclude people with zero 401(k) balances. The regressions include a constant.
Regressions with multiple companies in them also control for company dummies.
Standard errors are in parentheses. To preserve the anonymity of the companies, sample
sizes are not listed in Panel B.

               Table 9. Demographic correlates of Roth contribution rate
Each row of this table reports coefficients from a separate ordinary least-squares regression where
the dependent variable is the Roth contribution rate at the end of the first calendar year in which
Roth was available for at least eleven months. A 1% contribution rate corresponds to a dependent
variable value of 1, not 0.01. We exclude people with zero 401(k) balances. The regressions
include a constant. Regressions with multiple companies in them also control for company
dummies. Standard errors are in parentheses. To preserve the anonymity of the companies,
sample sizes are not listed in Panel B.

      Table 11. Demographic correlates of having a positive non-Roth employee
           contribution conditional on having a positive Roth contribution
Each row of this table reports coefficients from a separate ordinary least-squares regression where
the dependent variable is a dummy for having both positive Roth and positive non-Roth employee
contribution rates at the end of the first calendar year in which Roth was available for at least
eleven months. The sample is restricted to employees who have a positive Roth contribution rate
on this date. The regressions include a constant. Regressions with multiple companies in them
also control for company dummies. Standard errors are in parentheses. To preserve the anonymity
of the companies, sample sizes are not listed in Panel B.
