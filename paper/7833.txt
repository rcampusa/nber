(Supplement) The Greatest Decade: The Honor Roll of Inventions, 1876-86
"The invention of the semiconductor transistor set in motion a technological revolution that is arguably even
more impressive and pervasive than that of the Great Industrial Revolution of the last century." -- Flamm
(1997, p. 1)

"The chip has transformed us at least as pervasively as the internal-combustion engine or electric motor" --
Fortune magazine, June 8, 1998, pp. 86-87.


         The miracle of U. S. economic performance in the late 1990s was a source of pride at home,

of envy abroad, and of puzzlement among economists and policymakers.1 The Federal Reserve

presided over rates of output growth believed only a few years earlier to be unachievable even for a

few quarters, much less over the four glowing years 1996-99. As the unemployment rate inched ever

lower, the Fed reacted with benign neglect, so that early in the year 2000 short-term interest rates

were no higher than they had been five years earlier and long-term interest rates were considerably

lower.

         Underneath it all lay the apparent demise, whether temporary or permanent, of two

relationships that had restrained economic performance for the 25 years prior to 1996, Phillips' curve

and Solow's paradox. Whatever had prevented "core" inflation rates from accelerating in the face of

steadily falling unemployment — whether a set of beneficial shocks or a flattening of the Phillips

curve itself — there was no doubt that low inflation had allowed the Fed to keep a set of loose reins

on the galloping economic racehorse.2 And economists struggling to explain Solow's paradox — that

"we can see the computer age everywhere except in the productivity statistics" — looked up from


         1. Lawrence Summers spoke for many economists and policymakers recently when he characterized this
widespread puzzlement as "paradigm uncertainty." See Business Week, "The Economy: A Higher Safe Speed Limit,"
April 10, 2000, p. 242.

          2. Accessible articles on the sources of low inflation and the debate about shifts in the inflation-unemployment
relationship include Gordon (1997, 1998) and Stock's discussion of the latter paper, Stock and Watson (1997), and
Katz and Krueger (1999). The mirror image of the 1970s, when everything went wrong, and the 1990s, when
everything went right, suggests that adverse supply shocks shifted the Phillips curve in an unfavorable direction in the
earlier decade and in the opposite favorable direction in the latter decade (see Gordon, 2000a, pp. 263-269).
                                                                                 Industrial Revolution, Page 2



their word processors to discover that, before they had satisfactorily explained it, the paradox had

been rendered obsolete both by data revisions and by the exploding rates of productivity growth

registered in 1998 and 1999.3 Suddenly the economy was awash not only in computers, but also in

productivity growth, and in turn the rapid productivity growth helped to explain how inflation could

remain low despite some evidence of accelerating wage rates.4

         Since computer prices have been declining at rapid rates for the last fifty years, the now-

standard phrase "New Economy" applied to the period since 1995 must mean something more than

declining computer prices and exponential growth in computer capabilities. We shall take the phrase

to encompass a mid-1990s acceleration in the rate of price decline in computer hardware, software,

and telephone services, the corollary of an acceleration of the exponential growth rate of computer

power and telecommunications capability, and the wildfire speed of development of the Internet. As

shorthand, we shall take the New Economy to be synonomous with an acceleration in rate of

technical advance in Information Technology, commonly abbreviated IT. This interpretation means

that we do not include in the New Economy the contributions made by IT prior to 1995 at the

previous slower rate of technical advance, and hence the recent literature on the contributions of IT

to business profits and productivity prior to 1995 is not directly relevant here.5

         A widespread consensus has emerged that the New Economy represents a fundamental



         3. Solow's first published recognition that the paradox is obsolete appears in Uchitelle (2000).

          4. The Economic Report of the President, February 2000, pp. 90-91, presents a particularly insightful analysis
of the mechanism by which an unexpected acceleration of productivity growth can, for a substantial period, reduce the
inflation rate associated with any given unemployment rate.

         5. See especially Brynjolfsson (1996), Brynjolfsson and Hitt (1996), and Brynjolfsson, Hitt, and Yang (2000).

transformation, simultaneously wiping out in one fell swoop inflation, the budget deficit, the 1972-95

productivity slowdown, and the business cycle.6 The acceleration in productivity growth dates from

the end of 1995, and Business Week showed remarkable prescience at that time in a cover banner

titled "Productivity to the Rescue" and more recently declared “At least for now, even formerly

skeptical forecasters and economists have acknowledged the reality of the productivity revolution.”7

 Among the leaders of the technological enthusiasts is Alan Greenspan, who recently stated "A

perceptible quickening in the pace at which technological innovations are applied argues for the

hypothesis that the recent acceleration in labor productivity is not just a cyclical phenomenon or a

statistical aberration, but reflects, at least in part, a more deep-seated, still developing, shift in our

economic landscape."8

        The sudden revival of productivity growth, after years in which Solow's paradox accurately

captured the lack of productivity payoff from computers, appears to vindicate Paul David (1990),

who predicted that the benefits of computers were being delayed, just as were the benefits of electric

motors at the turn of the century, but after some period would finally begin to boost economywide

productivity just as electric motors caused a productivity acceleration in U. S. manufacturing in the

1920s. Accordingly, the enthusiasts treat the New Economy as a fundamental industrial revolution

as great or greater in importance than the concurrence of inventions, particularly electricity and the


        6. A typical unqualified comment is that "when it comes to technology, even the most bearish analysts agree
the microchip and Internet are changing almost everything in the economy" (Ip, 2000).

        7. The full Business Week cover title on October 9, 1995, was "Productivity to the Rescue: Technology is
Transforming the American Economy into the Most Productive in the World." The more recent quote is from a
Business Week editorial, May 31, 1999, p. 190.

internal combustion engine, which transformed the world at the turn of the last century.

        Yet, without disputing the facts of the productivity revival and the broader miracle of the

American economy, room remains for skepticism. Does the New Economy merit treatment as a basic

Industrial Revolution of a magnitude and importance equivalent to the great inventions of the late

19th and early 20th century? These, particularly electricity and the internal combustion engine, but

also including chemicals, movies, radio, and indoor plumbing set off 60 years between roughly 1913

and 1972 during which multi-factor productivity (hereafter MFP) growth grew more rapidly than

before or since, and during which everyday life was entirely transformed.

        The skeptic's case begins with a new interpretation of the recent productivity revival. While

impressive on the surface, the revival reveals a marked imbalance in its location within the economy,

appearing to be centered in the production of computer hardware, including peripherals, and

telecommunications equipment, with substantial spillover to the rest of durable manufacturing.

However, outside the 12 percent of the economy engaged in manufacturing durable goods, the New

Economy's effects on productivity growth are surprisingly absent, and capital deepening has been

remarkably unproductive.9

        If Solow's computer paradox is still alive and well outside of durable manufacturing, where

most of the computers are located, then we must probe deeper and ask why such a massive

investment has yielded so little payoff. We begin with a historical retrospective on living conditions

in the late 19th century, in order to understand how fundamental was the transformation achieved by



         9. In 1996 current dollar value-added in durable manufacturing was 11.6 percent of current-dollar output in
the nonfarm private business sector. See Economic Report of the President, February 1999, Tables B-10 and B-12.

five clusters of inventions that occurred during the interval 1860-1900, hereafter to be called the

"Great Inventions". In contrast to these earlier inventions, computers differ in the exponential rate

of decline in the prices of computer speed and memory, which brings with it a massive substitution

toward ever greater use of speed and memory. Set against this exponential increase in computer

capability is a fixed endowment of time and a limited endowment of human brainpower, creating

diminishing returns at a rate never before seen in economic history as the supply curve of computer

power shifts down a relatively fixed demand curve.

       It is often assumed that the invention of the Internet in the mid-1990s shifted the demand

curve to the right, thus ending or postponing the rapid onset of diminishing returns. Accordingly, if

the Internet was the important invention that many assume, the growth in the demand for computer

power should have accelerated after 1995 relative to the rate of decline in price. But our examination

of aggregate data on the price and quantity of computer characteristics rejects this assumption; the

response of computer quantity to the decline in computer price was much larger before 1987 than

afterwards and did not accelerate after 1995. In fact, we shall argue the opposite of the David "delay"

hypothesis; the speed at which diminishing returns have taken hold makes it likely that the greatest

benefits of computers lie a decade or more in the past, not in the future.

       The paper then explores some of the limitations of the computer in general and the Internet

in particular when evaluated in comparison with the Great Inventions of the past. Computers are less

pervasive than is generally thought, because there are real limitations to the replacement of human

beings by computers. Many jobs require hand-and-eye coordination, and in the services many

occupations inherently require face-to-face contact between human beings or between a human

worker and an object.

Similarly, the number of new companies and new products associated with the Internet is not as

impressive as it may appear, because the economy today is much larger now than at the time of the

Great Inventions and requires many more innovations per year to achieve the same proportional

growth rate in technology and productivity.

       Five factors are examined that help to explain why the Internet has had so minimal an impact,

at least thus far, on productivity growth outside of durable manufacturing. First, consumer time is

limited, so much of Internet use simply substitutes for other forms of entertainment and information

gathering, such as watching TV, playing handheld games, and going to the public library. Second,

much investment in Internet web sites and infrastructure represents competition for market share

which redistributes sales rather than creating them, as when Borders and Barnes and Noble struggle

to defend themselves against the rise of Amazon.com. Third, much internet content is not truly new,

but rather consists of preexisting forms of information now made available more cheaply and

conveniently, in contrast to the sense in which the Great Inventions created truly new products and

activities. Fourth, much web site development duplicates rather than replaces existing forms of

commerce and information, raising costs more than revenue. Fifth, there is growing evidence that

a large fraction of consumption activity on the web takes place at the office, where workers take

advantage of fast broadband web access at the expense of their employers.


Dissecting the U. S. Productivity Growth Revival

       To assess the role of computers in the recent productivity growth revival, we need to
                                                                        Industrial Revolution, Page 7



distinguish between the growth rates of average labor productivity (ALP) and multi-factor

productivity (MFP). The former compares output growth (y) with that of a single input, labor hours

(h), while the latter compares output with a weighted average of several inputs, including labor,

capital (k), and sometimes others, including materials, energy, and/or imports. The two concepts can

be related by considering a simple production function relating the growth rates of output and two

inputs, labor and capital:



(1)                                     y = m + bh + (1-b)k,



where m is the growth rate of MFP, b is the elasticity of output with respect to labor input, and

(invoking constant returns to scale) 1-b is the elasticity of output with respect to capital input.

Equation (1) states that output growth is the sum of MFP growth and of the separate contributions

of labor and capital input, weighted by the elasticity of output growth to each input.

        Equation (1) can be easily transformed to relate the growth in ALP to the growth in MFP:


(2)                                     y - h = m + (1-b)(k-h)


Now we see that growth in ALP or output per hour (y-h) is equal to growth in MFP (m) plus the

contribution of "capital deepening," that is, the elasticity of output with respect to capital (1-b) times

the growth rate of the capital-labor ratio (k-h).



The "Direct" and "Spillover" Effects of the New Economy
                                                                                Industrial Revolution, Page 8



         We can use equation (2) to examine the effects of computers and the New Economy on the

recent productivity growth revival. Imagine a spontaneous acceleration in the rate of technological

change in the computer sector, which induces a more rapid rate of decline in computer prices and an

investment boom as firms respond to cheaper computer prices by buying more computers.10 In

response, since computers are part of output, this acceleration of technical change in computer

production raises the growth rate of MFP (m) in the total economy, boosting the growth rate of ALP

(y-h) one-for-one. Second, the ensuing investment boom raises the magnitude of the capital

deepening term (1-b)(k-h), thus increasing the growth in ALP relative to MFP.

         In discussing the New Economy, it is important to separate the computer-producing sector

from the computer-using sector. No one denies that there has been a marked acceleration of output

and productivity growth in the production of computer hardware, including peripherals.11 The real

issue has been the response of productivity to massive computer investment by the 96 percent of the

economy engaged in using computers rather than producing them.12 Applying (2) to the "non-

computer" economy, i.e., the portion of the economy not directly engaged in making computer



         10. In the U. S. national accounts computer prices are measured by the hedonic regression technique, in
which the prices of a variety of models of computers are explained by the quantity of computer characteristics and by
the passage of time. Thus the phrase in the text "decline in computer prices" is shorthand for "a decline in the prices
of computer attributes like speed, memory, disk drive access speed and capacity, presence of a CD-ROM, etc."

         11. In this paper we emphasize computer hardware, rather than the universe of computer hardware, software,
and telecommunications equipment, because the BEA deflators for software and telecommunications equipment are
problematic, exhibiting implausibly low rates of price decline, as argued by Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000).

         12. In 1999 nominal final sales of computers and peripherals plus fixed investment in software represented
3.5 percent of nominal GDP in the nonfarm nonhousing private business economy. Thus the "non-computer part of
the economy" represents 96.5 percent of nonfarm nonhousing private business output. Final sales of computer
hardware is an unpublished series obtained from Christian Ehemann of the BEA; the other series in this calculation
appear in the Economic Report of the President, February 2000, Tables B-10 and B-16.
                                                                      Industrial Revolution, Page 9



hardware and software, we might see two types of effects of computers. If the only effect of the

technological breakthrough in computer production on the non-computer economy is an investment

boom that accelerates the growth rate of capital input, then non-computer ALP growth would rise

by the capital-deepening effect (1-b)(k-n), but there would be no increase in non-computer MFP

growth. Let us call this the "direct" effect of the New Economy on the non-computer sector.

Sometimes advocates of the revolutionary nature of the New Economy imply that computer

investment has a higher rate of return than other types of investment and creates "spillover" effects

on business practices and productivity in the non-computer economy; evidence of this "spillover"

effect would be an acceleration in MFP growth in the non-computer economy occurring at the same

time as the technological acceleration in computer production.

       The distinction between the direct and spillover effect is illustrated in Figure 1, which refers

to the non-computer sector and plots the growth rate of output per hour

(y-h) against that of capital per hour (k-h). Points in the graph contrast growth rates for 1972-95 and

1995-99, the periods of the productivity growth slowdown and revival, respectively. The lowest line

labelled "capital-deepening effect" represents the term

(1-b)(k-h) in equation (2) and uses a typical value of one-third for the elasticity (1-b). The line

labelled "direct effect only" assumes that there is no change in MFP growth in the non-computer

sector in 1995-99 (point A') compared with 1972-95 (point A) from the previous rate labelled mA .

The top line labeled "with spillover effect" assumes that computer investment has created spillover

effects in the non-computer sector that raises MFP growth from mA to mB for the 1995-99 period,

as at point B. In our subsequent examination of the data, we will look for evidence that the New
                                                                               Industrial Revolution, Page 10



Economy has created spillover effects in the non-computer sector.



The Productivity Growth Revival in Historical Perspective

         What is the counterpart of the New Economy in the official output data? As shown in the top

frame of Figure 2, the remarkable event which occurred at the end of 1995 was an acceleration of the

rate of price change in computer hardware (including peripherals) from an average rate of -14.7

percent during 1987-95 to an average rate of

-31.2 percent during 1996-99.13 Computers did not become more important as a share of dollar

spending in the economy, which stagnated at around 1.3 percent of the nonfarm private business

economy, as shown in the bottom frame of Figure 2. The counterpart of the post-1995 acceleration

in the rate of price decline was an acceleration in the rate of technological progress; apparently the

time cycle of Moore's Law shortened from 18 months to 12 months at about the same time.14

         On the surface, the productivity growth revival which began at the end of 1995 is impressive,

especially when set in a historical context, and it suggests that substantial direct and spillover effects

of computer investment may have occurred in the non-computer sector. First we examine the basic

facts for the aggregate economy from the perspective of more than a century and postpone until the



         13. One way of dramatizing the rate of price decline is to translate it into the ratio of performance to price
when 1999:Q4 is compared with 1993:Q4. The BEA's implicit deflator for computer final sales implies an
improvement over that six-year period by a factor of 5.2. Improvements in performance-price ratios for individual
computer components are substantially larger, by a factor of 16.2 for computer processors, 75.5 for RAM, and 176.0
for hard disk capacity. See "Computers, then and now," Consumer Reports, May, 2000, p. 10, where the published
reported comparisons in 1999 dollars have been converted to nominal dollars using the Consumer Price Index.

         14. This fact is based on a conversation between Gordon Moore and Dale W. Jorgenson, related to the author
by the latter.

next section the decomposition of the economy into the computer and non-computer sectors. Table

1 compares rates of output, input, and productivity growth achieved in the American economy during

the four years 1995-99 as compared with three long intervals going back to 1870.15 The table is

divided into three sections: line 1 exhibits the growth rate of nonfarm nonhousing output, lines 2-5

exhibit growth rates of inputs and productivity for labor and capital inputs as conventionally

measured, and lines 6-9 are based on alternative input concepts which are adjusted for changes in

composition, e.g., the shift in labor input along the dimensions of age, sex, and educational

attainment, and the shift in capital input from structures to equipment.16

         The first three columns of Table 1 divide 125 years of history into three long intervals divided

at 1913 and 1972. The pattern of growth rates displayed on line 6 for composition-unadjusted MFP

can be summarized as "slow-fast-slow", which led me (1999, 2000b) to label this pattern as "one big

wave" in the history of U. S. productivity growth. The composition-adjusted MFP growth rates

displayed on line 11 show a lopsided wave with near-zero MFP growth in the 1972-95 period,

considerably slower than in 1870-1913 and much slower than in 1913-72. In the past I have pointed

to this wave-like pattern as suggesting that the basic question about historical productivity growth

should not be "why was growth was so slow after 1972?" but rather "why was growth was so fast


        15. The record compiled for 1870-1996 in Table 1 is based on Gordon (2000b), which merges data from
Kendrick (1961) with BEA and BLS data for the postwar period and develops estimates for labor and capital
composition to carry the postwar BLS composition adjustments back from 1948 to 1870.

         16. The section in lines 2-6 that excludes the composition adjustments is included to allow comparability with
the unadjusted quarterly data to be examined in Table 2 in the next section. Likewise housing is excluded to retain
comparability with Table 2. Adjustments for labor composition were pioneered by Griliches (1960) and Denison
(1962), and for capital composition by Jorgenson and Griliches (1967). Similar adjustments are incorporated in the
official BLS series on MFP that currently cover 1948-97, and detailed annual data are available through 1998 in
Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000).
                                                                    Industrial Revolution, Page 12



during the golden years 1913-72?" I have attributed the outstanding performance of the golden years

to the role of the Great Inventions discussed below.

       But waves inherently repeat themselves, and the data for 1995-99 are consistent with the

beginning of a new golden age of productivity growth. Either with or without composition

adjustments, MFP growth during 1995-99 exceeded that in the golden age period. Growth in output

per hour by either measure in lines 5 or 10 exceeded that in the golden age by a much larger amount,

since capital deepening during 1995-99 proceeded at such a rapid rate. The revival of ALP growth

was so extraordinary that, after we account for the major contribution of capital deepening, there was

still room for MFP growth to accelerate by more than a full percentage point on both lines 6 and 11.



Where Has the Revival Occurred and Can it Persist?

       Thus far it would appear that the glowing optimism of New Economy advocates is well

deserved, and that computers and the internet have brought U. S. productivity growth out of its two-

decade doldrums into another golden age. Yet there is still room for doubt for two reasons. First,

a major fraction of the revival in MFP growth has occurred within the small part of the economy

engaged in producing computers and peripherals, and within the rest of the durable manufacturing

sector. When durable manufacturing is stripped out from the data, the extent of the revival is much

diminished. Second, there is a large literature on the procyclicality of productivity supporting the

view that productivity grows unusually rapidly when output grows faster than its trend. Growth in

U. S. output during 1995-99 was faster than the sustainable trend, a growth surge made possible in

part by two unsustainable "safety valves" (Alan Greenspan's phrase), a decline in the unemployment
                                                                              Industrial Revolution, Page 13



rate from 5.6 percent to 4.2 percent, and an increase in the current-account deficit from 1.5 to 3.9

percent of GDP.17 If output was growing faster than trend, then productivity was also growing faster

than trend, and some part of the productivity revival recorded in Table 1 was transitory rather than

permanent. In the words of the Wall Street Journal, "only the most starry-eyed New Economy

believers thinks that the 7% annualized pace set in last year's [1999] fourth quarter is sustainable"

(Schlesinger and Dreazen, 2000).

         This section provides a brief summary of a more extensive cyclical analysis provided in

Gordon (2000c), based on quarterly BLS data for output and hours. Quarterly data is used in an

econometric analysis that decomposes the growth in labor productivity (y-h) into trend and cyclical

components separately for the nonfarm private business (NFPB) sector and that sector excluding

durable manufacturing (hereafter NFND).18

         The idea that productivity varies procyclically dates back to Hultgren (1960) and "Okun's

Law" (Okun, 1962) and was first interpreted by Oi (1962), who described labor as a "quasi-fixed

factor" that adjusts only partially during cyclical swings of output.19 In my econometric specification,

the change in the growth of actual hours relative to the hours trend (h-h*) is explained by changes




         17. MEMO: 1999 figure is for 1999:Q3, annualized. This number is to be updated.

        18. The quarterly BLS productivity data cover four sectors — NFPB, durable manufacturing, nondurable
manufacturing, and nonfinancial corporations. In this paper to save space we limit our attention only to NFPB and
durable manufacturing, including nondurable manufacturing in the residual NFND sector.

        19. Citations to the modern literature on the procyclicality of "Solow's residual", i.e., MFP, can be found in
Basu (1996).
                                                                            Industrial Revolution, Page 14



in its own lagged values and by changes in the growth of output relative to trend (y-y*).20 Hours

growth lags behind output growth and responds by roughly 0.75 of the output change; thus growth

in output per hour (y-h) exhibits a temporary acceleration when hours are lagging behind output

changes, and in addition increases by roughly 0.25 of any excess in output growth relative to trend.

        The decomposition of the recent productivity acceleration between cycle and trend is

accomplished by specifying a value for the hours growth trend (h*) and then conducting a grid search

to find the output growth trend (y*) that optimizes the fit of the equation explaining the relation of

h-h* to y-y*.21 The results displayed in Table 2 allow us to assess the direct and spillover effects of

computers on output per hour and MFP growth during the period between 1995:Q4 and 1999:Q4.

The first column refers to the aggregate economy, i.e., the NFPB sector including computers. Of

the actual 2.82 percent annual growth of output per hour, 0.54 is attributed to a cyclical effect and

the remaining 2.28 percent to trend growth, and the latter is 0.81 points faster than the 1972-95 trend.

How can this acceleration be explained? A small part on lines 6 and 7 is attributed to changes in price

measurement methods and to a slight acceleration in the growth of labor quality.22 The remaining


        20. The recent research (Gordon, 2000c) updates the cyclical analysis of labor productivity contained in
Gordon (1993).

         21. It is assumed that actual and trend output were equal in 1954:Q1, 1963:Q3, 1972:Q2, 1978:Q2, 1987:Q3,
and 1995:Q4. The task is to determine the optimal output trend after 1995:Q4. The regression equation is estimated
for the period 1954:Q1-1999:Q4, and the growth in trend output is varied to minimize the root-mean-squared error
over 1996:Q1-1999:Q4. The hours trend is set at a rate consistent with a NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation rate of
unemployment) in 1999:Q4 of 5.0 percent. A more optimistic NAIRU of 4.5 percent would yield a trend that is 0.11
points faster on line 4 of Table 2, changing the results on subsequent lines correspondingly.

        22. The price measurement effect consists of two components. While most changes in price measurement
methods in the CPI have been backcast in the national accounts to 1978, one remaining change — the 1993-94 shift
in medical care deflation from the CPI to the slower-growing PPI — creates a measurement discontinuity of 0.09
percent. The fact that other measurement changes were carried back to 1978 rather than 1972 creates a further
                                                                                                   (continued...)
                                                                                Industrial Revolution, Page 15



0.62 points can be directly attributed to computers. The capital-deepening effect of faster growth in

capital relative to labor in the aggregate economy accounts of 0.33 percentage points of the

acceleration (all due to computers), and an acceleration of MFP growth in computer and computer-

related semiconductor manufacturing account for all of the rest.23 Nothing is left for a structural

acceleration in MFP outside of the computer-producing sector. Thus in terms of Figure 1, the non-

computer economy is at a point like A', reflecting the effect of capital-deepening on growth in output

per hour but retaining the same structural growth trend of MFP (mA ) as before 1995.

         A different way of assessing the role of computers is displayed in the second column of Table

2. Here we subtract output and hours in computer manufacturing from the NFPB economy and find

that the structural acceleration of labor productivity on line 8 is 0.43 percentage points, compared

to 0.62 for the total NFPB economy. Line 11 indicates a small structural deceleration in MFP of 0.09

points.24 Thus far we conclude that the impact of capital deepening has created a genuine revival in

growth in output per hour (ALP) in the non-computer economy but that spillover effects on MFP in

the non-computer economy are absent (column 1) or slightly negative (column 2).



           22. (...continued)
discontinuity of 0.05 when the full 1972-95 period is compared to 1995-99. The acceleration in labor quality growth
reflects the same compositional changes discussed in connection with Table 1 above; labor quality growth during 1972-
95 was held down by a compositional shift toward female and teenage workers during the first half of that period.

          23. In the Oliner-Sichel decomposition on which line 9 is based, computers account for all of the acceleration
in the capital-deepening effect, and the additional acceleration attributable to semiconductors and telecommunications
is exactly canceled out by a deceleration of capital deepening for all other types of equipment and structures (See
Oliner and Sichel, Table 2, lines 2 through 7.

          24. The main explanation of the difference on line 11 in the first two columns is that the first column
subtracts out MFP growth in computers and computer-related semiconductors, while the second column subtracts out
only computers but not computer-related semiconductors. This inconsistency is imposed by the data available in the
Oliner-Sichel (2000) source.
                                                                                Industrial Revolution, Page 16



         However, this conclusion is far too optimistic regarding the effect of computers outside of

durable manufacturing, i.e., the NFND sector examined in the final column of Table 2. Starting from

a much lower actual growth rate of 2.05 percent, a slightly larger cyclical effect is subtracted, leaving

an acceleration in trend on line 5 of only 0.24 percent.25 Almost all of this can be explained by price

measurement and labor quality, leaving a structural acceleration in output per hour growth of only

0.05 percent, far less than is accounted for by capital deepening (line 9). As a result, line 11 shows

that there has been a substantial structural deceleration in MFP growth in the NFND sector.

         Figure 3 summarizes the results in this section by decomposing the post-1995 acceleration

in ALP growth of 1.35 percent among its components. The "New Economy" is alive and well, but

only within computer manufacturing and the remainder of the manufacturing durable sector. The

right-hand bar shows the deceleration in MFP growth in the NFND sector. This surprising finding

can be interpreted either as a "literal" deceleration in MFP growth compared to the 1972-95 period

or as suggesting that the acceleration of computer investment has had a negligible payoff, implying

a near-zero rate of return of computer investment outside of durable manufacturing. How could

there be such a low payoff to computer investment in most of the economy where the vast majority

of the computers are located?26 In this sense the Solow computer paradox survives intact for most



          25. There is no cyclical effect in durable or nondurable manufacturing; this is the corollary of the absence
of any increase in the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing and of the absence of any acceleration in hours growth
in manufacturing between 1995 and 1999. Thus the cyclical effect occurs entirely outside of manufacturing, accounting
for the higher cyclical effect when durables are stripped out in Table 2, column 3.

        26. McGuckin and Stiroh (1998, Table 1, p. 42) show that 88.5 percent of the computers are used in eight
of the 34 industries in their data base for the U. S. private economy. 76.6 percent are used in Trade, Finance-
Insurance-Real Estate, and Other Services, while 11.9 percent are used in five computer-intensive industries within
manufacturing, and only 11.5 percent in the remaining 27 industries.

of the economy, and the need to explain it motivates the rest of this paper.


How the Great Inventions Helped Us Escape from the Bad Old Days

         Our central theme is that computers and the internet do not measure up to the Great

Inventions of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and in this sense

do not merit the label of "Industrial Revolution". In this sense we are using the common definition

of an Industrial Revolution as applying to any great acceleration of output and productivity growth

that is pervasive and economywide, and our skepticism is based on the apparent failure of computers

and the internet to achieve a breakthrough in either ALP or MFP growth outside of durable

manufacturing.27 Our comparison is not with the First Industrial Revolution in Britain during 1760-

1830 but with what is sometimes called the Second Industrial Revolution, which took place

simultaneously in Europe and the United States and can be dated roughly 1860-1900.28,29 As we

learned in Table 1, it was the Second Industrial Revolution, not the first, that created the golden age



        27. "Usage of the term spread from `the' Industrial Revolution (that of Great Britain, roughly between 1760
and 1830), to a general expression, to be applied to any great acceleration of industrial output wherever it may occur"
(Checkland, 1987, p. 811). "There are different ways to judge technological breakthroughs; the obvious one and most
appealing to economists is the impact on output and productivity" (Mokyr, 1997, p. 33).

          28. For such a comparison see Mokyr (1997, p. 33), who writes in this context that "One can judge an era
of technological advances by whether it is one of door-opening or gap-filling inventions. It could be argued that if the
criterion for an Industrial Revolution is a cluster of such macroenventions, this does qualify our age as much as the
classical British Industrial Revolution, but so does the period roughly between 1860 and 1900."

          29. Also, what is being compared is not the entirety of technological advance of the 1990s but only the role
of the computer and the internet; a broader perspective that included biology, pharmaceuticals, and medical technology
might lead to a more sympathetic comparison of recent progress with the Second Industrial Revolution. However, the
yearly rate of increase in life expectancy at birth during 1900-1950, resulting in substantial part from the inventions
of the Second Industrial Revolution, was 0.72 percent per year, triple the 0.24 percent annual rate during 1950-95.

of productivity growth. Indeed, MFP grew at a snail's pace in the nineteenth century; as Brad

DeLong has observed "Compared to the pace of ecnomic growth in the 20th century, all other

centuries — even the 19th . . . — were standing still."30 To understand the profound sense in which

the Great Inventions of the Second Industrial Revolution altered the standard of living of the average

American resident during the golden age, we begin with a brief tour of some of the less desirable

aspects of living in the late nineteenth century.



Life in the "Bad Old Days"

          An eye-opening introduction to the conditions of that era is provided in a little-known book

by Otto Bettman (1974), the founder of the famed Bettman photographic archive. Bettmann divides

the horrors of the past into eleven categories, which for brevity will be condensed into four.

        Air, Food, Drink, and Health. The urban streets of the 1870s and 1880s were full not just

of horses but pigs, which roamed the streets and were tolerated because they ate garbage. In Kansas

City, the confusion and stench of patrolling hogs were so penetrating that Oscar Wilde observed,

"They made granite eyes weep." The steadily increasing production of animal waste caused the more

pessimistic observers to fear that American cities would disappear like Pompeii — but not under

ashes. Added to that was acrid industrial smog, sidewalks piled high with kitchen slops, coal dust,

and dumped merchandise, which became stirred together in slime after a rain. All of this was made

worse in the summer, which was almost as unbearable outdoors as inside, especially with the heavy



        30. Quoted in "A Century of Progress," Economist, April 15, 2000, p. 86. [ED: Citation to original DeLong

clothes of the day. Rudyard Kipling said of Chicago, "Having seen it, I desire urgently never to see

it again. Its air is dirt." Added to putrid air was the danger of spoiled food — imagine unrefrigerated

meat and poultry hung unrefrigerated for days, spoiled fruit, bacteria-infected milk, and virtually all

types of food were suspected of adulteration. Epidemics included yellow fever, scarlet fever, and

smallpox. The pain and lack of sanitation in surgery were endemic, and many hospitals were

deathtraps.

          Motive Power. Before the invention of electricity, urban streets were a chaotic jungle of

horse trolleys, and horse-drawn conveyances of all types, made even more congested in winter by

horse-drawn snowplows that did little more than move the snow out of the way of the trolleys by

dumping it on the sidewalks. Rural life was also no picnic; among its features were isolation,

loneliness, and the drudgery of fireplace cooking and laundry done by muscle-power. Travel between

cities on railroads was surprisingly dangerous; in 1890 railroad-connected accidents caused 10,000

deaths. Emigrants traveled west on wooden benches in worn-out boxcars attached to freight or cattle

trains.

          Housing. In 1882 only two percent of New York City's houses had water connections.

Urban apartments were crowded, damp, airless, and often firetraps. Even middle-class apartment

buildings were little more than glorified tenements; families were shelved in layers, with no insulation

from the neighbors' cooking smells or babies' squallings. In the slums as many as eight persons

shared a single small room.

          Working Conditions. Those who have seen the movie "Titanic" may have shared my

momentary shock at the working conditions of the sweating laborers shoveling coal into the huge
                                                                                Industrial Revolution, Page 20



mouths of the ship's boilers. Coal miners, steel workers, and many others worked 60-hour weeks in

dirty and dangerous conditions, exposed to suffocating gas and smoke. Danger was not confined to

mines or mills; in 1890 one railroad employee was killed for every 300 employed.31 Sewing in a

sweatshop might have been the most oppressive occupation for women but was not as dangerous as

soap-packing plants or the manual stripping of tobacco leaves.32

The Great Inventions

         The transition from these often abysmal living conditions to today's much easier and more

pleasant life resulted from the complex interaction of ideas, inventions, and the feedback from

growing wealth that allowed poor families to live as well or better in many aspects of life than the

wealthy of one hundred years earlier. While there many individual inventions, it helps to group them

together into five "clusters" or groups that can be compared with the cluster of inventions in

computer hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment now commonly called the "New

Economy." Each of these clusters had a primary breakthrough invention that occurred during the

period 1860-1900.33


        31. Thus in the single year of 1890 there were 10,000 deaths by passengers in railroad-connected accidents
and 2450 deaths by workers in the American railroad system (Bettman, 1974, pp. 70, 171).

        32. Except for the "Titanic" remark, everything in the preceding four paragraphs consists of a mix of
paraphrases and quotes from Bettman (1974).

          33. "Many inventions that mark the technological development of the 20th century were put in place during
the last two decades of the 19th century: the telephone, electric generator, electric light, steam turbine, cheaper
processes for making steel and aluminum, automatic machine tools, and most important in its effect on society, the
internal combustion engine" (Bunch and Hellemans, 1993, p. 278). Omitted from this list are the invention of paper
roll film by George Eastman and of the motion picture by Thomas A. Edison and William Dickson in the same year
(1888) and of the phonograph by Edison in 1879. The typewriter was patented in 1868 and reached "its modern form
in the 1890s" (Sichel, 1997, p. 123); see also Cortada (1993). These two sources also indicate that many types of office
machines, including four-function calculators, mimeograph machines, and punch-card sorters, date from the 1880s
                                                                                                          (continued...)
                                                                              Industrial Revolution, Page 21



        (1) The first great invention in the "Group of Five" is electricity, including both electric light

and electric motors, which dates from the simultaneous invention of the electric light bulb in 1879 by

Thomas A. Edison in the U. S. and by Joseph W. Swan in England, and the first power station in

1882. As shown by Nordhaus (1997), electricity drastically reduced the price of a lumen of light.

Electric motors, after a developmental period of two or more decades emphasized by David (1990),

revolutionized manufacturing by decentralizing the source of power and making possible flexible and

portable tools and machines. After a somewhat longer lag, electric motors embodied in consumer

appliances eliminated the greatest source of drudgery of all, manual laundry; through refrigeration

virtually eliminated food spoilage; and through air conditioning made summers enjoyable and opened

the southern United States for modern economic development.34

        (2) Sharing the title with electricity for the most important invention that had its main

diffusion in the twentieth century is the internal combustion engine, which made possible personal

autos, motor transport, and air transport.35 Grouped in this category are such derivative inventions

as the suburb, highway, and supermarket.36 Gradually eliminated or greatly reduced were many of

the ills of the late nineteenth century, from manure to unplowed snow to rural isolation.

and 1890s. See Sichel (1997, pp. 121-7).

        34. See Oi (1997) for an insightful analysis of the effect of air conditioning on productivity.

         35. The first internal combustion engine operating on modern principles is attributed to Julius Hock in 1870
and the first four-cycle engine to Nikolaus Otto in 1877. The first high-speed engine was built by Gottlieb Daimler
in 1883 and the first three-wheeled automobile by Karl Benz in 1885. See Bunch and Hellemans (1993), pp. 268-93.

         36. Bresnahan and Gordon (1997) in their introduction provide a formal analysis of how complementary
inventions like supermarkets, suburbs, and highways increase the consumer surplus contributed by new inventions like
the internal combustion engine and the motor car.

        (3) The third group of great inventions includes petroleum, natural gas, and various processes

which "rearrange molecules," including chemicals, plastics, and pharmaceuticals.37 Some of these

inventions were spontaneous and other were induced by the demands of motor and air transport.

They helped to reduce air pollution created by industrial and heating uses of coal, and they made

possible many new and improved materials and products, as well as conquering illness and prolonging

life. Unlike the discontinuity created by the revolutionary impact of electricity and the internal

combustion engine, the development of petroleum, chemicals, and their derivative industries was

more of a continuous process dating from the mid-nineteenth century onwards.

        (4) The fourth cluster consists of the complex of entertainment, communication, and

information innovations that were developed before World War II. This set of inventions that made

the world smaller (in a more profound sense than the Internet) can be traced back to the telegraph

(1844) and includes the telephone (1876), phonograph (1877), popular photography (1880s and

1890s), radio (1899), motion pictures (1881 to 1888), and television (1911).38 Television is the only

one of these innovations that was diffused into the popular marketplace after World War II.

Otherwise, all the rest were well established before World War II and created a quantum leap in the

standard of living when a year like, say, 1939 is compared with fifty years earlier. And this list does

not even include the gradual diffusion over the nineteenth century of literacy and reading stimulated

by the spread of inexpensive books and newspapers, the "penny post," and free public libraries.




         37. My colleague Joel Mokyr dates the development of modern chemistry to the discovery of synthetic dye
by William Perkin in 1856 and of the benzene molecule by August von Kekulé in 1865.

        38. Dates of initial inventions are from Bunch and Hellemans (1993).
                                                                           Industrial Revolution, Page 23



            (5) Perhaps the most tangible improvement in the everyday standard of living, besides electric

light, came through the rapid spread after 1880 of running water, indoor plumbing, and urban

sanitation infrastructure. The timing of this epochal development can be traced to "the first

enunciation of the germ theory of disease by Louis Pasteur in 1864."39 Mokyr and Stein credit

Pasteur's germ theory of disease for the great decline in mortality in the four decades prior to World

War I, long before the invention of antibiotics, although in part the development of indoor plumbing

was independent of the germ theory and dates to the contemporary invention of the indoor flush

toilet.40

            The "Group of Five" inventions, in turn, created an increase in per-capita income and wealth

during the golden years of productivity growth (1913-72) that allowed an improvement in living

standards even in those aspects of consumption where inventions did not play a major role,

particularly the ability of families to afford many more square feet of shelter (and in the suburbs more

land surrounding that shelter) than in 1880. Although we have grouped together our clusters of

inventions for ease of discussion, our list is quite similar to the list of the "Greatest Engineering

Achievements of the 20th Century" recently released by the National Academic of Engineering (NAE)

and displayed in Table 3. The NAE list includes separate entries for 11 inventions that we have

grouped together into our five clusters, and the links with our clusters are indicated in the table.

Interestingly, eight of the top 10 on the NAE list appear on our list of inventions which had their

genesis prior to the year 1900, and only two postwar inventions (electronics and computers) make

the top 10.41 The Internet, subject of so much New Economy "hype", is listed at a lowly 13th

position.



Comparing Revolutions

        Has the information revolution spawned by the computer created as great a change in living

conditions as any of the five major clusters of early twentieth- century inventions?                        While

retrospective exercises are inevitably subjective, it is interesting to play an expanded version of what

I like to call the "New Yorker game." A few years ago the New Yorker commissioned a critic to sit

in front a television set for an entire week and record his impressions. He had many reactions, but

the one most relevant for us is that he was surprised from the reruns of 1950 TV shows how similar

were the living conditions of the 1950s Ozzie and Harriet families in comparison to those of today.

Clearly living conditions were far better in the 1950s than in the 1890s, in large part because of the

"Group of Five" inventions. We can surmise that a hypothetical critic revisiting the 1890s through

a time machine would not have the same reaction that little had changed. Society had cured most of

the ills of late nineteenth century living conditions by the 1950s without any help from computers.

Among the achievements of the computerless society were the production miracle and the

organization of 12 million people in the U. S. armed forces during World War II, achieved with a

technology of typewriters, calculating machines, and file cards, and likewise the critical operation




        41. It is debatable whether electronics or computers should be credited to the postwar era. Herman Hollerith
developed punch card counting for the 1890 U. S. Census, founded the predecessor company of IBM in 1896, and
developed the first numerical keyboard for punching cards in 1901. As for electronics, the photoelectric cell was
invented in 1900 and the vacuum tube in 1904.
                                                                      Industrial Revolution, Page 25



"Ultra" which decoded the German Enigma code and was responsible for some of the most important

intelligence breakthroughs and deceptions of the war.

        To understand at a deeper level why the computer revolution does not measure up to the

earlier great inventions, it is useful to consider some of the ways in which the great inventions created

productivity growth. Electric light was a unique invention that extended the length of the day for

reading, entertainment, and other pursuits. Both the electric motor and internal combustion engine

created faster and more flexible movement, directly raising the productivity of factory workers,

housewives, truck drivers, and airline pilots as the machines they powered could rotate ever faster.

Petroleum refining, chemicals, plastics, and pharmaceuticals all involve the physical rearrangement

of molecules in ways that change materials into more productive forms. The complex of electric and

electronic entertainment and information industries arrived in a void in which nothing comparable

existed and had, one may safely conjecture, a greater impact on everyday life of the average family

than the second and third generation developments witnessed more recently, e.g., VCRs, CDs, and

large-screen color TVs, which provided merely better or more convenient ways of performing the

same basic functions.           A classic "second order" invention is the VCR, which combines the

attributes of two first-order inventions, namely motion pictures and television, just as the

contemporary cellular phone (part of the New Economy) is a second-order development of the

telephone, a first-order invention. In fact, no current development in communications has achieved

a change in communication speed comparable to the telegraph, which between 1840 and 1850

reduced elapsed time per word transmitted by a factor of three thousand (from 10 days to 5 minutes

for a one-page message between New York and Chicago), and the cost by a factor of 100 (Sichel,
                                                                     Industrial Revolution, Page 26



p. 127). And does today's web access compare in excitement with the first live electronic contact

with the outside world achieved as radio spread in the early 1920s and television in the late 1940s?




The Declining Cost of Computer Power
and the Pervasiveness of Diminishing Returns

       We now turn from history to an examination of the contemporary impact of computers and

the internet. The analysis begins with a simple supply-demand analysis that relates shifting theoretical

curves to the data on the prices and quantities of computer characteristics observed in the economy.

We then turn to the role of diminishing returns implied by the rapid decline in the cost of computer

power, to the attributes of the internet that have contributed to its rapid adoption by consumers and

business firms, and finally to some of the factors that may have prevented computers and the internet

from boosting MFP outside of durable manufacturing.



The Declining Price of Computer Power

         The stunning difference between the computer and the Great Inventions of the past is the

unprecedented rate of decline in the price of computer power. Since Gregory Chow's seminal paper

(1967), computers have seemed the ideal application for the hedonic regression technique, in which

the price of different computer models is explained by their characteristics (speed, memory, capacity

of hard drive, presence and type of CD-ROM reader, and others) and by the passage of time. Since
                                                                              Industrial Revolution, Page 27



1986 the U. S. National Accounts have been based on a hedonic price index for computers and since

1996 on a system that combines this hedonic index with moving or "chain" weights to reflect the

steady divergence of the computer price deflator from its value in any single base year. As shown in

the top frame of Figure 4, the implicit price deflator for computer hardware, including peripherals,

declined from 61,640 in 1961 to 36 at the end of 1999 (with a base 1996 = 100), for an annual rate

of decline of 19.4 percent per annum. There has been a corresponding increase in the quantity of

computer attributes, and both the rate of price decline and quantity increase accelerated after 1995

(as indicated by the increasing spaces between the annual price and quantity observations starting in

1995).

         While the rate of price change has varied over time, the notable feature of rapid price decline

does not distinguish the New Economy from the 1950-80 interval dominated by the mainframe

computer or the 1980-95 interval dominated by the transition from mainframe to PC applications

prior to the invention of the Internet.42 Throughout its history, the economics of the computer has

featured a steady downward shift in the supply curve of computer attributes at a rate much faster than

the upward shift in the demand for computer services. In fact, the story is often told with a

theoretical diagram like the bottom frame of Figure 4, in which the supply curve slides steadily

downwards from S1 to S2 with no shift in the demand curve at all.43 Ignoring the possibility of a


        42. Existing computer price deflators fail to take account of the radical decline in the price per calculation
that occurred in the transition from mainframes to PCs (which have been studied only separately, not together).
Gordon (1990, p. 239) calculates that the annual rate of price decline between 1972 and 1987 would have been 35
percent per annum rather than 20 percent per annum if this transitional benefit had been taken into account. This
consideration further reduces the uniqueness of technological advance created by the New Economy.

         43. Three examples of this graph applied to computers exhibiting no shift in the demand curve are
                                                                                              (continued...)
                                                                               Industrial Revolution, Page 28



rightward shift in the demand curve from D1 to D2 (we return to this possibility below), the second

distinguishing feature of the development of the computer industry is the unprecedented speed with

which diminishing returns set in; while computer users steadily enjoy an increasing amount of

consumer surplus as the price falls, the declining point of intersection of the supply curve with the

fixed demand curve implies a rapid decline in the marginal utility or benefit of computer power.



Declining Computer Cost Confronts the Fundamental Limitation of Time

         Since Gary Becker's seminal article (1965) on the economics of time, household production

has been viewed as an activity which combines market goods and time. The fixed supply of time to

any individual creates a fundamental limitation on the ability of exponential growth in computer speed

and memory to create commensurate increases in output and productivity. In performing the two

activities that were revolutionized by the personal computer, namely word processing and

spreadsheets, I cannot type or think any faster than I did with my first 1983 personal computer that

contained 1/100th of the memory and operated at 1/60th of the speed of my present model. The

capital stock with which I work has increased by a factor of almost 30, according to the hedonic price

methodology, yet my productivity has hardly budged, occasionally benefitting for a few seconds when

I can jump from the beginning to the end of a 50-page paper much faster than in 1983.44 As a result,


          43. (...continued)
Brynjolfsson (1996, p. 290), Gordon (1990, p. 46) and Sichel (1997, p. 17). The supply curves in this graph have been
drawn as horizontal lines, both to simplify the subsequent discussion of consumer surplus and because there is no
evidence of a rising marginal cost of producing additional computer speed, memory, and other characteristics at a given
level of technology.

         44. A price index that declines at 25 percent per year for 17 years reaches a level of 1.4 in 2000 on a base of
                                                                                                          (continued...)
                                                                          Industrial Revolution, Page 29



there has been an exponential rate of decline in my output-to-capital ratio, and an equally sharp

decline in the marginal productivity of computer capital.

        There is nothing unique about the applicability of diminishing returns to the computer

hardware and software industries. Numerous industries have run into barriers to steady growth in

productivity, most notably the airline industry when jet aircraft reached natural barriers of size and

speed, and the electric utility industry when turbogenerator/boiler sets reached natural barriers of

temperature and pressure. The apparent dearth of productivity growth in the construction and home

maintenance industry reflects that electric portable power tools could only be invented once and have

been subject to only marginal improvements in recent decades.

        What makes diminishing returns particularly important in understanding the computer paradox

is the sheer pace at which computer users are sliding down the computer demand curve to ever-lower

marginal utility uses. One way of illustrating this point is to take word-processing. The upper frame

in Figure 5 conjectures a total utility curve for word processing, plotted against the speed of the

computer measured in mHz. Plotted are successive improvements starting at point A with the

memory typewriter, which eliminated much repetitive retyping. At point B comes the early slow

DOS PC with Wordperfect 4.2. Much faster computer speeds allowed the development of

Wordperfect 6.0 for DOS, with a fully graphical WYSIWYG interface, as at point C. Further order-

of-magnitude increases in speed bring us today's state of the art at point D, Windows 98 with the

latest version of Microsoft Word. Yet look at how the curve flattens out. The real revolution in


         44. (...continued)
1983 equals 100. This implies that my present $1000 computer represents $70,100 in 1983 prices, or 28 times the
$2,500 that I spent in 1983 on my first computer net of peripherals.
                                                                               Industrial Revolution, Page 30



word processing came at the beginning, by ending repetitive retyping and by allowing revisions to be

inserted while the rest of the document would automatically reformat itself. The productivity

enhancement of WYSIWYG was minor in comparison, and what was contributed by the final step

to the latest version of Word for Windows, beyond the ease of training for novice users, escapes me.

As the computer industry has developed, the steady decline in the prices of computer charcteristics

has fueled the development of increasingly complex software with high requirements for speed and

memory required by graphical point-and-click interfaces that yield increasingly small increments of

true functionality. The race between hardware capability and software requirements has been aptly

summed up in the phrase, "What Intel giveth, Microsoft taketh away."

         The bottom frame of Figure 5 replots the same relationship with marginal utility on the

vertical axis. This is the demand curve for computers which is drawn on the simplified assumption

that word processing is the only use of computers, but the point can be made in multiple dimensions.

As the diagram is drawn, a large part of the consumer surplus occurred in going from A to B to C,

and further gains are relatively small.45



Diminishing Returns and the David "Delay Hypothesis"

         The diminishing returns argument provides part of the answer to the Paul David (1990)

"delay" hypothesis. The reason that electric light and electric motors took time to diffuse after their

invention in the 1870s is that initially they were very expensive and didn't work very well. But the


         45. Even Business Week, normally enthusiastic about the benefits of the New Economy, admits that the latest
increments in chip speed offer "a lot of speed you can't really use. . . a speedier chip won't mnake you type faster or
think faster." See Wildstrom (1999, p. 23).
                                                                    Industrial Revolution, Page 31



mainframe and then personal computers worked reliably from the beginning, provided their main

benefits early on, and encountered diminishing returns relatively soon. Personal computers are only

a secondary step in the evolution of computer technology that began with the first commercial

mainframe computer (the UNIVAC I in 1951).46 Many of the industries that are the heaviest users

of computer technology, e.g., airlines, banks, and insurance companies, began in the 1960s and 1970s

with mainframe technology and still perform the most computation-intensive activities on mainframes,

often using PCs as smart terminals to access the mainframe data base. In this sense computers have

been around for almost 50 years, not just a decade or so, and the "waiting for Godot" hypothesis of

David and others loses further credibility.



Why the Computers are not Everywhere

       One explanation of the Solow computer paradox (that "we can see the computer age

everywhere except in the productivity statistics") is that the computers are not everywhere. The early

work of Oliner and Sichel (1994) and Sichel (1997) emphasized the small share of computers in the

capital stock, and the greater degree of optimism in their more recent work (Oliner and Sichel, 2000)

results not from a sudden jump in the importance of computer spending — we saw in the bottom

frame of Figure 2 that this did not happen — but rather in the accelerated rate of price decline and

in an extension of their analysis to include not just computers but also semiconductors. Since the

share of nominal spending on computers did not increase at all from 1987 to 1999, we can interpret


       46. Many of us recall the 1957 Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn movie The Desk Set, in which
Hepburn's entire reference department was to be replaced by a computer named "Emerac".
                                                                              Industrial Revolution, Page 32



the rapid increase in computer speed and memory as a simple substitution in response to the declining

price, and with a price elasticity of demand of minus unity there is no need to invoke an increase in

the demand for computer attributes at all.

         Some of the output of computers is, in principle, as productivity-enhancing as that of electric

motors or motorized transport. From the earliest punch-card sorters in the 1890s, some applications

of computer technology involved movement and speed.47 Numerically controlled machine tools,

robots, and other computer-driven machinery has the same potential for productivity improvement

as the earlier great inventions and doubtless accounts for the robust rate of productivity growth

apparent in much of the durable manufacturing sector. The use of ever-faster computers and

peripherals to churn out securities transactions, bank statements, and insurance policies has enhanced

productivity growth in the finance/insurance sector. And, just as the motor car enormously increased

personal mobility and flexibility, so the computer has spawned inventions whose main output is

convenience, most notably the ATM machine.

         Hand and Eye Coordination. Computers are less pervasive than is generally thought,

however, because there are real limitations to the replacement of human beings by computers.

Commercial aircraft, large and small alike, will always need two human pilots, no matter how

advanced the avionics in the cockpit. Trucks will always need at least one driver. In manufacturing,

some critical functions have proven to be resistant to automation, such as the connecting of tubes and




          47. Sichel (p. 126) calculates that the cost per calculation of the Hollerith punch card machine declined by
a factor of four between 1890 and 1900, the precursor of today's rapid declines in the ratio of price to performance.
                                                                              Industrial Revolution, Page 33



wires when an auto chassis is "married" to the body.48 No matter how powerful the computer

hardware and how user-friendly the software, most functions provided by personal computers,

including word-processing, spreadsheets, and data-base management, still require hands-on human

contact through a keyboard and mouse to be productive.

        Face-to-face Contact in the Services. By their nature, many services involve in-person

contact between clients and practitioners, whether doctors, nurses, dentists, lawyers, professors,

investment bankers, management consultants, bartenders, wait staff, bus boys, flight attendants,

barbers, or beauticians. Many other services require in-person contact between an object and the

practitioner, such as grocery cashiers, grocery baggers, parking lot attendants, valet parkers, auto

repair, lawn maintenance, restaurant chefs, hotel housekeepers, and almost every type of maintenance

of homes and machines. Computers are a relatively large share of capital in business, health, legal,

and educational services, but in each of these the contribution of capital to productivity growth is

relatively small.


The Positive and Negative Side of the Internet

        The accelerated rate of price decline in computer attributes has been accompanied since 1995

by the invention of the Internet.49 In perhaps the most rapid diffusion of any invention since television


          48. Ford engineers explained to a group of NBER economists (including this author) touring a plant in
Lakewood, Ohio, on November 1, 1996, that the "marriage" would be the last operation in automobile assembly to be
fully automated. In another tour with some of the same economists at the Toyota plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, on
April 3, 1998, officials explained their aversion to automation and replacing humans with robots: "our philosophy is
kaizan (continuous self-improvement), and machines cannot kaizan."

        49. Here to simplify the presentation we will take the Internet as being synonomous with the World Wide Web
                                                                                                        (continued...)
                                                                               Industrial Revolution, Page 34



in the late 1940s and early 1950s, by the end of the year 2000 the percentage of American households

hooked up to the Internet will have reached 50 percent.50 Surely the invention of web browsers and

the explosive growth of e-commerce rates as a major invention and should be interpreted as a

rightward shift in the demand curve in the bottom frame of Figure 4 from D1 to D2. Such a rightward

shift in the demand curve would imply an increase in consumer surplus associated with the lower

supply curve S2 from the triangle JP2B to the larger triangle KP2C, in exactly the same way that

supermarkets and superhighways raised the consumer surplus associated with the invention of the

automobile (see footnote 36 above).



The Apparent Absence of a Rightward Shift in Demand

         However, if there had been a discontinuous rightward shift in the demand curve for computer

hardware due to the spread of the internet, we should have observed a noticeable flattening of the

slope of the price-quantity relationship in the top frame of Figure 4, as the rate of increase of quantity

accelerates relative to the rate of decline in price, but we do not. The rate of change of price and

quantity both accelerate after 1995 (as indicated by the greater spacing between annual observations)

but the slope does not change appreciably, suggesting that the spread of the internet is a byproduct

of rapid technological change that is faster than in previous decades but not qualitatively different in


          49. (...continued)
and the invention of web browsers, although the use of the Internet for e-mail, at least in the academic and scientific
community, dates back at least to the early 1980s.

          50. This projection is made by Henry Harteveldt, Senior Analyst at Forrester Research, in communications
with the author. The misleading data of Cox and Alm (1999, Figure 8.1, p. 162) suggests that it took more than 25
years for television to reach 50 percent household penetration, but dating from the first commercial TV station in 1947
this penetration rate was reached in only seven years. See Kurian (1994), series R105 divided by A335.
                                                                      Industrial Revolution, Page 35



the relationship between supply and demand than earlier advances in the computer industry.

        The data on the price and quantity of computer characteristics have previously been used to

"map out" the demand curve (Brynjolfsson, 1996, p. 290). In fact, the slope of the price-quantity

relationship was appreciably flatter during 1972-87 than during 1987-95 or 1995-99. If the demand

curve has not shifted, the inverse of these slopes is the price elasticity of demand, namely -1.96, -1.19,

and -1.11 in these three intervals, which can be compared with Brynjolfsson's (1996, p. 292)

estimated price elasticity of

-1.33 over the period 1970-89. The apparent decline in the price elasticity is the counterpart of the

fact that the nominal share of computer hardware expenditures in the total economy (which implicitly

holds income constant) rose rapidly before 1987 but barely increased at all after that year, and this

shift in the price-quantity slope is consistent with the view that the most important uses of computers

were developed more than a decade into the past, not currently.




Benefits of the Internet

        The "New Economy" was defined at the beginning of this paper as the apparent acceleration

around 1995 in the rate of technical progress in IT, broadly conceived. However, most of the

optimistic interpretations of this development point to the internet, or more specifically the invention

of web browsers, as the central development that warrants calling the present era a new Industrial

Revolution. Here we provide a brief summary of some of the main aspects of the internet treated as

an industry and relate these aspects to our earlier decomposition of the post-1995 productivity
                                                                         Industrial Revolution, Page 36



growth acceleration.

        Barua et al. (1999) have proposed dividing the Internet Economy into four "layers:" (1) the

internet infrastructure layer, (2) the internet applications layer, (3) the internet intermediary layer, and

(4) the internet commerce layer. The first layer consists of hardware manufacturers, including IBM,

Dell, HP, Cisco, Lucent, Sun, and many others, all included in either the computer hardware or

telecommunications hardware industries. As we have seen above in Figure 3, this sector accounts

for the largest single component of the post-1995 productivity growth acceleration, both the direct

effect of faster MFP growth in computer hardware (including computer-related semiconductors) and

the indirect capital-deepening effect of the investment boom in IT equipment. There is little debate

about the dynamism of this sector, but rather about the uses to which this exponentially exploding

quantity of computer power is being put.

        The second layer consists of software, consulting, and training, and includes such companies

as Microsoft and its competitors. The main debate concerning the productivity of this layer is

whether the new BEA software deflators decline too slowly to capture the increased capability of the

software being produced as part of this massive investment effort.51 However, as shown by

Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000), substituting alternative software deflators with radically faster rates of

price decline does not significantly change MFP in the rest of the economy; total output grows faster

but this is

almost exactly cancelled out by faster growth in capital input. There is more capital deepening and



         51. Producers' Durable Equipment investment in software in 1999 was $143.3 billion, almost 50 percent
larger than PDE in computer and peripheral hardware.
                                                                   Industrial Revolution, Page 37



a higher share of the productivity acceleration accounted for by the software industry, but no change

in any conclusions about spillovers from software to the rest of the economy.

       The third and fourth layers consist of providers of both intermediate goods and consumption

goods. Many aggregators, portals, and content providers, e.g., Yahoo and Travelocity, sell

information and services both to business firms and to consumers. To the extent that e-commerce

is provided by one business to another, it is an intermediate good and not directly relevant for

computing the productivity of final output in the non-computer economy. In this sense we do not

need to debate whether business-to-business ("B2B") e-commerce is a fruitful invention. If the

development of more efficient links in the supply chain reduces costs and allows the elimination of

people and paper in the chain of intermediate transactions, then we should see the payoff in faster

productivity growth in the non-computer economy. So far this payoff has appeared in other parts of

durable manufacturing but not in rest of the economy. Thus our primary remaining question concerns

the benefits of the Internet Economy in the provision of final goods.

       The consumer benefits of the Internet are familiar. Perhaps the most important single

consumer benefit, also now used universally within business firms, is e-mail. The use of the Internet

for e-mail long predated the invention of web browsers, and the hardware and software requirements

for straight e-mail, as opposed to e-commerce, are very small. The benefits of e-commerce include

the provision of vast amounts of free information that was formerly expensive or inconvenient to

obtain, including travel and sports schedules, hotel descriptions, maps, directions, news, security

prices, and even entire encyclopedias. When items are purchased over the web rather than obtained

for free, selection is often much better (especially for books, CDs and videos) than at traditional
                                                                             Industrial Revolution, Page 38



bricks and mortar stores, and prices are often lower, sometimes even when shipping costs are

included. Auctions on sites like E-Bay provide a new mechanism that allows the flea market to

spread from local communities and neighborhoods to a worldwide community of potential buyers and

sellers. According to Smith, Bailey, and Brynjolfsson (1999), "early research suggests that electronic

markets are more efficient than conventional markets with respect to price levels, menu costs, and

price elasticity . . . although several studies find significant price dispersion in Internet markets."

        If e-commerce contributes to holding down prices of goods traded in the non-computer part

of the economy, then this will provide an additional factor holding down inflation in addition to the

direct impact of the falling prices of computer hardware discussed earlier. However, the low prices

of many consumer web vendors have resulted in unsustainable financial losses financed temporarily

but surely not permanently by venture capitalists and stockholders. It remains to be seen how much

the web reduces consumer prices once stockholders begin to require that e-commerce vendors

actually earn profits (see Byron, 2000).52



Qualifying the Internet Benefit: Numbers of Products and a Fixed Time Endowment

        The enormous variety of products and services available on the internet, both for free and for

pay, might seem to be an invention worthy of comparison with the Great Inventions of the past. Yet

the mere fact that new products and services are being developed is not sufficient for an Industrial

Revolution, which requires that the rate of improvement must be greater than in the past. In Triplett's



         52. Bulkeley and Carlton (2000, p. A4) report the following ratios of net profits to 1999 sales: Amazon.com
-43.9, buy.com -21.8, eToys -110.3, and drugstore.com -331.8.
                                                                   Industrial Revolution, Page 39



insightful critique (1999, pp. 326-27), the enthusiastic retelling of anecdotes about the New Economy

ignores the distinction between arithmetic numbers and logarithmic growth rates. If an economy has

10 products and invents a new one, the growth rate is 10 percent. If many years later the economy

has 100 products, it must invent 10 new ones to grow at the same rate and invent 12 or 13 to register

a significant increase in the growth rate. Today's U. S. real GDP is more than 40 times greater than

in 1880, but does anyone think that today we are inventing 40 times as many products as in a single

decade that yielded the invention of electricity, the telephone, motion pictures, the phonograph, the

indoor toilet, and the many others discussed above?

       Skepticism of the importance of the Internet viewed as an invention need to distinguish

between consumer welfare and productivity. For consumers the new combination of home PCs and

web access provides a valuable invention, for otherwise why would internet access reach a 50 percent

household penetration rate only six years after the invention of web browsers? But here again, as for

computers in general, the vast new variety of Internet products collides with the same fixed quantity

of time available to each household member. Thus much internet use represents a substitution from

other forms of entertainment. Internet games replace hand-held games. Downloaded internet music

replaces purchased CDs. Internet pornography replaces purchased or rented adult videos. Other

forms of internet entertainment and surfing for information replace hours previously spent watching

television or reading books. New evidence of diminishing returns is now emerging: use of PCs and

of the Internet is declining among newer purchasers who paid less for their machines and appear to

value them less: "new purchasers who paid less than $1,000 for their machines are less involved with

them," and apparently only two-thirds of computer owners who subscribe to Internet services actually
                                                                      Industrial Revolution, Page 40



use them (Clark, 1999). As Herbert Simon once said "A wealth of information creates a poverty of

attention".53



Why Isn't the Internet More Productive?

        Finally, we come to the essential question raised by our previous productivity decomposition:

why has not the New Economy in general and the Internet in particular boosted MFP growth outside

of the durable manufacturing sector? What explains the apparent contradiction between this

unimpressive productivity performance and the eagerness with which millions of business firms and

consumers have purchased business and home computers, as well as internet infrastructure, spawning

whole new industries and creating vast wealth?            This conflict is highlighted by findings in

microeconomic cross-section studies that computers raise productivity at the level of individual firms.

For instance, Brynjolfsson and Hitt (1996) estimate that the gross rate of return on investment in

computers exceeds 50 percent annually, compared to 15 to 20 percent for other investments in the

sample of firms that they analyzed.

          At least four factors may play a role in resolving the conflict: market-share protection,

recreation of old activities rather than creation of new activities, duplicative activity, and consumption

on the job. The need to protect market share against competitors explains much of the investment

and maintenance expense of web sites. Barnes and Noble and Borders would have been content to

play a dominant role in the retailing of books but were forced by competition from Amazon to

become "clicks and mortar" organizations by developing their own web sites that duplicated much


        53. This quote was related to me by Hal Varian.
                                                                                 Industrial Revolution, Page 41



of their previous retail activity and most of what Amazon had already pioneered. More generally,

computers are used extensively to provide information aimed at taking customers, profits, or capital

gains away from other companies. This is a zero-sum game involving redistribution of wealth rather

than the increase of wealth, yet each individual firm has a strong incentive to make computer

investments that, if they do not snatch wealth away from someone else, at least act as a defensive

blockade against a hostile attack. This may be at the heart of the apparent contradiction between the

Brynjolffson-Hitt micro evidence and the failure of computers to spark a productivity growth revival

outside of durable manufacturing; the high payoff to computers for individual firms may reflect

redistributions to computer-using firms from firms that use computers less intensively. There is a

"keeping up with the Joneses" aspect of hardware and software purchase motivated by competition,

employee satisfaction, and employee recruitment.54

         Second, much internet content is not truly new, but rather consists of preexisting forms of

information now made available more cheaply and conveniently, in contrast to the sense in which the

Great Inventions created truly new products and activities. Internet surfing of airline schedules

provides a lower cost, although not necessarily faster, alternative method of obtaining information

already available in airline timetables, from the printed Official Airline Guide, and from the

neighborhood travel agent. Obtaining stock quotes and performing trades on the web does not

represent the invention of a new activity but rather a reduction in cost of performing an old activity.




          54. There seems to be a deeper contradiction between the macro and micro evidence that has not yet been
resolved. For instance, in a study of MFP growth and computer capital across a number of industries, Stiroh (1998)
finds that "For all computer-using sectors . . .the average growth rate of multifactor producitivity fell while [computer]
capital grew."
                                                                            Industrial Revolution, Page 42



        A third factor subtracting from productivity is the duplicative aspect of the Internet. Much

e-commerce is an alternative to mail-order catalog shopping (another invention of the 1870s).55 Just

as Wanamaker's and Macy's department stores began to issue catalogs to supplement their existing

retail operations in the early 1870s, so Land's End, Spiegel's, and many other catalog operators have

supplemented their existing operations with web sites in the late 1990s. Yet the catalogs have not

disappeared; the full cost of printing and mailing the catalogs is still incurred, but on top of that must

be expended many millions on developing and maintaining duplicative web sites. While it is cheaper

to take an order from a web customer than with a human worker answering a phone, much of the rest

of the transaction involves the same physical input of labor in building and stocking warehouses,

selecting items from warehouse shelves, packing them, and shipping them. The brown UPS trucks

are thriving with e-commerce, but each truck still requires one driver. Far from reducing or

eliminating the use of paper, in the electronic age "For getting attention in a professional way, paper

still matters. Nobody even asks anymore if paper is going away."56                     An example closer to

home is the added cost to academic societies of developing web sites to provide information already

available in their printed journals. The Econometric Society now provides duplicate announcements

of most of its activities through the back pages of its journal and through its web site, which costs

money to develop and maintain, and it like other societies is under increasing pressure to provide the

contents of its journal and even papers given at its regional meetings for free to its members on the




        55. The history of mail-order catalogs is summarized in Gordon (1990), pp. 419-23.

         56. The speaker is the president of NowDocs.com, as quoted by Doan (2000, p. 140). On the growth in paper
usage, see also "Bad News for Trees," Economist, December 19, 1998, pp. 123-6.
                                                                                Industrial Revolution, Page 43



web. Costs increase and membership erodes as information becomes available for free. Economists

gain a consumer surplus in having more convenient access to research, but convenience for professors

is not a final good. The final product, education and research, is affected little if at all by the ease of

access of references.57

         Finally, productivity on the job may be impaired by the growing use of business computers

with continuous fast web access for consumption purposes. A research service finds that people

spend more than twice as much time online at the office as they do at home, and that web users at the

office take advantage of high-speed connections to access entertainment sites more frequently at work

than at home. In fact the most-visited site from the office is eBay, and three financial trading sites

are not far behind (Farrell, 2000, p. A1). Traffic on many consumer-oriented web sites peaks not at

night, when people are at home, but in the middle of the day, when they are at work.58 The media

have gleefully reported that a large fraction of on-line equity trading is happening at the office, not

at home.59 Employers are so disturbed by the contining use of office computers for personal e-mail

that the number of companies using "surveillance software" to monitor their employees' e-mail usage

is "soaring" (Guernsey, 2000, p. C1). While it may be unusual to include a cartoon in an academic



          57. In a related investigation of the payoff for academic research of information technology, Hamermesh and
Oster (1997) find that articles with co-authors working at long distance from each other actually have fewer citations
than other articles; "a greater ease of overcoming distance does not enhance productivity" (p. 18). They interpret the
rise in long-distance co-authorship as mainly a consumption good as academic friends find it easier to work together.

         58. "Online-shopping traffice doesn't surge in the dead of night but in the middle of the workday, experts say.
Active Research Inc., a San Francisco Web-based market-research company, says retail clicks begin to gain steam
around 9 a.m. and spike around lunchtime. Gamedealer.com, an Internet games site, says 65% of its orders are placed
during the weak from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m" (De Lisser, 1999).

Times, May 20, 1999, p. A1.

paper, Figure 6 is a perfect way to close this section.



A Possible Qualification: Mismeasurement

       A possible resolution to the Solow paradox, which remains intact outside of durable

manufacturing, is that many of the benefits of computers have been mismeasured. PCs and the

Internet have doubtless created consumer surplus, but so did most of the Great Inventions of the past.

Several thought experiments provide convincing evidence. For instance, we might gather together

a group of Houston residents and ask them "if you could choose only one of the following two

inventions, air conditioning or the Internet, which would you choose?" A parallel question might be

asked in Minneapolis, "if you could choose only one of the following two inventions, indoor plumbing

or the Internet, which would you choose?"

       In addition to the likelihood that even larger amounts of consumer surplus were missed in the

past, another overriding factor limits the importance of the measurement issue. The heaviest uses of

computers are in industries that provide mainly or entirely intermediate goods, especially wholesale

trade, finance, many parts of the insurance industry, business services, and legal services. If

computers truly raised the output of these intermediate industries in unmeasured ways, then the

benefits should show up in the output of final goods industries that exhibit higher output in relation

to their undermeasured inputs. Yet this spillover from intermediate to final goods industries is just

what cannot be found in the official data on output and productivity growth, at least outside of the

durable manufacturing sector.

Conclusion

       This paper reaches the paradoxical conclusion that the "New Economy," defined as the post-

1995 acceleration in the rate of technical change in information technology, together with the

development of the Internet, has been both a great success and a profound disappointment. The

resolution of this paradox is that the New Economy has created a dynamic explosion of productivity

growth in the durable manufacturing sector, both in the manufacturing of computers and

semiconductors and of other types of durables. Beyond normal cyclical effects and some minor

factors, all of the acceleration in the growth rate of labor productivity after 1995 in the aggregate

economy can be traced to the New Economy operating through three channels, an acceleration in

multi-factor productivity (MFP) growth in computers themselves, an investment boom which has

caused an acceleration of capital deepening attributable entirely to computers and semiconductors

(with no contribution from other types of capital), and an acceleration in MFP growth in the rest of

durable manufacturing — including New Economy industries like telecommunications. This

productivity explosion has boosted the economy's overall rate of productivity growth, reduced the

inflation rate, created enormous wealth in the stock market, and allowed the Fed to postpone the

tightening of monetary policy in the face of a steadily declining unemployment rate.

       However, the remaining part of the paradox is what concerns us. Our decomposition of

productivity growth leaves less than nothing left over for the 88 percent of the economy outside of

durable manufacturing; trend MFP growth there has actually decelerated. Not only has there been

no spillover from the New Economy in the form of a structural acceleration in MFP growth in the rest
                                                                   Industrial Revolution, Page 46



of the economy, but there has not even been an acceleration in trend labor productivity growth in

response to a massive investment boom in computers and related equipment. Outside of durable

manufacturing, the New Economy has been remarkably unfruitful as a creator of productivity growth.

       Part of our conclusion is based on an analysis which divides the post-1995 acceleration in

productivity growth between a permanent trend effect and a temporary cyclical effect, building on

a previous literature showing that productivity grows more rapidly than trend when output grows

faster than trend. Since even the most optimistic advocates of a New Economy revolution deny that

the ebullient rates of output growth in 1998 and especially 1999 were sustainable, some fraction of

the productivity revival must be temporary. In developing the trend-cycle split, we had to interpret

the decline in the actual unemployment rate that had allowed output to grow so rapidly during 1995-

99. Of the decline in the unemployment rate from 5.6 percent in 1995 to 4.2 percent in 1999, we

assumed that 0.6 points of the decline were sustainable and 0.8 were not. An alternative assumption

that 1.1 points were sustainable and 0.4 points were not would shift 0.11 percentage points of annual

productivity growth from the cyclical to trend category and modify our conclusions modestly but

would not change our most surprising conclusion, that trend MFP growth outside of durable

manufacturing has actually slowed since 1995.

       In assessing the importance of the New Economy and particularly the Internet as an invention,

we have applied a tough test. To measure up, the New Economy had to equal the combined impact

of five clusters of Great Inventions that originated in the period 1860-1900 and together constitute

what is sometimes called the "Second Industrial Revolution." In one sense the question answers itself

by simply listing the honor roll of Great Inventions, some of which were electric light, the electric
                                                                     Industrial Revolution, Page 47



motor, the automobile, motor transport, air transport, the modern chemical industry, the telephone,

the motion picture, radio, television, and last but not least, the indoor toilet. Even derivatives of

electricity like the air conditioner are probably more valued by the consumer, at least in the southern

half of the United States, than the invention of the Internet, and of course the computer and the

Internet were in this sense subsidiary inventions that required the prior invention of electricity.

       The fundamental economics of the computer in general and the Internet in particular establish

a conflict between rapid exponential growth in computer speed and memory on the one hand, and the

fixed endowment of human time on the other. As a result most of the initial applications of the

mainframe and personal computers have encountered the rapid onset of diminishing returns, and much

of the use of the Internet represents a substitution from one type of entertainment or information-

gathering to another. Internet surfing may be fun, but it represents a far smaller increment in the

standard of living than achieved by the extension of day into night achieved by electric light, the

revolution in factory efficiency achieved by the electric motor, the flexibility and freedom achieved

by the automobile, the saving of time and shrinking of the globe achieved by the airplane, the new

materials achieved by the chemical industry, the first sense of live two-way communication achieved

by the telephone, the arrival of live news and entertainment into the family parlor achieved by radio

and then television, and the enormous improvements in life expectancy, health, and comfort achieved

by urban sanitation and indoor plumbing.

              Labor hours (line 2): Table 1, line 7, divided by 0.67, the implicit share of labor.

              Capital (line 3): Composition-adjusted capital (see below for source of line 7) minus
              0.71, which is the difference between the growth of capital services and capital stock
              in Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000, Tables 1 and 2, column 1).

              MFP (line 6): Output growth minus input growth, using weights of 0.67 and 0.33 on
              labor and capital, respectively.

              Labor hours (line 7): Table 1, line 7 plus line 8, divided by 0.67, the implicit share of
              labor.

              Capital (line 8): Table 1, line 2 plus line 6, divided by 0.33, the implicit share of
              capital.
