                                  ABSTRACT


        This paper examines the flexibility of wages across industries in
the U.S. and seeks to determine the potential impact which changes in the
industrial wage structure may have for employment.

        With regard to the flexibility of wages across industries, we find
that the U.S., alone among the major OECD countries, has experienced
substantial changes in the industry wage structure since 1970, with the
variation of log wages among industries increasing dramatically, particularly
in the l970s. This represents a widening of the gap between wages in the
high and low wage sectors. In order to evaluate these changes, we estimate
equations linking changes in industry wages over an extended period of time
to a variety of potential wage determining characteristics. We find that
industrial wages are positively correlated with value productivity per
worker, even after controlling for institutional and supply side factors
which may have contributed to the increased dispersion of wages in the
1970s. Our results are not consistent with the standard competitive model
of industry labor markets, in which wages and productivity are uncorrelated
across sectors and wages depend on aggregate, rather than sectoral
conditions.

        With regard to the impact of a flexible industry wage structure on
employment, we evaluate the circumstances under which flexible wages among
industries may be employment enhancing, and the set of circumstances under
which flexible wages are likely to be employment reducing. For the U.S.
economy in the 1970s we find that the data support the latter set of cir-
cumstances. The bottom line of the U.S. experience is that flexible wages
by industry have not contributed to employment growth.

            In contrast to the employment experience of most OECD countries, the

U.S. experienced a substantial increase in employment in the 1910s. In 1910,

80.8 million persons held jobs. In June of 1983, with the economy recovering

were   historically high        in the U.S. in the 1910s, so too were

employment/population           ratios. Some have argued that the great growth of       jobs   in
the   U.S. is attributable to wage flexibility in terms of aggregate wages, or in

terms of relative adjustments across sectors. The extent to which U.S. aggre-

gate wage flexibility contributes to job creation has been much debated in the

literature (see Sachs, Branson and Rotemberg, Gordon).

           This paper examines wage flexibility across industries and its connec-

tion to the growth of employment. We find little evidence linking the U.S.

employment record to flexible wages across industries. While it is true that

industry wages vary with industry conditions to a greater extent in the U.S.

than in other OECD countries, it is not true that this enhances employment. In

the 1970s it created greater dispersion of earnings across industry lines

and shifts of labor across industries in a fashion inconsistent with standard

models of how competitive markets determine wages and allocate employment among

industries. Consistent with our rejection of the link between industry wage

flexibility    and employment growth is       the fact that the other major       OECD country
                                      2




with a sizeable expansion of employment over this period, Japan, has had a very

different wage setting pattern, with little or no flexibility of relative wages

among industries.

          The paper is divided into three sections. Section one documents the

fact that industry wages in the U.S. are flexible, in the sense of responding to

industry specific conditions. Section two argues that flexibility in the

industry wage structure is neither inherently good nor bad for employment. It

lays out two polar cases: the "competitive flexibility case" in which a

flexible industry wage structure is employment enhancing; and the "industry—

productivity—wage case" in which flexibility of wages may reduce employment.

Section three seeks to determine whether the observed flexibility of the U.S.

industrial wage structure is closer to the former or to the latter case.

I. Does the U.S. Have a Flexible Industry Wage Strucuture?

             By this question we mean, do wages respond to industry—level con-

ditions, so that the pattern of wage differentials among industries varies over

time?

             Our answer is yes. Alone among the major OECJ) countries the U.S. has

experienced substantial changes in the industry wage structure, with the

variation of log wages among industries increasing dramatically, particularly in

the 1970s.

            Figure 1 documents this claim for the period l948 to 192. It graphs

the standard deviation of the log of nominal wages per full—time equivalent

worker across 53      industries   in the National Income and Product Accounts. What

stands    out is the incease in dispersion in the 1970s, which goes far beyond

well—known cyclical swings in the industry wage structure, which produce greater

inequality in wages across industries in recessions than in booms (Wachter)*.

            The pattern of increased inequality in the industrial wage structure

runs    counter   to the long term trend in the U.S. toward lower dispersion of wages

among industries (Cullen; Reynolds and Taft). Except for the periods of adjust-

ment in the aftermath of Wil and the Korean War, when wage dispersion, measured

in this way, rose slightly,industrial wage dispersion has tended to narrow with

the passage of time. The 1910's have broken considerably with this tradition.

In every year since 1910 wage dispersion measured across sectors both at the

two—digit and the four—digit level has increased, producing an overall rise of

35° during the period from 19'T0—19R2. Given the well documented growth of the

service sector economy over this period, and the low—paying attributes of work

in many of the expanding sectors,' it is conceivable that the trend increase in

dispersion results from a widening in the differential between service and manu-

facturing wages. To test this proposition, we examined wage dispersion in the

service and manufacturing sectors individually and found that in both sectors of

the economy industrial wage dispersion has trended upward over the seventies.

While the absolute level of wage dispersion has been historically higher in ser-

vices, the rate of increase in the dispersion of wages was greater in the manu-

facturing sector of the economy. (3)% and 25 respectively).

          The increase in dispersion in wages in the U.S. reflects a sizeable

widening of the gap between wages in the high and low wage sectors. As an

example of the change in the gap consider the ratio of the wage in petroleum

and coal products, one of the highest paying two—digit sectors, to that in

apparel, one of the lowest paying two—digit sectors. In 1910 the ratio stood at

2.02; in 1982, it was 2.82. Similarly, if we take the ratio of wages in a high

paying four digit industry, like railroad equipment, to the ratio of wages in a

low paying four—digit industry, like carpets and rugs, we find that this ratio

increased from 1.69 in 1910 to 2.)45 in 1980.

          To determine whether the U.S. experience is unique, and thus poten—

tially    a cause of the country's superior employment record in the 1970s, we

have calculated for each of the major OECD countries the dispersion in

industrial wages since 1975 using readily available manufacturing data.2 As can

be seen in Table 1, the pattern of increasing dispersion in the 1970s is unique

to the U.S. In Western Europe and Japan industry wage structures have been

relatively stable or have narrowed in the 1910s, at least in manufacturing. We

are therefore dealing with changes in the industry wage structure of a magnitude

that distinquishes the U.S. from other developed economies.


Industry Wage Equations

             Since the underlying factor in the industry wage structure are wages

by industry, we estimate next equations linking changes in industry wages over

an extended period of time to various potential wage determining characteristics.

To examine industry wages we use variants of the following equation:

     (i)          mW. = a + bLln(VA/L.) +
                     1               1
                                              cF      +   dlnSkill   +   eUnion.1   +   p.1
where w =     wage in industry i

         VA/L =    value   productivity per worker

      F = proportion of workers who are women

      Skill =       a variable wage weighted index of the occupations in an industry

                     (:w a •) where the WS is the national wage in the occupation

                     and   = share of occupation in employment.

      union.        =   proportion   unionized.


             The key "industry specific" variable in this equation is the level of

value productivity per worker, which we will later decompose into physical pro—

ductivity per worker arid output price. The notion that industrial productivity

trends affect industry wages has a long history in economic thought, with some

early post—World War II studies of industrial wages finding evidence of a weak

positive link between changes in wages and productivity at the industrial level

(see Dunlop, Garbino). The prevailing view, however, favors the competitive

model in which wages and productivity are uncorrelated across sectors, and where

wages depend on aggregate, rather than sectoral conditions (see Salter, Bolby

and Meyers, and most recently Kendrick).

          The other variables in the equation reflect two supply side factors

likely to affect industry wages, namely the proportion of female errrployment in a

sector, and the richness of occupational mix, as well as two institutional

forces likely to have increased the dispersion of wages in the l9TOs, namely

the percentage of workers unionized within an industry, and the percentage of

workers within a collective bargaining agreement who are covered by a cost of

living adjustment provision.


The Proportion Female

          Women on average in the U.S. earn 6)4 cents for every dollar earned by

a man. The rapid rise of women in the labor force over the last decade implies

that in industries with a growing share of female employees the measured

average wage paid to workers will fall. Hence, holding all else constant, sec-

tors which experienced a growth in female employment will have slower wage

growth over this period, potentially contributing to the dispersion of wages

across sectors. To examine the importance of this factor we obtained 1970
                                       9




Census of Population data on the number of female employees within detailed sec-

tors, and updated this with data from Employment and Earnings in 1982.3

We then enter the change in the proportion of female employment by industry into

our wage equation.


Occupational Mix

          In a well functioning industry labor market, with full labor mobility,

wage differentials across industries will result exclusively from skill dif-

ferences among workers and/or compensating differentials due to the nature of

work. While there is strong evidence suggesting that skill differentials

have increased over the 19T0's in response to generally slack labor market con-

ditions (Hamermesh and Bees), little empirical research has been devoted to a

study of the effects of inter—industry changes in skill mix on the industrial

wage structure. If the mix of skills across industries were to change, then the

pattern of wage movement we observe across industries should change as well. To

measure this important factor we have obtained data from the Current Population

Survey on major occupation by detailed industry for l92 and 1982 for a subset

of thirty—six two digit industries) We calculate an index of skill mix, E..w

for each industry, weighting the proportion of workers in a given occupation by

the national wage for the occupation, and enter the change in the mix into our

industry wage equation.5


The Effects of Unionization

          The union variable is introduced to take account of the well—known
                                          10




growth of the union premium in the 1910s (see Johnson; Freeman and Medoff). We

use the Freeman—Medoff series from the 1968—1912 Expenditures for Employee

Compensation (EEC) Survey aggregated from 3—digit Census codes to comply as clo-

sely as possible with the NIPA 2—digit industry codes.6


The Effects of Cost of Living Adjustment Provisions

          To account for the gaining importance of cost of living adjustment

clauses (COLA's) in major collective bargaining agreements in the 1910's, (See

Jacoby and Pearl) we include data on the percentage of workers within two—digit

SIC industry covered by COLA provisions in 1980.1


Data Source

          The primary   data   set used in our analysis is from the National Income

and Products Accounts (NIPA). It contains data by two digit (1912 SIC codes)

industry on wages and salaries, compensation, full—time equivalent employment,

part—time employment, national income, real gross national product, and real

implicit price deflators. The data are available for 20 industries in the manu-

facturing sector, 13 industries in services, 5 mining industries, 11 industries

in transportation and public utilities, and 6 industries in finance, insurance,

and real estate, for the period 1929—1982. In order to ensure a consistent time

series of industries in all our analyses with the NIPA data, we were forced to

omit several of the industries for which there was insufficient data. Our analy-

ses were therefore made for 53 industries in total.

          To supplement the NIPA data, we used Census of Manufactures Data
                                       11




(COM) on 1450 four—digit (1912 SIC codes) manufacturing industries from

1958—1980. This data contains information on wages, employment, labor produc-

tivity, total factor productivity and price deflators (based on the value of

shipments and provided by the Bureau of Industrial Economics).


Empirical Results

          Columns 1 — 4 of Table 2 present our basic results for the NIPA data for

the period l91O_l9828 Column (1) shows that changes in wages are indeed positively

related to changes in value productivity by industry. Column (2) decomposes the

changes in value productivity into changes in prices and in output per worker and

finds that while both terms matter, the price term has a somewhat greater effect

on wages. Column (3) shows that while changes in the percent female, in the skill

mix, and in the percent covered by collective bargaining affect wages in the ex—

expected manner, they do not substantially reduce the coefficient on changes in

value productivity. Column (14) shows that the addition of the COLA variable, while

important in explaining wages, does not affect the wage—productivity link.9

          Columns (5) through (8) of the table record results with the Census of

Manufactures data. These data have the advantage of covering more industries,

with presumably better productivity measures than are available outside of manu-

facturing at the cost of being limited to one—fifth of the workforce. Column

determining industry wages. In column (1) we attempt to control for supply side

changes and union effects. While we have information on unionization at a three

digit industry level,1-° we have not obtained skill or sex distribution figures

and thus choose to enter three digit industry dummy variables into the

regression to control for all possible 3—digit industry differences. The

results show a continued effect for industry—specific conditions on wages, as

reflected in the coefficients on changes in value productivity) across sectors.11

Finally, in column (8), we report results with changes in total factor produc-

tivity rather than in labor productivity as our independent variable and also

obtain significant sizeable coefficients)-2

             As a further check on our major finding we regressed wage changes on

value productivity changes using one additional source of data on labor pro-

ductivity growth from Kendrick (see Interindustry Differences in Productivity

Growth, Table 3). These data have the advantage of being compiled from a

variety of sources by the American Productivity Center (see Kendrick, Appendix

A), although to their disadvantage they were only available at a two—digit

manufacturing level. In column (9) we see that these data produce similar

results, with industrial wages responding to industrial price and productivity

movements.

             Overall, our results show that industry wage differentials in the U.S.

responded to industry level conditions in the 1970s, a finding which contrasts

sharply with the conclusions of most earlier studies that found wage and produc-

tivity movements were not correlated at the sectoral level (see Salter for the
                                            l4



U.K.,   Bolby and Meyers). While   it   is possible that our results may   be due to
the omission of some aspect of labor quality that has diverged greatly across

industries, the general consistency of our finding across data sets makes this

possibility highly unlikely. The imperviousness of the findings to the addition

of labor quality controls and unionisation variables 13, together with the observed

increased dispersion   of sectoral wages, suggests that industry wages     are indeed

responsive to industry conditions. On the basis of the constancy of the rela-

tive wage structure in other major OECD countries as shown in table 1, and a

brief examination of the relation between changes in value productivity and

wages across two—digit industries in Japan which produced essentially a zero

wage—productivity correlation,1 we conclude that this pattern of wage behavior

is unique to the U.S. econoniy. A possible explanation for the singular U.S.

industrial experience is that the American industrial relations system is highly

decentralized with thousands of different firms andunions determining wages, in

contrast to the more centralized wage setting mechanisms found in most other

countries (Bruno and Sachs).

II.   When   Does Industry Wage Flexibility Enhance Employment and When Does it
Reduce Employment?
             It   is corrimon to hear the claim that "wage flexibility" is inherently
good for   employment. After all, don't wage concessions save Jobs in declining

industries? While       concessions   in declining industries may indeed enhance

employment, economists have long recognized that wage flexibility across

industries is not uniformly good for employment. In particular, when industry

wages respond to industry—specific productivity patterns with sectors

experiencing rapid productivity growth raising wages more than other sectors,

"flexibility" can reduce employment in the technologically advancing sectors and

possibly in the econor overall. In this section we sketch out briefly the cir-

cumstances in which flexible wages among industries may be employment—enhancing

(the competitive flexibility case) and the circumstances in which flexible wages

among industries can reduce employment (the industry productivity—wage—

flexibility case). Whether flexibility of wages among industries in the U.S.

helps or hinders the growth of employment and the reduction of unemployment

depends on which circumstances best fit U.S. industrial wage developments.

Competitive Flexibility

             When industry wages are responsive to shifts in demand and supply for

workers in particular industries, employment will be greater than if wages are

inflexible. Consider for example, wage responses to upward and downward shifts

in demand. If short run labor supply schedules are upward sloping, as seems

reasonable, wage increases are necessary to increase employment when demand
                                      16




rises, while wage decreases will ameliorate the employment loss due to demand

declines. In such a setting, dynamic shifts in the demand for labor across

industries will produce wage dispersion for similar workers among industries and

a positive relationship between changes in wages and changes in employment in

the short run. The extent of wage flexibility necessary to produce a given

employment change within a sector will depend on the labor demand and supply

elasticities governing behavior within the sector, and on conditions external to

the industry, such as the total number of unemployed workers.

          According to the competitive model, however, differentials in pay of

equivalent workers across industries should be short lived, as mobility of

workers produces roughly equal pay for equal work. Workers will move to

industries which have had positive demand "shocks," thereby reducing the

measured average wage and expanding employment even more. In equilibrium,

industrial wage differentials will result exclusively from skill—differences

among workers and/or compensating differentials due to the nature of work.

While changing demand for labor may influence wages in the short run as adjust-

ment takes place along upward sloping labor supply curves, in the long run it is

mostly through employment, not wages, that adjustment takes place. Mobility of

workers ultimately links industrial wages to aggregate, rather than sectoral

conditions, and assures the long run elimination of wage differentials created

by demand "shocks." A competitive industry wage structure should therefore, be

responsive to industry—specific factors in the short run but not in the long

run.
                                          17




Industry Productivity—Wage F'lexihility

          While short—run wage flexibility due to competitive forces is

employment enhancing, flexibility due to industry—specific conditions inde-

pendent of shifts in the demand or supply of labor need not have salutorious

employment consequences. Consider, for example, a labor market in which wages

respond to industry specific changes in value productivity per worker which do

not reflect shifts in labor demand. While downward flexibility of wages in

response to declines in value productivity per worker can still "save" jobs,

upward flexibility of wages in response to increases in value productivity per

worker will, in the same sense, "cost" jobs, with industries experiencing rapid

value productivity growth hiring too few workers. Whether or not wage flexibi-

lity of this type is good or bad for aggregate employment in comparison with

the employment consequences of an inflexible industry wage system will depend

both on the mix of positive and negative productivity shocks among industries,

and on the extent of downward and upward flexibility in wages. With equal sized

positive and negative "shocks" to demand in equal sized sectors with equal

elasticities of labor demand and labor supply, a flexible relative wage system

will not necessarily lead to greater employment. If there is an asymetry in

response patterns, with wages declining more in industries doing poorly than

rising in booming sectors, a flexible wage system will produce more employment

than an inflexible system. If instead, wages fall less with relative produc-

tivity declines than wages rise with relative productivity increases, the system

of flexible wages will on net result in less employment than would otherwise
                                      18




have been observed.

          In principle, then, there are two possible situations in which wage

flexibility among industries has positive employment consequences:   (a) when the

wages reflect "competitive" market forces; and (b) when wages are more flexible

downward than upward to industry—specific productivity (or other) developments.

III.   Employment Consequences of Industry Wage Flexibility in the U.S.

          To determine whether the observed industry wage flexibility in the

U.S. has contributed to, or detracted from, employment growth, we examine clo-

sely the 'meaning' of   the positive relation between growth of industry produc-
tivity and growth of wages found in Table 2, and test for assymetries in

responses to changes in sectoral value productivity.15
          The productivity—wage relations found in Table 2 would fit   the com-

petitive model   and thus be employment increasing if industries with relatively

rapid productivity growth also experienced relatively rapid growth of labor

demand. In this case productivity growth would be correlated positively with

employment growth, as the associated wage increases attract greater labor to the

high productivity growth sectors. In his classic book Productivity and

Technical Change, Salter found Just such a strong positive correlation between

productivity growth and employment growth in the United Kingdom (line 5, table

3). As lines 1 and 3 of table 3 show, we find exactly the opposite pattern

among U.S. industries in the l9TOs. Industries with rapid productivity growth

tended to have lower rather than higher employment growth, making it difficult

to interpret the industry patterns in competitive terms as demand shifts along

upward—sloping supply curves. Lines 2 and 14 of the Table, which reveal a posi-

tive correlation between the growth of wages and the level of wages across

industries,   are also inconsistent with the competitive wage flexibility

 interpretation. It is difficult to argue that industries which already pay

above—average wages "need" wage increases to attract more labor, especially in a

decade of generally slack labor markets. But, as indicated by the increase in

wage dispersion found in Figure 1, this is precisely what occured in the l9Os:

large wage increases in high wage sectors.

          The suggestion here is that the industry wage and employment figures

do not reflect the competitive flexibility model but rather the industry—

productivity—wage model, in which increases in wages may reduce employment along

demand schedules. To examine this point further we estimate the following simple

labor demand relation across industries.

         (2)     lnE =
                     1
                           cx   +   lnW1IF.
                                         1    +   glnO 1

where lnE. = change in log of employment in industry i

      lnW./P. = change in log of product wage in industry i

      LlnO. = change in real output in industry i

          As Table       shows, the patterns of change in employment, wages, and

output by industry fit such a demand relation quite well. Industries with rela-

tive product wage increases had relative employment decreases, output held

fixed. While we are aware that equation (1) and equation (2) are not indepen-

dent of one another and can be analysed with a simultaneous model in which both

wages and employment are endogeneous1-6 the fact is that each shows wage—

employment behavior inconsistent with the standard competitive model of industry

labor markets.

          It is, of course, still possible that the flexibility of wages across

industries is employment enhancing. If wages respond more to relative declines

in productivity than to relative increases in productivity, flexibility of

wages will still lead to greater employment. To see if such asymetries hold for

the U.S., we have re—estimated the equations in Table 2 allowing for asymetric

responses of wages to productivity changes, with separate variables for value

productivity increases above and below the average. The results, shown in Table

the T'TIFA data, a l0° change in productivity alters wages by 2.8% in industries

with the best productivity record and by 2.3% in industries with a poor record

of productivity growth during the 1970—1982 period. This same pattern emerges

far more strikingly in the regressions (not reported here) linking annual move-

ments in wages to annual nvements in productivity.17 While the results pre-

sented in column (2) of Table 5 with the C0t data suggest an asymetric response

pattern of wages to value productivity movements which might be slightly

employment enhancing, subsequent regressions using different time periods and

decomposing value productivity into price and output per worker produced the

opposite pattern. In general, the COM results are highly sensitive both to the

time period of analysis, and to the way in which productivity is measured, so

that no pattern is discernable.

         Finally, to see if we can generate any evidence that industry wage

flexibility contributes to employment growth in the U.S. we have taken a more

aggregate approach to examine the possibility of a link between the growth of

employment to population by year and a crude indicator of the change in the

industry wage structure over time, namely, the levl of dispersion in wages by

year. To test this we estimate, using aggregate data from 1950        to   192,18 an
equation of the form:

          (3)ln(E/P) = a + b1nGNP + cow + dT + eT7O

Where E/F = employment to population ratio
      GNP =   GNP   measured in constant 1972 dollars

          =   dispersion   of industry wages in NIPA data

        T =   trend
      T70 =   trend   term for 1970

Our results given below show that, holding fixed for the level of GNP and time,

there is a slight negative correlation between the dispersion of industry wages

and employment/population which would suggest that industry wage flexibility has

little or no relation to aggregate employment)-9

          In sum, our analysis suggests that the flexibility of wages across

industries which we find in the U.S. diverges too much from the competitive

flexibility case to contribute to the growth of employment. If anything, the

disaggregate data suggest that the flexibility of industry wages to industry

value productivity has been harmful to employment.

IV. Conclusion

          In this paper we have examined the flexibility of wages across

industries in the U.S. using various data sets for the entire economy and for

manufacturing industries and examined the impact of the changing industry wage

structure on employment. Our findings can be summarized briefly.


          (1) Contrary to historic patterns, the industrial wage

                structure has become more disperse, with the dis-

                persion of wages measured across sectors in the U.S.

                 increasing in every year since 1970, leading to an

                overall    rise of 35% from 1970—1982. This trend
                has occurred in both nnufacturing and service
                 sectors   of the U.S. economy and has produced an

                overall widening of the U.S. wage structure, with

                the percentage differential between top wage and

                bottom wage quartiles rising from an average of 80%

                 since WWII, to over 90% since 1970.

          (2) This pattern of dispersion is unique to the U.S as a

                 developed economy, as wage dispersion in both

                Western European countries and Japan has either

                remained   constant or declined.
          (3)   Industrial wages at both two—digit and four—digit

                levels are positively correlated with productivity

                and price movements over the postwar period in ways
                                            21




                  not   consistent with the competitive model of

                  industry labor markets.

             (14) The   flexibility of the U.S. industry wage structure

                  has not contributed to employment growth; if

                  anything, it has been inimical to employment and

                  the competitive allocation of labor across sectors.


          To    return to the question with which we began, "Does a flexible
industry wage structure increase employment?" In      theory,   under certain cir—
cumstances,    flexible wages across industries will increase employment, while in

other circumstances they will not. In practice, as far as we can tell for the

U.S. in the 1910s, the experience is that flexible wages by industry      did not
contribute    to eniployment.

1.   See for example, Employment and Training Peport of the President, 1953,

     tables C—4,     C—l4, and   E—R.

2.   International comparisons of hourly compensation costs for production

     workers in manufacturing industries in selected countries are prepared by

     the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Office of

     Productivity and Technolor, annually since 1915. Since the calculation

     of labor compensation does not include the same items in each country

     caution should be exercised in cross—country analysis. Hourly compen-

     sation is converted to U.S. dollars using average daily exchange rates for

     the reference period.

3.   The percentage     of female employment within industry   taken from the 1910

     Census   is   based on 1967 industry SIC codes, and therefore, is not strictly

     applicable to the industry definition used in the Employment and Earnings

     data for the latter period. Any error involved in the matching of the two

     series should not, however, systematically bias the coefficient values on

     the change in percent female by       industry.
4    The unpublished data are provided by the U.S. Department of Labor,

     Bureau of Labor Statistics. The data for 1972 are not adjusted to 19B0

     Census population controls, which have the effect of raising the total

     employment base from 81,702,000 to 82,153,000.

5.   The variable L in Skill is calculated using occupational employment

     by two—digit industry (Current Population Survey) and median weekly
                                            29




     occupational earnings x 52 (Statistical Abstract of the United States) for

     the years 1972 and 1982 in the following manner:

     ln Skill =       in     (a w82 ) — in       (a W )        for   all i

     where i = two—digit industry

           s = one—digit occupation, and
                               th                 th
         a. = share        of s   occupation in        industry.

     in this manner, we explicitly control for changes through time in

     occupational shares across industries and in the occupational wage struc-

     ture, both of which may influence the average occupational skill mix

     across industries.

8.   Though not reported here, in our analysis of industry wages we experiment

     with several different time periods. The results are not sensitive to

     the time period of analysis. Regressions for both the pre-l970s period,

     19)48—1970, and the entire post—World War II period, 19)48—1982 yielded

     qualitatively similar wage—productivity relationships.

9.   The effects of the percent female, the skill mix, the proportion of workers

     covered by   a   collective bargaining agreement, and the percentage of workers
                                                 30




      covered by a COLA provision, were evaluated in the wage model which decom-

      posed price and output per worker as well. Here we obtained:

      ln W =—.Ol + .26         ln   Q/E + .30    1n F +           in Skill —.l2t F + .01 Union
                       (.11)             (.09)            (.01)                (.8)   (.02)
                      + .03 COLA;                                 B2 =   130
                          (.02)
10.   If we simply include unionization in our wage—productivity equation:

      ln W = .Ol + .31 ln VA/L + .02 Union;                     B2 =   451
                          (.02)                (.003)

11.   The regression which decomposes value productivity into price and output

      worker with 3—digit industry controls yields:

      ln W = .05 + .29 AQ/E + .29 P;                    152 =   .666
                          (.02)        (.03)

12.   Total factor productivity growth is calculated as a weighted index of

      various input shares and is, arguably, a truer measure of exogenous tech-

      nical changes among industries.

13.   Reestimating equations () and (5) for the quartile of industries in the

      COM sample with the highest percentage unionized and for the quartile with

      the lowest percentage organized, we obtain in both cases coefficient

      estimates for value productivity of similar magnitude as those obtained in

      the COM full sample regression. This we regard as strong evidence that

      the wage—productivity link operating within industry is the dominant fac-

      tor in explaining sectoral wage performance in the 1910's. For the quar-

      tile industry group with a low percentage of unionized workers we obtain:


      ln W =   •014   +    .29 ln VA/L;                 152 =   .4O

                           (.O4)
                                              31




       Similarly, for the group of industries characterized by a relatively high

       degree of unionization we obtain:


       ln W = .05 +     .32 ln VA/L;                R2   .39

                        (.014)



114.   The regression of percentage change in the wage on the percentage change
       in prices and output per labor (for 11 manufacturing industries) yielded:
       %   W   = .29 —.o6% Q/L + .o8%    F;        R2 = .38
                    (.06)        (.17)

       Data is from the Japanese Handbook of Labor for the period 1960—1980.

15.    We focus on the meaning of the response to sectoral value productivity

       because this is the key determinant of rising dispersion of wages and

       because the impact of this for employment is uncertain. It is obvious

       that responses in wages to skill mix changes, and to changes in the pro-

       portion female is employment enhancing, while changes due to unionization

       are employment reducing.

i6.    The simultaneous two equation model is explored in thesis work currently

       in progress by Linda A. Bell.

17.    In the short term, movements in productivity may be wage dependent and

       therefore not truly exogenous in a wage equation. The technical issue of

       productivity exogeneity in the short and long term is explored in thesis

       work currently in progress by Linda A. Bell.

18.    Population figures are based on U.S. total noninstitutional population,

       aged 16 and over. See Employment and Training Report of the President,

      1983, table A—iT.

19.   We have also estimated variants of equation (3) with current rather than

      constant dollars, and obtained a —.09 (.82) coefficient (standard error on

      the a term. If we eliminate the TTO term, we obtain contradictory

      results with constant and current dollar GNP: a .SO(.i14) coefficient on

      w in the former case compared to —.68(.25) in the latter case. As the

      similar coefficients obtained with inclusion of TTO indicate, these dif-

      ferences reflect different treatment of the 1970s, when productivity

      growth was slow and inflation substantial. While the statistics support

      the current dollar GNP equation (R2 =    .853 vs. B2 = .810), we   believe the

      weak negative results given in the text with the TTO term provide a more

      accurate picture of what the data say.
