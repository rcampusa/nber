               ELECTION POLLS. FREE TRADE. AND THE STOCK MARKET:
               EVIDENCE FROM THE 1988 CANADIAN GENERAL ELECTION


                                   ABSTRACT


     This paper examines the relationship between the Toronto Stock Exchange
(TSE) and election polls during the 1988 Canadian General Election campaign.
Two hypotheses are investigated: first, did polls influence the TSE, and
secondly, if so, did the nature of the influence suggest that investors were
reacting to expectations concerning the effect of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade
Agreement (FTA)? I find that the TSE was positively related to Conservative
popularity as measured by polls, but that the differential movement of TSE sub-
indices does not offer additional support to an FTA based interpretation of
events.
