                                          ABSTRACT

The COVID-19 pandemic led to stark reductions in economic activity in India. We employ
CMIE's Consumer Pyramids Household Survey to examine the timing, distribution, and
mechanism of the impacts from this shock on income and consumption through December 2020.
First, we estimate large and heterogeneous drops in income, with ambiguous effects on
inequality. While incomes of salaried workers fell 35%; incomes of daily laborers fell 75%. At
the same time, we observe that income fell more for individuals from households in the highest
income quartile. Second, we document an increase in effort to buffer income shocks by
switching occupations. We employ a Roy Model to estimate the gains from occupation churn
and find, surprisingly, that reservation wages fell, implying that the risk of COVID did not reduce
the value of employment. Third, we find that consumption fell less than income, suggesting
households were able to smooth the idiosyncratic components of the COVID shock as well as
they did before COVID. Finally, consumption of food and fuel fell less than consumption of
durables such as clothing and appliances. Following Costa (2001) and Hamilton (2001), we
estimate Engel curves and find that changes in consumption reflect large price shocks (rather than
a retreat to subsistence) in sectors other than food and fuel/power. In the food sector, it appear
that lockdown successfully distinguished essential and non-essential services, at least to the
extent that it did not increase the relative price of food. There is some suggestive evidence that
the price shocks outside the food sector were larger in places with greater COVID-19 cases, even
during the lockdown.

1     Introduction
India was hit quickly and hard by SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1A). Although the first case was
reported only on January 30, 2020, urban slums and some states saw a 50% estimated
seroprevalence by July­August 2020. (Mohanan et al., 2020; Malani et al., 2021), leading
to the world's second-highest number of reported cases.1 Even reported cases are likely
an underestimate: seroprevalence studies suggest that official reports may underestimate
cases by 30­100 times (Mohanan et al., 2020; Malani et al., 2021).
    The economic shocks resulting from the pandemic itself were compounded by a severe
series of suppression policies (Figure 1B). India gradually increased international and
local travel bans leading to a nation-wide lockdown on 24 March, 2020. This lockdown
was among the harshest in the world as measured either by ratings in the Oxford Tracker
(Hale et al., 2020) or by Google mobility trends (Google LLC, 2021).2 These joint shocks
of pandemic severity and government responses make it particularly important to study
the economic responses in the context of a developing economy.
    We examine the combined effects of the pandemic and resulting restrictions on eco-
nomic outcomes as measured by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy's (CMIE)
Consumer Pyramids Household Survey. Our paper has both a descriptive component
and an analytic one.
    Our descriptive analysis first documents the decline in income and consumption as-
sociated with COVID-19. We document the timing, extent and distribution of the decline
(relative to 2019 averages) in activity. This analysis shows that employment began to de-
cline before lockdown, suggesting that voluntary social distancing played a role in the
economic effects of COVID-19. Although the decline was most dramatic during lock-
down, there was a quick V-shaped recovery such that activity was down only 15% on
average by December 2020.
    Thereafter, our descriptive analysis demonstrates that the economic shocks had a more
heterogeneous effect on income than consumption.3 . While salaried workers saw mean
income decline by 35% at the worst point in April 2020, daily workers saw their mean
income decline a staggering 75%. However, the consumption response was not very un-
equal: all occupational groups saw mean consumption fall roughly 40%. (We find similar
patterns when we differentiate populations based on pre-COVID income rather than oc-
cupation.) These findings are consistent with credit markets, or some other insurance
mechanism, helping to buffer income shocks during the crisis.
    It should be noted, however, that COVID may not have worsened income inequality.
At the same time that lower wage occupations seem to suffer a greater decline in income,
individuals from higher income households in rural areas experience a bigger decline in
    1 As   of March 2021 (Worldometer, 2021).
    2 We do not contend that the decline in mobility is entirely caused by government orders.  In fact, mobility
fell even before the national lockdown. However, to the extent that the lockdown did reduce mobility,
mobility is measure of the severity of suppression.
    3 This finding is consistent with the idea that inequality in income does not always translate into inequal-

ity in consumption Aguiar and Bils (2015); Krueger and Perri (2006) This analysis is similar to Chaudhuri
and Paxson (2002), which finds that seasonal variation in consumption is less severe than such variation in
income in rural India.

                                                                3
income than those from higher income households. (In urban areas, individual incomes
decline about the same percentage across the household income distribution.) During the
recovery, individuals from higher income households in both rural and urban experience
the weakest recovery in incomes. The discrepancy between the occupation and income
results for inequality may be potentially explained by household composition. Lower in-
come individuals in higher income households may be the first to lose or sacrifice income
and least likely to return to the labor market for fear of contracting COVID.
    The core of our paper examines how individuals managed to cope with this large eco-
nomic shock. With respect to income, we focus on two margins. We first examine whether
the decline in economic activity reduced work on the intensive margin of hours versus
the extensive margin of employment. We find that COVID reduced male employment by
20 percentage points (from a base of 65%) and reduced male hours worked (conditional
on employment) by 1.5 hours per day (from a base of 8 hours).4
    Second, we document how individuals switched occupations (without migrating) to
offset declines in their income. Those who remained employed during the pandemic
increased the rate at which they changed occupations by 50% over their 2019 levels of
baseline occupation switching. We use a Roy Model to estimate the gain from switching
occupation to protect income and find that reservation wages and the gains to switching
declined during the pandemic. The decline in reservation wage suggests that fear of
COVID is not what increased unemployment: that fear would have raised reservation
wages. The decline in reservation wages is also consistent with the idea that aggregate
shocks to household consumption reduce consumption in the unemployed state because
other household member were also more likely to become unemployed.
    With respect to consumption, we do two things. First, we examine the degree of con-
sumption smoothing using Cochrane (1991) or Townsend (1994) style regressions. We
find that households were about as successful at smoothing idiosyncratic shocks during
COVID as before COVID. While this does not suggest full compensation--as COVID was
a large aggregate shock--it does suggest a surprising strength of formal and informal
insurance mechanisms.
    Second, we examine how household allocated their budget across product categories.
We document that individuals reduced their expenditures on some goods (clothes, ap-
pliances, education) far more than on other goods (food, fuel and power, and housing
and rent). We then estimate Engel curves implied by the Almost Ideal Demand System
of Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) to decompose the decline in expenditure into two parts.
One is movement along the pre-COVID Engel curve due to declines in income, holding
the relative prices of goods constant. The other is declines in expenditure due to increases
in the relative price of goods (Hamilton, 2001). This analysis reveals that price shocks
for essential goods such as food and fuel were far less severe than price shocks for other,
non-essential goods. Food and fuel budget shares increased because obey Engel's law and
income declined during COVID. Consumption of categories like clothing suffered mainly
because prices, as perceived by consumers, rose. Examining price shocks across product
categories and locations we find that India's lockdown seems to have successfully distin-
  4 Female
         employment fell about 3 percentage points from a base of 9%. Female hours conditional on
employment fell less than 1 hour from a base of 7 hours per day.

guished between essential (food) and non-essential goods (clothing). Moreover, we find
that the price shock outside food was positively correlated with COVID-19 cases. This
may be evidence that the lockdown had a harsher effect on markets where cases were
higher or that the shadow price of non-essential goods reflects peoples' fears of catching
COVID.
    Our work is related to three lines of research. Our analysis of incomes relates to work
on income smoothing in developing countries (Morduch, 1995; Dercon, 2002). Prior liter-
ature has focused on income smoothing by choice and timing of inputs into farming (Bin-
swanger and Rosenzweig, 1993), occupational diversification within households (Rosen-
zweig and Stark, 1989), migration (Paulson, 1994), and contracting (Bardhan, 1983). Our
work relates more closely to work on smoothing by labor supply on the intensive margin
(Moser, 1998) or across sectors (Kochar, 1999; Rose, 2001). Our work also relates closely
to the literature on occupational mobility (Moscarini and Thomsson, 2007; Kambourov
and Manovskii, 2008, 2009a,b; Groes et al., 2015), how it relates to the business cycle
(Carrillo-Tudela and Visschers, 2020), and the collateral consequences of that adaptation
(Chodorow-Reich and Wieland, 2020).
    Our analysis of consumption relates to a literature that employs Engel curves to iden-
tify bias in CPI measurements (Nakamura, 1995; Hamilton, 2001; Costa, 2001; Logan,
2009; Atkin et al., 2020) or changes or inequality in income (Alm°    as, 2012; Young, 2012;
Aguiar and Bils, 2015; Nakamura et al., 2016). Our work differs in that our goal is not
to identify implicit price changes for the purpose of correcting CPI so much as finding
implicit price changes due to the COVID supply shock.
    Finally, our analysis contributes to a growing literature that seeks to understand the
impact of COVID on economic outcomes overall (Alstadsæter et al., 2020; Chen et al.,
2020) and on inequality (Deaton, 2021; Egger et al., 2021).5 Our work is also related to a
series of papers that examine the impact of government interventions during the COVID
epidemic on consumption (Hoseini and Beck, 2020), though in our case we show that In-
dian government support, though widespread, was modest as a percentage of household
expenses. One feature that distinguishes our work is that we have access to longitudinal
data on households so we are able to control for variation across households. Work that
is similar in purpose and used the same data as the present paper is Bertrand et al. (2020)
and Bertrand et al. (2020), which examine the same data and yields similar descriptive re-
sults, and Deshpande (2020), which uses the same data to examine the impact of COVID
on hours of work. Other papers on the impact of COVID on Indian income include Dhin-
gra and Machin (2020), Lee et al. (2020), Pinto et al. (2020). These papers on India do not
evaluate labor churn or decompose consumption shifts into those due to prices and to
income. A paper that is similar in scope to the present paper but examined the effect of
the currency crisis of 1997 on Indonesia is Frankenberg et al. (2003).
    The remainder of this paper adheres to the following outline. Section 2 describes the
CMIE Consumer Pyramids data. Section 3 characterizes the timing and distribution of
changes in income. Our focus is on how workers tried to smooth income by switching
occupations. Finally section 4 characterizes the timing and distribution of changes in
   5 There are a series of papers that try to measure the impact of COVID on economic activity using indirect

measures such as night lights (Beyer et al., 2020) and NO2 emissions (Deb et al., 2020).

consumption. We use Engel curves to decomposes the consumption response to COVID
into changes due to income and prices.


2     Data
2.1     Consumer Pyramids Household Survey
Our primary data source is the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy's Consumer Pyra-
mids Household Survey (CPHS). This is a panel of roughly 174,000 Indian households
(1.2 million members) surveyed every four months since January 2014. Households are
intended to be representative at the level of urban and rural areas of regions, defined as
clusters of similar districts within a state. Sampling is staggered so that roughly 25% of
all households are sampled each month.
    Sampling and weights. The CPHS covers nearly all states in India except for a few
states in the northeast (e.g., Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunchal Pradesh) that are difficult to
sample because of instability (Vyas, 2020d). CPHS divides each state into homogeneous
regions, clusters of districts with similar features.6 Each region is divided into rural and
urban strata, where rural regions are villages as defined by the Indian Census. The ur-
ban strata is further subdivided into four sub-strata defined by town size. The primary
sampling units are villages and towns. Thirty villages were randomly selected from ru-
ral strata of each region. For urban strata, a random subsample of towns in each sub-
strata are selected. The ultimate sampling units are households. In each selected village
16 households were selected by systematic random sampling (every nth household on a
street, where n is a random number between 5 and 15). In cities, 21 Census Enumera-
tion Blocks (CEB) were randomly selected. In each CEB, 16 households were selected via
systematic random sampling.
    Churn and non-response. The sample churns somewhat over time Vyas (2020c). On
average 2.1% of households are lost in each four month wave and 2.4% are added in
each wave to replace lost households and to grow the sample over time. Weights are in-
cluded to ensure that the sample remains representative of its region. Prior to the COVID
epidemic, response rates were roughly 84%. Non-response was due more to inability to
reach all households in the allotted 4 months for each sampling wave more than refusal
to be surveyed. Separate weights are included in an attempt to correct for non-response.
    During the pandemic, response rates fell (Vyas, 2020a). After states and then the cen-
tral government declared a lockdown in the 3rd week of March, the survey switched tem-
porarily from in-person to telephonic. Response rates during the 19th wave (January­
April 2020) fell to just 64.4% (as low as 30% in April). The 20th wave (May­August 2020)
had a response rate of just 40% (Table 1).
    Nevertheless, CMIE was able to maintain the distribution of surveys across two di-
mensions the same as prior to the pandemic. First, the ratio of rural to urban households
was roughly 35:65 pre- and post-lockdown, with only a two week deviation to 43:57 when
lockdown was declared. The distribution of households across states shifted a bit in favor
    6 The
       features are similar agro-climactic conditions, urbanization levels, female literacy, and average
household size.

of rural states, but was roughly the same as pre-pandemic. Second, the distribution across
income also remained roughly the same. The fraction earning between |150,000­300,000
per annum was 45% before and after lockdown. However, sampling at the extremes of
the distribution did change. The share earning  |500,000 fell from 12.9% to 9%; the share
earning  |150,000 increased from 23% to 29.1%. Of course, some of this change may be
a reduction in income due to COVID7
    Survey content. The survey is conducted at the household level but measures both
individual and household level variables. It measures employment status, time use, and
occupation for each member of the household once every four months. It measures in-
come for each household member and the overall household and consumption for the
household every month by asking members to recall income and consumption each of
the last four months. The survey is conducted on a smart device and gathers data on up
to 12 members of each household.
    The CPHS has analogues in Indian NSSO surveys on labor statistics and on consumer
expenditures. It is difficult to compare the CPHS to the consumer expenditure survey
because the NSSO's 2017­2018 consumer expenditure survey was rejected by the govern-
ment and thus not released (Vyas, 2020b). The previous one was from 2011­2012. How-
ever, Abraham and Shrivastava (2019) show that the CPHS and NSSO produce similar
results for male workers.


2.2    RBI inflation data
We obtain data on overall and constituents8 of inflation from the Reserve Bank of India
(Reserve Bank of India, 2020). The data are available at the monthly level for rural and
urban areas of each state; the base year is 2012. We obtain relative prices from constituents
   7 CMIE also reports a shift in the fraction of households across occupational groups.
                                                                                     Again, this could be
churning due to COVID as opposed to sampling. In any case, we address the problem by looking at within
household change in occupation when analyzing labor supply.

et al., 2020).9


2.3     COVID cases, lockdown rules and mobility
We obtain data on COVID cases and deaths from www.covid19India.org, which com-
piles reports from government sources across the country. We obtain data on national
lockdown severity from the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (Hale et al.,
2020) and district-level mobility from Google Mobility Reports (Google LLC, 2021).


3     Income
3.1     Decline in income
Income. Per capita income fell sharply during the pandemic (Figure 2).10 At its low point,
mean income was 40% and median income was 65% lower than average 2019 income,
reflecting an enormous unanticipated shock to incomes.11 Interestingly, income fell up
to 20% after India reported its first case (in Kerala on 30 January 2020) but before Indian
governments instituted lockdowns in the third week of March. This suggests some of the
income decline was due to voluntary contraction of economic activity before mandatory
business closures.12
    Income recovered rapidly, but remains about 10% lower than 2019 levels as of October
2020, the latest data available for this paper. The recovery began in May and was V-
shaped. Indeed, the recovery seem to have occurred even before the epidemic peaked
(Figure 1), though it is possible the recovery drove the epidemic.
    Employment rate and hours. Employment and hours conditional on employment
fell sharply (Figure 3). The effects were more severe for males (20 percentage points) than
females (3 percentage points), though females had much lower employment rates (< 10%)
in 2019 to begin with. As with overall income, employment and wages recovered rapidly,
even before the ostensible peak of the epidemic.


3.2     Distribution of decline in income
We explore the distribution of changes in income across two dimensions: occupation and
household income. First, we compare changes in four high-level occupational groups:
salaries employees, business persons, farm and agricultural laborers, and small traders
    9 CPIfor items other than constituent g (¬ g) calculated as CPI¬ g = (k = g wk CPIk )/(k = g wk ), where k
indexes constituents.
  10 We calculate per capita income as household income divided by household size. We do this to account

for household level income, including from household-level businesses.
  11 Our benchmark is the average monthly income across months. For median (mean) income, we use the

median (mean) across households of average monthly income as a benchmark.
  12 To be sure, India did impose increasing international travel bans prior to the domestic lockdowns.

However, is hard to imagine those were solely responsible for restrictions on domestic activity to the extent
observed.

Note. The figure was constructed by first dividing the household income by the household size to calculate per capita income, then
dividing by the state × urban status specific mean or median 2019 income, and finally calculating monthly means or medians using
individual member weights. A similar process was followed for consumption. Dashed vertical lines in January 2020, March 2020 and
June 2020 indicate the month of first case (blue), the month the national lockdown started (red) and the month the national lockdown
ended (green). All values are inflation adjusted in 2012 |.

Note. An index of mean per capita income was generated by constructed by dividing the household income by the household size
to calculate per capita income, then calculating the mean across India, using individual member weights, by current occupational
category, and finally dividing by mean per capita income in 2019. Dashed vertical lines in January 2020, March 2020 and June 2020
indicate the month of first case (blue), the month the national lockdown started (red) and the month the national lockdown ended
(green).

and daily workers. We do not disaggregate by community type (urban or rural) in our
occupational breakdown. Second, we compare change in four quartiles of income based
on 2019 average household income. For income, we do disaggregate by location, as urban
incomes are higher. Our units for measuring income are percent of average 2019 income
to abstract from variation in income levels across locations.
    Income. While all occupations saw sharp drops in income, there were large differ-
ences across occupations (Figure 4). While salaried employees saw mean income fall 40%
in April 2020, small traders and daily laborers (henceforth daily laborers) saw a much
larger decline of 75%. Even these declines mask substantial inequality in income changes.
Among salaried workers (Panel B, Figure 4), white collar workers saw declines of roughly
20%, while blue and pink collar workers saw declines of 50%. Among agricultural work-
ers (Panel C, 4), laborers (who work on land owned by others) saw a decline almost triple
that of small farmers (who own small plots of land). Organized farmers, who own larger
plots, saw incomes fall in August 2020 by 40% of their average 2019 income. However,
this group--and to a lesser extent small farmers--is the residual claimant on agricultural
revenues, which fluctuate dramatically over even a normal year like 2019. That means
the decline relative to their August 2019 baseline is closer to 10%.
    Together these changes suggest that salaried white collar workers were hit far less
during the COVID pandemic; while daily laborers, including in agriculture, were hit far
harder. An important topic for future research is whether salaried occupations were pro-
tected because they employ high human capital workers, permitted greater remote work,
or offered greater contract security.

Note. Individuals were assigned to income quartiles calculated using average 2019 per capita incomes. The figure was constructed
by first dividing the household income by the household size to calculate per capita income, then calculating the mean within income
quartiles in their state × urban status locations, using individual member weights, and finally dividing by mean per capita income in
2019 to create an index. Dashed vertical lines in January 2020, March 2020 and June 2020 indicate the month of first case (blue), the
month the national lockdown started (red) and the month the national lockdown ended (green). The line at the bottom indicates the
interquartile range of income, measuring inequality of income.



   While the income shock from Covid shows large, regressive inequalities across oc-
cupations, the shock is either neutral or progressive across household income. Figure 5
shows that incomes of individuals from the highest (4th) income quartile (based on 2019
average household income) fell earlier. Moreover, in rural areas the highest quartile fell

more at the peak of the economic crisis. Finally, incomes of the highest quartile have not
returned to pre-crisis levels, while those in the lowest quartile have. Although we do not
know why the shock was progressive, this finding is consistent with the idea that some
members of higher income groups were more cautious about returning to work due to
fear of catching COVID.
    Employment rate and hours. Unpacking the income shock across the occupation dis-
tribution (Figure 6), we see that daily laborers and those from higher-income households
saw greater increases in unemployment. Salaried workers workers saw the greatest de-
cline in hours (even when employed), which is consistent with higher income workers
having a lagging recovery from the initial economic crisis. After salaried workers, daily
laborers saw the biggest decline in employment. A surprising finding is that that the de-
cline in hours was similar across income quartiles. Again, disaggregating employment by
occupation yields different conclusions about inequality than disaggregating by income.

Note. Includes male individuals aged 15 or above. The occupation categories are as of 4 months prior. Share employed is the number
of people who report being employed relative to the labor force, retirees, and students. Daily hours worked are medians conditional
on working any positive hours. Dashed vertical lines in January 2020, March 2020 and June 2020 indicate the month of first case (blue),
the month the national lockdown started (red) and the month the national lockdown ended (green).



   Wages. Combining income and hours data, we are able indirectly to measure hourly
wages by occupation. We do this by estimating the following regression of individual (i)
income ( Iiokt ) on hours (hiokt ) in an occupation o separately for each location k and time

where location is defined community type (urban or rural).13 The coefficient on hours
yield implied hourly wages.
    The resulting time series (Figure 7) reveals daily workers were hit more than other
occupations not just on the hours margin, but also the hourly wage margin. Their wages
fell roughly 40% in rural areas and 80% in urban areas at the height of the downturn.
Salaried workers, unsurprisingly see the least decline in implied hourly wage. Indeed,
in rural areas, their salaries stayed constant but they were asked not to come into work
enough that their implied hourly wage increased 30% during the first full month of lock-
down. By October 2020, wages for non-agricultural workers were just 10% below 2019
levels. Agricultural wages still lagged by 20­30%.

3.3                          Income smoothing via labor supply
COVID was, at least initially, an aggregate supply shock (Guerrieri et al., 2020). Indi-
viduals may have attempted to smooth income through the usual tools in their toolkit.
However, many of those efforts may have been blunted by the combination of the sur-
prise and aggregate nature of the shock and the social distancing orders. For example,
it might be difficult to shift towards contractual protections (Bardhan, 1983) or modify
work inputs (Binswanger and Rosenzweig, 1993) because the pandemic was unantici-
pated. Moreover, attempts to move to find work was impeded by the aggregate nature of
the shock and government restrictions on travel.
  13 In CPHS data, individuals can only report their primary occupation. (We implement this as a regres-
sion where hours are interacted with time, occupation and location fixed effects, with no constant or main
effects.) We assume the hours of work they report are entirely in that occupation.

                                                                                                                                                               13
    That is not to say that there was no scope for adjustment. It is possible that individuals
sought more hours at lower pay. It possible that they shifted to other sectors or occupa-
tions in search of work. Given the aggregate nature of the shock, however, these efforts
were likely to have spillover effects on other workers. We explore these adjustments and
possible spillovers in this section. We start at the intensive margin.

3.3.1     Intensive margin
We explore changes at the intensive margin by examining how workers changed the num-
ber of hours they worked during COVID. It is possible that workers tried to offset the de-
cline in wages illustrated in Figure 7 by increasing hours worked. This would be observed
if the income effect was greater than the substitution effect on leisure over the observed,
COVID-period wage range. Others have observed such income-smoothing adjustments
in emerging economies (Moser, 1998).
    To explore changes in the intensive margin of labor supplied, we report transition
matrices for hours worked. First, in Table 3 we segment hours worked into bins (not
employed, employed but 0 hours, (0,4] hours, (4-6] hours, (6-8] hours, and > 8 hours
worked). Second, for each of two months (September 2019 and December 2019), we calcu-
late the transition matrix of probabilities of going from each of the hours bins that month
to each hours bin 4 months later (January 2020 and April 2020, respectively).14 We assign
each transition matrix to the destination month, e.g., we call the December 2019­April
2020 transition matrix simply the April 2020 transition matrix. To highlight the change
in transition probabilities from pre-COVID to during COVID, we subtract the monthly
transition matrix for January 2020 from the matrix for April 2020. While January 2020
is supposed to be the pre-COVID transition matrix, we note there may be some compli-
cations associated with seasonality in hours worked. To mitigate seasonality effects, we
leave out agricultural workers from our analysis. (We cannot simply subtract the tran-
sition matrix from 1 year prior because CPHS reports hours starting only in September
2020.) The resulting change-in-transition matrix is reported in Table 3.
    We find little evidence that individuals were able to increase their hours to offset the
aggregate supply shock. The first panel looks at all occupations other than agriculture
to reduce the impact of seasonality on our analysis of hours. We see massive increases
in unemployment in April relative to regular churn. If we add people who claimed to
be employed but happen to show zero hours worked, there is a roughly 65% increase in
non-work. Even among those who work, we only see declines in hours, regardless of how
many hours one previously worked. These changes also suggest much of the shock was
felt at the extensive rather than intensive margin, even if we put aside smoothing at the
intensive margin.
    When we examine each occupation separately, focusing only on workers who were in
the occupation in the prior period, farms and farm workers seem to stand out. They were
less likely to end up without employment or hours. They are also more likely to retain
their pre-COVID hours during the pandemic. One should take these findings with a grain
of salt: there is a great deal of seasonal variation in agricultural work, and April is typi-
  14 We   can only focus on two months because CPHS does not have hours data prior to September 2019.

cally a high mark for income prior to the pandemic (see Figure 7). We omit agricultural
workers in the first panel for this reason.

        Note. This table is generated as follows. First, we segment hours worked into bins (not employed, em-
        ployed but 0 hours, (0,4] hours, (4-6] hours, (6-8] hours, and > 8 hours worked). Second, for each of two
        months (September 2019 and December 2019), we calculate the transition matrix of probabilities of going
        from each of the hours bins that month to each hours bin 4 months later (January 2020 and April 2020,
        respectively). We assign this transition matrix to the destination month, e.g., we call the December 2019
        - April 2020 transition matrix the April 2020 transition matrix. These transition matrices are limited to
        workers working in the occupation(s) indicated in the title of each panel in the origin or destination month.
        Third, we difference the monthly transition matrices, i.e., we subtract the transition matrix for January 2020
        from the transition matrix for April 2020.




3.3.2    Extensive margin - unemployment and occupational churn
With respect to adjustments at the margin of employment, we look at two behaviors:
whether a person works and what sector he or she works in. To capture both we define




                                                           15
five exhaustive states: not employed15 now and in the last period,16 not employed now
but employed last period, employed in same occupational category as the last period,
employed in a different occupational category in the last period, employed but unem-
ployed or OLF in the last period. We further subdivided (the previously unemployed 
now employed) and the (previously employed  now employed in different occupation)
into two categories: employed in the same sector one was previously in (switchback) and
employed in a new sector (no switchback). This extra partition is intended to determine
possible loss of productivity due to adaptation. Presumably, individuals who switch to
an occupation that is new are likely to have lower productivity either relative to an occu-
pation in which they previously worked in.
    Figure 8 shows that there was an increase in unemployment and exit from the labor
force during the pandemic. In addition, there appears to be an increase in switching
occupations or occupational churn. When the economy resumed activity, many people
switched back to occupations in which they previously worked, whether they came from
the unemployed state or another occupation. However, there does appear to be a higher
fraction of people working in a new occupation relative to, say, 2018 or 2019. It remains
to be explored whether this occupation shifting will significantly affect longer-term labor
productivity.
    Occupational churn may be asymmetric, e.g., it may be possible to go from being
salaried to being a daily worker, but not vice versa. A simple model that might explain
this is a Roy model of sorting across sectors based on skill and skill prices. If skills are
positively correlated and skill prices differ across sections, then it is possible that there
is initial sorting into jobs based on comparative advantage. When there is a labor de-
mand shock and skills are constant over time, however, it is possible workers shift to
other sectors in which they previously had an absolute advantage, but not a compara-
tive advantage. During the pandemic, skill price changes might convert those absolute
advantages into comparative advantages. While this is not the only model that explains
transitions, it is helpful to keep in mind as we explore transitions.
    To explore asymmetric changes, we switch from reporting stacked bar charts to tran-
sition matrices in Table 3. We define five states: not employed, and employed in each
of the four occupations we reported before (salaried employee, farmer and farm laborer,
business person, and small trader and daily wage earner). For each month, we can calcu-
late the transition matrix of probabilities of going from each of the states four months ago
to each state the selected month. To better highlight the change in transition probabili-
ties, we difference monthly transition matrices across year, e.g., the change in April 2020
transitions will show the difference between the April 2020 and April 2019 transition ma-
trices. To simplify our exposition, we group months into quarters and report the change
in transitions for each quarter of each year.
    The results reveal four things about the downturn at the start of the epidemic. First,
there was greater transition to unemployment among individuals who are in lowest in-
come occupation, i.e., daily laborers. Second, agriculture was least disrupted; while un-
  15 We define not employed as out of the labor force (OLF) or unemployed, categories found in the CPHS
data set.
  16 The last period is defined as 4 months ago, which is the last time the member was surveyed in the

CPHS.

Note. These figures were constructed by, first, categorizing each member of each household into five states in each month they are
observed: not employed now and in the last period, not employed now but employed last period, employed in same occupational
category as the last period, employed in a different occupational category in the last period, employed but unemployed or OLF in the
last period. (We define not employed as out of the labor force (OLF) or unemployed, categories found in the CPHS data set. The last
period is defined as 4 months ago, which is the last time the member was surveyed in the CPHS.) We then calculate the fraction of
the observed members in each state in each month. Each figure includes only those members aged 18­65. Switchbacks are measured
by examining whether the individuals switches to a sector they had previously worked in either four months or one year previously.
Note that the female graph starts at 80%. Dashed vertical lines in January 2020, March 2020 and June 2020 indicate the month of first
case (blue), the month the national lockdown started (red) and the month the national lockdown ended (green).

employment increases, there was a smaller outflow from agriculture than other occupa-
tions. Unsurprisingly, it is also the occupation that saw the most inflow of workers. This is
not merely a seasonal effect because we subtract the transition matrix from Q2 2019. This
finding is consistent with reports of a massive migration from cities to rural areas when
the country began to loosen the lockdown in May Malani et al. (2020). Third, salaried
persons and business persons seemed to have relied on occupational transition to pro-
tect consumption more than daily laborers did. Fourth, the recovery in Q3 2020 largely
followed these patterns, but dramatically scaled back transitions to unemployment, espe-
cially for daily laborers.

     Notes. Q2 is April­June; Q3 is July­September. We define five states: not employed, employed in each of
     the 4 occupations we reported before (salaried employee, farmer and farm laborer, business person, and
     small trader and daily wage earner). For each month, we calculate the transition matrix of probabilities of
     going from each of the states in the chosen month to each state after four months as the observed fraction
     of the population that made that transition. The fraction is calculated only among household members
     between ages 18­65; moreover, these members are weighted to represent the national average. We assign
     this transition matrix to the destination month, e.g., we call the December 2019­April 2020 transition matrix
     the April 2020 transition matrix. To obtain the change in transition probabilities, we difference monthly
     transition matrices across years, e.g., the April 2020 change-in-transition matrix is the difference between
     the April 2020 and April 2019 transition matrices. Quarterly change in transition matrices are the equally
     weighted change-in-transition matrices for months that compose the quarter.


    Occupational churn occurred even before the pandemic. However, the net benefit of
occupational churn can change in the presence of aggregate shock like COVID. For ex-
ample, with a shock in just one occupation or sector, an individual in a origin occupation
that suffers a negative shock can move to another destination occupation that has not suf-
fered the same shock. While the additional labor supply in that second occupation will
reduce wages there, the effect may be minor. With a shock to all occupations, however,
this destination supply effect can be magnified if the displacement is asymmetric, i.e.,
some destination occupations see more entry of labor. This can negatively affect the pri-
vate return from occupational switching to protect consumption, as well as the external
effects of churn on other workers in the destination occupation.
    To address this challenge, we calculate the private benefit of occupational churn dur-
ing an aggregate shock like COVID. Define t as the pre-COVID period, t + 1 as the COVID
period, j as the pre-COVID occupation, and j = j as the COVID period occupation for


                                                        18
individuals who switched occupations. Income pre-COVID is Yijk,t+1 = w jk,t hijk,t , where
k indexes location. Income for individuals who switched occupations during COVID
is Yij k,t+1 = w j k,t+1 hijk,t+1 . Consider a person who has switched occupations during
COVID. We want to calculate how much additional income she made by switching occu-
pations and how that changed during the pandemic.
    These calculations require specifying counterfactuals. For example, if the person were
a typical person in her prior occupation per-COVID, she may have made what the typ-
ical person in that old occupation makes during COVID. But the fact that the person
switched suggest she is probably worse than the typical person remaining in that prior
sector. Conversely, if one's model for transitions is the changing comparative advantage
model described above, then it is also possible that the transitioning person is actually
making a higher daily income than the typical person in the destination district because
they are greater skill than others in the destination occupation. These problems are worse
when one considers that switchers may not be representative of either district on hours
as well as hourly wage.
    To calculate the counterfactual against which to value churn, we employ the following
model of wages in sector j at time t:

                              Yijkt =  jt Xijkt +  jt Iik,t ( j) + eijkt                   (2)

where Iik,t ( j) is an indicator for whether the person just switched into sector j. The coef-
ficient  jt captures the lower wage that switchers may earn because they lack experience
in the sector. Our goal will be to estimate the value of switching from sector j to j :

                            Vi, j, j ,kt = ^ j k Xij kt + ^ j kt - ^ jk Xijkt              (3)

Because switching occurred with great frequency even before COVID, we want to esti-
mate the wage equation and the value of switching with cross-sectional regression in 4
periods: (i) Q2 of 2018 and 2019, (ii) Q3 of 2018 and 2019, (iii) Q2 of 2020, and (iv) Q3 of
2020. Comparing the Q2 (Q3) 2020 gain to the Q2 (Q3) 2018/2019 gain tells us the change
in benefits to switching during the downturn (recover) period of the pandemic.
    The first problem we face is that there is selection into sectors. To address this, we use
a Roy model framework French and Taber (2011); allow workers a choice of sectors to
enter, a decision captured via a multinomial probit (e.g., Table 4 for Q2 in 2018/19 and Q2
2020); and use experience in each sector as our exclusion restriction for each sector. The
second problem is that we do not observe reservation wages (i.e., implicit wages in the
unemployed sector). To capture these we estimate a version of the model with just two
sectors, employed and unemployed, and back out estimates of reservation wages using
a probit first stage and a single wage equation for the employed sector. The result is that
the gain from switching to unemployment is the same regardless of which sector a person
switches from (Table 5).

    As expected, there are positive gains to switchers from switching sectors. However,
the gain to switching to unemployment, for those who do, are lower than those switch-
ing to other sectors. Relatedly, the gain from switching out of unemployment into each
employed sector is typically greater than the gain to entering that sector from any other
employed sector.
    More relevant for COVID, we find that the gains to switching declined during COVID,
whether one examines Q2 or Q3 of 2020 (Table 5 and Figure ??). Of particular interest is
the change in reservation wage, which falls by 0.3 log points in Q2 and 0.3 log points in
Q3 2020. If people were worried about going to work due to the risk of catching COVID,
one would expect the reservation wage to rise, not fall. Perhaps the decline in household
income caused consumption (marginal utility of consumption) in the unemployed sector
to rise (fall) more than income and thus consumption in the employed sectors.


4     Consumption
4.1   Decline and distribution of decline in consumption
Indian households experienced a sharp decline in consumption at the start of the pan-
demic. While the average decline matched the average decline in income, the median
decline in consumption was less severe than the median decline in income: median ex-
penditure fell 40% while median income fell over 65% (Figure 2). Like income, expen-
ditures fell before lockdowns started and recovered even before cases appear to have
peaked. Consumption is now roughly 20% below the 2019 level.

   Although there are major disparities in mean income shocks across occupations (Fig-
ure 4), there was a largely uniform reduction in consumption across occupations (Fig-
ures 10), at least when the units are percent change rather than absolute change. There
are roughly 20 percentage point variations in the decline in consumption across income
quartiles (a) in urban areas and (b) in all areas during the recovery, but even these gaps
are small relative to income gaps (Figure 11). This suggests that households were able to
smooth consumption somewhat despite the fact that the pandemic was a large unantici-
pated, aggregate supply shock.


4.2     Consumption smoothing
We conducted basic tests of consumption smoothing, i.e., regressions of differences in
consumption on differences in income, a la Cochrane (1991) and Townsend (1994). We
do not expect perfect consumption smoothing: even prior to COVID, smoothing was
imperfect. Instead, we test to see if households were less able to smooth during COVID.
We estimate a regression of the form

                 log cikt = µi + dkt +  log Mikt +  (log Mikt × I(2020)) +  ikt                                 (4)

where cikt is consumption by household i in location k, µi are household fixed effects,
dkt is a measure of the aggregate shock (proxied by location average consumption as
in Townsend (1994)); Mit is idiosyncratic income, and I(2020)) is an indicator for 2020.
Here  measures risk smoothing (with  = 0 implying full-risk sharing) and  measures
whether COVID affected the ability to smooth consumption.
    While we formally reject full-risk sharing, the magnitude of this rejection is somewhat
small--consistent with prior literature such as Townsend (1994)--and the differential ef-
fect of COVID itself was relatively minor. Pre-COVID, a 10% income fall was associ-
ated with a 0.99% decline in consumption (Table 6). During COVID, it was associated
with a 0.104% decline in consumption. Urban areas (column (4)) show less consumption
smoothing than rural areas (column (3)) pre-COVID, but similarly slight increases in dif-
ficulty smoothing during COVID. To get a sense of whether the aggregate nature of the
shock made a difference to smoothing, we estimate a version of this regression without
the control for the aggregate shock. We find that aggregate shocks meaningfully affect
smoothing, but that the aggregate shock had a larger role during COVID.17
    Finally we examine how consumption changed in specific categories such as food,
clothing, and education. The data show that households reduced their consumption of
objects such as appliances and clothing (which fell > 90%) far more than they reduced
food (fell 25%) and fuel (fell 40%). The massive decline in educational investments (fell
90%) is consistent with the finding in Chetty and Looney (2007) of inefficient smoothing
because it sacrifices future income potential. Although this variation in where consumers
cut back can be interpreted as Maslovian prioritization, we use the framework of Engel
curves to understand these changes in the next section.
  17 The  ratio of the coefficient on the interaction to the coefficient on ln income in specification (1) is 0.047.
It is 0.183 in specification (2), which omits a control for aggregate consumption.

Note. The figure was constructed by first dividing the household expenditure by the household size to calculate per capita expen-
diture, then calculating the mean across India, using individual member weights, by occupational category, and finally dividing by
mean per capita expenditure in 2019 to create an index. Dashed vertical lines in January 2020, March 2020 and June 2020 indicate the
month of first case (blue), the month the national lockdown started (red) and the month the national lockdown ended (green).

Note. Individuals were assigned to income quartiles calculated using average 2019 per capita incomes. The figure was constructed by
first dividing the household expenditure by the household size to calculate per capita expenditure, then calculating the mean within
income quartiles specific to their state × urban status location, using individual member weights, and finally dividing by mean per
capita expenditure in 2019 to create an index. Dashed vertical lines in January 2020, March 2020 and June 2020 indicate the month of
first case (blue), the month the national lockdown started (red) and the month the national lockdown ended (green).

Note. The figure was constructed by first dividing the household expenditure in each category by the household size to calculate per
capita expenditure in the category, then calculating the mean across India using individual member weights, and finally dividing by
mean per capita expenditure in 2019 in that category to create indices. Dashed vertical lines in January 2020, March 2020 and June 2020
indicate the month of first case (blue), the month the national lockdown started (red) and the month the national lockdown ended
(green).

4.3     Decomposing consumption changes
The causes of changes in consumption observed during COVID can crudely be broken
down into changes in prices, change in income, and changes in preferences. We assume
that COVID was too sudden and the economic shock too short to reflect changes in prefer-
ences. Instead, we focus on price and income as mediators for the disparate consumption
changes we observed across goods.
    The CPHS data allows us to observe income and consumption before and during
COVID. We also have state × month price indices for different categories of consump-
tion from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) price, but not during the height of the economic
crisis. Specifically, we lack data on good category specific CPI from March­August 2020
and data on overall CPI for March­June 2020. In the spirit of Costa (2001) and Hamilton
(2001), we assume that Engel curves can provide a structure to understand unobserved
price changes.

4.3.1   Methods
Our analysis has two steps. First, we estimate Engel curves using data largely from pre-
COVID in order to identify the preference parameters for each good category × location.
Second, we use our estimates of Engel curves and observed income during COVID to
predict budget shares during COVID due to income changes. Then we infer that the
gap between our predicted and actually observed budget shares during COVID reflect
changes in the price of goods.
   We start with the Working-Lesser single demand function from Deaton and Muell-
bauer (1980)'s Almost Ideal Demand System

          i, j,k,t =  + (ln Pj,k,t - ln Pj,¬k,t ) + (ln Yi, j,t - ln Pj,t ) +  Xi, j,t + ui, j,t   (5)

where i indexes households, j location (homogeneous region × urban/rural), t is time, k
indicates some category of good, and ¬k is categories other than k. i, j,k,t is the share of
a household's budget spend in category k, ln Pj,k,t - ln Pj,¬k,t is the log of relative price of
category k, Yi, j,t is income, and Xi, j,t are covariates that influence preferences, including
household size.
    Our first step is to estimate preference parameters (, , ,  ) by estimating the regres-
sion equation above using data from 2018, 2019 and August­October 2020. Our units are
households. We control for average age of household members and household size. We
employ OLS and weight each household in proportion to the number of households it
represents in the nation. Because we will not be using the standard error of parameter
estimates in our numerical exercise, we use robust standard errors without clustering.
    Certain issues arise in running this regression. First, the categories of goods that the
RBI uses does not always match the categories the CPHS uses. For example, the RBI
has not released data on housing or education. Moreover, because the number of goods
categories that the RBI and CPHS reports differ, we do not know if the miscellaneous cat-
egory across those two sources are the same. We focus on the categories that the RBI has
released. Second, expenditures sometimes exceed and other times fall short of income.
This may reflect borrowing or savings, respectively. Third, there may be error in the price

                                                   26
indices that the government generates. Although we are motivated by a substantial liter-
ature that uses Engel curves to obtain better price indices, we sidestep this issue as our
goal is to fill gaps in the CPI during the worst of the COVID downturn.
    Our second step is to combine observed income and expenditures in different goods
categories with our regression estimates to back out price changes that household must
have experienced during COVID. Recall we do this because we lack certain CPI data
during the downturn. We can derive our exact calculation by taking the total derivative
of (5) and dividing by di, j,k,t :

                      d ln Pk, j,t - d ln P¬k, j,t              d ln Yi, j,t     d ln Pj,t
           1 = k                                         + k                 - k              + d u i , j,k ,t .   (6)
                               d i , j,k ,t                     d i , j,k ,t     d i , j,k ,t

   There are two scenarios of missing-price data that we address. For some months we
lack data on category-specific CPI, but have data on overall CPI. In this case, we can
derive relative price changes from the equation above using:

                  ^ k dE[(ln Pk, j,t - ln P¬k, j,t )]
                                                           ^ k d ln Y
                                                                        ¯ i , j,t   ^ k d ln P
                                                                                                  ¯j,t
                                                      = 1-                        -                                (7)
                             d ¯ i , j,k ,t                  d  ¯ i , j,k ,t         d   ¯ i , j,k ,t

where bars and E[z] indicate sample means. Here, the right hand side is calculated and
the left hand-side is inferred. The second scenario is when we have neither overall or
category-specific CPI. In this case, we can only calculate:

                  ^ k dE[(ln Pk, j,t - ln P¬k, j,t )] 
                                                       ^ k d ln P    ¯j,t      ^ k d ln Y
                                                                                            ¯ i , j,t
                                                     +                    = 1-                        .            (8)
                             d ¯ i , j,k ,t             d   ¯ i , j,k ,t         d  ¯ i , j,k ,t

We cannot distinguish changes due to purchasing power and relative price changes.

4.3.2   Results
COVID had disparate impacts on budget shares across product categories. Figure 13
shows the distribution of budget shares over time for the four product categories for
which are able to match CPI data. The food, fuel and (to a lesser extent) intoxicant share of
budgets increased, while the clothing share fell. In some cases, food expenditure exceed
income multiple times, suggesting households tapped savings or borrowed. However,
we cannot rule out that income reporting was the problem. Because these cases were few,
we winsorize the data at 95% in our analysis.
   Price v. income shocks. We show the relative contribution of income and the com-
bined effect of purchasing power and relative prices during the worse of the COVID-
induced economic shock in Figure 14A. Regression coefficients are presented below each
subplot. We find that income changes explain the increase in budget shares of food; price
changes had little role. In short, Engels law (  = -0.26) played a major role in explain-
ing the increase in the food share of expenditures during COVID. The smaller positive
increase intoxicant share of household budgets reflect a negative shock from purchasing
power or relative prices largely offsetting a positive effect from nominal income. (Both

the price and nominal income shocks were negative, but intoxicants are a somewhat infe-
rior good (  = -0.02).) Fuel consumption lay somewhere between food and intoxicants:
share rose, but mainly because income fell and fuels is mildly inferior (  = -0.07). Price
somewhat offset nominal income's effect, but it was a minor offset.
    When the economy began to recover in August 2020 (Figure 14B), food consumption
continued to be elevated. Since we have separate overall and food CPI for this month,
we can see that, although price overall played a small role, it was purchasing power that
did most of the work. An increase in overall inflation reinforced the decline in nominal
income, raising consumption of food. What is perhaps most notable about this is that rela-
tive prices played such a small role. Somehow, through one of the most severe lockdowns
around the world, the country was able to maintain the relative price of food.

    Price shocks and COVID cases. A natural question is whether areas with greater price
shocks were areas harder hit by COVID cases. We back out price shocks by location (state
x community type) and product for April 2020. We measure COVID in two ways: number
of confirmed cases divided by number of tests (positivity rate) or simply the number of
confirmed cases in that month. The positivity rate has the advantage that it accounts for
the low level of testing, especially early in the pandemic.
    We present suggestive graphical evidence in Figure 15 that, outside of food, areas with
greater COVID positivity rates appear to have greater positive price shocks in April 2020
(relative to April 2019). This is only suggestive, however. Regressions of price shocks on
COVID cases do not reveal significant differences in price shocks for food versus other
categories. Table 7 reports coefficients from 16 regressions. In each we regressed implied
price shocks for a given product category on measures of COVID by location:  p j,k,t =
k,t d j,k,t + e j,k,t . Estimates of k,t are reported, but none are significantly different from one
another.
    Nonetheless, if we take the estimated correlation seriously, there are two possible ex-


                                                        31
planations for the findings. One is that the lockdown was more severe--at least with
respective to non-food items--in areas that were harder hit by COVID. Another is that
there is a shadow price associated with COVID for non-essential items, i.e., individuals'
perceived risk of getting infected.


5    Conclusion
We draw four conclusions from our analysis. First, the economic shock of COVID in India
was harsh, but short-lived. That said, there appear to be meaningful disparities in how
badly household incomes fell and in how much households had recovered as of October
2020. Those trends should be followed to see if COVID increased income inequality in
India.
    Second, workers tried to smooth their income by switching occupations. However,
this switching may have had spillover effects on other occupations and changed the
distribution of income losses across occupations. Further work is required to develop
counterfactuals--what workers would have earned had they not switched occupations
during the height of the COVID shock--to better estimate the degree of loss reallocation.
    Third, the COVID-induced economic shock generated less disparity in consumption
than income. Our analysis suggests that households were able to insure idiosyncratic
shocks as well as before COVID. An intriguing possibility is that the precautionary sav-
ings of higher income households made it easier for lower income households to borrow
to buffer consumption. It may be an interesting feature of aggregate supply shocks, or
at least pandemic induced supply shocks, that they facilitate inter-household insurance
through, e.g., credit channels. This possibility can be explored using the same Engel curve
decomposition used to understand the relative effect of income and price changes on the
share of household budgets spent in different product categories.
    Fourth, the change in budget shares across product categories suggests that the rela-
tive price of food did not increase during the pandemic, indicating that the lockdown may
have been somewhat successful at discriminating between essential and non-essential
services. Other product categories, such as clothing, did experience increases in relative
prices. Future work will explore whether geographic variation in the relative price shock
is correlated with infection risk and non-pharmaceutical interventions.

Note. Includes males and females aged 15 or above. Wages are coefficients from a regression of per capita household income (includes
wages plus household level business income) on hours, run separately by occupation and location. We report median implied wages
across locations, by occupation. Dashed vertical lines in January 2020, March 2020 and June 2020 indicate the month of first case (blue),
the month the national lockdown started (red) and the month the national lockdown ended (green).

Note. Includes all males (not females) aged 15 or above. Wages are coefficients from a regression of per capita household income
(includes wages and household level business income) on hours, run separately by occupation and location. We report median
implied wages across locations, by occupation. Dashed vertical lines in January 2020, March 2020 and June 2020 indicate the month of
first case (blue), the month the national lockdown started (red) and the month the national lockdown ended (green).
