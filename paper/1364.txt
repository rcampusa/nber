        Post—Retirement Adjustments of Pension Benefits

                              ABSTRACT


     This paper examines why pension plans increased their liabflities by

giving benefit increases to persons no longer working even though almost all

of them were not required to do so by any legally enforceable contract. In

our model workers and firms have implicit contracts under which post—

retirement increases in benefits are purchased by workers through lower

wages or initial benefits. Such arrangements permit both plans arid workers

to share the risk of uncertain rates of return. They also allow beneficiaries

to invest at a higher net rate of return than they could obtain elsewhere

because of tax advantages and, in large plans, economies of scale. We

also discuss how post—retirement adjustments can be used to influence

turnover.

     Some empirical implications of the model are tested over a sample of

beneficiaries of defined benefit plans. The major empirical findings are:

     (1) There is strong evidence of compensating differentials in final
         salary and initial pension benefits for beneficiaries receiving post—
         retirement adjustments.

     (2) Regardless of how the size of pension plans is measured
         (beneficiaries, participants, amount of benefits paid),
         large pension plans provide larger post—retirement benefit
         increases.

     (3) Beneficiaries of collectively bargained plans are more likely
         to receive benefit increases and, among those receiving benefit
         increases, receive larger increases.

     (4) Benefit increases are larger in percentage terms for those who
         have been retired the longest and for those with the most years
         of service.

                               Introduction

     What happens to an individual's private pension benefits after he

retires? Until recently, economists and policy analysts have assumed they

remained constant in nominal terms, even in periods of severe inflation.

Feldstein (1983) and Summers (1983) even have developed models explaining

why individuals prefer not to have indexed pensions. These models are

consistent with the observation that very few plans provide for automatic

adjustments and the assumption that ad hoc increases are uncommon and, when

granted, quite small. Three recent surveys of large plans (Bankers Trust,

1980; Hay Associates l981; and Hewitt Associates, 1981) show approximately

two—thirds of large plans giving one or more ad hoc increases during the

last half of the i970s (see King, 1982). However, these surveys did not

consider small or medium-sized plans, leaving open the question of how

widespread the increases really were; also they did not compare the size of

the increase to initial benefits of specific individuals, leaving open the

question of their magnitude.

    The assumption that post—retirement adjustments are relatively rare has

been important in much of the recent theoretical literature on the nature of

the pension contract. Barnow and Ehrenberg (1979) and Bulow (1982b) develop

models of a firm's pension liability (or cost) under conditions that assume

no post—retirement increases in benefits. If plans do award such benefit

increases, these models underestimate pension liabilities.

     The perception that pension benefits are fixed in nominal terms is also

one of the primary reasons that older persons are thought to be adversely

affected by inflation (Okuri, 1970; White House Conference on Aging, 1982).

This had led to a policy debate and research examining the desirability of
                                    2

requiring or encouraging automatic cost of living adjustments (papers by

Clark and Spengler, Munnell, and Greenough in Clark, 1980; President's

Commission on Pension Policy, 1981). Our understanding of the economic

well-being of the elderly during inflationary periods and the value of such

regulations will then be enhanced by studying post—retirement benefit

changes.

     Table 1 reports evidence from Clark, Allen, and Sumner (1983) on the

magnitude of post—retirement adjustments between 1973 and 1979 for a

nationally representative sample of persons in defined benefit plans who

were already retired in 1973. The mean benefit rose from $2128 in 1973 to

$2638 in 1979. This increase of $510 amounted to 24 percent of the 1973

benefit. These increases were very widespread, as 75 percent of all

beneficiaries received at least one increase and 25 percent received an

increase in every year. Among only those receiving increases, the mean 1979

benefit was 32 percent larger than the mean 1973 benefit.

     Since inflation was particularly high during this period, it is

interesting to compare the rate of increase of nominal benefits to the rate

of increase of prices. This is not to say that these benefit increases are

attributable to inflation. As we will explain in more detail below, these

increases could just as easily be attributed to a risk—sharing arrangement,

in which the uncertain parameter is the pension fund's nominal rate of return.

This more general framework allows us to explain not only the benefit

increases given in the 1970s, but also those given by some plans in periods

in which the inflation rate was very low. With this proviso in mind, the

Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 63.3 percent between 1973 and 1979.

                                    3

Thus, the mean rate of increase in pension benefits for all beneficiaries

equalled 38 percent of the inflation rate. Among only those receiving

benefit increases, the mean rate of increase in benefits equalled 51 percent

of the CPI increase.

     Another interesting way to look at the magnitude of these increases is

to ask how much effect they had on pension liabilities. Over this six—

year period, benefits rose at an average annual rate of 4.7 percent in plans

giving increases. Assuming either a 7 or 10 percent discount rate, the

benefit increases raised by 14 percent the present value of benefits paid

between 1973 and 1979. Since the mean age of retirement in our sample was

62, the average retiree could expect to receive benefits for 18 years. If

his benefits continued to increase at a 4.7 percent rate, the planTs liability

for this worker's lifetime benefits would increase by 44 percent at a 7 per-

cent discount rate and by 39 percent at a 10 percent discount rate.

     This paper examines why pension plans increase their liabilities to

such a large extent when not required to do so by any explicit contract.      In


our model workers and firms have implicit contracts under which post-

retirement increases are purchased by the worker through lower wages,

lower initial benefits, or reductions in other forms of compensation.    In


return the worker receives (1) the prospect of a higher after—tax rate of

return from reinvesting some of his pension wealth in the plan during the

early years of retirement (as opposed to investing it on his own) and (2) a

hedge against inflation and rate—of—return risk, the magnitude of which

depends upon the composition of the plan's portfolio. The compensating

differentials framework has been used by Ehrenberg (1980), Schilier and
                                    4

Weiss (1980), and Smith (1981) to examine tradeoffs between wages and both

the magnitude of and likelihood of receiving pension benefits. We also

explore how post—retirement adjustments can be used to influence employee

behavior. Some empirical implications of our model are then tested over a

sample of beneficiaries collected by the Department of Labor from a

representative set of defined benefit pension plans.


                 Rationale for Post—Retirement Adjustments

     Between 1973 and 1979 most beneficiaries received increases in their

nominal pension payments after they had retired. Virtually none of these

increases were required by any formal contract. Why, then, are defined

benefit plans voluntarily raising their pension liabilities? The explanation

offered in this paper is the existence of an implicit contract between the

plan and both workers and retirees, in which the plan guarantees a minimum

nominal annuity plus the possibility of post—retirement adjustments in the

future. The quid pro quo for future benefit increases is lower wages, lower

initial benefits, or some other form of compensating differential. An unusual

feature of this form of compensating differential is that the worker must

pay before he benefits. Therefore, the existence of such contracts will

depend in part on the confidence of the worker or retiree in the reliability

of the future payment.

     Consider the case of a person who is about to retire and wants to select

the optimal payment schedule for receiving his pension benefits. Suppose he

has two alternatives. The first is the conventional retirement annuity fixed

at the same nominal level in each future period. The second is a promise of a

stream of pension benefits where a minimum nominal payment per period is
                                    5

guaranteed to the worker but benefit increases may be granted in the future.

The latter arrangement is the "implicit contract" model described in Pesando

(1984). His model is motivated by the widespread tendency to finance

post—retirement adjustments out of "excess" plan earnings (earnings above the

level required by the rate of return used in evaluating the plan's

liabilities). Here we address the question of when such contracts are

preferable to workers.

     The implicit contract works in the following fashion. Consider a

two-period retirement framework where L1, 1   1, 2 indicates benefits in

each period. There is a minimum guaranteed benefit (Lm), which is set so the

plan is fully funded for both periods based on the plan's interest rate

assumption r. This rate will be less than the risk—free interest rate and as

a result, Lm will be lower than the benefit in a fixed annuity plan (or

contributions during the working period must be higher). This initial benefit

or wage offset is required because benefits are assumed to be adjusted only in

an upward direction, not downwardly. We also assume the minimum guaranteed

benefit is paid in the first period. Letting A be the contribution in the

pre-retirement period required to fully fund benefits of Lm in each period, we

have A(l+r)2/(2+rv) = Lm.    Let r be the actual rate of eturn earned by the

plan's assets.   If r > r, then the plan provides a benefit L2 equal to the

total remaining assets in the fund, i.e., L2 =   (A(l+r)   Lm)(l+r).   If


r < r, then L2 = Lm.

     This contract allows the worker to receive returns to the fund's assets

above the threshold indicated by r. It also allows the worker and the firm

to share the risks of uncertain rates of return in contrast to the conventional
                                    6

defined benefit plan in which the firm is usually assumed to bear all of the

risk of nominal rates of return arid defined contribution plans in which the

worker supposedly bears all of such risk.   It offers the worker some

insurance against unexpectedly high rates of inflation as long as the plan's

rate of return has a positive covariance with inflation. The amount of

inflation insurance depends on the composition of the pension fund's port-

folio. Feldstein (1983) has shown that unless the worker has an infinite

degree of risk aversion, full indexation is not optimal.'

     In return for these benefits the worker must accept a lower wage, a

smaller initial benefit, or both. The equilibrium condition is the sum of

the present value of earnings, guaranteed pension benefits in both periods,

and the expected magnitude of the post-retirement adjustment in the second

period equals the present value of the marginal product while working.2

     The choice between the fixed nominal annuity and the "implicit contract"

boils down to an exercise in the optimal intertemporal allocation of income

under uncertainty. There are a number of important sources of uncertainty to

consider. We will focus on the plan's nominal rate of return, the nominal

rate of return on assets held by the worker, and the likelihood the plan will

meet its obligations. Even though workers and retirees in any plan are

heterogeneous in both their preferences toward risk and their risk—bearing

ability, they will be covered by the same set of rules defining the contract.

A non-union plan will adopt a decision rule such as selecting the contract

that maximizes the utility from pension wealth of the marginal worker. In a

plan covered by collective bargaining, a different decision rule will be

applied, such as maximizing the utility from pension wealth of the median
                                    7


union member (who may be retired). The implications of these differences

for union and non—union plan behavior will be discussed later.

     Cross—sectional differences in the demand for post—retirement adjustments

will be related directly to the expected difference between the after—tax rate

of return earned by the plan after the worker retires and the after-tax rate

of return the worker expects to receive on his own assets.3   Although we have

no direct information on the expected rates of return earned by each plan in

our sample, there are a number of reasons to believe this variable is highly

correlated with plan size. First, part of the cost of administering a pension

plan is fixed, especially investment and actuarial services. According to

Smeeding (1983), this produces economies of scale with respect to custodial

(administrative overhead) fees and securities commissions for portfolio

adjustments, especially the latter. Smeeding reports that these fees fall

from 5.90 percent for IRA or Keogh plans to 4.43 percent for small pension

plans to 3.54 percent for large pension plans. Mitchell and Andrews (1981)

also show dramatic declines in administrative expenses per participant among

multi-employer plans, especially among plans with fewer than 3000 par-

ticipants. Second, small defined benefit plans must make more conservative

actuarial assumptions because of longevity risk. As plan size decreases,

the longevity distribution of its beneficiaries is less likely to approxi-

mate that of the entire population. This increases the likelihood that a

sizable proportion of beneficiaries will live longer than expected and redu-

ces the benefit that can be offered for a given contribution. Third, among

plans funded through trusts, the assets of each plan must be segregated from

those of all other plans. This makes it very difficult for small plans to
                                    8

obtain adequate diversification. Although this constraint can be avoided by

funding the plan through an insurance company, the administrative fees or

contingency reserves required by insurers usually fall in percentage terms

with the dollar volume of annual contributions (see McGill, 1975).

     An indirect test of whether some or all of these factors make rates of

return an increasing function of plan size is to examine actuarial interest

rate assumptions. Malca (1975) reports these assumptions for 1972 and 1973

from a Standard and Poor's survey. The results show the median asumption for

the largest size category was 5.5 percent, compared to 4.8 to 5.0 percent for

plans in intermediate size categories and 4.5 percent for plans in the
smallest category.   In summary, as long as large plans are expected to realize

larger rates of return and rates of return for individual workers and retirees

are randomly distributed across plans, individuals in large plans should be

more willing to purchase post—retirement adjustments. In addition to rate of

return differences, this coefficient will also reflect the effect of

unobserved factors correlated with the size of pension plans.

     Taxes are an additional factor affecting the difference between the

expected rate of return for the plan and the return the worker expects to

receive on his own assets after retirement. Assets can accumulate at a tax-

free rate in the pension plan, whereas retirees must pay taxes on earnings from

their investments. For those who intend to save part of their pension

benefits in the initial years of retirement, this provides an incentive for

the implicit contract outlined here. Unfortunately, our data set lacks the

detail necessary to construct marginal tax rates for beneficiaries. Some of

these effects will be picked up by the other variables in the empirical

model outlined below.
                                   9


     Post—retirement adjustments are usually granted on an ad hoc basis rather

than through any formal escalator clause. For instance, in our sample only

seven plans had explicit contractual provisions for automatic adjustments at

regular intervals. These intervals can be quite long; one plan required

adjustment every three years and another required them every sixth year. If

the contract for post—retirement adjustments is implicit and not legally

enforceable, the plan stands to gain considerably by reneging on the

agreement. The probability of cheating, in turn, determines the probability

that such contracts are acceptable to workers.

     The cost to the plan of cheating is reduced ability to write similar

implicit contracts in the future, since workers will simultaneously lower the

mean expected return and raise the expected variance from buying these

contracts. It also may cause the expected real present value of the

"guaranteed" minimum benefits to fall, especially in underfunded plans in

which liabilities are not fully covered by insurance. These costs are

likely to be especially sizable for large firms because (1) information

about their activites is likely to spread more widely through the labor

market and (2) assuming labor is more specialized in large firms, they are

more likely to use pension plans to reduce turnover and the costs of

investing in specific on—the—job training. If the likelihood of cheating is

lower in large plans, this gives us an additional reason for expecting

larger post—retirement adjustments in such plans.

     Potentially, unions can act as enforcement agents to prevent cheating by

the plan and increase the likelihood of post—retirement adjustments. Even
                                     10

though such adjustments are not a mandatory bargaining topic,4 unions have

ample means to pressure employers to discuss the matter. Whether this is

in the union's interest is an empirical question. Many workers have the

same incentive as the firm to violate arrangements made with retirees, since

they can use the strike threat to obtain a share of the capital gains. On

the other hand, other workers will not want to forfeit the option of using

post—retirement adjustments as a device for investments or risk—sharing

when they retire. This is especially likely to be true for older workers.

Both the median voter model and recent empirical findings by Freeman (1983)

on pension plan provisions indicate that the preferences of older workers

receive much more weight than those of younger workers in forming union

objectives. This makes it more likely that unions will act in their

interests.

     Another factor encouraging unions to act in this fashion is the activity

of retirees in union political affairs. Retirees can sometimes vote for union

officers and attend union conventions. In the United Mine Workers they even

vote on contract ratification. This means distributing a portion of any rents

obtained in negotiations to retirees can yield a political payoff to union

officers. In contrast, retiree preferences will receive zero weight in a

non—union setting, making an intergenerational transfer from workers to

retirees unlikely. Thus, we expect larger post-retirement adjustments in

collectively bargained plans because of (1) greater costs to the firm for

reneging on the implicit contract and (2) a preference—weighting scheme tilted

toward retirees and older workers.
                                    11

      In addition to post-retirement adjustments existing as a form of

compensation for which workers must pay, firms may use these contracts to

regulate employee behavior. Unvested pensions can reduce turnover by

increasing the cost of taking a job at another establishment. In inflationary

periods, pension benefit formulas based on salaries also penalize job

changers, since the formulas are based on nominal rather than real salaries

(see Clark and McDermed, 1982, and Bulow, 1982a). Post—retirement

adjustments can be distributed in order to either maintain or exacerbate these

effects.    ifl Clark, Alien, and Sumner (1983), we found that 17 percent of the

plans giving adjustments increased benefits by a straight percentage, whereas

27 percent made the magnitude of the increase a function of years of service.

Furthermore, eligibility for increases in some of the plans was limited to

workers with a minimum amount of preretirement service ranging between 10 to

20 years.

     Theoretically, it is not clear that post-retirement adjustments would be

a more or less effective device than the benefit formula itself for

influencing employee quit decisions. Conceivably, post—retirement adjustments

simultaneously increase the returns from working an additional year with the

firm (via an implicit contract in which the magnitude of future benefit increases

is linked to tenure) and reduce the variance of expected real pension wealth

for workers by insuring against inflation risk. If these effects have a

greater impact on turnover than an upward adjustment in the benefit formula

costing an equal amount, such an approach may be optimal. To put the same

point somewhat differently, by giving post—retirement adjustments to its

retirees, the firm hopes to change the expectations of its current workers so

that they value their pension contract in real rather than nominal terms
                                    12

Another possibility is that since the Employee Retirement Income Security Act

(ERISA) has made it more difficult for firms to use vesting requirements to

discourage turnover, basing post—retirement adjustments on years of service is

now a second-best mechanism for achieving the same result. Regulation of

explicit pension contracts may also explain why firms have adopted implicit

contracts.5

by the Department of Labor, is the primary data source for this study.

These data are from a stratified random sample of pension plans filing

series 5500 and 5500C forms in 1975. The PBMF combines information from the

Arthur Young and Company Survey of Private Pension Benefits Amounts with

Social Security information from the Summary Earnings Record and from a

standard summarization of the Master Beneficiary Record, known as the Survey

Benefit Summary Record. The Arthur Young survey contained information on

671,000 persons receiving benefits on December 31, 1978 from 446 plans of

371 sponsors. In all but two cases where more than one plan per sponsor was

reported, the second and/or third plan was not part of the formal sampling

process but was provided along with the requested plan data by the

responding plan. These additional plans were deleted from the analysis,

since they were assigned a zero plan weight in the sampling process.

Weights provided by the Department of Labor enabled us to construct weighted

samples of individuals and plans that were representative of the set of pen—

sion plans that existed in 1975.

     Although the PBMF included defined contribution as well as defined

benefit plans, this analysis concentrates exclusively on the defined benefit

plans. The defined contribution plans were excluded because of limitations in

the sampling procedure that made it impossible to determine potential benefit

increases for many of these plans. In addition, only 50 percent of the

beneficiaries in the five largest plans in the Arthur Young survey were

matched with the Social Security data because of a resource constraint

imposed by the Social Security Administration. The weights for individuals

in these plans were doubled to compensate for the decrease in the sample

size. Persons in any plan receiving a lump sum distribution were eliminated

from the sample.

     The PBMF contained information reported by firms on individuals who were

receiving benefits in December 1978. Data were included on age, year of

retirement, years of credited service, sex, race, marital status, Social

Security reported earnings, and the current pension benefit. All benefit

amounts were converted to an annual benefit. In addition, plan charac-

teristics such as union status, number of beneficiaries, and industrial

category also were reported. Specific questions were asked about any

increases in post—retirement benefits awarded between January 1, 1973 and

January 1, 1979. Plan sponsors were asked to indicate the size and method

of each increase, date of each increase and types of beneficiaries eligible

for each increase.

     Using this information, we were able to construct annual pension benefits

from 1973 to 1979 for most of the beneficiaries. This task required that

individuals in each plan be examined carefully to determine if they were

eligible to receive an increase. Then, using the increase formula, the
                                    14

magnitude of the increase for each individual was calculated. Working

backwards over the six-year period, we determined the annual benefit for most

of the beneficiaries in the sample. Some plans failed to report information

such as years of service that was necessary to reconstruct benefit increases.

In these plans we attempted to use related information in the PBMF to

construct appropriate proxies for the missing data. For several plans, this

was impossible and they were deleted from the sample.

     The reported benefit on the PBMF is assumed to be the benefit a person

would receive throughout 1979. Benefit increases reported in one year are

assumed to take effect in January of the following year. For example, the

1979 benefit reported on the PBMF reflects all 1978 increases. Thus, to

determine the 1978 benefit we subtract the implied increase from the 1979

benefit. This process continues until annual benefits from 1973 to 1979 are

calculated. This paper reports the results of an analysis of post—retirement

benefit increases for persons who were retired throughout this period.

Thus, we selected individuals who were already retired at the beginning of

1973 so that they were receiving benefits during the entire period.

     To estimate post—retirement benefit adjustment equations, some additional

restrictions had to be imposed on the sample.   In three plans the average per-

cent increase in nominal benefits was over 190 percent.   In no other plan,

however, was the average increase more than 75 percent. Although the 1979

benefits in these plans were comparable to those of other plans in the

sample, the derived 1973 benefits were unusually small. We attribute this

to incomplete or inaccurate information provided us about how benefit

increases between 1973 and 1979 were calculated. These three plans are
                                    15

excluded from the sample. This problem also arose for some individuals in

other plans, again presumably because of errors in reporting benefit changes

in complete detail. Accordingly all individuals with 1973 benefits of less

than $10 are excluded from the sample. Finally, there were severe reporting

errors in or missing values for three of the independent variables (years of

service, year of retirement, and age at retirement; for example, average age

at retirement in one plan was 85) in twelve of the plans.   These plans were

dropped from the sample. When only one or two of these variables were

missing or implausible, sample means were substituted for the reported

value. All estimates reported below are derived using the PBMF sampling

weights. The weighting is necessary because large plans were intentionally

overrepresented in the survey.


                             Empirical Specification

     The rationales for post-retirement adjustments offered above have empirical

implications that are testable over the PBMF. The compensating differential

implies a tradeoff between post—retirement adjustments and either wages or ini-

tial benefits. Large plans are more likely to provide post—retirement adjust-

ments because of higher rates of return and a lower probability of reneging on

the implicit contract. The latter factor, along with the political dominance of

older workers and retirees, makes collectively bargained plans more likely to

provide post—retirement adjustments. If these adjustments are used to

discourage turnover, they should be correlated with years of service.

     We will focus most of our attention on a specification in which the

dependent variable is the change in benefits between 1973 and 1979 divided by

1973 benefits. This variable is not distributed normally because it is
                                     16

truncated from below at zero. To shed more light on the determinants of where

any individual is likely to be in that distribution, we estimate OLS

regressions for a binary variable indicating whether a person ever received an

increase in his benefit and for the ratio of the change in benefits to 1973

benefits for those who received increases. Although OLS is not the most

appropriate estimation technique for a binary dependent variable, alternatives

such as probit or maximum likelihood logit are quite expensive for a sample

of over 130,000 observations. Since switching from OLS to one of the other

techniques generally does not radically alter estimates in large samples, we

did not feel such an expense was justified.

     Comparison of 1973 and 1979 benefits can produce misleading conclusions

about the adjustment of benefits if there are important differences in the

timing of such adjustments. To take this into account, we consider two

additional dependent variables:   (1) the number of increases given over this

period and (2) the ratio of the present value of real benefits between 1973

and 1979 to the present value of benefits that would have been received under

complete indexation.

     Our choice of independent variables is restricted largely by the

available data. To estimate the tradeoff between wages and post—retirement

adjustments, we use the five—year salary average before retirement as the wage

variable. Annual salaries were estimated from the Social Security earnings

histories using Foxes (1979) method. Final five—year salary averages were not

available for persons retiring before 1956.   initial benefits for this sample can-

not be determined, since our knowledge of benefit increases begins with 1973.

As a proxy we use 1973 benefits. This variable equals initial benefits plus any
                                     17

post-retirement adjustments granted before 1973.   If these two variables are

independent, the 1973 benefit produces a downwardly biased estimate of the

tradeoff between initial benefits and post—retirement adjustments (because of

positive correlation between post—retirement adjustments before and after

1973). However, since our model predicts a negative correlation between ini-

tial benefits and post—retirement adjustments, the direction of bias cannot be

predicted.

     Most, but not all, plans reported collective bargaining status on either

the PBMF or a file of EBS—l reports obtained from the National Bureau of

Economic Research. The collective bargaining status for some plans remained

unspecified. Rather than throwing out these observations, we use two union

status variables. The first indicates whether the plan was collectively

bargained; the second, whether collective bargaining status was unreported.

This allows the coefficient of the first variable to be interpreted as a

union-non-union difference. Union status is correlated with many other

variables, requiring some additional controls. A set of industry dummies at

roughly the 1—digit level of aggregation is included for this reason.

     Our measure of plan size is the number of beneficiaries in 1979. Since

plan size can be measured in a number of additional dimensions, we also

examined the number of participants and the dollar value of all benefits paid

to 1979 beneficiaries. These specifications produced very similar results and

are not reported. The years of service variable used is reported by the

pension plan. This does not necessarily equal total years employed by a

given company, depending upon rules for participation in the plan. For

instance, years of credited service under the pension plan may be somewhat

smaller than total years   employed in the firm.
                                      18


     Dummy variables corresponding to the year in which the person retired are

included in the model to test whether persons who have been retired the

longest are treated differently from recent retirees. Although this is an

important empirical question for measuring the economic well—being of the

elderly, our model does not address this issue.    If post-retirement

adjustments result from implicit contracts to insure against inflation risk,

the optimal insurance policy could conceivably be one that provides the

largest payoffs to those who live the longest. Such insurance is cheaper

than a policy providing equal protection at all ages and, under fairly

reasonable assumptions, provides a greater reduction in wealth uncertainty

during retirement. For most individuals, self insurance will be more

efficient in the years immediately after retirement. They pay a

"deductible'1 for protection in later years by receiving relatively smaller

(or zero) post—retirement adjustments during first retirement years. Finally,

we include age at retirement, sex and race as independent variables. These

variables capture longevity risk differences or other differences not

accounted for in our specification.


                               Empirical Results

     Although the PBMF includes individuals retiring since 1950, five—year

Social Security earnings data are available only for persons retiring since

1956. This forces us to examine two different samples to be able to both

estimate compensating differentials and measure the distribution of post-

retirement adjustments across the broadest possible number of cohorts.

         aThe dependent variable is the ratio of the change in benefits between 1973 and 1979 to the 1973 benefit.
Binary variables indicating whether collective bargaining status is unreported, whether sex is unreported,
industry       of employer, and year of retirement are also included.

         bsample includes persons who retired from 1956 to 1972 for whom a final five—year salary average was
available. The weighted mean of the dependent variable is 0.285 over the 129,057 unweighted observations in this
sample.

         CSamp1e includes persons who retired from 1950 to 1972. The weighted mean of the dependent variable is 0.308
over the 137,038 unweighted observations in this sample.
                                    19

over those retiring since 1956. A specification without the salary average

and initial benefit variables is reported so valid comparisons can be made to

the means and coefficients in columns 4 and 5 obtained when the sample is

expanded to include persons retiring since 1950. The dependent variable is

the ratio of the change in benefits between 1973 and 1979 to benefits in 1973.

     The coefficients of both the salary average and the 1973 benefit variables

in column 3 are negative and large in absolute value relative to their

standard errors, as predicted by the compensating differentials model.

Controlling for other factors, a 10 percent increase in salary averaqe

reduces the amount of post—retirement adjustment over our six-year period by

about 0.5 percentage points. A 10 percent increase in 1973 pension level

reduces the post—retirement adjustment over the period by 2.9 percentage

points. Both of these results imply rather small losses in present value of

pension flows from post-retirement adjustments for large gains in final wage

or initial pensions.

     The magnitude of the implied compensating wage differential indicates

that a pure tradeoff between forms of compensation is not being estimated. One

factor accounting for this is a tendency for all forms of compensation to be

positively related across workers or firms. Only by holding constant the

level of total compensation including unobservable job and worker charac-

teristics may pure compensating differentials be calculated.6   All the

regressions in Table 2 include several controls that are positively related to

level of compensation, and coefficients for each of these variables (plan

size, unionization, tenure, age at retirement and male) are larger in column 3

than they are in column 2. This 'indicates that in column 2 they picked up part
                                    20

of the negative effect of salary and pension level on post—retirement adjust-

ments. Even given the controls, however, a considerable amount of

uncontrolled variation in post—retirement adjustments remains (witness the low

R2 values), so the magnitude Of the compensating differential estimates is

not surprising. A second reason for the small size of these coefficients is

that measurement error in both the initial benefit and salary average

variables downwardly biases their regression coefficients and, thus, upwardly

biases the estimate of the compensating wage differential.

     A final explanation for large implied compensating differentials is that

the 1973 benefit variable is larger than initial benefits for all retirees who

received any post—retirement adjustment prior to 1973. Using a simulation

analysis, we estimated that by 1973, persons retiring between 1956 and 1960

already had received post—retirement increases of between 70 and 120 percent

of their initial benefits (Clark, Allen, and Sumner, 1983). This implies

that the 1973 benefit is approximately twice the size of the initial benefit

for these retirees. Thus, the tradeoff implied by the coefficients reported

in Table 2 for post—retirement increases as a percentage of the 1973 benefit

is larger in terms of the retiree's initial pension benefit. For the

pre-1960 retirees, the implied increase in benefits between 1973 and 1979 is

about 6.0 percentage points (2.9 percent of the 1973 benefit is approximately

6.0 percent of initial benefit for these oldest retirees) for a 10 percent

decline in initial benefits. If this 6 percentage point increase is awarded

every 6 years and if a retiree lives 18 years after retirement, the bene-

fit at death will be approximately 19 percent higher than the initial

benefit.7   Although still not an equal trade in present value terms, such
                                    21

a ratio may reflect more accurately tradeoffs between initial benefits and

post—retirement adjustments.

     Estimates of the other coefficients are generally consistent with

the reasoning presented earlier. The plan size coefficient indicates a

positive and significant impact of larger plan size on the magnitude of

post-retirement increases. A ten thousand-person increase in the number of

recipients in 1979 is associated with a 4.8 percentage point larger benefit

increase. The largest plan in the sample had 67,130 recipients in 1979;

the regression coefficient implies that this plan gave a 24 percentage point

larger increase than the average plan. The smallest plan in the sample had

one recipient. The estimated coefficient implies that it gave an 8.2 per-

centage point smaller increase than the average plan. A significant plan

size effect was found throughout our analysis as we varied the independent

variables in the equation and used alternative definitions of plan size.

The magnitude of the plan size coefficient declines somewhat when salary

average and 1973 benefit are deleted (column 2) or when the sample is

expanded to include persons retiring in the early 1950s (column 5) but it

remains significantly greater than zero.

     Collectively bargained plans granted larger benefit increases than non—

collectively bargained plans. The increases in union plans were estimated to be

16.0 percentage points larger than those in non—union plans. At the sample means

the average union plan gave a 32.9 percent increase; the average non—union plan,

a 16.9 percent increase. Thus, increases in union plans were almost twice

those in the non-union plans. Table 2 indicates that the union coefficient

changes only slightly when the specification and sample are changed.8
                                    22

     Years of service is strongly correlated with benefit increases. An addi-

tional year of service is associated with a 1.6 percentage point larger increase

in benefits during the sample period. The age of retirement coefficient is

estimated with little precision. The sign indicates the magnitudes of adjust-

ments increase with later retirement. Use of firm—reported information about

whether the retirement was early, normal, or delayed did not improve the

precision of this estimate. Both the years of service and age at retirement

coefficients are more sensitive to changes in the specification and sample.

Age at retirement is the only variable for which the sign of the coefficient

changed in response to alternative specifications.

     As for the other coefficients, post—retirement benefit increases are

insignificantly different by sex and race in the compensating differential model

shown in column 3. The deletion of the salary average and 1973 benefit from

the model produces estimates indicating larger post-retirement adjustments

for females and nonwhites. The industry variables (not shown in Table 2)

indicate that increases were larger in the mining, manufacturing and

transportation sectors of the economy.

     The expanded sample of 1950-72 retirees is used to examine the magnitude of

benefit increases in percentage terms across cohorts. The year of retire-

ment means and coefficients are reported in the first two columns of Table

3. These coefficients come from the benefit change equation reported in

column 5 of Table 2. They indicate how the magnitude of the adjustment dif-

fers by year of retirement relative to a person retiring in 1972. The ratio

of the change in benefits between 1973 and 1979 to 1973 benefits by year of

retirement in the third column is calculated by adding the year of retire—

     aThe change in nominal benefits for persons retiring in a given year are
calculated for a white male union manufacturing worker with the mean values of
years of service, number of 1979 recipients in plan, and age at retirement.

     bThe values in this column are calculated by dividing the ratios in the
preceding column by ratio of the change in the CPI between 1973 and 1979 to
the CP1 in 1973 (.633).

ment coefficient to the predicted benefit for a white male union manufac—

turing worker retiring in 1972 with the sample mean values of 1979

recipients, age of retirement, and years of service. These figures are

divided by the ratio of 1973—79 CPI change to the 1973 CPI (.633) to obtain

the ratios of the percentage change in nominal benefits to the percentage

change in prices in the last column.

     The regression coefficients show that percent increases in pension

benefits are much larger for those who have been retired the longest. The

average white male union manufacturing worker retiring in 1972 had a 22.8

percent larger pension in 1979 than in 1973. Workers who retired before

1964 received at least twice as large a percentage increase. This pattern

of larger benefit increases is caused by firms using increase formulas that

provide explicitly for larger increases to those retired for longer periods.

In addition, flat dollar increases will also give larger percentage

increases to long—term retirees who had lower initial benefits.

     Although inflation need not have been a direct causal factor, an important

policy issue is how these increases compare to the change in the cost of

living over this period. We think they were surprisingly large. The conven-

tional view has been that pension benefits did not adjust at all. Instead we

find workers who retired before 1964 saw their benefits increase by more than

three-quarters as much as prices. Workers who retired between 1964 and 1967

saw their benefits increase by more than 50 percent of the price rise. The

workers who were most likely to have anticipated relatively little inflation

during retirement were also least likely to have witnessed a severe erosion in

real benefits.
                                    24

    To determine the sensitivity of the results to the truncation of the depen-

dent variable at zero, the model was re-estimated using two different equations:

(1) a linear probability model of whether an increase was given between 1973 and

1979 and (2) the ratio of the benefit increase to 1973 benefits, estimated

over only those receiving at least one increase. These were estimated over

the sample of persons retiring between 1950 and 1972 and are reported in

columns 1 and 2 of Table 4.   These findings are in general agreement with

those reported in Table 2. Increases in plan size raise the probability of

a persons having received any increase and the magnitude of increases con

ditional on having received at least one increase. Each 10,000 increase in

the number of 1979 recipients raises the probability of receiving at least

one benefit increase by 5.2 percentage points and the magnitude of the total

increase between 1973 and 1979 by 2.4 percentage points Being in a union

plan raises the likelihood of receiving an increase by 22.6 percentage

points and the magnitude of increases by 12.3 percentage points among those

receiving increases. Years of service retains its strong positive correla—

tion with both measures of benefit increases, whereas increases in the age

of retirement lower the probability of receiving an increase but have no

effect on the magnitudes of increases among those receiving them.

     The timing of increases is considered by examining the number of increases

given over the period (in column 3 of Table 4) and the ratio of discounted

nominal benefits to fully indexed benefits (in column 4). Once again, the

overall picture from Table 2 is more or less unchanged. Larger plans gave

more increases and the increases were larger in present value. Collectively

bargained plans, on average, gave one more increase than did non—union

plans. Individuals with long job tenure were more likely to receive

increases. On the whole, the basic findings seem quite robust as to the

specification of the dependent variable.

     The empirical results provide strong evidence of compensating differentials

in final salary and initial benefits in firms providing post—retirement adjust-

ments. The strong weight given to years of service is consistent with the

use of benefit increases to regulate employee mobility. The results also

show that post—retirement adjustments are larger in large plans and in plans

covered by collective bargaining agreements. This is consistent with the

notion that implicit contracts are more likely to be written when the like-

lihood of reneging on the contract is low. A final major finding of this

paper is that benefit increases tend to be larger for those who have been

retired the longest.

     Regardless of how these results are interpreted in theoretical terms,

they indicate strongly that the private pension system was much more responsive

during the 1970s inflation than was previously believed. Further, our evi-

dence on tradeoffs between benefit increases and both wages and initia'

benefits suggests regulations requiring private pension indexation will

lower the welfare of those who prefer higher wages or initial benefits to

future benefit increases.

     These results also suggest existing models of the costs of pension

benefits to employers (or equivalently, their value to employees) be re-

examined. With most beneficiaries receiving sizable post—retirement adjust—

ments, the present value of the expected stream of payments implied by the
                                     26

benefit formula at the tinieof retirement will in most cases be a downwardly

biased measure of worker's pension wealth. This makes it impossible to use

an "explicit contract" framework to derive either the increment to this

wealth in each year of employment or the firm's total pension liability.

Since the empirical results imply workers earn larger post—retirement

adjustments with additional years of service, the tilt of pension accruals

toward the most senior workers has been underestimated in previous studies.

The "accrued benefit" approach for evaluating pension liabilities produces

misleading results for the same reason. Unless the implicit contract is

"unveiled," this approach will ignore an important part of the plan's

liabilities.

     We do not claim to have identified fully all parameters of such

contracts. In future work it would be useful to explore the effects of such

variables as plan financial performance and training costs on benefit

increases to test directly the rationales we have offered rather than using

proxies such as plan size.   It is also possible that the experience in the

l970s was atypical, a conjecture that can only be tested by examining data

sets from other periods.

     'TIAA—CREF has developed an explicit contract similar to the one

described here. TIAA-CREF Graded Payment Method allows a person to have

scheduled increases in benefits in exchange for a lower initial benefit.

     2This condition holds for a given value of the riskiness of r, The con-

dition would have to be restated in terms of the expected utility of each party

to allow the riskiness of r to vary across plans.

     3The contract for post—retirement adjustments may be desirable as a risk-.

sharing device even if it offers a lower expected rate of return than the

worker's own assets. This would be the case, for instance, if the variance of

the plan's rate of return is lower than the worker's or if their covariance is

negative.

     5unfortunately, our time series does not allow us to test whether the use of

post—retirement adjustments increased after the passage of ERISA. Simulation

experiments in Clark, Allen, and Sumner (1983) indicate that benefit increases

were awarded during the l950s and 1960s.

     6See Duncan and Holrnlund (1983) for discussion of potential biases in esti-

mates of compensating differentials.

     7lhese values are derived by assuming the 1973 benefit is twice the size of

the initial benefit for persons retiring during the l950s. A 2.9 percent

increase in 1973 benefits would represent approximately 6 percent of the ini-

tial benefit. The value of post—retirement adjustments would be greater if the

retiree has chosen a joint survivors option where the higher benefits
                                    28

would continue as long as the retiree or spouse survived. There were

insufficient data on the PBMF to determine if persons selecting joint sur-

vivorship received larger or more frequent increases.

     8For a more detailed analysis of the effect of unions on post—retirement

increases as well as on the initial pension benefit, see Allen and Clark (1984).
