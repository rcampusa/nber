        This paper contributes to research endogenizing multinational firms in general-equilibrium

trade models.      We attempt to integrate separate contributions     on horizontal multinationals   which

produce the same final product in multiple locations, with work on vertical multinationals,          which

geographically      fragment production by stages. Previously derived results now emerge as special

cases of a more general model. Vertical multinationals        dominate when countries are very different

in relative factor endowments.       Horizontal multinationals   dominate when the countries are similar

in size and in relative endowments,          and trade costs are moderate to high. In some cases, foreign

investment       or trade liberalization    leads to a reversal in the direction   of trade.   Investment

liberalization     can also lead to an increase in the volume of trade and produces a strong tendency

toward factor-price equalization.          Thus direct investment can be a complement   to trade in both a

volume-of-trade      sense and in a welfare sense.

 1.      Introduction

         The theory of the multinational enterprise has traditionally been rather disjoint from the

theory of international      trade.   International   trade theory developed from a general-equilibrium

tradition, usually relying on the twin assumptions of constant return to scale and perfect competition

in production.       The theory of the multinational enterprise has tended to be a branch of a more

general theory of the firm, focussing on individual firms and their incentives to internally integrate

activities across geographic space.

         During the last fifteen years, the theory of international trade has broadened considerably,

incorporating models based on increasing returns, imperfect competition, and in some case product

differentiation.     But the treatment of individual firms remains limited, generally detached both from

the theory of the multinational enterprise and empirical evidence. Firms are modelled as single-plant,

single-product organizations with all equity concentrated in the country of (single-plant) production.

Yet industries with strong scale economies and oligopolistic market structures are often dominated

by multinationals.

        More recently, there have been attempts to endogenize multinational firms into general-

equilibrium trade models. Firm-level characteristics combine with country-level characteristic         and

trade wsts to determine what types of firms exist in equilibrium. Yet the various papers are limited

in generality, in part due to severe technical challenges. Perhaps the most difficult of these is that

characterizing the types of firms in existence as a function of parameter values is inherently an

exercise in comparative statics on inequalities. Second, the dimensionality of even a minimal partial-

equilibrium model is large when their are alternative configurations of firms and plants.

        Two branches of literature in particular remain separate.       In one, multinationals   are multi-

plant firms producing roughly the same product in different locations, substituting international

production for trade (Markusen, 1984). These models of “horizontal” multinationals are particularly


                                                        1
                                                        2

relevant empirically for investment          among the developed economies.         In the second branch,

multinationals are firms that separate activities geographically with investment leading to intra-firm

trade (Helpman,        1984).   These models of “vertical” direct investment       seem more relevant to

investments into developing economies, a category which has been historically small but which has

grown substantially during the last five years.

            The purpose of this paper is to provide an integrated treatment of these models, so that

various combinations of vertical multinationals, horizontal multinationals, and strictly national firms

can arise endogenously as a function of parameter values. The parameters in question are trade

costs, differences between countries in relative and in absolute factor endowments, and investment

barriers.     me    horizontal model of Markusen, with generalizations by Horstmann          and Markusen

(1992), Brainard (1993), and Markusen and Venables (1995, 1996a,b) emerges as a special case as

does the vertical model of Helpman, with extensions by Helpman and Krugman (1985), Konan (1996)

and Zhang (1996).

            The model begins in a traditional fashion with two countria, two goods, and two factors. One

sector has increasing returns both at the firm (e.g., R&D) and the plant level. Trade costs may exist

between countries.       The increasing-returns indust~ has six possible firm “types”, with the types of

firms active in equilibrium denoted a “production regime”.            There are two types of single-plant

national firms (type-n firms), one for each country. These firm locate their “headquarters” activities

in the same country as their single plant.           Vertical multinationals   (type-v firms) locate their

headquarters       and single plant in different countries as in Helpman’s original model.       Horizontal

multinationals are two-plant firms, with their headquarters in one country.         The two types each of

vertical and horizontal multinationals are subscripted by country, in each case the country in which

their headquarters      activities are located.   Headquarters   activities (firm-level fixed costs) use only

skilled labor, plant f~ed costs use a combination of skilled and unskilled labor, and final production
                                                        3

requires only unskilled labor. 1

         We show that vertical multinationals           dominate    production     when the countries        differ

significantly in relative     factor endowments,       but are somewhat          similar in size.      Horizontal

multinationals dominate when the countries are similar in both size and in relative endowments, and

when trade costs are moderate to high. National firms dominate (a) when trade costs are low and

relative endowments      are similar or, (b) when trade costs are moderate, relative endowments are

similar, and the countri=     differ significantly in size.

         The “trade regime” (the direction of imports and exports), is of considerable interest in that

it can differ substantially from standard Heckscher-Ohlin theory and its trade-industrial-organization

extensions (e.g., Helpman and Krugman). While the increasing returns sector (X) is assumed skilled-

labor intensive overall relative to the competitive sector (Y), multinationals can unbundle this sector

into separate activities, one of which is more skilled-labor intensive than Y (headquarters)             and one

of which is less skilled-labor intensive (final production).       If differences in relative endowments are

moderate,    then the skilled-labor-abundant       country exports X.       But if the relative endowment

difference is large, type-v firms enter, fragment the X sector, mncentrating            headquarters     activities

in the skilled-labor-abundant    country and production in the unskilled-labor abundant country. This

reverses the direetion of trade, with the skilled-labor-abundant        country importing X.

        The ratio of sales by affiliates of multinationals to the sum of trade flows and affiliate sales

is of some interest.   If trade costs are low, this ratio is highest when the muntries differ significantly

in relative endowment but are of similar size (type-v firms dominate).             If trade costi are high, the

ratio is highest when the countries are similar in both relative endowments and size (type-m firms



     lHorizontal multinationals do have a verticat component to them, in that the headquarters services are
supplied to the foreign branch plant. This is surely true of all multinationals: there are service flowswithin the
firm. Our distinction between vertical multinationals and horizontal multinationals is in a sense simply one of
deftition. The form is a “vertical”relationship in the sense that servicesflow in one direction and final output
in the other. There is no intra-fum trade in goods in the case of our horizontal f~ms.
dominate).

        We then inquire into the effects of multinationals by comparing an unrestricted equilibrium

to one in which multinationals are banned by assumption.        Results include the following.    First,

investment liberalization can, in some cases, reverse the direction of trade and/or increase the volume

of trade.    Second, investment liberalization (like trade liberalization in more traditional models)

produces a strong tendency toward factor-price equalization.    Thus direct investment and trade can

be complements in both a volume-of-trade sense and in a welfare sense.

        Throughout the paper, we will try to indicate the empirical relevance of certain situations and

the potentially testable predictions generated by the model.
 2.      Model Structure

         The model has two countries (h and f) producing two homogeneous goods, Y and X. There

are two factors of production, L (unskilled labor), and S (skilled labor). L and S are mobile between

industries but internationally immobile. Y will be used as numeraire throughout the paper. Skilled

labor is used for the Grin-specific f~ed cost of producing X, and plant-specific f~ed wsts use a

combination of the two labor types. Unskilled labor is used in variable rests, and in addition there

are transport nsts between countries, specified as units of unskilled labor per unit of X exported.

        Subscripts (i)j) will be used to denote the countries (f,h). The output of Y in country i is a

CES function, identical in both countries. The production function for Y is


(1)




where LiYand S iYare the unskilled and skilled labor used in the Y sector in country i. The elasticity

of substitution (1/(1-•)) is set at 5.0 in the simulation runs reported later in the paper.

        Superscripts (n,v,m) will be used to daignate a variable as referring to national firms, vertical

multinationals,   and horizontal multinational firms respectively.   (m i , vi , n i ) will also be used to

indicate the number of active m, v, and n firms based in country i. Hopefully, it will always be clear

from the context what is being represented (e.g., ni as a variable in an equation always refers to the

number of national firms in country i).

        The quantification of fwed costs in the X sector is of considerable importance in this model.

Notation is as follows, with F’s denoting skilled-labor requirements and G’s denoting unskilled-labor

requirements.

F;      Skilled labor requirements of a type-n firm drawn from headquarters’ country

F;      Slrilled labor requirements of a type-v firm drawn from headquarters’ country

F;       Skilled labor requirements of a type-m firm drawn from non-headquarters’           country

G“       Unskilled labor requirements for a type-n firm drawn from headquarters’ count~ (where the
         plant is located).

G“
        Unskilled labor requirements for a type-n firm drawn from the non-headquarters’               country
        (where the plant is located).

G“      Unskilled labor requirements for a type-m firm, which must be incurred in each country (one
        G“ for each plant).

        Several assumptions guide us in specifying the relative values of freed-cost parameters.

        (a) Skilled labor need in f~ed costs should be the same for both type-n and type-v single-

plant firms (F; = F;+     F).   But type-v firms will need to draw some of this skilled labor from the

country in which the plant is located (F; > O). For type-n firms, all of these skilled labor

requirements will be drawn from the headquarters’ country.

        (b) Skilled labor needed in fwed costs for type-m firms should be higher than the amount

required for single-plant type-n and type-v firms, but much less than double the amount (2F~ > F?

+ F; > F).      This latter assumption reflects the joint-input nature of knowledge capital.          Type-m

firms require somewhat more skilled labor in the headquarters’ muntry               (FT > F“ , reflecting

technology-transfer   and other costs) and some skilled labor in the host country. 2

        (c) Unsfilled labor requirements should be the same for all plants and should be drawn

entirely from the country in which a plant is located (Gm = Gn = G’).

        (d) In order to prevent a degeneracy in the model and to account for the real possibility that



    2Markusen and Venables (1995a,b)assume that rdlX-sector activitiesuse factors in the same proportion or
use just a single factor, Labor-market effects are only of second-order importance in those papers and not
addressed. Assumptions similar to the present ones are introduced in Markusen and Venables 1995c,but there
are no type-vfums. The technology-transfercost (F7 > F?) is motivated by empirical results, especially those
of Teece (1977, 1986), that direct investments require si~lcant further investments in skilled-labor-intensive
activities for multinational fums,
                                                             7

there is some cost to separating plant and headquarters, we assume that all fwed costs for a type-v

firm are 1% higher than the f~ed costs for a type-n firm (F;+                   F;=   1.01“F:, G’=     l. Ol*Gn ). 3

         Using these principles as guidelines, the values used in the simulations throughout the paper

are as follows.

Nation Firms Headquartered          in Country i:
         F;=    1.0                           G“ = 1.0
Horizontal Multinationals Headquartered             in tiuntry     i:
         F? = 1.1           F;=    0.1        Gm = 1.0             (one Gm required for each plant)
Vertical Multinationals Headquartered           in Country i:
         F;=   0.909        F;=   0.101       G’=     1.01

         Marginal factor requirements are constant in units of unskilled labor. 4 X~j denotes the sales

in country j of a national firm based in country i. Let w i, and z i, denote the prices of unskilled labor

and skilled labor respectively in country i. A national firm undertakes all its production in its base

country, so the cost function of one national firm in country i is given by

where c is the constant marginal production cost. c, Fn~, and G n are identical across countries.                 r is

the amount of unskilled labor needed to transport one unit of X from country i to country j, which




    3Consider an equilibrium with at least one type-n~f~m and at least one type-~ firm. If we did not have this
cost penalty these two fums could be exchanged for one type-v~ f~m and one type-vf firm and we would still
have an equilibrium (total factor demands in each country are unchanged, etc.). Thus the equilibrium is
degenerate. Our assumption of the l~o cost penalty seems very realistic, and avoids this technical problem.

     4We assume that sktied workers cannot be used in X production (e.g., “unskilled workers” actually have
manual/mechanical skiUs that cannot be used in R&D, and vice versa for the skiUs of “skilled workers”). We
could assume that skilled workers have the same productivity in X as unskitled workers, effectively binding the
skilled-uskilled wage ratio to a lower bound of 1. This would add 12 more inequalities to the model. In the
parameterization we use, such a lower bound is almost never binding, exceptwhen mtitinationals are prohibited
(used for compwison purposes), in whichcase the ratio is less than one in equilibrium in about 10% of the factor
box.
                                                             8
we assume to be the same in both directions. In our calibration, national firms in the X sector are

moderately more skilled-labor intensive that Y-sector firms.

        A horizontal multinational based in country i has sales in country j, X~j . It operates one

plant in each muntry incurring freed costs, (Gm, F~ ) in its base country, and fixed costs (Gm, F;

) in country j. Sales are met entirely from local production not trade. L~j (S~j ) denotes a country

i horizontal multinational firm’s demand for unskilled (skilled) labor in country j. A firm type m i thus

has a cost function


(3)       wiLtirn+ wjLtirn+    Zis,;    + Zjsurn = Wi[cx,;       +   Gm] +   Wj[cxym      +   G’”] +   ZiF’lm + ZjF2m.




        Similarly, a vertical multinational based in muntry i (plant in country j) has sales in country

j, Xyj. L~j (S~j) denotes a country i vertical multinational firm’s demand for unskilled (skilled) labor

in country j. A firm type vi hm a cost function

        In our calibration, horizontal multinational firms are generally more skilled-labor intensive

than national and vertical multinational firms, using more skilled labor for branch-plant fixed rests

versus the additional unskilled labor for transport costs used by national or vertical firms.                            This

depends, however, on firm scale.

        Let ~, and ~i denote the total labor endowments of country i. Adding labor demand from n i

national firms, vi and Vjvertical multinationals, and mi and mj horizontal multinationals gives count~

i factor market clearing:
                                                          9


              ~ = Lb + niLin + miLi~ + mjLj~ + vjL~

In equilibrium, the X sector makes no profits so muntry i income, denoted Mi, is


(6)       Mi = Wig + Vif              i = h,f



pi denotes the price of X in muntry i, and XiCand YiCdenote the consumption of X and Y. Utility

giving demands


(8)       Xk = a Mijpi,              Yti = (1 -a)Mi.



        Equilibrium in the X sector is determined by pricing equations (marginal revenue equals

marginal rest) and free-entry conditions.          We denote proportional markups of price over marginal

cost by e~j , (k = n,m,v),   SO,   for example, e~i is the markup of a country j horizontal multinational

in market i. Pricing equations of national, horizontal, and vertical firms in each market are (written

in complementa~-slackness      form with associated variables in brackets):


(9)      Pi(l - e;) ~ ‘jc                 (x;)

(lo)     Pj(l -e;)      s Wi(c + t)        (x;)

(14)       Pi(l - e;) s Wj(C + T)       (x;)



         In a Cournot model with homogeneous products, the optimal markup formula is given by the

firm’s market share divided by the Marshallian price elasticity of demand in that market. In our

model, the price elasticity is one (see equation (8)), reducing the firm’s markup to its market share.

This gives, (also using demand equations (8)),


                xi      pjx;
(15)       e~=~=—                      k = n,m,v         i,j = hJ.

         There are six zero-profit wnditions corresponding to the numbers of the four firm types.

Given equations (9)-(14), zero profits can be written as the requirement that markup revenues equal

freed rests.

        To summarize the X sector in the model, the twelve inequalities (9)-(14) are associated with

the twelve output levels (two each for six firm types), the twelve equations in (15) are associated with

the twelve markups, and the six inequalities in (16)-(21) are associated with the number of firms of
                                                       11

each type. Additionally goods prices are given by (8), income levels from (6) and factor prices from

factor market clearing equation (5) together with labor demand from the Y sector.

         The model is quite complex for two reasons. First, a bare-bones partial equilibrium version

of the model would involve 30 non-linear inequalities as just noted.             Second, it is a problem of

comparative statics on inequalities, making traditional analytical, comparative-statics            methods of

limited value. The problems introduced by inequalities are compounded by the factor that we have

five different   production     activities (Y, X-sector output,      national-firm    fixed costs, horizontal

multinational-firm   fried costs, vertical multinational-firm fixed costs), all using factors in different

proportions. 5

        We did manage to make considerable analytical progress in two of our earlier papers,

Markusen and Venables (1995, 1996a,b). In the former we did this by examining a simplified partial

equilibrium model (a model of the model) and in the latter by adopting a monopolistic-competition

framework with f~ed markup rules, and only three firm types. In both models, production and all

fixed cost activities use factors in the same proportion and there are no vertical multinationals are

permitted.   In the next section, we will try to gain some intuition by reviewing analytical results from

our earlier papers with appropriate extensions, and later in the paper simulate the full model which

involves 51 non-linear inequalities using Rutherford’s (1995) non-linear complementarily             solver.




    5Reviewing points made separately earlier, type-m fums are moderately more skilled-labor intensive than
type-vf~ms which are moderately more skilled-laborintensive than national firms which are moderately more
skilled-labor-intensive than Y production in our calibrations. But many of the interestbg factor-mmket effects
that we identify are driven by geographical rearrangement of activities when multinationals are allowed to enter
rather than by the skilled-labor intensities of type-n or type-v fums versus type-m fums versus Y production per
se.

 3.      General   Discussion

        A brief review of our earlier separate results maybe in order (Markusen and Venables, 1995,

1996a,b Konan, 1996, Zhang, 1996), along with some conjectures about how they will relate to one

another in a more general model. First, consider the basic determinants of the production regime,

defined as the set of firm types active in equilibrium. A basic feature of the model is that horizontal

multinationals have multi-plant economies of scale, in that the total freed costs for a two-plant firm

are less than double the f~ed costi for a one-plant firm. Given the parameterization           of the model

noted above, at the equilibrium factor prims prevailing in free trade the f~ed costs of a type-m firm

are about 1.52 times the f~ed costs of a type-n or type-v firm.             The latter are low freed-cost

organizations, but they must incur transport costs in serving a foreign market.        The advantage of a

type-v firm over a type-n firm in turn lies in the possibility of international differences in factor prices:

large difference give the type-v firm an advantage in that it can locate each of its two activities in

different countries according to factor-price differences. The broad determinants of the equilibrium

production regime are as follows.

Production Re~ime

Type-m firms will tend to dominate when
      Firm-level scale economies are high relative to plant-level scale economies
      Total world demand is high
      Trade costs are moderate to high
      Countries are similar in relative factor endowmenk
      Countries are similar in size.

TWe-n firms will tend to dominate when
      Trade costs are low and countries are similar in relative endowments and si~
      Trade costs are moderate and countries are ve~ different in size.

Type-v firms will tend to dominate when
       Trade costs are moderate to low, and countries differ significantly in relative endowments.

       Some of this is fairly obvious, but a few comments about the roles of relative endowments and

muntry sizes are appropriate.      When trade barriers are moderate, type-m firms tend to have an
                                                    13

advantage over type-n or type-v firm when the countries are similar in relative endowments and size.

Neither country has an advantage in terms of a single plant, and the added fixed costs of having two

plants outweighs the trade costs incurred by a one-plant firm. But if the muntries are very different,

then one of them has an advantage, either in terms of being a much larger market or in terms of

having factor prices that favor X sector production.       Single-plant firms located in this advantaged

muntry then have an advantage over two-plant horizontal multinationals in that the latter must locate

costly capacity in a small and/or high-rest market. Thus the association of horizontal multinationals

with similar countries.

        When single-plant firms dominate, the qumtion of type-n firms versus type-v firms turns on

factor-price equalization.    If factor prices are roughly equalized with type-n firms dominating, then

type-v firms cannot enter.      There is a cost penalty to splitting headquarters     and plant, and no

offsetting advantage.     When factor-prices are very different across the two countries, then there is

an advantage in splitting the two activities, with the headquarters in country with cheap skilled labor

and the plant in the country with cheap unskilled labor. Our conjecture is then that type-v firms

should be able to enter when the two countries are very different in relative endowments so that

factor prices are not equalized when only type-n firms produce.         But differences in country sizes

should not support type-v firms in equilibrium.

        In the earlier work of Markusen and Venable, the mmparison of horizontal multinationals

with national firms suggested that multinationals tend to reduce the volume of trade in goods as

exports of “producer services” (e.g., blueprints,        managerial services) substitutes   for trade in

commodities. The addition of type-v firms make that less clear, as articles by Konan and Zhang show.

Investment liberalization can lead to a reversal in the direction of trade as previously integrated firms,

for example, begin to export component and producer sefices and re-import a large share of finished

(assembled) products from a subsidia~ in a smaller, unskilled-labor abundant country.             Similar
                                                    14

circumstance might lead to an increase in the volume of trade following trade liberalization.

         Another possibility that investment liberalization can increase the volume of trade lies in the

fact that, in the absence of multinationals,      “comparative advantage” in X is determined         by a

combination of country size and relative endowment factors. The country relatively well endowed

with skilled labor has a comparative advantage in X, but the larger of two countries also has such a

comparative advantage due to a “home market effect” familiar from the trade-industrial organization

literature.   When a count~ is large, but scarce in skilled labor it may export X, but have a high price

for skilled labor constraining its specialization and exports.    The entry of type-v firms in such a

situation basically relaxes this constraint by locating headquarters in the small, skilled-labor abundant

country thereby leading to an increase in the volume of trade.

         There is an interesting question about the volume of sales by affiliates of multinationals

relative to trade, something that is amenable to empirical examination. Our model should predict that

this ratio is high under the circumstance outline above so that horizontal multinationals dominate in

equilibrium. But it may also be moderately high when vertical multinationals dominate in equilibrium.

Unfortunately,    this leads to a less-than-sharp prediction.    If trade costs are high, then affiliate

production relative to trade should be highest when the countries are similar in size and in relative

endowments (type-m firms dominate). If trade costs are low, then affiliates should have a high share

when the countries are very different in relative endowments (type-v firms dominate).              These

conjectures are summarized as follows.

Trade Repime

The entry of multinationals (removal of an investment ban) may reverse the direction of trade in X
when the muntries differ significantly in relative endowments.

The entry of multinationals may increase the volume of trade when one country is larger but is
relative well endowed with umkilled labor.
                                                   15

The ratio of affiliate sales to the volume of trade plus affiliate sales is high when (a) trade costs are
low and the muntries differ significantly in relative size, (b) trade barriers are moderate to high and
the countries are similar in both relative endowments and size.

        Finally, there are interesting questions concerning how multinationals affect factor prices, a

subject we addressed in Markusen and Venables, 1996a. We noted that the ent~ of horizontal

multinationals generated a tendenq    toward international factor-price equalization in almost all cases.

Those results should be reinforced herewith the addition of vertical multinationals.    As noted above,

type-v firms in this model are creatures of situations where factor prices are unequal in their absence.

Allowing direct investment leads firms to fragment and rearrange X-sector activities, putting more

R&D in the skilled-labor-abundant     country and more production in the unskilled-labor-abundant

country, thus moving the world toward factor-price equalization.

Factor-Pri=   Equalization

The removal of investment       barriers should generate     a strong tendency     toward factor-price
equalization.

4.      Production     Regimes

        Figure 1 shows simulation results for three alternative values of transport costs,     T =   .00, .05,



and .10. Each panel is an Edgeworth box with the total world endowment of unskilled labor on the

horizontal axis and the total world endowment of skilled labor on the vertical axis. The origin for

country h is at the southwest corner and the origin for country f at the northeast corner.            These

diagrams will be familiar to most readers from the work of Dixit and Norman (1980) and the

adaptations to industrial-organization   models by Helpman and Krugman (1985).

        In the parameterization    we use, the skilled-unskilled wage rate at the center point of the

factor box is very steep; although this wage ratio is about 1.4S though the center, there are actually

many more units of unskilled labor than skilled labor, so that geometrically the factor-price ratio is

very steep. The point of mentioning this is that country size effects are very important in this model

in some cases, and in effect country h is smaller (in total income) at all points left of column 10 and

larger at all points to the right of column 10 in all of the diagrams.

        The top panel of Figure 1 shows a simplified regime diagram for the case of free trade

(complete characterizations    are provided in an appendix). There is a central region in which only

national firms operate, flanked by areas in which there is a mixture of type-n and type-v firms. In

the northwest corner only type-v (v~ ) firms are active in equilibrium and similarly an area of only

type-v (v ~) firms in the southeast corner. Obviously, these are regions in which only the unskilled-

Iabor-abundant country produces X while all headquarters are located in the skilled-labor abundant

country. b

        Results here are reminismnt of Helpman (19W). As the countries become very different in

relative endowments, factor-price equalization fails to hold in the absence of multinationals, creating


   %e might note that, because of the assumed cost penalty, type-vh and type-vf f~ms can never co-exist. One
each of these f~ms could be displaceby one each of a type-nhand type-~ firms. The latter generate exactly the
same outputs and factor demands except for having a l~o lower freed cost.
                                                       17

an opportunity for type-v firms to enter. The middle panel of Figure 1 shows similar results, with a

quantitative difference in that the region in which only national firms are active shrinks.

          The bottom panel of Figure 1 with     T =   .10 provides an integrated case that cannot be found

in previous writings (Zhang, 1996) suggests this in a partial-equilibrium model. All six firm types exist

in some region of the factor box (again, see the appendix for a complete characterization).            In the

central region, type-m firms exist; only type-m firms exist in the core of this region while the outer

edges are generally a mixture of type-m and type-n firms. Horizontal multinationals exist when the

countries are relatively similar in size and in relative factor endowments, a point emphasized by

Markusen and Venables (1995, 1996a,b). 7

          As the countries become increasing different in relative factor endowments, factor prices

become unequal, creating an opportunity for type-v firms to enter in the manner we have already

discussed. When countries differ in relative endowments but are also veq different in size, there is

a mixture of national and multinational firms (relevant to all three panels).

          For example, near the lower left-hand edge of all three panels, types n ~and v ~firms exist in

equilibrium (see appendix). Country h is relatively well endowed with skilled labor making it suitable

for headquarters activities, but it is too small to support all such activity. Thus type n ~firms exist as

well. All final production occurs in the large, unskilled-labor-abundant        country.   This case may be

relevant to some small, but skilled-labor abundant countries such as Sweden, Switzerland, and The

Netherlands.    These countries are home to many multinationals, but much of their production occurs

abroad.

          Zhang (1996) notes an interesting hypothesis that follows from these results: as a developing

country begins to catch up in both size and in relative endowments, we might see it first attract

5.       Trade Regimes

         Figure 2 shows the equilibrium trade regimes for transport costs     T =   .00,   .05, and .10 in the

three panels corresponding to Figure 1. By “exports of S“, we are referring to services of skilled labor

embodied in the headquarters services supplied to foreign plants by multinationals (skilled labor in

not itself internationally mobile).   Thus there are two traded goods in the model, X and Y, and a

traded service. If for example only type-v~ firms existed in equilibrium, then these firm are providing

headquarters services to country f in exchange for markup revenues which would likely be repatriated

in terms of X. Country h might either import or export Y, but statistics would show a net deficit for

country h in trade in goods only, the balancing item being the “invisible” service flow to foreign plants.

         The top panel of Figure 2 (costless or free trade) shows that country h exports X for points

above, but not too far above the diagonal.      This follows from the fact that the X sector overall is

skilled-labor-intensive   relative to the Y sector.   But when the difference in relative endowments

becomes large, factor-price equalization fails to hold and it bemmes profitable for type-v~ firms to

enter.   These firms unbundle the X-sector activities into headquarters services (more skilled-labor-

intensive than Y) and final production (less skilled-labor-intensive than Y). In the northwest corner

area of Figure 2, country h then exports Y and S, and imports X.

         The large unshaded region to the northwest of the center point in the middle panel in which

country h imports X and exports S and Y requires some explanation (types v ~and n ~firms are active

in equilibrium over most of this region). Some point in this region actually lie below the diagonal.

Driving this result is a country size effect, which will appear several times in our results. Two effects

drive “comparative advantage” in this model as we noted earlier: relative endowments and country

size. Due to the scale economies in X and the nature of markup determination, location in the larger

market is advantageous for a firm in the presence of trade costs, because most of the firm’s sales are

in its low-cost market. In the absence of multinationals, the larger country will be the headquarters
                                                      20
country for most national firms (out of proportion to country size differences) and be the exporter

of X along the SW-NE diagonal of the factor box. But since the relative endowments of the two

countries are the same, this must in turn imply that the relative price of skilled labor is higher in the

large country. That in turn implies that if multinationals are permitted, type-v firms headquartered

in the small country will enter in equilibrium.

        The bottom panel of Figure 2 adds a central region in which there is no trade in X (all X is

produced by type-m firms), with peripheral regions in which one country imports both X and Y in

exchange for exports of services. For example, in cell row 17 and column 8 in the lower panel, type

v~ and m ~firms exist in equilibrium (see appendix). All firms are headquartered         in h and a very high

service export volume is matched by imports of both X and Y.

        Some recent empirical evidence suggests that the volume of direct investment in the world

economy has been growing faster than the volume of trade, ~pecially among the developed countries,

over the last two dwades.      There has been a large increase in the flow of direct investment from

developed to developing countries over the las five years, although the stock of direct investment in

developing countries remains fairly small.

        Figure 3 considers the volume of sales by foreign affiliates of type-m and type-n firms divided

by that amount plus the total volume of trade in X and Y. 8 It takes on a value of zero when there

are only type-n firm in existence and may have a value of one when there are only type-m firms. 9

When trade costs are low or zero, the statistic is small or zero near the center of the factor box and

when the countries differ in size but not in relative endowments (type-n firms dominate in these



    %here are several alternative statistics which could be used. One is to consider ordy arm’s length trade in
X in the denominator, so that for example X export by type-vh fums from the plant in f to h are not counted.
We found no strong reason to prefer one statistic over another.

    9Having ordy type-m firms is not sufficient for a value of one. If more of these firms are headquartered in
one country, that country will be a net exporter of S and a net importer of Y. Thus some commodity trade still
occurs in equilibrium.
                                                   21

areas). But it can take on values in the .30-.50 range when the countries are significantly different

in relative endowments but similar in size (type-v firms dominate).     Once again, this is the result of

unequal factor prim    in spite of free trade that create opportunities for type-v firms.

        As trade costs bemme higher in the bottom panel of Figure 3, the central region changes very

substantially with horizontal multinational firms replacing national firms. The statistic at and near the

center in fact jumps from zero to one. Now the affiliate sales ratio is highest when the countries are

similar in both size and in relative endowments.   But it remains moderately high when the countries

are very different in relative endowments but similar in size, and near zero when the countries are

very different in size. This gives us some sharp empirical predictions, but unfortunately the affiliate

sales ratio between very similar countries is greatly sensitive to the level of trade costs.

6.       Assessing the Effects           of Multinationals         by Counterfactual:         Multinationals
         Suppressed

         While much has been written on the “effects on multinationals”, often it is not clear to what

multinationals are being mmpared.        What is the munterfactual     against which to judge these effects?

In our case, the most obvious alternative is to simply compute equilibria in which multinationals are

banned by assumption, thus suppressing type-v and type-m firms. Only types n~ and n ~can exist in

equilibria, converting the model into a standard example of the “new trade theory”.

        Figure 4 illustrates the trade regime for the three values of trade costs used in the preceding

figures, ~ = .00, .05, and .10. The striking feature of all three diagrams is the tension of relative

endowment      versus country size in determining the direction of trade in X. Since X cannot be

fragmented, it is skilled-labor-intensive overall relative to Y, and so the skilled-labor-abundant      country

tends to export X. But the X sector has increasing returns to scale and hence has this home-market

effect mentioned     several times earlier.     This gives the larger of two countries         a “comparative

advantage” in X production and exports. 10

        These effects come across quite clearly in all three panels of Figure 4. If auntry                  h is

relatively skilled-labor-abundant     (points above the SW-NE diagonal), it exports X unless it is

“significantly” smaller, where the critical value of size decreases with the difference in relative

endowments.     Converse comments apply to country f. Some non-monotonicity                 occurs in the top

panel (free trade) such as row 10. Moving from left to right, country h first imports X as the country-

side effect dominates, and then exports X as the relative-endowment effect dominates.             Crossing the

diagonal the direction of trade reverses again (but this is the relative-endowment           effect continuing



    1°Recti that the factor-price ratio through the center point is very steep, so effectivelycountry h is larger
in income at all points to the right of column 10. If ~   country size mattered, the hatched area of country h
exporting X in Figure 4 would be all points in the right-hand half of the diagram. If only relative endowments
mattered, the hatched area would be all point above the SW-NE diagonal as in the Heckscher-Ohlin model. The
Helpman-Krugman (1985) reproduces the usual Heckscher-Ohlin result because, with freed markup rules, there
are no country size effects.

to dominate) and eventually trade reverse a final time as the country-size effect once again dominates.

           Figure 5 puts the information of Figura 2 and 4 together to produce maps of regions where

the direction of trade is reversed with the removal of the investment ban. In all three panels, trade

in X reverses direction in the northwest and southeast regions. Basically, this is intuitive in terms of

previous results.     With multinationals banned, X sector production integrated in one location is

skilled-labor-intensive   relative to Y production.    Thus the skilled-labor abundant country exports X

as just noted. But factor-prices are unequal in these regions, with skilled labor being cheaper in the

skilled-labor-abundant    country.     Thus if multinationals can enter, type-v ~ firms will enter in the

northwest corner, fragment production, concentrating headquarters activities at home and locating

more unskilled-labor-intensive       final production in country f.

           The shaded regions of trade reversal in the top panel of Figure 5 are considerably harder to

understand,     in part because our intuitive stories tend to follow partial-equilibrium           reasoning.

Consider the shaded region in the southwest area of the top panel. Without multinationals, country

h imports X since the country-size effect dominates the relative-endowment               effect as we noted

earlier.    But muntry h also has a relatively low price for skilled labor in this region.             Thus if

multinationals are permitted, type-v ~firms will enter, relocating headquarters activities toward country

h. But this drives up the price of skilled labor in country h. In general-equilibrium,         the solution is

to reallocate resources in country h, from the Y sector to final X production, the latter being less

skilled-labor intensive than Y. So invatment       liberalization leads to a reallocation of resources to the

most skilled-labor-intensive   activity (headquarters)      and to the least skilled-labor-intensive   activi~

(final production) and out of the intermediate activity Y. This reversal in the direction of trade in

X in this SW region does not occur in the bottom two panek of Figure 5 (increased trade costs affect

the direction of trade with multinationals (Figure 2), but not without (Figure 4) in this SW region).

           Figure 6 plots results as to how the volume of mmmodity trade changes with investment
                                                   24

liberalization, the hatched areas being regions of increased trade following investment liberalization.

Investment and trade in goods could be termed complements in a volume sense in these regions.

Roughly speaking, the results indicate that the investment liberalization increases the volume of trade

when the moderately skilled-labor abundant country is also moderately smaller.

        These results are not easy to interpret.     In each of the panels of Figure 6, some of the

hatched points of increased trade volume coincide with point of trade-direction reversal in Figure 5

while the majority do not. What is true is that all of the hatched points in all panels of Figure 6

involve mixed regimes type-n and type-v firms when multinationals are permitted.      No points involve

type-v firms only (and obviously not type-n firms only).

        The second interesting feature of these hatched point of increased trade volume is that almost

all of them involve essentially no change in the gross volume of X sector trade, indeed many involve

a small fall in this volume. What accounts for the increased trade volume is an increase in the net

volume of X sector trade and a rise in the volume of Y trade (note that net trade in X and trade in

Y need not be the same because of trade in services). Thus, while the gross volume of trade in X

is not increasing, there is a fall in intra-industry (cross-hauling) trade in X as countries become more

specialized.   The country with the lower price for skilled labor in the absence of multinationals

bemmes more specialized in headquarters’ servi~s and less specialized in final production when

investment is liberalized.   In the left-hand “blob” of hatched points in the middle panel of Figure 6

for example, country h becomes more specialized in Y and S and less specialized in X production

when investment is liberalized. At some of the upper points in this blob the direction of trade in X

is reversed, from exporting to importing X while in the lower point imports of Y are reinforced by

investment liberalization.

        The only exception to this result is some points at the extreme right and left-hand edges of

the upper panel of Figure 6, where investment liberalization does lead to increased intra-industry
                                                   25
trade in X, and to very little change in the net volume of trade in X.       At the left-hand edge for

example, invatment    liberalization leads to a switch in the direction of trade in X as we noted above,

with country h exporting X after liberalization (country h switches from being relatively specialized

in Y to being relatively specialized in headquarters services and final X production).   This generates

more cross hauling of X with little increase in the net trade in X (just a reversal in direction).

7.         Factor Prices and Welfare

           Our final set of raults    have to do with the effects of multinationals on factor prices and

welfare.     Again, we will use the counterfactual of no multinationals permitted as a counterfactual

against which to wmpare the effects of direct investment.

           Figures 7 through 9 present results on the ratio of the skilled to unskilled wage rate in

country h. The panels correspond to the trade costs              T =   .00,   .05, and .10, and in each diagram the

top panel is for multinationals permitted and the bottom panel for multinationals                    banned.    It is

immediately      obvious    that   multinationals   constitute     an important        force   toward   factor-price

equalization.    In each diagram, most of the area in the top panel has a value of z fi~ of between 98%

and 102.0470 (inverse of 98Yo) of its value at the center point of the factor box. It is interesting to

note that the size of this region is not very sensitive to the level of trade costs.

           The bottom panels in Figures 7-9 tell a rather different story. Factor prices diverge rather

sharply from the center point as muntries become different in relative endowments.                  The degree of

divergence again is not very sensitive to trade costs, except that the size of the 98Yo-102% region

bemmes very small with non-zero trade costs.

           The diagrams suggest that investment liberalization generates a strong tendency toward factor-

price equalization regardless of whether the entering firms are type-v firms or type-m firms (central

region of Figure 9). We have already commented on the role of factor-price differences in inducing

entry of type-v firms. Briefly, unequal factor prices induce the entry of type-v firms, which fragment

the X sector, locating skilled-labor-intensive headquarters activities in the country where S is cheap

(generally the skilled-labor-abundant       country) and final production where L is cheap.              This then

creates a pressure toward factor-price equalization.         In the case of type-m firms, they do something

similar. Since there is only one headquarters, the potential type-m firm chooses the country in which

skilled labor is cheaper.     In general equilibrium, this creates a similar pressure toward factor-price
                                                        27

equalization.

         Our final results in Figure 10 plot areas in which the removal of a prohibitive investment ban

might lead to a fall in welfare (hatched areas). 11 Using good Y as numeraire                        and setting

expenditure shares equal to 1/2 as in our simulations, the indirect utility function for country h is




Thus changes in welfare can arise either from factor-price changes or a change in the price of X.

Although the general-equilibrium        effects do not permit a very simple answer, most of the hatched

points in Figure 10 are associated with a rise in p, for country h following the removal of an

investment ban. In the hatched areas in the upper left-hand corners, recall that the direction of trade

actually reverses following investment liberalization, with country h having to import X from country

f. In the hatched regions on the far right, the removal of the investment ban is associated with a

transfer of production of X from country h to country f in most but not all of the hatched cells. We

think that this is interpreted as a loss of home-market advantage for country h, with an associated

loss of X production and rise in price. In any case, it is possible for invatment         liberalization to leave

a country worse off if it is (a) small but very well endowed with skilled labor, or (b) large and

somewhat abundant in unskilled labor.




    llWe have tried to avoid putting any emphasis on quantitative results in this paper. Since this is a pure
simtiation model, numericaJ values seem to have no particular interpretation. We break the silence here and
note that in ahnost all of the hatched points of Figure 10, the welfare loss following trade liberalization is less
than 1%.

8,       Summa~ and Conclusions

        The purpose of this paper is to provide an integrated treatment of a number of strand of

literature in which one sector of the economy produces with increases returns to scale and imperfect

competition.     One branch is often referred to as the “new trade theory” in which single-plant national

firms compete with national firms of another country in the international market place. A second

branch involves endogenous “horizontal” multinational firms which choose between serving a foreign

market by exports and serving it by building a branch plant.         A third branch involves “vertical”

multinationals which maintain single plants, but which geographically separate headquarters       activity

from production.      In the present paper, all of these models arise as special cases for some set of

parameter values.

        (1) Our first task was to characterize the production regime: the types of firms active in

equilibrium.     Broadly speaking, single-plant national firms (with headquarters   and the plant in the

same location) dominate in equilibrium when the countries are similar in relative endowments and

dissimilar in size. They can also arise when sizes are similar provided trade costs are low. Vertical

multinationals    (one plant with headquarters   and plant in different countries) dominate when the

countries are sufficiently dissimilar in relative endowments but somewhat similar in size. Two-plant

horizontal multinationals dominate when the countries are similar in size and in relative endowments,

and trade costs are moderate to high.

        (2) We then examined the trade regime: which countries export X, Y, and services. Here

the assumptions on factor intensities are crucial. Integrated production of X is more skilled-labor-

intensive than Y but decomposing X, headquarters          activities use only skilled labor and final X

production is less skilled-labor-intensive   than Y. Results indicate that the skilled-labor-abundant

country is like to import X (vertical multinationals headquartered in that country dominate) when the

countries are different in relative endowments but not extremely different in size.
                                                    29

         (3) An interesting statistic which is often cited empirically (although measured in a variety

of ways) is the ratio of sales by affiliate of multinationals to that amount plus the volume of

commodity trade.     Our results indicate that this ratio is moderately high when the countries differ

significantly in relative endowments (vertical multinationals dominate).     It is very high if trade costs

are moderate to high and the countries are similar in both relative endowments and size (but zero

under the latter circumstance if trade costs are zero).

        (4)   We introduced     an explicit munter-factual      against which to judge the effects of

multinationals by running the model with multinationals suppressed (e.g., a prohibitive investment

ban).   Several interesting results follow. First, over a considerable subset of the parameter space

examined, the removal on an investment ban reverses the direction of trade in X. The multinational’s

ability to fragment production into skilled-labor-intensive and unskilled-labor-intensive   activit ies often

means, for example, that the skilled-labor-abundant      country switches from exporting to importing X

(but exporting headquarters services) following the removal of a ban.

        Investment   liberalization can also lead to an increase in the volume of trade.           In most

instances when this happens, it appears to be driven by increased specialization within the X sector

and a fall in intra-industry trade in X. So, for example, the skilled-labor-abundant          country may

concentrate   on headquarters   activities following investment liberalization and the other country

concentrate more on final production.     While the total trade in X may not change at all, net trade

increases and so the balancing volume of trade in Y increases.

        (5) A final section of the paper considered factor prices and welfare, again using the counter-

factual of an investment ban as a standard for comparison. We showed that investment liberalization

created a strong tendency toward factor-price equalization at all levels of trade costs. The overall

welfare effects of investment liberalization for a country are more complex and puzzling.             Cases

where a country loses from liberalization are generally associated with the country having high levels
                                                   30
of X production    and exports without multinationals, but having that advantage eroded following

investment liberalization.   This is consistent with established understanding   about “home market

advantages” in scale-intensive industries.

        (6) A a final comment, we might point out how fragile the “strategic-trade-policy” literature

looks in light of our results.   That literature focusses on cases of single-plant, domestically-owned

brrns competing against like firms from the other country. This type of situation does exist in our

model, but over a very small part of parameter space (whatever that might measure). And of course,

it is clear that small changes in trade costs or other policy parameters might induce a regime shift,

so that the policy prescription based on an exogenous regime may be completely inappropriate.
