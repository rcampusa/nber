              VERTICAL FORECLOSURE AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE POLICY


                                     ABSTRACT



       We examine conditions under which a low cost vertically integrated

 manufacturer has an incentive to export an intermediate product to its higher

 cost (vertically integrated)      rival rather than to vertically foreclose, fully

 cutting off supplies.   The nature of supply conditions in the importing

                                                         and optimal policy by
 country, the size of an import tariff on the final good

 the exporting country are all shown to be important for this decision.     The

                                                     final (Cournot) product
 exporting country may gain by taxing exports of the
 even though, under Cournot competition, an export subsidy is optimal in the

 absence of a market for intermediates. In this case, optimal policy alao
                                                         tax on final goods

     In   countries that are dependent on imports of a key intermediate product

or raw material from a dominant world supplier there is often substantial

concern about the price and the availability of imports. For example, Japanese

suppliers (with the help of the Japanese government) recently restricted the

exports of one megabite DRAM computer chips, substantially raising their price'.

These suppliers control about BOX of the market for computer chips and the

higher prices and shortage in supply have forced U.S. producers of computers to

curtail production and increase prices. Vertically integrated Japanese firms such

as Toshiba and N.E.C. have benefitted both from increased profits in the market

for computer chips and from the improvement in their competitive position in the

market for final computers.

     This paper first examines the incentives for a vertically integrated firm to

export an intermediate product to a higher cost foreign rival,        lowering its rival's

costs, rather than to engage in vertical foreclosure thus fully cutting off

supplies2. The rival is also assumed to be vertically integrated, but it can

produce the intermediate product only at a higher (and increasing) marginal cost.

Differences in coats, which give rime to the possibility of vertical supply (the

supply of an intermediate product to a rival) ,     occur most    naturally in an

international context because of differences in endowments and technologies

across countries. A firm in one country may have control over a cheaper source

of supply of raw material   or,     as in the above example, it may have a superior

technology in the production of an important manufacturing component, such as

a computer chip.

     We consider the moat extreme form of dependence on a vertically integrated
supplier by assuming that a aingle vertically integraced firm controls the exports

of both the intermediate and final products. If the rival firm in the importing

country has no independent source of supply, vertical foreclosure would sllow the

exporting firm to enjoy a monopoly in the market for the final good. In this

situation, the exporting firm will choose vertical foreclosure. However, even s

small tariff imposed on the import of the final good will induce the export of

some of the intermediate product. If the rival firm has access to the

intermediate good either through its own production or through imports, then

sales of the final good in the importing country are determined by Cournot

competition. The implications of Bertrand behaviour in the export market for the

final product are considered in Appendix A.

     The exporting firm is assumed able to act first by committing to an export

strategy (price or quantity) for the intermediate product prior to the decision of

the high cost firm as to its own level of production of the intermediate good

and to the resolution of the Cournot output game for the final good. This aeans

that the exporting firm is aware of its rival's optimal reaction to an increase in

the export price (or a decrease in the export quantity) of the intermediate

product based on its rival's alternative costs of production. The low cost firm is

essentially in the position of a 'dominant supplier with a competitive fringe' in

the export market for the intermediate product, but not for the final product.

     The assumption that a foreign supplier has 'dominance' is intended as a

first approach in examining the consequence for the importing country of a

substantial dependence on foreign supplies. It has the advantage that the vertical

supply (or foreclosure) decision is made with a full understanding of its

consequences. Also, this setting allows us to highlight the importance of

differing cost conditions for the production of the intermediate product in the
                                                and the responsiveness of these
importing country. Both the absolute quantities

supplies are shown to be important factors in

          In assessing the likely consequences of dependence on foreign supplies,

it is important to examine public as well as private incentives in the exporting

country. If the low coat firm   chooses   to supply the foreign rival, will

                                            to prevent exports of the
'government foreclosure' (government policy

intermediate product) be in the interest of the exporting country? We show that

if the exporting firm initially enjoys a higher profit margin from the export of

the intermediate than the final product (as a consequence of an import tariff on

the final good), government policy amplifies this difference which tends to

increase the extent of vertical supply. Perhaps surprisingly, this policy is

achieved by a tax, not a subsidy, on the exports of the intermediate product,

together with a (larger) tax on the exports of the final product. Indeed, it is

never optimal to subsidize the exports of one good and tax the exports of the

other.

     The possibility that an export tax on the final good may increase national

welfare may be somewhat unexpected given the Spencer and Brander (1983) result

that an export subsidy increases national welfare in a Cournot duopoly with one

domestic and one foreign firm. We set out some simple conditions under which

the presence of the export market for the intermediate product switches optimal

                                                             tax. Conversely. if
policy from an export subsidy on the final good to an export

there is Bertrand competition for the final differentiated products, we show that

the existence of vertical supply may make it optimal to subsidize the export of

the final good.

     Vertical foreclosure has been an important issue in the antitrust literature

and in industrial organization. Two very interesting recent papers, Salinger (1988)
and Ordover. Saloner and Salop (1988), show that vertical merger for the purpose

of vertical foreclosure can be an effective atrategy when there ia imperfect

competition in the market for both the intermediate and final products. In both

these papers, producers of the intermediate product have identical and constant

costs and vertical merger results in a full cutting off of supplies to downsteam

firms3.   In contrast, the present model demonstrates that asymmetries in costs

can make vertical supply profitable for a dominant firm. If the supply of the

intermediate good in the importing country is sufficiently elastic, then vertical

supply4 by the low cost firm is an equilibrium strategy even in the absence of

commercial policy intervention by either country.

     This paper is also related to the international trade literature concerning

the optimal choice of commercial policy to exploit the relationship between

exports of a final good and exports of an input used in its production, (see for

example Kemp (1966), Jones (1967) and Jones and Spencer (1989)).             However, this

literature applies only to perfect competition and there is no consideration of

the issue of vertical foreclosure. Finally, this paper draws on the literature

concerning trade policy under imperfect competition. Of special relevence are

Dixit (1984),       Eaton and Grossman (1986), Grossman and Dixit (1986), Venables

(1985)    and Brander and Spencer (1985).

     Section    2    of the pet;r contains   the basic model and the second stage

Cournot output equilibrium is described in Section 3. Section 4 is concerned with

the conditions for vertical supply of the intermediate good.             The optimal trade

policies for the exporting country are derived in Section 5 and Section 6

contains some concluding remarks.

2.       The Model

     A vertically integrated       firm,   firm   I,   in country 1 (potentially) exports the
                                                            final good to
quantity x of an intermediate good and the quantity y1 of a

                       2 in country 2 purchasea x from firm                          1   at a price r and also
country 2.    Firm

uses some of its own supplies x2 of the (homogeneous) intermediate good to

                                                            of the final good in
produce y2 of the final good for domestic sale. The price p
                                                 — p(Y) where p'(Y) C 0 and Y
country 2 is given by the inverse demand curve p

— y1 +                                               from the possibility that the
         y2 represents aggregate output. We abstract

final good is also sold in country                  1.    If the rwo markets are segmented, this

involves no loss of generality.

                                                            that one unit of the
     Technological relationships are simplified by assuming

intermediate good is required to produce one unit of the final good and that

there are no other factors of production5. Firm 1 produces the intermediate good

(and the final good) -at a constant marginal cost c1, whereas firm 2 can produce

irs own supplies of the intermediate good only at at a higher (and increasing)
                                                             2's marginal cost
marginal cost. This means that c2 > c1 where c2 denotes firm

of production of x2 at x2 — 0. We assume that firm                              2   is vertically integrated,

but this is not necessary. The intermediate good could be supplied by an

increasing cost competitive industry in country 2.

     Export polity by country I is expressed by a specific subsidy                                  s   to exports

of rhe final good and a specific tax v to exports of the intermediate product.

The subsidy      s   and the tax v may be either positive or negative. Country                             2


imposes a specific tariff t on imports of the final good. We can now write the

total profit of firm 1 ftom the export of y1 and x as,

                          It'   —   (p   -
                                             (t-s+t,))y, +         (r   -   v   -
                                                                                    c,)x.                      (21)

Firm 2's profit from the sale of y' is given by

                                     it2     —
                                                 p(Y)y,   -
                                                              rx   -
                                                                       C2(x2)                                  (2.2)

where y2 —   x   +   x2, and C2(x2) represents the total cost of production
                                                                            of x,.
                                                                                               6

Marginal cost C(x2) is assumed to be strictly increasing: C(x2) > 0.

      The structure of decisions is identified by stages. In stage 0, country             1.




commits to its export policies a and v and country 2 commits to its import tsriff

t.   In stage   1, firm 1 commits to the price   r that it will charge for the export of

the intermediate good. Subsequently, the quantities y1 and y2 of the final good

are determined by a Cournot (quantity Nash) equilibrium in stage 2. Firm 2 is

free to import its desired quantity of the intermediate good at this stage, and to

produce its own supplies.

       The equilibrium of the game played by firms is subgame perfect6.          In setting

the export price for the intermediate product in stage       1,   firm   I   takes into

account both the subsequent (Cournot)      Nash equilibrium in the market for the

final good and the response of firm 2 in the production of its own supplies. This

means that firm     1   takes full account of the effect of the export price r on the

profits that it can earn from the sale of the final good.         In particular, firm 1 can

choose not to export the intermediate product (vertical foreclosure) by setting r

at a prohibitive level.

       Support for the credibility of this structure can be found by considering an

alternative form of our model in which firm 1 commits to the level of exports

(rather that to the price) of the intermediate good in stage 1. With quantity

commitment in the       firsruage,   the price received for exports is determined by a

market clearing condition in stage 2 ensuring that demand equals total supply

(including the quantity of the intermediate good that is produced in country 2)

Exporting of the intermediate good takes time and these exports must be

available at the time of production of the final good. However, production of the

intermediate product for local use can take place contemporaneously with

production of the final good. The level of exports of the intermediate good might
                                                                              in
then naturally be determined prior to the production of the intermediate good

country 2.

3.       The    Final     Coods Market

         Thia    section is concerned with the equilibrium in the second stage of the

model. Substituting for x — y2                   -   x2 in       (2.2),        firm 2's profit can be written as,

                                            — (p     -
                                                         r)y2 +    rx2         C2(x2)                             (3,1)


         We firat consider firm 2's choice between ita own production of the

intermediate good and use of imported supplies. Firm 2 chooses x2 ? 0 to

maximize        (3.1)     for   given   levels       of y1, y2 and             r. Since    C(x2) >    0, the profit


function is stricly concave in x2 and the optimal choice of x2 satisfies the first

order condition:

                                    r   -
                                            C(x2)        C 0     (—    0   if x2 > 0)                             (3.2)

                                                                                          of r:
If x2 > 0, (3.2)            implicitly defines the supply of x2 as an increasing function
     —
x2       x2(r)    where     x—     1/C(x2)       >   0. If the marginal cost                 of production of     x2

                                                                                                                   = 0
everywhere exceeds the import price r,                           C(O) — c2 >             r, then firm 2 sets x2

and produces            using    imported    supplies          only.       This includes the special case in

which production of x2 is prohibitively expensive so that production by firm                                           2



requires the use of imported supplies.

         At the stage 2 Cournot equilibrium for the final good, Firm 1 chooses its
                                         — y2-x2and the prior committed values
output y1 to maximize (2.1), given y2, x

of r, t, s, and v. Similarly, firm 2 chooses y2 to maximize (3.1),                                          given y1, x2, r,

t, s and v. If x2               — 0, then y2 — x. The first order conditions                         are:


                                n(y1,y2,r,t-s,v)
                                                           — p +    yip'       -
                                                                                   (t-s+c1) — 0                   (3.3)

                                                         — p +   y2p'
                                                                           -   r   — 0                             (3.4)

Solving (3.3) and (3.4) simultaneously, we obtain

The value of v affects y1 and Y2 only through its influence on r, the
                                                                      export

     The comparative static effects of an increase in r on
                                                           y1 and y2 can be

obtained from total differentiation of the first order conditions (3.3)                                      and (3.4).

These effects are signed using (3.6),                (3.7) and (3.8).

               y(r,t-s) — -p42/H> 0 and y(r,t-s) — i41/H< 0                                                   (3.9)

Similarly, the response of y1 and y2 to changes in s and t are given by

         y    -y(r,t-s) —         -42/H >       0 and      y         —
                                                                         -y(r,t-s) —        ir1/H <   0.     (3.10)

Also, from (3.9) and U. O), industry output is decreasing in r, increasing                                       ins
and decreasing in t:

             Yr(r,t-s) —        p'/H   C 0 and       15   —    -Y(r,t-s)           —   -p'/H    > 0         (3.11)

Finally, a unit increase in r increases the price of the final good but by less

than one unit. From (3.6),           (3.8)    and (3.11),

                  d(r-p)/dr —           l-p'Y5 — p'(2p'+Yp'')/H                        >0                   (3.12)

In otherwords, an increase in r increases                                -
                                          r-c1                               (p-t-c1)— r-p+t,         the difference
                                                                                                                                9

between the profit margins that firm                             1   earns from the export of the intermediate

and final products. This difference in profit margins features prominently in the

subsequent results.

4.    The Intermediate Cooda Market; Vertical Foreclosure or Vertical Supply

      The demand by firm 2 for imports of the intermediate good from firm 1 is

firm 2's output of the final good at the Cournot-Nash equilibrium less its own

production (if any) of the intermediate good.

                                         x(r,t-s) —             y2(r,t-s)        -   x2(r)                              (4.1)

The exporting firm, firm 1, is aware of this actual demand for imports when it

chooses r in stage 1. An increase in r tends to reduce the demand for imports of

the intermediate good, both because it decresses firm 2's final output and

because it induces firm 2 to produce more of the intermediate good. Also, from

(3.10), the demand for x is decreasing in                                s   and increasing in t:

                     xr(r,t-s) —         y x <0 and
                                               -
                                                                      x3     —   -x5(r,t-a)     —    y <0.              (4.2)

      Vertical foreclosure occurs if firm 1 sets a prohibitive price                                              r   for the

intermediate good.            Setting x(rP,r.a) — 0 implicitly                             defines     r   —   r(t-a) where,
                                           r       —
                                                       -rt(t-a)      —   -y/x C        0                                (4.3)

The prohibitive           export       price       for    the    intermediate          good is       decreasing    in a and

increasing      in   t.    An increase in a decreases firm 2'a marginal profits from its

output y2 and therefore decreases firm 2's demand for imports x.

       At r —        r,   firm     2   produces y2 using only its own production of the

intermediate good and, from (3.4), y2 — x2 satisfies,

                                                         p + x2p' —          r                                          (4.4)

If the production of x2 is prohibitively expensive at r —                                            r,   then (from (3.2) x2

— 0 and      (4.4)   implies that              r—        p. Vertical foreclosure then gives firm 1 monopoly

power in the market for the final good'.
                                                                                                                             10

     Firm   l's profit at stage 1 can be written directly as a function of the

export price r and trade taxes and subsidies, t, a, and v set in stage 0. Let                                                ,tE



represent this function (where E stands for the exporting firm) ,                                then
                —    E(.t5V)           —    (p-t+s-c1)y'(r,t-s)           + (r-v-c1)x(r,t-s)                         (45)

From differentiation of (4.5) using (3.3), the effect of an increase in r on ir is,

                                        —    (r-v-ct)xr   + x + y1p'y                                                (4.6)

The first two terms of (4.6) represent the direct effect of an increase in r on

the profits of firm 1 from the export of the intermediate good. The third

(positive) term captures the 'strategic effect' of r on the profits earned from the

export of the final good. Since                  y   > 0 and   Y   C   0,     an increase in r increases

both the volume and the price of exports of the final good.

     In stage       1, firm 1 chooses r to maximize                 itt   subject to r S        r.     To obtain

the conditions for a maximum, define the Lagrangean L —                                 ÷ p(r(t-a)              -   r)
where p represents the Lagrange multiplier. The first order conditions for a

maximum are then,

                —       - p      —0 and     L5
                                                 —   r(t-s) r ?-
                                                                          0, p? 0, L5.p     —0                      (4.7)

We assume that mE is strictly concave8 for all r                              r, ensuring that            1rE   achieves

a global maximum whenever the first order conditions are satisfied.

     If r(r,t-s,v)          .c   0,   a reduction in r below              r   increases   it5   and,       from (4.7),

vertical supply occurs            (c    r") and the Lagrange multiplier                 p — 0. At a vertical

supply equilibrium, ir(r,t-s,v) — 0 implicitly                         defines    r —   r(t-s,v) with               partial

derivatives,

            r,(t-s,v)   —     -r(t-s,v) — itt/Wr and               r(t-s,v) —                   >    0.             (4.8)

The sign of    r    follows from        w — -x C         0.    An increase in the export tax v

increases the price r paid by firm 2 for imports of the intermediate product9.

     If ir(r,t-s,v) — 0, then r(t-s,v) —                      r(t-s)        with p — 0 and vertical
                                                                                                           11

foreclosure occurs. Finally, it it(rP,t-s,v) > 0, then p > 0, and r is constrained

at the foreclosure level rP(t-s).

       To examine the conditions underlying the vertical supply or foreclosure

decision, it is      useful      to rearrange (4.6), using          (4.2)   and (3.3), to obtain

                              —   (r-p+t       (s+v))y + x
                                                                -   (r-v-c1)x                      (4.9)

Let   c — rx/x2        0 represent the elasticity of supply of x2 in country                 2.     Also

define   flr
               —
                   ry2/Y > 0 to       be the (positive) elasticity (with respect to an

increase in r) of the derived demand for the intermediate product. Then, from

                                                   and only if
(4.7) and (4.9), firm 1 chooses vertical supply if

                             —    -(y5/rP)((r'p+t • (s+v))t1 +          (rP-v-c1)rJ < 0        (4.10)

       Prior to the imposition of trade policy by the exporting country (s—v—0),

from (4.10), the boundary at which vertical foreclosure just occurs is given by

                                      t   —p   -   r   -
                                                           (rP_c)c/q                           (4.11)

This                                                                                    1. Along    the

increaae   c   at r, but to maintain x2 —             x2(r)    fixed. That is, the supply turve

for x2 is assumed to rotate clockwise at r —                  r    ensuring that, as 5r     is   increased,

r   and the values of        x2,   p, and     ,   evaluated at     r   do not change. FF is

negatively     sloped if demand is not too non linear'0. The region of vertical

foreclosure is shown by the shaded area to the left of FF. The area strictly to

the right of FF represents              the region of vertical supply.

      Whether vertical foreclosure occurs is heavily influenced by production

conditions     for the intermediate good in the importing country as well as by the

tariff. We consider two important aspects of local production conditions: the

total quantity x'(r) of supplies available at the foreclosure point and the

responsiveness     of these supplies as measured by Cr

      From   (4.4),    p-rn —      -   x2(r)p'    and the quantity x2(r) affects the size of the

price spread p-rn. From (4.11), this price spread in turn determines the point at

which the boundary FF intersects the vertical axis of Figure                      1.   If   t>   p-rn,   then

firm 1 earns a strictly higher profit margin from the export of the interaediate

than the final good at r —              r   and firm 1 chooses vertical supply.

      If country      2    has no independent source of supply of the intermediate

product, then x2            0, the price      difference p    -   r    — 0 and FF reduces to a point

at the origin of          Figun:: 1.    If the tariff t —     0,   then the equilibrium is at the

origin and firm 1 chooses vertical foreclosure. However, any positive tariff will

induce vertical supply. A small tariff on exports of the final good decreases the

profit margin on sales of the final good and gives firm 1 en incentive to get

'under' the tariff wall by supplying the good produced at a lower stage of

production.

                                even if t is positive. An exogenous increase in
may choose vertical foreclosure
                                                                          the
the fixed quantity of supplies shifts up the point at which FF intersects

vertical axis in Figure 1 increasing the range of t at which there is vertical

foreclosure (with       c   —   0).   This occurs because a higher level of x2 lowers the

value of r5 at which firm 2 chooses not to import x reducing the profit margin

that firm 1 can earn from the export of the intermediate product. Vertical

                                                            a larger (but fixed)
foreclosure is thus more likely if an importing country has

quantity of its own supplies of the intermediate product.
         These results are reported in Proposition I together with the sign of the

                                          vertical supply equilibrium should it
profit margin condition r(t,O)-p+t at the

occur. As ahown in the next aection, the sign of this profit margin condition is

important for optimal export policy by country 1.

         Suppose that the importing country can produce only

r, the boundary condition (4.11) becomes t —                       p(Y(r,t))-r where r — r(t,x2)                          as

defined by y2(r,t)-x2 — 0. An increase in x2 increases the boundary value of t

since dt/dx2 —       -(l-ptYr)drP/dxa/(lpYt+(l-ptYr)rt)                   >   0. The sign follows since 1-

P"r —     l-p'Y >       0 from (3.11) and (3.12),             r   > 0 and dr/dx2 —        l/y C 0. ***
        Now consider the case where Cr               >0      snd supplies of the intermediate good

sre responsive to price. As illustrated in Figure 1, an increase in the

responsiveness of supplies in country 2 or a higher tariff tends to move the

equilibrium towards vertical supply.

Proposition 2 (assume s—v—0 snd                Cr   >   0)

        (i) For any given t,         an increase in          Cr, holding      x2(r)   fixed,    moves the

equilibrium towards vertical supply. Vertical supply occurs if

C   >

        (ii)    A sufficiently large value of t will induce the export of the

intermediate product.

Proof: (i) From (4.10), with t and x2(r) fixed, d1r(rP(t),t,O)/dCr —

c1)/r < 0.       At the boundary        FF, ,r(r,t,0)         — 0. and an increase in           Cr   will      make

ir(r,t,O) C 0 inducing           vertical      supply.       The stated   condition      for         follows      from

           (ii) Since l-p'Y.        —
(4.10).                                 1-p'Y       > 0 from    (3.11)    and (3.12), d(r(t)-p+t))/dt —

4(lp'Yr)        + l-p'Y >    0. Hence,       a sufficiently large value of t will make r(t)-

p+t      0, which, from (4.10),             is a sufficient condition for vertical supply.***

        Proposition 2(i) indicates that if Cr is sufficiently large, the equilibrium wil

be one of vertical supply even in the absence of a tariff. Why does a larger

value of       C tend   to move the equilibrium towards vertical supply?

alternatively, vertical foreclosure. Note that in Proposition 3(u), the firm engages

or v maintains r at r(t-s) (with p              ? 0)     then exports x remain at zero:

                  dx(r,t-s)/ds —     xrr    +   y — 0 and dx(r,t-s)/dv                0            (5.2)

             The standard     role     for        an export subsidy (originally derived by Spencer and
 Brander (1983)) can be seen by
                                considering equation (5.4) when v — 0 and a is

 initially        zero.     Ignoring         the preaence     of   the   intermediate       good market (as
 reflected by the term
                       (r-c1)y), it can be seen that a small subsidy to the final

 good raises welfare because it reduces the output of the rival firm in a market

 where firm 1 enjoya a positive profit
                                       margin. Aa Spencer and Brander (1983)

 show, the optimal export aubsidy for a Cournot
                                                (duopoly) firm makes it credible
 for the exporting firm to produce what would have been the

 level of output in the absence of a
                                     aubaidy.

        However, the export market for the intermediate
                                                        product introduces an
opposing effect of a on profit and welfare. A positive value of a causes a

contraction in demand by the rival firm for the intermediate
                                                             product reducing
the profita that firm 1 earns from vertical
                                            aupply. As revealed by (5.4), if firm 1

product, then welfare is increased by a small tax on

          We now consider country l'a optimal
                                              policy towards the exports of the

condition for the choice of the export tax                         v     is dW/dv —       (vx-sy)r       —   0. This
defines the optimal value'3 of v as a function of a:

                                                     v(a) —   sy/x                                              (5.5)
                                                                                                          19

If there were no tax or auhsidy to final goods trade, (5.5) indicates that there

would he no gain from government intervention in the market for intermediates.

                                                                       tax to
Also, active commercial policy requires a subsidy to both exports or a

both exports. It is never optimal to subsidize exports of the final product and to

tax exports of the intermediate product or vice versa.

     A subsidy to exports of the final product creates a wedge between firm l's
                                                                 choice of the
objective function and welfare in country 1, distorting firm l's

export price r. Firm 1 ignors the effect of an increase in r on the net cost of

the subsidy to taxpayers. The export price r is set above the optimal level so as

to increase y1 and the total subsidy received. Since                   r>0           (see (4,8)), this is

corrected by setting v <   0,   that is by also subsidizing the export of the

intermediate product. At the optimal value of v, a small change in r has no

effect on the total subsidy payment for both exports (d(vx-sy1)/dr —                          vx-sy —      0)

and there is no distortion in the choice of r. A small increase in r incteases the

subsidy payment by increasing y1 but this is just offset by a lower subsidy

payment because of the reduction in exports x.

     If both a and v are chosen optimally then from (5.4) and (5.5), the optimal

value of s satisfies the first order condition,

                    dW/ds —   [r(t-s,v(s))       -   p   +   t]y   -

Proposition 4 (assume vertical supply at s—v—O)

It is optimal for country 1 to

     (i)   tax the exports of both products if firm 1 earns a higher profit margin

from the export of the intermediate than the final product at s—v—U:

                  a < 0 and v —   v(s)     > 0 if r(t,0)           -
                                                                       p   +   t>    0             (5.7)

     (ii)    subsidize the exports of both products if firm 1 earns a lower profit

margin from the export of the intermediate than the final product at s—v—0:

                    s > 0 and   v   —   v(s)   < 0 if r(t,0)    -
                                                                     p +   t   < 0               (5.8)


£1221: From (5.4) et s—v—0, dW/ds < 0 if r(t,0)-p+t > 0 and dW/ds > 0 if r(t,0)-

p+t <0.***

     Given initial vertical supply, we know from Propositions 1(i) and 3(i) that

r(t,0)-p+t > 0 if independent supplies x2 are not too responsive to price and t                              is
poaitive.    From Proposition 4, it is optimal to tax both exports in this case. High

values of    c   are associated with the subsidization of both exports.

     Since a is larger than v in absolute value                (from (5.5)       and   y/x   <   1),   the

direction in which commercial policy aims to switch trade flows is generally

indicated by the sign of a. There is some ambiguity in the response of exports to

a change in s when v is set optimally, but under linear demand and supply

conditions, an increase in s, maintaining            v   —   v(s),   causes a net expansion in

exports of the final product and s reduction in exports of intermediates14. If                           s


is positive, then both exports are subsidized, but sales of the final good are

given relatively more encouragement since, with s +                  v   > 0, firm l's enjoys a

greater increase in its profit margin from the export of the final than the

intermediate good.

     Since s is positive if and only if firm 1 initially earns a lower profit

margin from the export of the intermediate than the final good (r(t,0)-p+t <                           0),
it follows that the net effect of government intervention is to widen or amplify

the initial difference in relative returns. With linear demand and supply, optimal

policy then serves to expand the export of the good with the higher profit

margin and to contract the export of the good with the lower profit margin.

B.   Polic:y Under         Vertical     Foreclosure
     We   now consider optimal policy for the case where p ? 0 and r —                                   r(t-s).
From (4.7), p         0 implies       ,r(r,t-s,v)              ? 0    in equilibrium.      From   differentiation of
(5.1),    using (4.6),(5.2),(5.3) and ,r —                      -x,    the first order conditions for a local

maximum of welfare reduce to:

                                                        —
              dW/ds — y1p'dy2/ds- sdy1/ds — 0 and dW/dv                               0   for all v             (5.9)

where dy2/ds —    yr + y — xr                       0   (— 0   if x2    —   0),   and dy1/ds —    yr    +   y   > 0.

If Y2 —   x2(r)   >   0,    an increase in a reduces the Cournot equilibrium level of Y2

holding r constant          (y C   0), but          r    and marginal cost C(x2) —            r    also falls with

the cut back in x2. The net effect is a reduction in y2 and an increase in y1 so

that the optimal value of s satisfies: s —                            y1p'(dy2/da)/(dy1/ds) >         0. This is the


Spencer and Brander (1983) result that an export subsidy increases profit in a

Cournot duopoly. If x2 —           0,   vertical foreclosure gives firm 1 a monopoly of the

market for the final good and no policy intervention is called for.

C.   Globally Optimal Policy

     The previous sections have been concerned with optimal policy towards

exports given the vertical supply or vertical foreclosure decision of firm 1 at

s—v—O. However, the discontinuities in dW/ds and dW/dv at r —                                 r(t-s)        mean that

these local policies may not be globally optimal. This section develops globally

optimal policy for country 1. A main question is whether 'government

foreclosure' could be in the interests of the exporting country. Could country 1

gain by inducing foreclosure in situations where firm 1 chooses vertical supply.

In addition to our usual aasuption that                         C     > 0, we assume throughout this

section that demand for the final good and supply of the intermediate good in

country 2 is linear (p''(Y) —               0   and xr —         0),    much simplifying the analysis.

     In order to link the two branches of policy, it is useful to define a critical
                                                                                                        22

value of s —   ,   satisfying        r(rP,t-B,v(B))
                                                           — 0, at which vertical foreclosure just

occurs. Maintaining r —          r(t-s)        and v —   v(s)   as in   (5.5),     from differentiation of


(4.9), using x —      0   •1 —             y —0, x —0           and   q <0,
     dir(r,t-s,v(s))/ds
                                 —   (y(l-p'Y5)      -
                                                         x)r + Y5(l-p'y)           > 0           (5.11)

From (5.11), a reduction in s below B reduces ,r(r,t-s,v(s)) making it negative

and inducing vertical supply. Similarly, it can be shown that an increase in s

above B, with v —     v(B)     fixed, increases           ir(r,t-s,v(s))         and maintains vertical

foreclosure. If s < B and v —              v(s),   we have a vertical supply equilibrium and the

effect of a change in s on welfare is given by (5.6). Alternatively,                          if s   I, we

have vertical foreclosure, and holding v fixed at v —                        v(B),   the effect of an

increase in s on welfare is given by (5.9)".

      Propositions 5 and 6 are concerned with the globally optimal policy fot
                                                                could result in
country 1, taking into account that a suitable choice of policy

either vertical foreclosure or vertical supply in equilibrium. The proofs of these

propositions are in Appendix B.

Prorosition 5: (Assume p''(Y) — 0 and                xr — 0)
     (i) The globally optimal policy for country 1 is                        to tax the exports of both

goods (s C 0 and v —       v(s)      >   0),   and to maintain vertical supply if, at s=v—O, (a)

   • 0 and rP-p+t >       0,   or    (b)   r(t)-p+t ? 0 and, at the initial vertical supply

equilibrium, 0 C      r<       rx/(r-c1)x2.

     (ii) The globally optimal policy is to subsidize the exports                          of both goods     (s


> 0 and v —                                                                        at s—v—0, r(t)-p+t        0
               v(s)   C 0) and to maintain vertical supply                   if,


and, at the initial vertical supply equilibrium, Cr                      >
                                                                    is initial
     Proposition 5 shows that for a wide class of cases where there

vertical supply, either taxes or subsidies may be optimal, but it is not in countty

l's interest to induce vertical foreclosure. If there is initial vertical supply and
                                                                                                       23

the elasticity of supply of x2 is small, the profits of firm 1 are increased by

taxing the exporta of both goods. At a larger elasticity of supply of x2, the

globally optimal policy switches to an export subsidy for both goods, but as long

as r(t)-p+t      ? 0, the     subsidy to the final good is not so large as to cause

vertical foreclosure.

        An important element in the proof of Proposition 5 is to show that the

profit margin from the sale of the intermediate good exceeds the profit margin

from the sale of the final good at s —               ,    the      point at which foreclosure just

occurs: r(t-6)-p+t > 0. If 6 > 0, this is a sufficient condition for the global

optimality of vertical supply. It is possible that this condition does not hold for

the one case of initial vertical supply not covered by Proposition 5.                        This is the

case listed in Proposition 3(u)             in   which Cr is sufficiently large to induce

vertical supply at s—v—0 even though the profit margin on the final good exceeds

the profit margin on the intermediate good at r —                      r(t).   It is then possible that

r(t-6)-p+t C          0, and, from (5.6),    we may have dW/ds > 0 at s — 6 if           6 is smsll.    In

this   eventuality,       government   foreclosure        is the globally optimal policy.


       Proposition 6 shows that if firm 1 has chosen vertical foreclosure initially,

then it    is always      in country l's interest to maintain foreclosure.

Proposition 6: (Assume p''(Y) — 0 end                xr   —   0)
       If there is vertical foreclosure at s—v—0, it is optimal for country 1 to

maintain foreclosure. (a) If x2 — 0 and t — 0, no policy intervention is called for.

(b) If   Cr>    0, and ir(r(t),O,O)       ? 0, then the optimal policy is to subsidize the

export of the final good.***

£.     Conclusion

       Many large manufacturing firms have secured their access to important

intermediate products by integrating backwards so as to produce the intermediate
                                                                                24

                                                            can be produced more
product within the corporation. If the intermediate product

cheaply in one country than another, then vertital integration can give firas in

one country a cost advantage relative to foreign rivals. Such differences of cost

are a natural consequence of differences in endowments and technology across

countries. This leads to the question as to whether high cost manufacturers need

be concerned about dependence on imports of a key intermediate input from a

country that is also a major exporter of the final manufactured product.

     This paper addresses this issue by first examining the conditions under

which a low cost vertically integrated manufacturer will export an intermediate

product, lowering the costs of a rival producer of the final product. We show

that the tendency towards vertical supply is increased both by a greater

responsiveness of supplies in the importing country and (more surprisingly) by a

reduction in the total (fixed) quantity of supplies available at the foreclosure

point. Also, an import tariff on the final good increases the incentive for

vertical supply. In Appendix A, we show that these general tendencies continue

to hold if there is Bertrand rather than Cournot competition for the final

differentiated products.

     Secondly, we consider the implications of optimal government policy in the

exporting country for the vertical supply decision. Although the exporting firm

tan optimize on its own by setting the export price for the intermediate product

prior to the determination of the second stage levels of production of the final

good, there is still a role for government. With Cournot competition in the

market for the final good, this role is partly a consequence of the fact that an

export subsidy increases domestic welfare in a Cournot duopoly. However, the

vertical connection between markets opens up the possibility that final export

sales should be taxed instead of subsidized. Such an outcome is a consequence of-
                                                                                 25

a higher profit margin from the export of the intermediate than the final good

(arising from a sufficiently high tariff on imports of the final good). Although

the optimal commercial policy in such a case is to tax both exports, the

relatively higher tax on final goods serves to divert sales to the more profitable

market for intermediates increasing the extent of vertical supply.

     Overall, our results indicate that in a broad class of cases a high cost firm

need not be concerned about full vertical foreclosure. Nevertheless, the price at

which foreign supplies of the intermediate product can be imported may be high.

The analysis is based on the assumption that a single vertically integrated firm

controls the exports of both products from country 1. If this assumption is

relaxed, allowing for more than one vertically integrated exporter from the low

cost country, then it seems reasonable to conjecture that increased competition

from exporters would increase the extent of vertical supply.

     Another direction in which the results could be generalized would be to

consider the potential for bargaining between the low cost and high cost firm

concerning the price and quantity of exports of the intermediate product. If

there is a tariff on the import of the final good, the joint profit maximizing

solution would be for firm   1   to export the intermediate product only, giving firm

2 s monopoly of the market for the final good in country 2. However, this

solution would require non linear pricing and may be difficult to enforce.

    Merger between the two firms would seem to be a better means of

achieving this outcome, but it may be ruled out by antitrust policy. If the

possibility is admitted that there may be more than one rival firm in the

importing country, it may not be possible to monopolize the industry fully

                                                                       to merge,
making the merger solution less attractive. Even if remains profitable

there is then still the issue of whether to supply the remaining rival firms.

The presence of the export market for the intermediate product has a

fundamental effect on firm l's choice of its export price p1 under Bertrand

competition. As shown by the positive third term of (A.2),                                  firm   1   recognizes that

an increase in its export price                      p1 will increase its profits from the export of the

intermediate product by raising its rival's level of production of the final good.

        The second stage choice of P2 by firm                       2   satisfies the standard Bertrand

                                                     (p2-r)b2 — 0. This condition, together with (A.2)

chooses vertical supply if i4(r,t-s)                         C 0 where    r    is defined by x — 0. From

(A.3), the condition       fi
                                c   0 is sufficent (but not necessary) for vertical supply. As

is the case with Cournot competition, both a tsriff on the import of the final

good and a responsive supply of the intermediate product in country                                2   tend to

increase the likelihood of vertical supply. Also, if the supply curve x2(r)                                  is

vertical at    r, an   exogenous increase in these supplies tends to move the

equilibrium towards vertical foreclosure. (At the vertical intercept of FF in

intermediate product is small then            fi   >   0, and W is increased by a small tax to

the export of the final good. This is a gereralizstion of the Eaton and Grossman

(1986) result that an export tax increases welfare in the exporting country under

Bertrand duopolistic competition. However,                   fi    may be negative and optimal policy

then switches to a subsidy to the export of the final good.

      In choosing its export price p1, firm 1 takes the price Pa as given. Since

Pa increases    in response to an increase in                Pi' considering the           market for the

final good alone, firm 1 is not sufficiently 'aggressive' in raising its price.

However an increase in p1 increases profits from the export of the intermediate

good by less than a fixed level of Pa would imply. Firm 1 therefore tends to be

                                                                       of x. If P C

by reducing the equilibrium levels of p1 and Pa by a positive export subsidy                                 s.

Proof of ProDosition 5:

       (i)   If   c   — C and r-p+t>O, or if r(t)-p+t                    C and, at the initial vertical


supply equilibrium, C <               c,,
                                            < rx/(r-c1)x2 then, from Propositions 1(i) and 3(1) part

(a),   r(t,C)-p+t > C at the vertical supply equilibrium. From Proposition 4(i), the

locally optimal policy is to set s C C and v —                        v(s)   > C.     (ii)   If r(t)-p+t ? 0 and

Cr   > rx/(r-c1)x2, then Proposition 3(i) part                      (b) applies and r(t,C)-p+t       < C at the
vertical supply eqilibrium. From Proposition 4(u), the locally optimal policy is to

set a > C and v —          v(s)   C    0. From (4.9)         and (5.5), 8 —                                      At
a — 8, from (5.6), the (left hand side) derivative of W with respect to                               s   is then

     dW/ds —     [(rP(t-8)_p+t)(yY - yY3)                   + (r(t-8)-ct)xYs1/Yr                          (El)

Since there is vertical supply at s—v—C, 8 is strictly positive. Also, rP(t)p+t                                       0

and d(r(t-s)-p+t)/ds —                -x/3x1      > C for p'' (Y) —    C implies that         r(t-8)-p+t > 0

ensuring that (El) is negative. An increase in a to the vertical foreclosure point

reduces welfare.

       It remains to show that welfare would be reduced by a policy of increasing

a above the vertical foreclosure point (for both
                                                 parts (i) and (ii)). For                                 a      5,

From   (5.9)   and    (3.3),   if a ?        8,
                                  dW/da —         -(p-t-c1)xr - s(Y5r + Y)                                (83)

Therefore, from (82) and (53),                    for   s    8,

                       dW/ds          (r(t-s)-p+t)y

Since,   yr +         > C, r(t-s)-p+t > C and v(8) < C for a                          8 > C, (84) is negative

at v —   v(8),    and an increase in              s   above 8 reduces welfare.***

x2    0, then dy2/ds —     0   and it follows from (5.9) that dW/ds < 0 for

a >   — 0 and it is locally optimal to set s—v—0. If
                                                     Er> 0, from (5.9), UW/ds > 0
at s — 0 and it is locally optimal to set s > 0 and v — v(a) < 0.

      It remains to show that vertical supply reduces welfare in both cases. Since

ir(rP(t),O,O)     ?0,   from (4.9), we have rP(t)-p+t           0 (—0 for        x2     0 and t   —0)   at

s—v—0. Since         0 and (from (3.5) and p''(Y) — 0, d(rP(t-s)-p+t)/ds                   —xp'r      > 0

this implies that rP(t-)-p+t             0. Using dr/ds —   y(l-p'Yr)/1tr             < 0 (see footnote

                  (5y/3)-2x     < 0 it can be shown that d[r(t-s,v(s))-p+t]/ds — (2-

that dW/ds > 0 for all s <            0 and the result follows.***

2.   The idea that vertical foreclosure can increase profits is related to rhe

                                                                       the coaca of its
general idea that s firm in an oligopoly can gain hy increasing

rivals. Salop and Scheffman (1983) and (1987) show that a dominant firm may

gain by raising the costs of its rivals through such means as union contracts or

overbuying of inputs that also serve to raise its own costs. Our model differs

 since it concerns the tradeoff between the direct profits earned from the export

 of a unit of the intermediate product with the loss from the reduction in the

 rival's costs in the market for the final good.
                                                                                31

3.   In Ordover, Saloner and Salop (1988), if the upstream or intermediate good

is supplied   by the vertically integrated firm, then its price is determined by

Bertrand competition with one other supplier of the homogeneous good. Since the

price of the intermediate product equals the common level of marginal costs,

there is no potential for profits to be made from vertical supply. Salinger (1988)

assumea a Cournot type market for the intermediate product as well as Cournot

                                         one unit of the intermediate product ia
competition for the final product. Since
                                                   the vertically integrated firm
required to produce one unit of the final product,
                                                                            will
conjectures that the sale of an additional unit of the intermediate product

increase its rivals' output of the final good by one unit. The sale of the

intermediate product is then viewed as unprofitable if the vertically integrated

firm can earn a higher profit margin from the sale of the final good than the

intermediate good. Our approach allows the low cost firm to recognize the extent

to which the importing firm will substitute imported supplies for its own

production.
                                                                     vertical

Nahata (1980) and Dixit (1983). An exception to this is Greenhut and Ohta

(1979), who consider vertical integration by a subset of oligopoliata, but vertical

supply is not an issue. An excellent discussion of the literature ia available in

Tirole (1988).

5.     Allowing for other factora of production (but maintaining the fixed

proportions assumption) would reduce the impact of changes in the price of the

intermediate good, but otherwise would not generally affect the reaults. With

substitutability between inputa, an increase in the price of the intermediate good

would cauae the rival firm to substitute away from the higher priced input

making such price increasea leaa profitable for the vertically integrated firm.

However, the ability of the rival firm to produce its own suppliea of the

intermediate good plays a aimilar role under fixed proportions technology so that

introducing aubaitutability between inputs should not change the general nature

of the reaulta.

6.      The choice of s and v by country 1 also satisfies the requirements for a

subgame perfect equilibrium. The entire structure could be made aubgame perfect

by consideration of country 2'a optimal choice of the tariff                     t.   We do not do thia

because the reaulta do not seem sufficiently new or interesting.

7.          There is no discontinuity in x(r,t-a) at r —             r   even if x2 — 0 ao that

y2(r,t-a)       —   0.   Given (3.7) and (3.8), the implicit function theorem implies that

y1(r,t-a) and y2(r,t-s) defined by (3.3) and (3.4) are continuous with continuous

partial derivatives for r               r. If x2 — 0, y2(r,t-a) (aa well aa x(r,t-a)) reducea

continuously to zero aa r increases to r.

8.     From     (4.9),       —
                                 y(2-p'Y) - 2x (r-v-c1)x + (r-p+t-(a+v))y. If p
                                                  -
                                                                                                  'Cf)

— 0 and xr — 0 then               — y(2-p'Y) - 2x < 0. We have x2 > 0 if r > c2 and

     — 0 and    x   — 0 if   r    c2.   In this linear case,   ,r5   is also strictly concave in        •r
                                                                                                                     33

at r —     c2, since     the left hand derivative       4 (evaluated         for a reduction in r

below c2) is less negative than the right hand derivative.

9.     The signs of r1 and           r   are ambiguous in general. See Spencer and Jones

(1988) for further analysis.

10.    Along FF, r(t) changes with t. From (4.10), PT is negatively sloped if

dx(r,t,0)/dt —          4rrt   + (l-p'Y)y + (rPp+t)y <              0. Since   tr   C   0,   r     > 0 and 1-

       >   0, this holds if       y      is small. Under linear demand,        y    —   0.
11.     In keeping with our assumption that c2 > c1, the supply curve x2(r) could

have a positive but less than infinite slope for a range of values of r below r".

12.     If Cr   —
                    ,   the   value of r follows from (4.9) with x — y2 and                  x   — 0. Firm 1

sets    a value of r just below c2 if (4.9) is strictly positive at this value of r. A

lower value of r determined by setting (4.9) equal to zero may be optimal if,

with s—v—0, the tariff is sufficiently high to make r-p+t —                         c2-p÷t >       0.

13.     It can be shown that the second order conditions, d2W/ds2 C                     0,       d2W/dv2     C

0,    and d2W/ds2.d2W/dv2 - (d2W/dsdv)2 > 0 for the optimal choice of s and v are

sstisfied provided that p' '(Y) — 0 and               rr <   0. If demand is non linear these


expressions depend on third derivatives of demand. We assume that demand is

sufficiently close to linear for the second order conditions to hold.

14.    An increase in         s, maintaining    v —   v(s)   affects y1 and x partly through its

effect on r and this effect is ambiguous. An increase in s tends to reduce the

demand for x but r does not necessarily fall.                 There is a similar ambiguity in the

pricing response of a monopolist to an increase in demand. If p' '(Y) —                                0,    from

(4.8), (4.9), (3.9) and (3.10), dr/ds — r5 + rv'(s) —                      -y(l-p'Y)/ir C               0.   If p''(Y

0 and xr —      0,   using ,c. as in footnote 8, we obtain dy1/ds —                 y[7y(l P"r)    -             -

8xfl/4irr >     0   and dx/ds    —
                                     y(x xp'Yr)/rr C
                                            -                 0.
15.    Setting v — v(8) is reasonable since v has                  no   affect on welfare         for s ?        .
