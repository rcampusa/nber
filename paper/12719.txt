A Comment Concerning Deposit Insurance and Moral Hazard

                                             ABSTRACT

Hooks and Robinson argue that moral hazard induced by deposit insurance induced banks to invest
in riskier assets in Texas during the 1920s. Their regressions suggest this manifestation of moral hazard
may explain a portion of the events that occurred during the 1920s, but some other phenomena, hitherto
overlooked, must also be at work. Economic logic and evidence form the archives of the Board of
Governors suggest that phenomenon is mismanagement and defalcation by corporate officers, which
increases when insurance reduces depositors' incentives to monitor and react to the safety and soundness
of banks.

        An article by Linda Hooks and Kenneth Robinson, “Deposit Insurance and Moral

Hazard: Evidence from Texas Banking During the 1920s”contains a contradiction (Hooks

and Robinson, 2002). Pondering it reveals an insight which the authors may have

overlooked.


The Contradiction

        Hooks and Robinson examine balance sheet data for banks in Texas. Table 3

focuses on state banks during the 1920s and finds “evidence that declines in capitalization

led to increases in asset risk, as measured by loan concentrations. Such activity on the part

of insured banks would indicate that banks with weakened financial conditions increased

the riskiness of their asset portfolios, which would be consistent with a moral-hazard effect

at work (p. 848).” Table 4 examines two control groups: state banks in 1909, and national

banks during the 1920s. Neither group exhibits correlations between capitalization and

loan concentration, suggesting that a difference between the control and treatment groups,

one of which was deposit insurance, encouraged poorly capitalized state banks to invest in

assets, such as loans to local farmers and businessmen, with higher expected return and

risk.

        According to Hooks and Robinson’s regressions in Table 2, however, such

behavior did NOT increase the likelihood that banks failed. Banks whose portfolios

contained a higher proportion of loans had LOWER failure rates than other banks, all else

being equal (see coefficient on the portfolio concentration variable, which measures the

ration of loans to assets, LOANASS). The beneficial effect of additional loans was large.

An extra $1 of loans reduced the probability of failure to the same extent as an additional




                                              2
43 cents of retained earnings (-0.140/-0.327) (see Table 2, column 1). The authors

acknowledge this result when they write “we expect a positive sign on LOANASS …

However, LOANASS is negative and significant, the opposite of what was hypothesized.”

       Their hypothesis rests on the notion that “declines in capitalization can induce ‘go-

for-broke’ strategies among insured banks. With less of their own funds at risk as capital

declines, insured banks may be tempted to gamble on risky projects with a small

probability of payoff. If these ventures prove successful, the bank gains, otherwise the

insurance fund suffers the losses (p. 844).” The expectation of a “positive sign on

LOANASS” presumes that investing in loans rather than safer assets, such as government

securities and eligible commercial paper, actually resulted in large losses and high failure

rates. Table 2’s regressions indicate the opposite. Texas banks benefited from lending more

money. Their ex ante gambles yielded ex post profits. This is understandable since the

banks made these loans during the era known as the Roaring 20s, when the national

economy prospered, and Texas experienced oil and industrial booms.

       Table 2’s regressions contain another variable, INSURED, an indicator for state

banks, all of which had to participate in one of the two Texas deposit insurance systems.

The author’s argue that “if moral hazard incentives are present at insured banks, leading

them to pursue excessively risky activities, then we would expect a positive sign on

INSURED (p. 843).” The sign is indeed “positive and significant at the 10-percent level,

indicating that deposit insurance significantly increased the likelihood of failure (p. 843).”

       This brings us to the contradiction in the essay, and I believe, an overlooked

insight. The author’s interpretations of LOANASS and INSURED in Table 2 are

inconsistent with their interpretations of Tables 3 and 4. For the latter tables, the authors




                                               3
claim that the structure of a bank’s assets, measured by loan concentrations in the

portfolio, serves as a good proxy for risk. “Loans are one of the riskiest assets that banks

can hold (p. 842).” “A higher proportion of loans leaves a bank more exposed to credit risk

and more vulnerable to adverse economic shock (p. 843).” The statistically significant

relationship between LOANASS, TOTCAP, and CAPLOAN reveals moral hazard at work.

In Table 2, however, the authors’ argue that the coefficient on INSURED indicates that

moral hazard induced excess risk taking and influenced the survival of banks. But the

regressions also contain the variable LOANASS. If LOANASS serves as a good proxy for ex

ante portfolio risk, as the authors argue throughout their essay and in Tables 3 and 4, then

the variable INSURED cannot also do so. Regression analysis imposes a ceteris paribus

assumption. The coefficient on INSURED measures the correlation between insurance and

failure that is orthogonal to LOANASS, that is holding the loan to asset ratio constant.

        In other words, if the coefficient on INSURED reveals moral hazard at work, it

must reveal moral hazard operating through a channel other than distorting banks decisions

concerning the bearing of risk. What might that channel be?


Resolving the Contradiction

        The literature on deposit insurance discusses two types of moral hazard. The first,

which the authors explicitly search for in this essay, involves excess risk-taking among

insured banks. The relationship at issue is that between managers and regulators, who

indirectly underwrite gambles gone bad by zombie banks. The Savings and Loan crisis

inspired this line of research.




                                              4
       The second occurs when the presence of insurance reduces the incentives for

depositors to monitor the safety of their savings. Depositors stop monitoring the behavior

of bankers, and no longer bother to move deposits from worse to better managed

institutions. Mismanagement increases. Bad banks proliferate. Competitive pressures force

good banks to cut costs and corners, initiating what may become a race to the bottom.

       Mismanagement of this type does not generate predictable patterns in bank balance

sheets. Some classic examples of mismanagement illustrate this point. One, a bank never

bothers to make loans. Instead, it invests in eligible paper, deposits funds in correspondent

banks, and keeps the bulk of its resources in its vault. Its costs exceed revenues, and it goes

bankrupt, because its portfolio has too low of a return and too little risk. Two, a bank

invests in a large, expensive building with beautiful new furniture and artwork, which it

cannot afford on current revenues, and goes bankrupt. Three, bank managers do not

perform due diligence and fail to collect outstanding debts. Losses rise. Bankruptcy results.

In the first two examples, the balance sheets of the banks would exhibit low ratios of loans

to assets. In the third example, the balance sheet of a bank could exhibit any level of

investment risk.

       This property of mismanagement makes it a likely explanation for the positive

coefficient on INSURED in Table 2, since the logic of regression analysis dictates that the

factor generating the coefficient must be orthogonal to LOANASS and to the underlying

phenomena, portfolio concentration and overall asset risk, for which LOANASS proxies.

       Data on the causes of bank suspensions during the 1920s that I have recently

recovered from the archives of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors supports this

supposition. Each year when deposit insurance existed in Texas between 1921 and 1926,




                                               5
mismanagement forced an average of 3.2% of all state banks to suspend operations. That

fraction amounted to nearly 80% of all state bank suspensions. In the four years after

deposit insurance, mismanagement forced an average of only 1.2% of all state banks to

suspend operations. The share of suspensions attributed to mismanagement fell similarly

(see Chung and Richardson 2004 for a description of the source).


Conclusions

       Hooks and Robinson indicate that their article provides additional evidence

supporting the conventional academic wisdom. This comment argues that their essay does

that and much more. Their regressions demonstrate that while the prevailing paradigm

explains a portion of the events that occurred during the 1920s, some other phenomena,

hitherto overlooked, must also be at work. Economic logic and evidence form the archives

of the Board of Governors suggest that phenomenon is mismanagement, which increases

when insurance reduces depositors’ incentives to monitor and react to the safety and

soundness of banks.
