                                            ABSTRACT

Dooley et al (2003, 2004a,b,c) argue that China seeks to raise urban employment by 10-12 million
persons per year, with about 30% of that coming from export growth. In fact, total employment increased
by 7.5-8 million per year over 1997-2005. We estimate that export growth over 1997-2002 contributed
at most 2.5 million jobs per year, with most of the employment gains coming from non-traded goods
like construction. Exports grew much faster over the 2000-2005 period, which could in principal explain
the entire increase in employment. However, the growth in domestic demand led to three-times more
employment gains than did exports over 2000-2005, while productivity growth subtracted the same
amount again from employment. We conclude that exports have become increasingly important in
stimulating employment in China, but that the same gains could be obtained from growth in domestic
demand, especially for tradable goods, which has been stagnant until at least 2002.

1. Introduction

          In a series of four papers, Dooley et al (2003, 2004a,b,c) lay out a vision of a “revived

Bretton Woods system” to explain international trade and monetary arrangements today.

According to their vision, this system has the following elements:

          1) Under the old Bretton Woods system, European countries adopted undervalued

exchange rates and capital controls, allowing then to pursue export-led growth. They eventually

graduated to flexible exchange rate and capital mobility, thereby jointly forming a “capital

account” region (along with Canada and Latin America);

          2) Another group of countries including Asia and especially China make up the new

periphery, again adopted undervalued exchange rates and capital controls to pursue export-led

growth. These countries form a “trade account” region. China, in particular, needs to employ

some 200 million persons from the rural area, or 10-12 million persons per year in the urban

areas, which is facilitated by the inflow of foreign direct investment;

          3) The United States is at the center, and its budget and current account deficits have their

counterpart in the trade surpluses in Asia. The U.S. current account deficit is financed through

official inflows from the “trade account” region and private inflows from the “capital account”

region;

          4) The system is sustainable so long as the “trade account” region continues to finance

the U.S. trade deficit and protectionism does not occur. Threats of protectionism are offset by the

profits earned by foreign investors in the “trade account” region, especially China. Conversely,

the trade deficits run by the U.S. (or equivalently, the Treasury bills held by China) are a form of

collateral that prevents the Chinese from seizing the assets of foreign firms, which would lead

U.S. to default on its financial obligations.
                                                            2

         Some of these various hypotheses are more controversial than others. For example, Wei

(undated) objects to the idea that U.S. Treasury bills held by China act as collateral against the

Chinese seizing foreign plants, arguing that: (i) most FDI in China does not come from the U.S.,

but rather from Hong Kong; (ii) there is no recent history of China seizing control of foreign

firms; (iii) there is even less history of the United States defaulting on its Treasury bill

obligations. But this final idea of U.S. Treasury bill acting as collateral is not really essential for

the rest of the theory,1 and controversy over it need not detract from the other hypotheses. The

focus of this paper is on the least controversial of their hypotheses, and that is the idea that

expanding exports from China serve to create employment in the urban areas.

         Our goal is to quantitatively evaluate this employment hypothesis, i.e. to answer the

question of how much employment is created by rising Chinese exports. Even this hypothesis is

not as straightforward as it might seem. A recent article in the Economist entitled “The Jobless

Boom,” notes that employment growth has been lower than overall economic growth across

various countries of Asia, especially in China, and that this ratio has been falling over time.2

Citing a study by the Asian Development Bank (Felipe and Hasan, 2006a,b), the article suggests

that the reasons for this weak employment growth has been the shift towards more productive,

capital-intensive industries. Dooley et al (2004b, p. 4) themselves do not expect the employment

growth to come entirely from exports, and in fact, suggest that employment growth of 3 million

workers per year in China will come from rising exports.

         A logical starting point to determine the employment effect of exports is to look at the

calculations from input-output (IO) tables for China, with both the direct and indirect demand for

  In fact, Dooley et al (2004c) motivate the collateral idea by noting that the rest of their theory does not necessarily
imply a trade deficit in the United States as center country; by adding the trade deficits as collateral, that limitation
of the theory is overcome.

labor from ordinary and processing exports. As reviewed in section 2, an increase in ordinary

exports of $1,000 (the annual wage in manufacturing in 2000) leads to employment of 0.44

person-years in 2000, and 0.34 person-years in 2002, with much smaller effects from processing

exports. But surprisingly, applying these “static employment coefficients” to compute the

implied employment gains due to the growth in domestic demand and exports, over 1997–2002

and 2000–2005, leads to employment gains that vastly exceed the actual employment increase in

China. In other words, the static employment coefficients are an unreliable guide to computing

the actual employment effects of export growth.

       One reason why the static employment effects are unreliable has already been suggested:

changes in the industry composition of exports towards more productive industries. This source

of aggregate productivity growth is sometimes called the “Denison effect” in the U.S. literature

(Nordhaus, 1992, p. 215), as discussed in section 3. Shifting towards more productive industries

means that the labor needed to produce any given output is reduced. We show in section 4 that

accounting for the “Denison effect” reduces the employment impact of exports by about 25%

from the initial calculations, but we still predict employment gains due to rising exports that are

much too high.

       Besides the shifting composition of industries, aggregate productivity can rise due to

technological progress and capital accumulation. We do not attempt to fully account for this

second source of productivity growth, but make a limited attempt by using the growth in wages

over time: in our calculations with the IO tables, rising wages means reduced employment

growth. We show in section 5 that this factor further reduces the employment gains that we can

expect from exports, to 45% of the initial calculation for ordinary exports and 75% of the initial

calculation for processing exports. These are rules of thumb that can be used to reduce the static
                                                 4

employment coefficients for exports.

       In section 6 we investigate the growth in domestic demand in China over 1997–2002,

when our data is most complete. Looking first at traded goods (agriculture, mining and

manufacturing), and accounting for the “Denison effect,” we find that the net employment

growth in those sectors due to rising domestic demand is actually negative. That is, the shift

towards more productive industries has outstripped the increase in final demand, leading to no

net job creation. The only source of employment gains during 1997–2002 was in the non-traded

sectors, such as construction, and final consumer services like restaurants, health services,

education, etc. Taking into account the same factors as for exports, i.e. shifting demand across

industries and rising wages, we find that the impact of domestic demand on employment is 75%

smaller than the initial calculation from the IO table, which gives us another rule of thumb.

       Using these rules of thumb we revise the static employment coefficients, and in section 7

re-calculate the impact of rising exports and domestic demand on labor demand in China. We

find the implied employment growth from exports is modest over the 1997–2002 period: not

more than 2.5 million jobs added per year. During the 2000–2005 period exports grew much

faster, so the employment impact is also higher: exports added as much as 7.5 million jobs per

year. However, domestic demand led to three-times more employment gains than did exports,

while productivity growth subtracted the same amount again from employment. This calculation

confirms the suggestion in Dooley et al (2004b, note 5) that about 30% of the employment

growth in China will come from rising exports. We conclude in section 8 that exports have

become increasingly important in stimulating employment in China, but that the same gains

could be obtained from growth in domestic demand, especially for tradable goods, which has

been stagnant until at least 2002, and possibly beyond (Aziz and Cui, 2007).

2. Employment Gains in China

         We begin by reviewing the recent growth in employment, GDP and exports in China.

Throughout the paper we focus on the period 1997–2005, which gives us two overlapping five-

year intervals to work with: 1997–2002 and 2000–2005. Despite the relatively short span of

years and closeness of these two intervals, we will find substantial changes in the Chinese

economy over this time.

         In Table 1 we list total employment, broken down by urban and rural, as well as GDP and

its components during these years. Total employment has grown by 7.5–8 million workers per

year over this period, while urban employment has grown slightly faster: 8–8.5 million workers,

as there was some migration out of the countryside. Real GDP and its components, as well as all

trade data, is measured in constant 2000 US$.3 Real GDP growth doubled from 5.7% per year

over 1997–2002 to 11.0% in 2000–2005.4 Notice that the growth of C+G is much less in the

2000–2005 period than is the growth in investment, indicating that an increasing share of

domestic demand is for construction projects and other investments.

         In Table 2 we provide the data on Chinese ordinary and processing trade, again in

constant 2000 US$. Both exports and imports grew by more than 20% per year over the 2000–

2005 period, which greatly outstripped their prior growth: the boom in Chinese trade is really a

feature of the 21st century. Note that the trade balance listed in the final column of Table 2 does

not match the values for (X–M) given in the final column of Table 1, because (X–M) includes

both goods and services as used in GDP accounts, whereas the trade balance in Table 2 is just for



3
  We lack specific deflators for components of GDP and trade, and the overall Chinese inflation rate is erratic over
this period, including some years of deflation. Since our trade data is reported in US$, we decide to use constant
2000 US$ to measure all other values, converted with the nominal yuan/dollar rate and using the U.S. CPI.
4
  The real GDP figures we are using are deflated by the U.S. CPI, as explained in note 3, and are based on
expenditure GDP rather than production GDP. For these reasons, the growth rates differ from those sometimes
reported in the press.
                                                 6

merchandise trade.

       A logical starting point to determine the impacts of export growth on employment are the

studies by Lau et al (2004), using a 1995 IO table for China, and Lau et al (2006a,b), using a

2002 IO table. From the 1995 table, Lau et al (2004) estimate that $1,000 of ordinary exports

from China leads to 0.70 person-years of employment, and $1,000 of processing exports leads to

0.06 person-years, or roughly one-tenth as much as for ordinary exports. Those estimates are

shown in Table 3, and have been falling over time. Using the 2002 IO table, Lau et al (2006a,b)

estimate that $1,000 of ordinary exports from China leads to 0.36 person-years of employment

(which is one-half as much as they found for 1995), and $1,000 of processing exports leads to

0.11 person-years (which is twice the estimate for 1995), so processing exports lead to about

three-tenths the employment of ordinary exports.

       We will refer to these employment estimates computed from the IO tables as “static

employment coefficients,” because they each refer to a single year. The change in these static

employment coefficients can be due to either of the factors we identified in the introduction:

shifting composition of exports across industries and technological progress. We will attempt to

measure the importance of each of these, but first need to replicate the results of Lau and his co-

authors for one year. Using the IO table for 2000, we find that $1,000 of ordinary exports from

China leads to 0.44 person-years of employment, and $1,000 of processing exports leads to 0.13

person-years. So again, processing exports leads to about three-tenths the employment of

ordinary exports. Our estimates for 2000 are also shown in Table 3, and fall neatly in-between

the estimates of Lau et al (2004, 2006a,b), giving us some confidence that our employment

estimates are consistent with theirs.
                                                  7

       The methodology we have used to obtain the static employment coefficients from the

2000 IO table is discussed in the Appendix, and is briefly summarized as follows. Denote the

sources of demand by j = D, O, P for domestic demand, ordinary exports and processing exports,

respectively. Then the portion of value-added going to labor from $1 demand of type j in sector i

    j
is BLit , which is computed from the IO table as the sum of direct plus indirect payments to

labor. Our calculations are only for 2000, which we denote t = 0, but the same calculations are

                                                                                         j
made by Lau et al (2004, 2006a,b) for 1995 and 2002. Having obtained these coefficients BLit

for each sector, these are averaged across sectors:


                D
               BLt   ≡
                       ∑  D BD
                         i it Lit
                                  , and    j
                                          BLt   ≡
                                                  ∑  X j Bj
                                                    i it Lit
                                                             ,   for j = O,P                 (1)
                        ∑i D it                    ∑i X itj
where D it denotes domestic demand in sector j, while X O                                 P
                                                        it denotes ordinary exports and X it


denotes processing exports.

                                  j
       Notice the averaged terms BLt refer to the portion of value-added going to labor. To

convert this into employment we need to divide by a wage. For the 2000 IO table, we have used

the average 2000 wage, which was $842 per year. So the static employment coefficients shown

in Table 3 for 2000 are obtained as:

                               CLj 0 ≡ BLj 0 / $842 , for j =D,O,P                           (2)

We are unsure what wages were used by Lau et al (2004, 2006a,b) for 1995 and 2002, but the

calculation is presumably analogous to that in (2), which we will write in other years as:

                                        j
                                       CLt ≡ BLt
                                              j
                                                 / Wt .                                      (2')

       In Table 3 we also show the static employment coefficient for domestic demand, which

equals C+I+G. For 2000, we have computed the domestic coefficients as in (1) and (2), for j=D.
                                                           8

                     j
For 2002, we choose CLt so that the implied employment from domestic demand plus exports

                                                                         D
just equals the actual employment in each year. That is, we have chosen CLt so that:

                                      D
                                     CLt D t + CLt
                                                O O
                                                   X t + CLt
                                                          P P
                                                             X t = Lt ,                            (3)

where Lt is employment in year t. Notice that this full-employment condition also holds in 2000

by construction of the static employment coefficients from the IO table.

        Despite the fact that the static employment coefficients are obtained for a single year,

there is a strong temptation to apply them over time, i.e. to use these coefficients to predict the

future course of employment due to export growth. There are potentially large errors associated

with that procedure, however. To see this point theoretically, take the difference of (3) over a 5-

year period. After some simplification, we obtain the equation:


   ΔL t = ΔD t   1
                 2
                        D
                     ( CLt + CLt
                              D

                                                                                                   (4)

where ΔD t = D t − D t − 5 is the change over a 5-year interval, and likewise for every other

variable. On the first line of (4) we have the change in domestic demand and exports times the

average employment coefficients, and on the second line we have the change in the employment

coefficients times the average demand. Generally, the employment coefficients are falling over

time, as can be seen by comparing the rows of Table 3. It follows that the second line of (4) is

negative, and potentially quite large: the fall in each employment coefficient is multiplied by the

average level of demand, and not just its growth. Since the second line is negative and potentially

large, it follows that the first line on the right is potentially much larger than the actual increase

in employment.
                                                         9

         This theoretical result is confirmed in Table 4, where we take the static employment

coefficients and apply them to the change in exports over the two 5-years periods, 1997-2002

and 2000-2005. In the first row of Table 4, for example, we use our estimates of the C ij0

employment coefficient from the 2000 IO table, as shown in Table 3, and multiply each of the

employment coefficients by the real change in domestic demand, ordinary exports and

processing exports over 1997–2002. That is we compute:


                           Prediction 1 = ΔD t CLD0 + ΔX O
                                                         t C L0 + ΔX t CL 0 ,
                                                             O       P P
                                                                                                            (5)


which is similar to the first line of (4). From domestic demand we predict an employment

increase of 216 million persons,5 and for ordinary processing exports we predict an employment

increase of 31 million persons. Summing over these we obtain nearly 250 million workers, as

compared to an actual employment increase of only 39 million! We see that simply multiplying

the real changes in demand and exports by the employment coefficients, as in (5), massively

overstates the true change in employment.

         The situation is even worse over the 2000–2005 period, where now we use the static

employment coefficients of Lau et al (2006a) from the 2002 IO table. Again we multiply the

employment coefficients by the real change in domestic demand and exports, as in (5), and

predict an increase in employment in China of 550 million workers, as compared to the actual

increase of only 37 million! Thus, the predicted employment impact vastly exceeds the actual

employment increase. The difference between the predicted and actual employment increases is

due to fall in the employment coefficients, as shown on the second line of (4).

  The rise in domestic demand of $411.5 billion in Table 4 is taken from the IO tables for 1997 and 2002, and
exceeds the rise in domestic demand of $345.4, taken from C+I+G in the national accounts, Table 1. We use
domestic demand from the IO tables for consistency with later calculations. If instead we use the national accounts
figure to predict employment gains in Table 4, then we obtain 225 million workers over 1997–2002, which is
somewhat less than what we report in Table 4.

         We conclude from these calculations that the static employment coefficients, times the

changes in demand, do not provide reliable estimates of the actual employment gains in China.

Reasons for this have already been suggested: the static employment coefficients do not take into

account the changing industry composition of domestic demand and exports, and the coefficients

can also fall due to technological progress and capital accumulation. We now examine each of

these explanations in turn.


3. Shifting Composition of Exports and Domestic Demand

         The static employment coefficients computed from the IO table refer to the employment

impact of an additional $1,000 in average exports or domestic demand, i.e. using the same

composition of output that occurred in the year of the IO table, as shown by taking the averages

in (1). But that is not a good guide for the effects of an actual change in demand, because with

shifting comparative advantage, export growth may be in industries different from in the past. In

addition, for domestic demand the growth in China in recent years has been especially strong in

investment (as shown in Table 1), especially construction, which differs in its labor requirements

from other industries.

         The growth in exports is shown in Figures 1 and 2, where we graph the percentage

increase over 2000-2005 in total and ordinary exports, respectively, and industry wages in 2000.

Regardless of whether we use total or ordinary exports, the industry with the greatest percentage

increase in exports was electronic and telecommunications equipment, and that industry also had

the highest wage in 2000.6 Overall, there is a positive correlation between the percentage growth

in exports, and the real wage in 2000, with food products and tobacco appearing as an outlier

(and a relatively small export industry). The fact that the percentage increase in exports differs

6
   This industry also had by far the greatest increase in real exports over 2000-2005, exceeding $160 billion, though
the majority of those sales were for processing exports.
                                                          11

substantially across industries, meaning that the use of “average” exports as in Lau et al (2004,

2006a,b) will lead to inaccurate results. Instead, we want to use the “marginal” exports, i.e. the

actual increase in exports that occurred in each industry over the five-year period.

        In theoretical terms, we want to compare the results of using aggregate employment

coefficients, as shown in Table 3, with using disaggregate sector-level coefficients. To obtain the

disaggregate results, write the full-employment condition (1) alternatively as:


                           ∑i     Lit D it + C Lit X it + C Lit X it = ∑i L it ,
                                 CD            O     O      P     P
                                                                                                              (6)


where C D       O           P
        Lit , C Lit , and C Lit are the disaggregate employment coefficients by IO sectors, and


likewise for domestic demand Dit, ordinary exports X O                           P
                                                     it and processing exports X it . Taking the


difference of (6) over a 5-year interval we obtain:


             {
 ΔL t = ∑i ΔD it 12 (C D
                       Lit + C Lit − 5 ) + ΔX it 2 (C Lit + C Lit − 5 ) + ΔX it 2 (C Lit + C Lit − 5 )
                               D              O 1     O       O              P 1     P       P
                                                                                                         }
                                                                                                              (7)
                 {
          + ∑i ΔC D   1                                    O      O             P 1       P      P
                                                                                                         }
                  Lit 2 ( D it + D it − 5 ) + ΔC Lit 2 ( X it + X it − 5 ) + ΔC Lit 2 ( X it + X it − 5 ) .
                                                 O 1




By using the sectoral data in the 2000 IO table, we can make an alternative prediction of the

employment gains from the first line of (7):


                                         {
                 Prediction 2 = ∑i ΔD it C D
                                           Li0 + ΔX it C Li0 + ΔX it C Li0 ,
                                                    O O           P P
                                                                                    }                         (8)


where we are using employment coefficients from the year 2000 table in place of the average

employment coefficients that appear in (5). Note that these are obtained from the 2000 IO table

              j
by dividing B Li 0 by the wage in each sector:


                                         0 ≡ B Li 0 / Wi 0 , for j = D,O,P.
                                      j        j
                 Prediction 2 uses: C Li                                                                      (9)
                                                            12

       Comparing the new prediction obtained from the disaggregate coefficients in (8) with that

from the aggregate coefficients in (5), since ΔD t = ∑i ΔD it and ΔX tj = ∑i ΔX itj we obtain:


        Prediction 2 − Prediction 1 =

                ∑{                                                                                           }.
                                                                                                                  (10)
                   i
                     ΔD it (C D
                              Li 0   −   CLD0 ) +   ΔX O     O
                                                       it (C Li 0   −   CLO0 ) +   ΔX itP (C PLi0   −   CLP0 )


If there is a negative correlation between the growth in demand and the employment coefficients

in each sector, as we would expect if growth in output occurs in the more efficient sectors, then

(10) is negative and our second prediction of employment growth is less than the first. This

reduction in employment gains come from shifts towards more productive industries, and is an

example of what Nordhaus (1992, p. 215) calls the “Denison effect.” Nordhaus refers to the work

of Edward Denison (1967, 1980), who demonstrated that if resources shift from low-productivity

to high-productivity industries, like from agriculture to manufacturing, then the economy would

show aggregate productivity growth even if sectoral productivity growth was zero in both

sectors. The aggregate productivity growth is due to a “reallocation effect” across industries. The

flip-side of this aggregate productivity growth is that the labor needed to produce any given

output is reduced, as we are showing in (10).

       Another interpretation of the calculation in (8) can be obtained by taking the averages:

                ~        ∑i ΔDit C DLi0 , and          ~          ∑i ΔX itj C Lij 0 ,
                CDL0 ≡                                 C Lj 0 ≡                           for j = O,P.            (11)
                          ∑i ΔDit                                  ∑i ΔX itj
                                                                         j
Notice that (11) is an average of the sectoral employment coefficients C Li 0 in 2000, but using

the change in domestic demand and exports as weights, rather than their average levels as in (1) -

(2). Again, since ΔD t = ∑i ΔD it and ΔX tj = ∑i ΔX itj , it is immediate that prediction 2 in (8) can

be alternatively written as:
                                                         13

                                               ~          O~O          P~P
                           Prediction 2 = ΔD t C D
                                                 L 0 + ΔX t C L 0 + ΔX t C L 0 ,                             (12)


which is the change in demand times the revised employment coefficients. From (11) and (12),

we can see our second prediction of the rise in employment uses actual or “marginal” increase in

exports and domestic demand, rather than the “averages” used in (1)-(2) and (5).

         In the following sections, we implement this second prediction, as well as a third variant,

using the 2000 IO table. In sections 4 and 5 we focus on the growth of exports, over 1997–2002

and 2000–2005, and in section 6 discuss the growth in domestic demand, in which case we do

not have disaggregate data for 2005 so we are restricted to investigating 1997–2002.


4. Growth of Exports, 1997–2002 and 2000–2005

         In Table 5, we report the employment gains over 1997-2002 and 2000-2005 using the

disaggregate increase in exports over these two periods (prediction 2a). In the former period,

1997-2002, the employment growth is 23 million persons, rather than 31 million from Table 1.

So the shift towards more productive industries reduces the employment growth by 25% (or 17%

for ordinary exports and 52% for processing exports). A similar decline is seen over 2000-2005,

when using the actual rather than the average, increase in exports reduces employment growth

from 115 million (prediction 1) to 86 million (prediction 2a), again a decline of 25%.7 We

conclude that the employment gain from increased exports is reduced once we account for the

industry composition of exports, as suggested by Felipe and Hasan (2006a,b).

         The adjustments we have made for prediction 2 can be extended in two directions: we

have the data to take into account the provincial compositions of exports, along with provincial


7
   If instead of using the industry wages in prediction 2, as in (9), we instead continued to use the overall average
wage of $842 in 2000, then the predicted employment impact of exports is reduced by 15% as compared with the
first prediction. That reduction comes from using the disaggregate calculation as in (8), but with the average wage of
$842 in (9). The additional 10% reduction for prediction 2 is obtained by using the industry wages, as in (9).
                                                 14

wages by industry; or to account for the differing wages paid by types of firm-ownership (state-

owned, collective, or private) and the exports by firm-ownership and industry as well as wages

by firm-ownership and industry. To the extent that exports are shifting to more productive

provinces (e.g. coastal) or firms (e.g. private), the estimated employment gains are reduced.

       It should be noted that the maintained assumption in these calculations is that the national

IO table for 2000 applies equally well across provinces and across types of firm-ownership. We

have only very limited data that could be used to test this assumption. To the extent possible, we

applied the methods of Bernstein and Weinstein (2002), and found that the 2000 IO table appears

to hold reasonably well across provinces except for Guangdong (where labor compensation was

higher than predicted from the national IO table). Because Guangdong was the only outlier, and

because our ability to construct an alternative IO table for Guangdong is extremely limited, we

continued to apply the national table across all provinces, and types of firm-ownership.

       Focusing first on the provincial effects (prediction 2b), accounting for the shift in exports

by industry and province further reduces the employment impact of increased exports, to 20.6

million persons over 1997-2002, or one-third less than the initial calculation. For 2000-2005, the

implied increase in employment is 77.5 million persons, which is also one-third less than the

initial calculation. The employment effects that are obtained when we instead take into account

the shift in exports by industry and firm-ownership (prediction 2c) are similar to those that take

into account provincial effects: the predicted employment gains are reduced by about one-third

from the initial calculations. The data we have available do not allow us to take into account both

of these effects at the same time. In any case, for 2000-2005 the implied increase in employment

is still much larger than the actual increase of 37 million, which calls for an explanation.
                                                                15


5. Increase in Wages due to Productivity Gains

       A final limitation of the static employment coefficients computed from the IO table, and

also a limitation of our results reported in Table 5, is that we have assumed that wages are

constant over time. That is, we are using wages in 2000: either at the overall wage in (2), or the

industry wage in (9). But of course, real wages will rise over time due to both productivity gains

and capital accumulation. With rising wages, any implied increase in value-added and payments

to labor will correspond to a smaller increase in employment.

       For our next calculation, we divide the direct plus indirect payments to labor from the

2000 IO table by the real 1997 and 2002 wages, respectively, when estimate labor demand in

each year. That is, we obtain the employment coefficients in each year as:

                    j
                 Ĉ Lit ≡ BLi
                           j
                              0 / Wit and Ĉ Lit − 5 ≡ B Li 0 / Wit − 5 , for j = D,O,P.
                                             j           j
                                                                                                                               (13)

Then our third prediction of the employment gains for rising demand is:

 Prediction 3 =

         ∑i {Dit Ĉ DLit − Dit − 5Ĉ DLit − 5 + X OitĈOLit − X Oit − 5ĈOLit − 5 + ΔX itPĈ PLit − ΔX itP − 5Ĉ PLit − 5 }.
                                                                                                                               (14)



       Note that if instead of the estimates in (13), we had used the true employment coefficients

  j
C Lit obtained from the IO table in each year, then (14) would be an exact prediction of the

change in employment: there would be no error involved. So the difference between the third

prediction, which uses the industry wages in each year, and the actual changes in employment

occurs because: (i) we are using wages in (13) that do not differ between domestic and export

                                                       j
production, and (ii) we are still using coefficients B Li 0 from 2000, rather than allowing these

coefficients to change over time. In brief, we still do not accurately predict employment changes

with (14) because we are not allowing the IO table to change over time, and our wage data is not
                                                 16

detailed enough. Still, we find that this third prediction is a further improvement over our earlier

calculations.

       In Table 6 we show how the implied employment effects are further reduced when we

allow for the actual increase in wages over 1997–2002 or 2000–2005. For 1997–2002, we find

that the employment gains due to ordinary exports range from 5 to 10 million (predictions 3a, 3b

and 3c), which are reduced by 55% or more as compared to the initial calculation. For processing

exports, the implied employment effects range from -1.4 to 1.7 million, a reduction of at least

80% from the initial calculation. Over this period, most of the increase in exports over these

years can be explained by the shift in workers towards more efficient industries, firms and

provinces, so the employment gain is very modest. Over 2000–2005, we also find that the

employment gains due to increased ordinary exports are reduced by 55% from our initial

calculation, while the employment gains due to processing exports are reduced by about 75%.

       To sum up, our calculations have reduced the employment impact of increased exports by

more than one-half of the initial calculation for ordinary exports, and at least three-quarters for

processing exports. Are these results in Table 6 believable? The smaller employment gains

indicate an efficient reallocation of resources, which is plausible. We note that these efficiency

gains come from reallocations across many industries (as well as province and firm-ownership),

and do not simply reflect a rural-urban migration. Indeed, agriculture and manufacturing

industries tend to rise or fall together in our calculations: allowing for rising wages over time, we

find that the increase in exports is associated with rising employment in both agriculture and the

sum of all manufacturing industries. So the net changes in implied employment reported in

Tables 5 and 6 would be similar if we omitted agriculture and reported instead the changes in

manufacturing employment due to exports.

6. Shifting Composition of Domestic Demand, 1997–2002

          To measure domestic demand we rely on the sum of C+I+G by industry from the IO

tables, which we have for the years 1997, 2000 and 2002, but not for 2005.8 So to evaluate the

change in employment due to domestic demand, we are restricted to the five-year period 1997-

2002, and will not be able to report any results for 2000-2005. Furthermore, domestic demand is

not broken down by province nor by the type of firm-ownership. So the calculations for domestic

demand will only be broken down by industry over 1997-2002.

          The implied employment increase due to the growth in domestic demand are reported in

Table 7, where we distinguish domestic demand for tradable goods (all manufacturing plus

mining and agriculture) and non-traded goods (all utilities and services, including construction).9

That is, we have re-computed the employment coefficients shown in (1)-(2) and (10)-(11) for

domestic demand by separating trade from non-traded goods. Traded goods are shown in part A

of Table 7. We find that domestic demand for tradable goods has risen by a very modest amount

in real terms over 1997-2002, $24 billion, shown in the first column. Multiplying that increase in

demand by the static employment coefficient of 0.525, we obtain a modest rise in employment of

12.7 million persons, as shown in the third column (prediction 1).

          However, if instead we use the actual change in demand rather than its “average” change,

then fall in demand would actually lead to reduced employment of 10 million workers when

holding wages fixed at their 2000 levels (prediction 2). Allowing for the growth of wages

between 1997 and 2002, the implied fall in employment is even higher, 50 million workers, due

to the fall in domestic demand (prediction 3). Only a very small amount, 3.3 million workers, is

made up by the increase in demand due to rising exports, so the net change in employment due to


8
    Imports are treated entirely as intermediate inputs in the IO table, so need not be deducted from C+I+G.
9
    Tradable goods are defined as sectors 1-22 of the 2000 IO table, and nontradable goods as sectors 23-40.
                                                          18

domestic demand plus exports is a fall of some 47 million jobs.

           Since employment actually increased by 39 million jobs over 1997-2002, the gap must be

made up by the non-traded sector, which is confirmed in the next row of Table 7. An initial

calculation using a static employment coefficient gives a rise in employment of 203 million

(prediction 1, part B). Use the actual change in demand rather than its “average” change, then the

employment increase becomes 166 million workers when holding wages fixed at their 2000

levels (prediction 2). Allowing wages to rise over 1997-2002, the employment gain in non-

tradable goods is 111 million workers (prediction 3). That is an enormous rise in employment

due to domestic demand, which far exceeds any of our calculations for exports. The sector with

the largest increase in domestic demand is construction, which accounts for at least half of the

overall rise in employment. Employment gains are also shown in final consumer services like

real estate, restaurants, health services, education, etc.

           The changes in domestic demand for tradable and non-tradable goods are graphed in

Figure 3, along with the industry wages in 2000.10 Sectors with the greatest increase in demand

include a few tradable industries, like instruments and office machinery, and electronic and

telecommunication equipment, but many more non-traded goods: real estate, restaurants,

scientific research, education, public administration, health and social services, etc. At the far

right of the figure, sectors like textile, wearing apparel, food products, furniture and agriculture

all have negative growth in real demand over 1997–2002. We find it quite remarkable that the

rapidly growing Chinese economy did not generate more domestic demand for its own tradable

goods over this period! Domestic demand should be treated as a viable alternative to exports as a

source of employment growth, but did not function in that way, presumably because the income

gains in China did not lead to a commensurate rise in consumption. Aziz and Cui (2007) argue
10
     For convenience we omit the petroleum and mining sectors in Figure 3, as well as several other smaller sectors.
                                                 19

that one reason for this outcome is that household income did not rise by as much as GDP.

       That estimate for rising employment due to non-traded goods can be combined with the

fall in employment in tradable goods, to obtain a total implied change in employment of 111–50

= 61 million workers (prediction 3, part C). That is our final estimate for 1997-2002. In principle,

this estimate of 61 million jobs added over 1997-2002, from both domestic demand and exports,

should equal the actual gain in employment of 39 million jobs. The discrepancy between these

numbers (25 million) can be due to multiple causes: we have not been able to distinguish

domestic demand by firm-ownership or province; we have used a fixed 2000 IO table; and the

wage data we use is not as detailed as we would like. But we feel that even if these improvement

were made to our calculations, the overall message of Table 7 would not change: the vast

majority of job growth over 1997-2002 is due to the increase in demand for non-traded goods,

especially the construction sector. The main reason that employment has grown as much as it has

in China over 1997-2002 is due to the increase in domestic demand for non-tradable goods!

       Furthermore, it is important to recognize that our final estimate of 61 million job gained

over 1997–2002, from prediction 3, is vastly better than our initial calculation of 216 million

jobs (prediction 1, part C). Comparing these two numbers, we see that the initial calculation is

reduced by 72% due to the adjustments we have made. That is nearly the same adjustment (75%)

that we found in the previous section for processing trade, but larger than the adjustment (45%)

that we found for ordinary exports. It is noteworthy that a downwards adjustment of 45% is

shown in Table 7 for the nontradable sector, where the employment gains were reduced from 203

million in our initial calculation to 61 million (prediction 3). The fact that total employment

generated from domestic demand is revised downwards by nearly 75% reflects the very weak

growth in demand for tradable goods, leading to negative employment gains once we account for
                                                         20

the industry composition of demand and wage increases over time. In other words, the “Denison

effect” operates very strongly in the pattern of domestic demand for tradable goods, as we have

already seen for exports.11


7. Implied Growth in Employment Once Again

         Let us now summarize what we have learned from the last three sections, and return to

the calculations of employment growth. In Table 8 we show again the static employment

coefficients for 2000 (our calculations) and 2002 (from Lau et al, 2006a,b). We found in section

2 that those coefficients vastly overstate the actual change in employment over 1997–2002 or

2000–2005. But by using improved calculations, we were able to reduce the predicted

employment growth. Our final calculations showed that the employment growth for ordinary

exports was 55% lower than obtained from the static employment coefficients, while that

employment growth from processing exports and domestic demand were 75% lower (and

possibly more). We apply those rules of thumb to the initial static employment coefficients to

obtain revised employment coefficients, as shown in Table 8.

         For example, instead of the initial calculations for the 2000 IO table, we now predict that

$1000 in ordinary exports generates 0.44×0.45 = 0.20 person-years of employment, while $1000

in processing exports or domestic demand generates 0.13×0.25 = 0.03 and 0.53×0.25 = 0.13

person-years, respectively. For 2002, we now predict that $1000 in ordinary exports generates

0.36×0.45 = 0.16 person-years of employment, while $1000 processing exports of domestic

demand generates 0.11×0.25 = 0.03 and 0.44×0.25 = 0.11 person-years, respectively. These



11
   Note that in Figure 3, the industry with tradable-good industry with the highest percentage increase in domestic
demand is instruments and office machinery, followed by electronic and telecommunication equipment. The latter
industry has among the highest wage of any tradable industry, and also shows the highest percentage increase in
exports (both for ordinary and processing exports).
                                                         21

estimates are upper-bounds, since we obtained lower employment impacts in some calculations,

but we shall use these adjustments as conservative.

         We use the revised employment coefficients in Table 8 to re-calculate the employment

gains for both periods, as shown in Table 9. For 1997–2002, we find that the growth in domestic

demand (for nontradable goods, in particular), leads to an increase in employment of 67 million

workers. In addition, the growth in exports (for ordinary exports, especially), leads to an increase

in employment of 12 million workers, or about 2.5 million workers per year. Summing over

domestic demand and exports, we predict employment gains of 79 million from 1997–2002, as

compared to the actual employment increase of 39 million.12 So our prediction is still twice as

big as the actual gain, but that is a great improvement over our initial calculation (Table 4) where

the predicted employment gain was 216 million – more than five times greater than the actual

increase! The gap between our revised employment gain over 1997–2002 and the actual is due to

                                    j
the fall in the labor coefficients BLit from the IO table, reflecting technological progress and

capital accumulation.

         In later period, 2000–2005, the growth in domestic demand and exports are both stronger.

We again use the revised employment coefficient from Table 8 for 2002, and multiply those by

the real changes in domestic demand and exports. We find that the growth in domestic demand

(especially investment), leads to an increase in employment of 114 million workers. In addition,

the growth in exports adds employment of another 38 million workers. By coincidence, the

predicted employment impact of exports is nearly exactly equal to the actual rise in employment

of 37 million workers, or 7.5 million per year.

12
     Note that the predicted employment gains in Table 9 are not exactly the same as the final row of Table 7,
because in Table 9 we are using the rules of thumb shown in Table 8 to reduce the static employment coefficients,
i.e. the coefficient for ordinary exports is reduced by 55%, and the coefficients for processing exports and domestic
demand are reduced by 75%. Those rules of thumb are broadly consistent but not identical to the calculations in the
final row of Table 7.
                                                22

       However, the role of domestic demand over 2000–2005, which added 114 million to

employment is actually three-times large than the role of exports. Based on that evidence, we

could not refute the claim that domestic demand is responsible for the employment increase.

Whether we want to claim that it is domestic demand or exports that are responsible is really just

an exercise in semantics, however: the fact is that both have played an important role in

stimulating employment growth, and the sum of them (152 million) is still considerably larger

than the actual employment gains (37.4 million) over this period. Again, we would attribute the

gap between the predicted and actual employment gains as due to technological progress and

capital accumulation, as well as illustrating the limits of how far we can push our calculations

from the IO table. We have made a substantial improvement over the initial calculations, whose

predictions were off by an order of magnitude, but still have not obtained a precise accounting of

the causes of employment growth.


8. Conclusions

       Dooley et al (2003, 2004a,b,c) argue that the current systems of current account

imbalances is sustainable so long as China is willing to absorb the Treasury bills used to finance

the U.S. deficits. And that willingness is tied to its desire to move workers from unproductive

rural employment into urban, manufacturing jobs. These authors suggest that China needs to re-

employ some 200 million persons from the countryside, or 10-12 million persons per year in the

urban areas, and that growth in exports will explain about 30% if these employment gains.

       We have evaluated this hypothesis by using calculations on the employment impact of

exports, and domestic demand, from Chinese IO tables. We have started with the calculations of

Lau et al (2004, 2006a,b) for 1995 and 2002, and added our own calculation for the 2000 IO

table. The “static employment coefficients” obtained from these tables summarize the amount of
                                                23

employment generated by $1000 in exports or domestic demand for one year. By construction,

these static employment coefficients are consistent with the full-employment condition for the

economy. But the static employment coefficients do a very poor job at predicting the future

growth in employment from the future growth in exports or domestic demand. We have shown

that the errors involved in this forward-looking forecast are enormous, which means that the

static employment coefficients are highly unreliable for that purpose.

       To improve on that situation, we have proposed adjustments to the static employment

coefficients. These adjustments take into account the future growth in export and domestic

industries, which may be quite different from their former growth, as well as rising wages over

time. The adjustments partially close the gap between predicted and actual employment growth,

even when using an IO table for a single year. Using the revised employment coefficients, we

find that export growth over 1997-2002 explains at most one-third of the total employment

growth in the economy (2.5 out of 7.5–8 million workers per year). For 2000–2005, however,

export growth was faster, and in principle can explain the entire employment growth of 7.5

million workers per year. However, the rise in domestic demand – especially for investment –

generated employment gains that are three-times larger than those for exports, which confirms

the relative importance of exports as compared to domestic demand suggested by Dooley et al

(2004b). The same amount of employment is reduced by productivity growth in the economy, so

the net gain is back to 7.5 million workers per year, somewhat less than the goal put forth by

Dooley et al (2003, 2004a,b,c).

       The other key finding is that over 1997–2002, the rise in domestic demand was nearly

entirely in the nontradable sector: predicted employment for tradable goods actually fell. This is

very surprising, but reflects the shift in expenditure in China towards construction projects as
                                                24

well as nontradable consumer goods. We do not have the detailed data to evaluate whether the

same shift occurred during 2000–2005, but from the aggregate GDP data, there has been

substantially faster growth in investment I instead of private and public consumption C+G. So

we speculate that domestic demand for tradable goods continues to lag, despite the newspaper

reports of rising consumer expenditures; this view is also put forth by Aziz and Cui (2007), who

point to the slow growth in household income as an explanation.

       The importance of this finding is that China could certainly turn towards domestic

demand instead of export (and consumer expenditures, in particular) as an engine to stimulate

employment. The transition from export-led growth to domestic demand would undoubtedly rely

on many economic and policy actions that are now only beginning: a real appreciation as the

prices of non-tradable goods begin to rise, shifting domestic demand towards both imports and

exportable goods; accompanied by some nominal appreciation of the yuan; fiscal policies that

allow for greater security of income in old age, allowing higher expenditures today; reform of the

banking sector; etc. Readers are referred to Aziz (2006), Aziz and Dunaway (2007), and

Anderson (2007) for further policy discussions. We believe that it is these features – and not the

reliance on export-led growth – that should determine the future path of the government and

trade accounts in China and ultimately restore greater balance to these accounts.

The structure of China’s extended IO table separates domestic input from ordinary and

processing imported inputs. The direct input requirement coefficient matrix is presented in

Figure A1, where:


•    A DD , A DO , A DP are the matrixes of direct input requirement of domestic products for one
    unit of domestic product, ordinary export, and processing export, respectively.
•    A MD and AOO are the direct input requirement coefficient of ordinary import for one unit
    domestic production and ordinary exports;
•    A PP is the direct processing import requirement coefficient of producing one unit processing
    export;
•    AVD , AVO , and AVP are each an 1 × n vector of direct value added caused by one dollar of
    sector j ’s production in domestic products, ordinary export, or processing exports;
•    ALD , ALO , ALP are correspondingly the direct labor demand generated by one dollar
    production of domestic products, ordinary export, or processing exports.
•   E O and E P are each an n ×1 vector of ordinary export and processing export respectively.


Total Value Added (VA) Coefficient Matrix

       To calculate the total economy value added, we must consider the linkages between

sectors. When one unit domestic product is produced, it generates a first round of value added,

which is the direct value added AVD . However, in order to produce this unit of domestic product,
                                                                26

intermediate inputs must be used. The production of these intermediate inputs hence create the

second round of value added, which is named indirect value added ( AVD ⋅ A DD ). This process of

creating indirect value added can continue on and on, as intermediate inputs are needed to

produce other intermediate inputs. Therefore, the total domestic VA induced by a unit domestic

production is the sum of first round direct domestic VA and all the indirect domestic VA. Hence,

we derive the total domestic VA coefficient ( BVD ) aroused by domestic production as:



        BVD = AVD + AVD ⋅ A DD + AVD ⋅ A DD ⋅ A DD + AVD ⋅ A DD      (   )
                                                                         3
                                                                             +L
                    (
             = AVD ⋅ I − A     )
                             DD −1
                                                                                   (1)

       Similarly, producing one unit of ordinary or processing export products also requires

domestic made intermediate goods, which in turn generates many rounds of VA from these

domestic intermediate inputs. We thus have:


        BVP = AVP + BVD ⋅ A DP                                                     (2)

        BVO = AVO + BVD ⋅ A DO                                                     (3)

where BVi represents the total VA coefficient vector for production i, for i= D (domestic), O

(ordinary), and P(processing) respectively.


       For the same reason, total import content caused by Domestic Production and exports are:

                        (
        BMD = i ⋅ A MD ⋅ I − A DD        )
                                         −1
                                                                                   (4)

                                     (
        BMO = i ⋅ AOO + i ⋅ AMD ⋅ I − A DD    )   −1
                                                       ⋅ A DO                      (5)

                                     (
        BMP = i ⋅ A PP + i ⋅ AMD ⋅ I − A DD   )
                                              −1
                                                                                   (6)
                                                      27

        This is conceptually similar to the vertical specialization (VS) as in Hummels, Ishii and

Yi (2001) and Dean, Fung and Wang (2007).

Other Data

         In Table A2 we show the allocation of value-added to labor and capital, along with the

share of value-added within the sum of value-added plus imports used for each type of

production: domestic production, ordinary exports, and processing exports. For each type of

production, about one-half of value-added goes towards compensating labor, with the remainder

divided between capital income (one-third) and taxes on production (one-sixth). The amount of

value-added differs a great deal across type of production, however: it is 94% of the sum of

value-added plus imports used in domestic production, 62% for ordinary exports, and 20% for

processing exports.

         We have also confirmed that the employment levels in Table 1 are consistent with the IO

table itself, as described in Table A3. In the first column we list the economy-wide compensation

to labor from the various years of the IO tables, and in the next columns the real agricultural and

manufacturing wages (in US$, 2000). China employs one-half of its workers in agriculture and

one-half in manufacturing, so we take the simple average of these two wages to obtain the
                                                         29

average wage, which is $842 in 2000, for example. Dividing the labor compensation from the IO

table by the average wage, we obtain employment of 716.5 million persons in 2000, which is

very close to the 720.5 million persons reported in Table 1.

         For years before and after 2000, however, there is an inconsistency between the actual

employment figures reported by the China Statistical Yearbook, in the last column of Table 4,

and the implied employment obtained by dividing total compensation from the IO tables by

average wages from the China Statistical Yearbook, in the second-last column. Implied

employment even falls over 1997–2002, which does not seem believable. The problem appears

to be an inconsistency between the wage series we use (from the China Statistical Yearbook) and

the wages that are implicit in the IO tables, at least in 1997 and 2002.13 It is essential that the

implied employment from the IO table in each year equal actual employment in the economy. To

achieve this, we inflate the 1997 wages from the China Statistical Yearbook by 8%, and deflate

the 2002 wages by 4%, obtaining the revised wages reported in the bottom of Table 4. Those

adjusted wages lead to implied employment from the IO tables that is roughly equal to that

reported by the China Statistical Yearbook. We will continue to use this simple adjustment to

1997 and 2002 wages in all our calculations.




13
    For 2000, when we have the most complete IO table available, it lists both labor compensation and employment
at the end of the year. So the wages being used in the Io table can be computed, and they are highly consistent with
both the wages and actual employment figures used in Table 4 for 2000. For 1997 and 2002, however, the IO table
is less complete, and in particular, does not list employment so that implied wages cannot be computed.

Notes:
1. Average wage is the simple average of manufacturing and agriculture sectors. Source for wage data is the China
Statistical Yearbook, 2006.
2. Implied employment = real compensation from IO table / real average wage.
3. Actual employment data come from China Statistical Yearbook of each year.
4. The revised wage data multiplies 1997 wages by 1.08, and multiplies 2002 wages by 0.96 , so that the implied
employment is roughly equal to actual employment.
