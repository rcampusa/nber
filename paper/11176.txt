JEL No. I12, I18

                                           ABSTRACT

The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) between the major tobacco companies and 46 states

created an abrupt 45 cent (21%) increase in cigarette prices in November, 1998. Earlier estimates

of the elasticity of prenatal smoking implied that the price rise would reduce prenatal cigarette

smoking by 7% to 21%. Using birth records on 10 million U.S. births between January 1996 and

February 2000, we examined the change in smoking during pregnancy and conditional smoking

intensity in response to the MSA. Overall, adjusting for secular trends in smoking, prenatal smoking

declined much less than predicted in response to the MSA.

1. Introduction

       On November 23rd, 1998, the attorneys general for 46 states suing the major United

States tobacco companies reached the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) with the defendants

who agreed to pay the states $206 billion (Capehart, 2001). To finance the settlement, tobacco

companies immediately increased cigarette prices by 45 cents (21%) nationwide (Capehart,

2001). Cigarette prices rose another 42 cents over the following two years. The rise in prices

constitutes the most important smoking-related consequence of the MSA (Cutler et al., 2002;

Schroeder, 2004). We examine the effect on prenatal smoking of the unprecedented increase in

cigarette prices following the MSA.

       Two decades of research suggests that raising cigarette prices is an effective means of

reducing population smoking prevalence. Estimates of the price elasticity of smoking

participation range from -0.15 to -0.26 (Lewitt and Coate, 1982; Wasserman et al., 1991; Hu et

al., 1995; Farrelly and Bray, 1998). Specific populations, however, are known to be more or less

price sensitive (Chaloupka and Warner, 2000). Studies of pregnant women suggest that the price

elasticity of prenatal smoking participation is substantially higher than in the general population,

with estimates typically greater than -0.35 (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Gruber and Köszegi, 2001;

Gruber and Zinman, 2001; Ringel and Evans, 2001; Bradford, 2003; Colman et al., 2003), and

even as high as -1.83 (Lien and Evans, 2004).

       Evidence of smokers’ price responsiveness has made raising excise taxes a common

policy lever for reducing cigarette smoking. Between 1990 and 1998, the average retail price of a

pack of cigarettes rose from $1.53 to $2.18 and state and federal excise taxes combined increased

from an average of $0.39 to $0.63 (Orzechowski and Walker, 2003). The MSA provides an

opportunity to examine how a large, nationwide price increase affects prenatal smoking




                                                                                                   3
compared with the incremental changes in cigarette prices seen during the years preceding the

MSA.

       Prenatal smoking is the most important modifiable risk factor associated with low birth

weight (LBW; <2500g), contributing to an estimated 20% of LBW births (USDHHS, 1990). On

average, prenatal smoking is estimated to raise the odds of LBW by 20-230%, depending on

prenatal smoking intensity (USDHHS, 2001). Because over 520,000 babies are born annually to

women who smoke during pregnancy, changes in prenatal smoking warrant scrutiny in any

evaluation of the overall health impact of the MSA.

       In this paper, we use data from the National Vital Statistics System's Natality Detail File

to examine the effect of the MSA and its immediate 45 cent price increase on prenatal smoking

participation and conditional intensity of smoking for pregnant smokers. We compared smoking

related outcomes before and after the MSA and we estimated relative price regressions that

exploited the wide variation in the relative price change following the MSA to measure the

change in prenatal smoking behavior following the MSA. The majority of price elasticity

estimates suggest that the immediate price shock from the MSA would reduce prenatal smoking

by at least 7.4%. In the medium run, given an additional 42 cent price rise over the following

two years that is likely to be attributable, in part, to the MSA, one should expect an even larger

decline in prenatal smoking participation.

       Overall, pregnant women responded much less than expected to this unprecedented

increase in the price of cigarettes. Compared with the level of prenatal smoking participation

predicted by the secular trends leading up to the MSA, pregnant women reduced smoking by less

than 3%. Teenage mothers were the most responsive group, reducing smoking by just over 8%




                                                                                                     4
compared to that predicted by secular trends leading up to the MSA. The relative price models

yield no evidence of price responsiveness among our sample of pregnant women.

       The remainder of the paper will proceed as follows: in section 2, we describe in detail the

previous literature on cigarette prices and prenatal smoking; in section 3, we outline our

empirical specification for estimating the effect of the MSA net of secular trends during this time

period; in section 4 we present the results of our analysis of smoking trends before and after the

MSA, including two tests to determine whether our results are robust to important assumptions

in our specifications; in section 5 we describe and present estimates of the effect of differential

relative price changes on prenatal smoking behavior; and in section 6 we compare our estimates

to the prior literature and discuss potential explanations for the smaller than expected price

response.



2. Prior Research on Price Responsiveness and Prenatal Smoking

       Recent research on the response of pregnant women to cigarette price changes has

yielded disparate estimates of prenatal smoking elasticities (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Gruber and

Köszegi, 2001; Gruber and Zinman, 2001; Ringel and Evans, 2001; Bradford, 2003; Colman et

al., 2003; Lien and Evans, 2004). In the earliest such study, Evans and Ringel (1999) estimate

the price elasticity of prenatal smoking participation to be -0.50 by using a sample of 10.5

million birth records from the Natality Detail Files to identify the response of pregnant women to

within-state variation in excise taxes between 1989 and 1992. In a closely related article using

the same data for years 1989-1995, Ringel and Evans (2001) estimate that the overall price

elasticity of prenatal smoking participation is -0.7 and that the price response varies widely by

maternal race and education. Their findings suggest that the groups who would respond least to a




                                                                                                      5
tax change would be teenage mothers, Hispanic mothers, and those with less education. Both of

these studies exploit variation stemming from relatively modest cigarette tax changes, and thus

their elasticity estimates should be viewed as most reliable for predicting the response to

relatively small price changes. In a complement to this earlier work, Lien and Evans (2004),

again use the Natality Detail Files to evaluate changes in prenatal smoking in response to large

tax changes (between 14 and 50 cents ) in four states during 1993 and 1994. These estimates

yield state-specific prenatal smoking participation elasticities ranging from -0.10 in Illinois to -

1.83 in Massachusetts. Gruber and Köszegi (2001) and Gruber and Zinman (2001) estimated

prenatal smoking participation elasticities of -0.35 for pregnant women and -0.38 for pregnant

teenagers using Natality Detail Files from 1991-1997 and 1989-1996, respectively. Both of these

models use the same data as Evans and Ringel’s earlier work, and a similar specification

identifying the price effect based on changes in excise taxes. Using data from the National

Maternal and Infant Health Survey of 1988 and its 1991 follow-up survey, Bradford (2003) finds

a similar participation elasticity among pregnant women, -0.35. Notably, he finds no significant

difference between pregnant and non-pregnant women in the elasticity of smoking participation.

In related, but not directly comparable work, Colman et al. (2003) explicitly model the quitting

behavior of women smoking at the time of conception. Using the PRAMS database on 10 states

from 1993 to 1999, they estimate a price elasticity of quitting during pregnancy of about -1.0.

       Despite a growing body of work in this area, there is no consensus regarding the elasticity

of smoking during pregnancy, and little evidence on how these elasticities vary by the

characteristics of the mothers. This ambiguity in the literature leaves gaps in knowledge about

the potential effectiveness of excise taxes or other price-related policy tools to reduce prenatal

smoking. The MSA provides a useful natural experiment that allows us to test the elasticity of




                                                                                                       6
prenatal smoking during a recent time period, and in response to a large national price change.

The MSA allows us to ask, does a large price increase (over 21%) change the smoking behavior

of pregnant women in the late 1990s, and if so, how does the price elasticity of smoking

(participation and intensity) vary by demographic characteristics?



3. Empirical Methods

       We examined trends in prenatal smoking before and after the MSA, allowing for changes

in both the level and the trend in prenatal cigarette smoking at the time of the MSA. We estimate

an implied elasticity based on this overall pre-post MSA specification.



The MSA as a Natural Experiment

       The MSA created a natural experiment by subjecting the United States’ population to a

sudden, 45 cent per pack increase in cigarette prices. As discussed more fully in Cutler et al.

(2002), the factors leading to the settlement and the subsequent price rise had more to do with the

legal environment and the tobacco companies’ fears of a large award and future litigation than

with a sudden, discrete change in smoking attitudes. To show the abrupt nature of the price

change, Figure 1 presents the average annual retail price of a pack of cigarettes (including excise

taxes and adjusted for inflation to 1999 dollars) from late 1995 to early 2000 (Orzechowski and

Walker, 2003). Monthly retail price data are unavailable, so we also present monthly wholesale

prices (USDA, 2004), (including excise taxes but excluding generic brands) to illustrate the

sharp increase in prices following the November 1998 MSA. The monthly wholesale prices

demonstrate the abrupt price change we use to identify pregnant women’s response to the MSA.

The figure also clearly demonstrates how average retail prices continued to rise in the two years




                                                                                                    7
following the MSA. We compare the rate of prenatal smoking and the trend in this rate before

and after the MSA, attributing only the immediate price change (a 45 cent increase in November,

1998) to the MSA since that is the portion of the price change most clearly linked to the

settlement. Assuming that any non-price effects of the MSA really do not affect pregnant

women during our period of study, we will estimate an upper bound for the price response of

pregnant women following the MSA. Our estimate is an upper bound because we attribute

changes in behavior to the immediate 45 cent price change that accompanied the MSA,

excluding the additional rise in cigarette prices that occurred in the subsequent months.



Data and Sample Characteristics

       Smoking and demographic data were obtained from the 1996-2000 Natality Detail Files

(NCHS, 1996-2000). These files, generated from birth records, include all births within the

United States during that time period. We restricted the study data to infants conceived between

January 1996 and February 1998 and between December 1998 and February 2000, defining

conception date using reported gestational age. We excluded conceptions between March 1998

and November 1998 because these pregnancies may have been affected by the MSA for only a

portion of their term. We end the study period in February 2000 because infants conceived

beyond this date were mostly born in 2001, and we wished to limit our follow-up to a period

when the price effects of the MSA would be strongest. In addition to the price change, the MSA

stipulated that tobacco companies reduce specific kinds of advertising and allocate a portion of

the settlement monies to a foundation funding anti-tobacco advertising, among other things.

These other policy changes did not take effect immediately and they likely had little impact on

prenatal smoking during our study period (Chaloupka and Warner, 2000; Cutler et al., 2002;




                                                                                                   8
American Legacy Foundation, 2004), so we ascribe all observed effects of the MSA to the price

change.

       We restricted the sample to singleton births delivered by mothers aged 15-44. Because

California, Indiana, South Dakota, and parts of New York outside of New York City did not

report smoking, we excluded these births (20% of the nation) from our analyses. Records with

incomplete birth weight, smoking, and demographic data were excluded.

       Of the 10,029,081 singleton births to women 15-44 years old in our study states and time

period, 9,638,863 (96%) had complete data on the outcomes and covariates of interest. Table 1

shows that most single variables had missing data for fewer than 2% of the observations. Our

sample restrictions resulted in a sample of mothers with slightly better outcomes than the

complete population of pregnant women. The smoking rate among women in our sample was

12.1%, the median birth weight was 3,374g, and the rate of LBW was 6.0% while the smoking

rate in the complete population of pregnant women in 1998 was 12.9% (NCHS, 2003), the

median birth weight was 3,350g, and the rate of LBW was 7.6% (NCHS, 1998). Demographic

characteristics for mothers in the pre-MSA period were very similar to those in the post-MSA

period, though there were slightly more Hispanic mothers and fewer white mothers in the post-

MSA period (Table 1).



Empirical Specification

       We estimated the effect of the MSA on two outcomes – prenatal smoking status and

conditional smoking intensity (smokers’ number of cigarettes smoked per day) – by examining

them before and after November 1998. For smoking status, where the outcome is binary, we

estimated linear probability models so that the model coefficients would be directly interpretable




                                                                                                 9
and so that the time trends would be linear on the probability scale. Our large sample size assures

that our data sufficiently approximate the assumptions necessary for ordinary least squares

regression. Estimates using maximum-likelihood logit models (not reported) were qualitatively

and quantitatively similar. We used ordinary least squares models to examine smokers’ number

of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy before and after the MSA.

       For each outcome, we estimated models of the following form:

          Yist = α + β1timet + β 2 PostMSAt + β 3timet * PostMSAt + γExciseTaxes st
                                                ′                     ′                             (1)
            + ϕMaternal Characteristicsist + δ 1 CalendarMontht + δ 2 States + ε ist .

To control for secular trends in smoking, the pre-post models included a linear time trend

variable, timet spanning the 50 months of our study period. We tested and rejected higher order

time trends. In each model, the effect of the MSA was assessed using a binary variable,

PostMSAt, equal to 1 for all births conceived after the MSA, to capture changes in the level of

the outcomes, and an interaction between PostMSAt and timet to estimate the change in trend

following the MSA. The vector δ1 includes a set of calendar month effects to control for known

differences in the composition of births at different times of the calendar year, and the vector δ2

includes a set of state fixed effects to control for time-invariant differences in smoking across

states. Our Maternal Characteristics included maternal race, educational attainment, age, parity,

prenatal care, marital status, prior preterm birth, alcohol consumption, and infant gender. Each

was coded categorically as shown in Table 1. Maternal characteristics, including smoking and

alcohol consumption, were self-reported. Race/ethnicity categories were defined by the U.S.

Division of Vital Statistics. Finally, we controlled for state and federal excise taxes

(Orzechowski and Walker, 2003), adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index, urban

consumers series (USDL, 2003). Following several earlier studies, we linked observations in the

Natality Detail Files to cigarette excise taxes specific to the infant’s month of conception and the


                                                                                                    10
state where the birth occurred (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Ringel and Evans, 2001; Lien and

Evans, 2004).

       For each analysis, we modeled outcomes separately for three mutually exclusive

racial/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics), two categories

of educational attainment (high school degree or less and greater than a high school degree), and

two age groups (15-19 year olds and 20-44 year olds), as price-responsiveness may vary along

these dimensions (Farrelly and Bray, 1998; Chaloupka and Pacula, 1999; Chaloupka and

Warner, 2000; Ringel and Evans, 2001; USDHHS, 2001). All analyses assumed independence of

observations between, but not within states, and standard errors were adjusted to address

clustering within states, using methods suggested by Huber and White (White, 1980).



4. Trends in Prenatal Smoking Before and After the MSA

Changes in Smoking Prevalence

       Before discussing our regression results, we present raw data on prenatal smoking

prevalence during the years before and after the MSA to establish the trends in prenatal smoking

leading up to the MSA. Figure 2 displays annual prenatal smoking rates based on published U.S.

Vital Statistics data from birth certificates (NCHS, 2004). The figure shows a marked, relatively

linear decline in prenatal smoking between 1995 and 2001. This crude look at the data suggests

two things. First, our assumption of a linear trend in smoking rates over our study period

appears reasonable, a fact confirmed more rigorously in our models when higher order time

trends were rejected. Second, there is no discernible break in prenatal smoking trends at the time

of the MSA.




                                                                                                11
       Figure 3 displays raw smoking prevalence from our data as well as predictions from the

model of prenatal smoking trends. The dashed line presents the predictions assuming the pre-

MSA trend in prenatal smoking continued unchanged in the period after the MSA. The solid line

presents the model predictions based on the actual data following the MSA. It is clear that the

model fits the data well and that prenatal smoking following the MSA deviated only slightly

from the secular trend established before the MSA.

       The left-hand columns in Table 2 give the linear probability model coefficients for the

MSA effects, excise taxes, and the demographic covariates on which we ultimately stratified our

analysis. The probability of smoking during pregnancy declined by about 0.01 percentage points

per month during the period leading up to the MSA, dropped 0.3 percentage points at the time of

the MSA, and then continued to decline with no significant change in trend after the MSA. The

signs on the other coefficients are all as expected. Smoking declines with age for all mothers

over age 20. Smoking is most prevalent among women with some high school education but no

degree, and white women are substantially more likely to smoke than blacks, Hispanics, or

women of other racial and ethnic groups. These trends are similar for the conditional smoking

intensity estimates. Conditional smoking intensity during pregnancy declined by about 0.01

cigarettes/day per month prior to the MSA, dropped another 0.19 cigarettes/day at the time of the

MSA, and declined 0.02 cigarettes/day per month after the MSA.

       Table 3 shows how smoking behavior changed in relative terms following the MSA.

Overall and within most groups, the relative decline in smoking was under 3%. Mothers aged

15-19 were the exception to this trend. Their smoking rates declined by 6.32% 8 months after

the MSA, and 8.38% by 15 months after the MSA. These estimates imply an elasticity of

smoking prevalence of about -0.13 overall and -0.30 among teenagers, given the 21% price rise




                                                                                                  12
at the time of the MSA. These elasticities are lower than the prior estimates based on cigarette

excise taxes and using similar data from earlier during the 1990s. Table 4 shows analogous

estimates of the relative changes in smoking intensity (among prenatal smokers), and shows

comparable, small effects of the MSA. The relative decline in smoking was at or below 3%

within all groups at both 8 and 15 months following the MSA implying conditional smoking

elasticities of less than -0.14.



Testing the Sensitivity of the Time Trend Assumptions

        Because our pre-post analysis lacks a control group, our results rely on the assumption

that the secular time trends we estimated in the period before the MSA would continue after

November 1998 in the absence of the MSA. To address this potential limitation, we tested the

sensitivity of our results to alternative assumptions regarding smoking trends following the

MSA. The results above are robust to alternative assumptions regarding the trend in prenatal

smoking. Because we estimate relatively small effects of the MSA, any understatement of the

secular decline in smoking that would occur absent the MSA would suggest that the true impact

of the MSA was smaller than estimated, or near zero. We tested an alternative scenario, where

the secular trend in smoking reversed near the time of the MSA. In contrast to the estimated

decline in prenatal smoking of 0.12 percentage points per year before the MSA, the true secular

trend in smoking would have to be rising 0.33 percentage points per year following the MSA

before our estimate of the relative change in prenatal smoking reached -7.4%, the minimum

estimate based on national data in the earlier literature. Figure 2 further emphasizes how

dramatic this secular trend would be in light of several years of monotonically declining rates of

prenatal smoking in the years leading up to the MSA.




                                                                                                   13
Specification Check to Test the Assumption of Intertemporal Independence

       For computational reasons, we assumed that the εist were independent between states and

across time periods. However, we tested first-order autoregressive models for εist using

generalized least squares regression and data aggregated by state and month to gain insight into

how the assumption of intertemporal independence affected our analyses. We modeled the

outcomes as a function of the time and MSA variables and compared auto-regressive and

independence models. We find that, while we reject the independence assumption, the point

estimates for the MSA effects are quite similar in the two models, though the confidence bounds

on the effect of the MSA are 1.3 times wider under the autoregressive assumption.



5. The Effect of Relative Price Changes on Prenatal Smoking

       Any standard economic model of consumer demand implies that the relative size of the

price change accompanying the MSA should influence the expected impact of the MSA. The

relative change in cigarette prices following the MSA varied widely across states, ranging from

under 16% in Massachusetts to over 30% in Maryland. We exploit this variation in the relative

price change at the time of the MSA.

       We estimate models of the change in prenatal smoking in a given state as a function of

the relative change in cigarette prices due to the MSA and state excise taxes between fiscal year

(FY) 1998 (July 1997 through June 1998) and FY 2000 (July 1999 through June 2000). For

these models, the unit of analysis is the 1998 to 2000 change within a given state. To calculate

the relative price change during this period for each state, we used FY 1998 retail cigarette prices

as the baseline price. Then, for each state, we calculated the total of the change in excise taxes



                                                                                                     14
between 1998 and 2000 plus a constant 45 cent MSA effect. We used this total to create the

following modified 2000 price in each state:

                              ′
                    Price 2000 = Price1998 + ∆(excise taxes) 2000-1998 + 45 cents                   (2)

Thus, we are calculating the “plausibly exogenous” price change within a state, assuming that the

MSA price effect and state excise tax changes at this time are exogenous to underlying, within

state trends. Due to the absence of monthly retail price data, we used annual retail prices

(Orzechowski and Walker, 2003) and estimated models of the relative change in the state rate of

prenatal smoking participation and average conditional smoking intensity as a function of

relative price changes. The models take the following form:

                       ⎛ Ys , 2000   ⎞        ⎛ Price         ′⎞
                    ln⎜⎜             ⎟ = β1 ln⎜       s , 2000 ⎟
                                     ⎟        ⎜⎜ Price         ⎟ +εs ,                              (3)
                       ⎝ Ys ,1998    ⎠                 s ,1998 ⎟
                                               ⎝               ⎠

where s indexes state of birth. In this framework, we would expect β1 to be negative in sign.

That is, for a higher relative price rise, we expect a greater relative decline in smoking. We

weighted each state-level observation by the total number of births in that state in 1998 and 2000

combined.

       We plot each state’s relative changes in smoking prevalence and relative price changes in

Figure 4. As seen in the scatter plot, and confirmed in our regression models, the impact of

relative price changes on prenatal smoking prevalence was indistinguishable from 0. In fact, our

estimates of β1 were positive. The coefficient and standard error for β1 in the prevalence models

were 0.3136 and .3302 respectively. The same figures from the conditional smoking intensity

model were 0.1041 and .2630. Given Figure 4 and the large standard errors on our estimates, we

infer that there is no discernible relationship between relative price changes in this set up. If

anything, the positive coefficients may pick up a spurious relationship between changes in state


                                                                                                    15
excise taxes and prenatal smoking trends in the underlying state population. This casts doubt on

the usefulness of treating state excise tax changes as exogenous.



6. Conclusions

       In a study of over 9 million births before and after the MSA, the effect of the MSA on

prenatal smoking was much smaller than expected. Based on repeated cross-sections of births

during a period before and after the MSA, we estimated a -2.65% change in prenatal smoking 15

months after the MSA. This estimate was less than 40% of the change one might expect given a

price elasticity of prenatal smoking of -0.35, the lowest national estimate reported in earlier

studies (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Gruber and Köszegi, 2001; Gruber and Zinman, 2001; Ringel

and Evans, 2001; Bradford, 2003; Colman et al., 2003; Lien and Evans, 2004). The difference

between the observed change in prenatal smoking and the change implied by earlier estimates is

even more remarkable given that cigarette prices continued to rise dramatically following the

initial 45 cent price hike in November 1998, at least in part due to the MSA.

       There are three plausible and potentially concurrent explanations that might reconcile our

results with those in earlier studies. First, the composition of women who smoked during

pregnancy during the time period we study may differ from women who smoked during earlier

years. By 1997, there was wide public awareness of the health risks of smoking and rapidly

rising cigarette prices. Prenatal smoking was falling rapidly in the early 1990’s but the decline

slowed in the years leading up to the MSA. Thus, the women still smoking during pregnancy in

November 1998 may be particularly intransigent. This story is consistent with findings in

Gruber and Köszegi (2001) and Gruber and Zinman (2001), where pregnant women showed less




                                                                                                    16
price response than when elasticities estimated using sales data, a measure of tobacco

consumption overall. We think this offers a partial explanation of the results we observe.

       A second explanation that reconciles our results with earlier studies is that previous

studies in this area could be confounded by unobserved trends or policy changes within states.

Most studies of the impact of tobacco prices on smoking have focused on changes in state

tobacco excise taxes over time (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Gruber and Köszegi, 2001; Gruber and

Zinman, 2001; Ringel and Evans, 2001; Colman et al., 2003). During certain time periods, excise

tax increases have been endogenous with the environment of a given state. Kubik and Moran

(2003), analyzing cigarette consumption data between 1955 and 1997 find that a state’s tobacco

excise taxes tend to go up in years following increases in the state’s tobacco consumption.

       Several other unmeasured state-level changes may have coincided with these tax

increases, so that changes in prenatal smoking that were attributed exclusively to higher cigarette

prices may actually have been caused by multiple factors. For example, legislators may have

implemented tax changes as a response, at least in part, to changing attitudes towards smoking in

their states. Furthermore, there may have been other tobacco control measures, such as

restrictions on smoking in public places, which were implemented at the same time as the tax

increases. Therefore, it is possible that the large price effects estimated in prior studies may be

better attributed to a combination of changes in attitudes, policies, and prices. Indeed, Lien and

Evans (2004) deliberately interpret their results as evidence of a response to all anti-tobacco

policy and not just a price response.

       Finally, most of the earlier studies (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Gruber and Köszegi, 2001;

Gruber and Zinman, 2001; Ringel and Evans, 2001; Bradford, 2003; Colman et al., 2003)

analyzed the effects of small changes in state taxes or prices. It may not be appropriate to




                                                                                                      17
extrapolate the effects of incremental changes to cases of large price increases. Lien and Evans

(2004) focus their work on larger tax changes in four states, and their elasticity estimates were

highly variable across states, ranging from -0.10 in Illinois to -1.82 in Massachusetts.

       At first glance, our findings seem discrepant with national cigarette sales data in the

immediate wake of the MSA. Estimates by Cutler et al. (2002) suggest that national cigarette

sales fell by 6.5% in the year following the MSA, which implies a demand elasticity of -0.33,

within the range of prior elasticity estimates. However, in Figure 5 we present smoking rates for

women of child bearing age, older women, and all men from the National Health Interview

Survey between 1997 and 2000. These data show that at the time of the MSA, 1998-1999,

smoking rates dropped substantially for everyone but women of childbearing age. Both our

estimates and those of Cutler et al. are consistent with the NHIS data in Figure 5.

       Although the MSA had a smaller than expected effect on smoking for most pregnant

women, we found the greatest reductions in prenatal smoking following the MSA occurred

among teenage mothers. Preventing smoking initiation among the young is believed by many to

be the most effective way to reduce smoking-related morbidity and mortality in the long term

(USDHHS, 1994; Wechsler et al., 1998; Bauer et al., 2000; Gruber and Zinman, 2001). Even if,

as some suggest, increasing prices delays rather than prevents teen smoking (Glied, 2002), short

term price-induced reductions in teen smoking may have important consequences for birth

weight outcomes.

       Our study has several limitations. First, because the post-MSA price increase was

nationwide, no control group was available. However, secular trends in prenatal smoking would

have to have shifted dramatically upwards before our estimate of the relative change in prenatal

smoking 15 months after the MSA reached -7.4%. In addition, we believe the most likely non-




                                                                                                    18
price factor concurrent with the MSA that would also have affected smoking is negative

publicity about both smoking and the tobacco industry, a factor which would reduce smoking.

Any non-price factors that decreased tobacco use would suggest that the price effect is even

smaller than what we have estimated.

       Second, maternal self-reports of smoking on birth certificates may be inaccurately low

due to social desirability bias. Colman et al. (2003) show that the Natality Detail Files have

lower reported smoking prevalence than the PRAMS database. Even if there were untruthful

reports of prenatal smoking status, our results will not be biased provided such inaccuracies are

not associated with price-responsiveness or time period. We have no reason to believe the

accuracy of self-reported smoking changed substantially between earlier studies using the

Natality Detail Files (Evans and Ringel, 1999; Gruber and Köszegi, 2001; Gruber and Zinman,

2001; Ringel and Evans, 2001; Lien and Evans, 2004) and this study, nor that the accuracy of

self-reported smoking changed during the course of the this study.

       Lastly, several states, constituting approximately 20% of births in the United States

population, were excluded. Our findings may not be representative of those populations. Four

percent of the women meeting our selection criteria were excluded because of missing data. As

missingness was similar before and after the MSA for all variables, it is not expected to bias our

results with respect to the impact of the MSA.

       In summary, the sharp rise in cigarette prices following the MSA had little effect on

smoking prevalence and intensity among most pregnant women, but the effect was slightly

stronger among pregnant teenagers. The overall modest change in tobacco use in response to a

large change in cigarette prices differs markedly from those implied by earlier estimates of the

price elasticity of smoking among pregnant women. Cigarette taxes are widely viewed as the




                                                                                                   19
most effective means of reducing tobacco use, capitalizing on the price-responsiveness of

smokers. The 2000 Surgeon General’s Report states that, relative to other interventions, taxation

both reaches more individuals and has a greater effect (USDHHS, 2000). Policy makers should

be aware that not all populations of smokers, and therefore not all smoking-related illnesses, will

be affected equally by cigarette price increases. Our findings suggest that among pregnant

women, excise taxes are less effective than previously believed.
