                                           ABSTRACT

Eight states established deposit insurance systems between 1908 and 1917. All abandoned the systems
between 1921 and 1930. Scholars debate the costs and benefits of these policy experiments. New data
drawn from the archives of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors demonstrate that deposit insurance
influenced the composition of bank suspensions in these states. In typical years, suspensions due to
runs fell. Suspensions due to mismanagement rose. During the penultimate year of each system, the
bank failure rate rose to an unsustainable height and the system ceased operations.

1. Introduction

       The savings-and-loan debacle of the 1970s and 80s stimulated research on deposit

insurance. Interest persists because of the institution’s international diffusion during recent

decades. Recently, the IMF endorsed a form of deposit insurance in its code of best practices

[Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache 2002 pp. 1377, Demirgüç-Kunt and Kane 2001 p. 3]. The

desirability of deposit insurance, however, remains controversial, particularly among economists

who have studied the history of deposit insurance in the United States.

       Between 1908 and 1917, eight states – Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Nebraska, South

Dakota, Mississippi, North Dakota, and Washington – established deposit insurance systems.

Within three decades, all discontinued operations. The experiences of these states influenced the

bankers, scholars, politicians, and pundits who wanted to reform America’s financial system

after the Great Depression. They believed the state deposit insurance systems had reduced bank

runs and that a similar nationwide system would protect the nation from banking panics in the

future. The advocates of deposit insurance won the debate in 1934, when Congress established

the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Today, economic historians paint a bleaker picture of

the state deposit insurance experience. The state systems encouraged risk taking, discouraged

prudence, and distorted the incentives of bank owners and managers. This moral hazard

weakened the financial system and raised bank suspension rates [Calomiris 1990 and 1992;

Alston, Grove, Wheelock 1990; Wheelock 1993; Wheelock and Kumbhakar 1995; Wheelock

and Wilson 1995; White 1981 and 1983]. The different opinions of those who study deposit

insurance today and those who analyzed it in the past might arise because those who studied the

issue then and now employed different methods and sources of evidence, and their particular

perspectives prevented them from seeing the entire picture.




                                                  1
       Our essay suggests this is the case. The five following sections substantiate this

supposition. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature and discusses the reasons that states adopted

deposit insurance. Section 3 describes the data on the causes of bank suspension drawn from the

archives of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Section 4 presents grouped logistic

regressions that show states with deposit insurance experienced banking panics in the years

immediately preceding the abandonment of those systems. These crises and exogenous economic

conditions accounted for almost all of the differences in average suspension rates between

insured and uninsured states. Section 5 presents multinomial logistic regressions indicating that

deposit insurance influenced the composition of bank suspensions. Deposit insurance reduced

suspensions due to causes discouraged by deposit insurance (called runs throughout this essay)

and increased suspensions due to causes exacerbated by the moral hazards of deposit insurance

(called mismanagement). The magnitudes of these effects were approximately equal. Section 6

discusses the implications of our estimates.

       During the 1920s, deposit insurance mitigated bank runs and engendered moral hazard.

These juxtaposed effects roughly balanced each other out. Deposit insurance, in other words,

altered the composition but not the quantity of bank suspensions. The exception was the

penultimate year of each deposit insurance regime, when bank suspension rates rose to

unsustainable levels and the system ceased operation.


2. Current Literature and Past Events

       Scholarly studies of the state deposit insurance systems of the early twentieth century

address two broad questions. What were the consequences of deposit insurance? Why did some

states establish deposit insurance systems while others did not?

       Answers to the first question are of two types. Before the Savings and Loan Crisis, the



                                                 2
conventional wisdom was that deposit insurance had salutary effects. Insurance reduced runs on

bank and enhanced the stability of financial intermediation [House Report No. 150, 73rd

Congress, 1934]. Insurance encouraged individuals to maintain larger deposit balances, which

increased the funds available to the financial system as a whole, expanded the amount of credit

available via unit banks (particularly in rural areas), reduced interest rates, and fostered economic

activity [Emerson 1934 pp. 241-2; Golembe 1960 pp. 188-9].

       The Savings and Loan Crisis forced economists to reexamine this issue. Cliometricians

concluded that deposit insurance subsidized risk-taking. Banks with insured deposits assumed

more risk than they would have otherwise [Calomiris 1990; Grossman 1992; Wheelock and

Kumbhakar 1995]. This moral hazard increased the likelihood of suspension for insured state-

chartered banks [Hooks and Robinson 2002; Wheelock 1992]. Membership in deposit insurance

systems was positively correlated with the rate of bank failures across states and among counties

within the state of Kansas, even after controlling for factors such as differing levels of

agricultural distress and aggregate characteristics of banks [Wheelock 1992; Wheelock and

Wilson 1995].

       These scholars also wondered why some states had established deposit insurance systems

while other states did not. Carter Golembe and Eugene White, among others, argue that bankers

lobbied for the establishment of deposit insurance to preserve the status quo, protect unit bankers

from competition, and insulate managers and owners from the ill-effects of erroneous decisions.

Bankers wanted such protection. Those whose negligence or malfeasance led to the collapse of

banks faced suits from creditors and prosecution for defalcation. Owners of bank shares

possessed double liability. Deposit insurance limited exposure to such claims. In other words,

deposit insurance was not adopted in the 1920s to promote the public good, but to serve interests




                                                  3
of bank owners and managers [Golembe 1960; White 1983].

         White [1983 pp. 198-204] presents econometric and qualitative evidence supporting this

political economy argument. States with laws favoring unit banks – such as low minimum capital

requirements and laws prohibiting branch banking – were more likely to establish deposit

insurance systems. Unit-banking states whose legislatures did not pass deposit insurance

legislation usually considered such provisions. In several instances, proposals for deposit

insurance failed by narrow margins. States with laws favoring larger banks – such as high capital

requirements and permissive statutes towards branch banking – did not adopt deposit insurance

and seldom seriously considered doing so.

         Curiously, White’s regressions reveal no correlation between the failure rate of state (or

national) banks and the adoption of deposit insurance. Figure 1 reveals why. Between 1908 and

1918, the decade when adoption was popular, suspensions rates in states that did and did not

adopt deposit insurance were low and similar. Statistical tests of means and variances cannot

distinguish the two distributions. This is true for both state and national banks, as Figure 2 shows.

The similarity of suspension rates before 1920 partially alleviates an econometric concern: that

states with higher suspension rates adopted deposit insurance and that the endogeniety of the

adoption decision biases upwards estimates of the effects of deposit insurance on suspension

rates. The pre-insurance experiences of the various states probably did not teach legislators in

some states that their banking systems were inherently vulnerable and thus needed deposit

insurance and in other states that their banking systems were inherently stable and thus in no

need of depositor protection.1

         Of course, politicians may have been forward looking. Legislators in states that adopted

1
    By inherently more vulnerable, we mean that the effect of adverse economic shocks would have been larger in




                                                        4
deposit insurance may have believed that their financial systems were more vulnerable to shocks

than the financial systems in other states. It is unlikely that they forecast the magnitude of the

shocks that would strike their economies in the next decade. The Dustbowl drought, World War

I, the realignment of the international financial system, the expansion of agriculture during the

1910s, and the contraction of agriculture during the 1920s surprised most people. Yet, if the

banking systems in states that adopted deposit insurance were inherently more vulnerable to

those shocks than were the banking systems in other states, estimates of the effect of deposit

insurance on bank suspension rates might be biased upwards.

        Recent research on the political economy of the agricultural frontier suggests such

concerns may be misplaced.2 Gary Libecap and Zeynap Hansen [2003] conclude that competition

to attract settlers propelled politics along the western edge of settlement at the turn of the

twentieth century [note that six of the eight deposit-insurance states lay along the agricultural

frontier]. The western states adopted an array of fiscal and regulatory policies designed to attract

migrants. One was deposit insurance, which encouraged the establishment of small banks in rural

areas and facilitated settlement. Farmers could not prosper in regions lacking access to credit.

These policies encouraged the expansion in the number of banks, the overexpansion of

agricultural production, and eventually degraded the topsoil over wide regions, leading to the

Dustbowl of the 1920s and 30s. In this vision of the past, a regression of suspension rates on

deposit insurance would capture both the direct and indirect effects of the insurance systems. The

direct effects included the influence of insurance on the behavior of bankers and depositors. The

indirect effects included the effect of farm credit on the expansion of agriculture, the erosion of

topsoil, and the ability of farmers to earn a living.


   the inherently vulnerable jurisdiction regardless of whether or not the jurisdiction adopted deposit insurance.

3. Data

         Our data come from archival and published sources. The archival evidence illuminates

the causes of bank suspensions. It comes from the Central Subject Files of the Federal Reserve

System. This section discusses when, where, why, and how the Board of Governors collected

this information; how we processed the materials; and issues important for interpreting empirical

work based upon this new and unique source. The previously published information illuminates

aggregate economic trends and shocks. Descriptions appear later in this section and in the

appendix.

         During the latter half of the 1920s, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors embarked on

an ambitious project: the creation of standard statistical reports for all banks operating in the

United States, both members of the Federal Reserve System and nonmembers, national and state,

public and private. Different divisions tackled portions of the problem. The Committee on

Branch, Group, and Chain Banking examined the issue of bank suspensions.

         In 1930, the committee began a retrospective study. The goal was to discern the cause of

every bank suspension in the United States during the preceding ten years. The plan was to

create a form on which relevant information could be compiled. This information included the

bank’s identity, characteristics (national, state, member of the Federal Reserve, town, county,

etc.), financial condition on the day of suspension and previous dates (assets, liabilities, surplus

and profits, paid-in capital, etc.), a description of the aftermath of suspension (reopened, merged,

liquidated, etc.) and financial details of the resolution, including the portion of the assets

recovered and repaid to creditors of various types. A facsimile of a portion of the form appears in

the data appendix. For every bank known to have suspended operations between 1 January 1921

2
    John Wallis communicated this conjecture to the authors at the 2003 Cliometrics Conference.


                                                        6
and 31 December 1929, the Committee filled in as much information as it could from records

available at the Board of Governors. Then, it sent copies of the forms to the Federal Reserve

District Banks. Accompanying memos instructed districts to check the information entered by

the committee, add information available in district records, fill out new forms for any suspended

banks missed by the committee, and forward the forms to the appropriate Federal Reserve branch

bank. The branch banks followed the same procedure, and then forwarded the forms to state

banking authorities. The state regulators repeated the process, and whenever possible, solicited

opinions from examiners and receivers who handled the case at hand. The goal was to get the

facts from objective individuals with intimate knowledge of each institution and to check and

recheck the information as the forms traveled down to the lowest levels of the regulatory

hierarchy and back up to the Board of Governors. To speed their work, clerks recopied

information of interest from original documents onto large columnar pads. Each row indicated

the cause of failure of an individual bank.

       Our data comes from those spreadsheets. The source has advantages. The spreadsheets

formed the foundation for a series of tables appearing in the committee’s report Bank

Suspensions in the United States, and thus, are consistent with the data often used by economic

historians to study this issue. Our source also has disadvantages. The summary spreadsheets

indicate only the state, legal status, date of suspension, and cause of suspension. Lack of bank-

specific explanatory variables, obviously, influences our analysis. The extant explanatory

variables are aggregated at the state and national level.

       To overcome this mismatch and prepare the evidence for analysis, we aggregate the data

on the causes of suspension to the state level. We lose no information in this process. Our

dependent variable (cause of suspension) is measured at the individual level (i.e. for each bank).




                                                  7
But, the independent variables are measured at the group level (i.e. for each state). In these

circumstances, the logit and multinomial logit models appropriate for the study of individual

bank suspensions are mathematically equivalent to grouped logit and multinomial models used to

study state-level suspension rates where the observations are weighted by the number of banks in

each state suspending operations due to each cause.

           We aggregate the dependent variable in the following manner. We categorized

suspensions into three classes. The first is suspensions due to reasons discouraged by deposit

insurance, which we often refer to as runs. The second is suspensions due to reasons encouraged

by deposit insurance, which we often refer to as mismanagement. The third is suspensions due to

neither reason. Summing for each state and year the number of suspensions in each class yields

our dependent variables. The computation is complicated by one consideration. A single

suspension could be attributed to multiple causes. Attributions occasionally include multiple

primary and multiple secondary causes. We weight all primary causes equally. We weight all

secondary causes equally. We place more weight on primary than secondary causes. The weights

sum to one. The results reported in this paper weigh primary causes four times as much as

secondary causes. We check the robustness of that assumption by varying the weight of the

secondary causes from zero to equality with primary causes. The variation does not change our

results.

           The definitions above clarify the dependent variable that we employ in Section 5. The

dependent variable that we employ in Section 4 is the log odds ratio of the aggregate state bank

suspension rate. We take this information from the Report of the Comptroller of the Currency.

Figure 1 displays state-bank suspension rates averaged for states with (DI) and without deposit

insurance (Non DI). It also indicates the years that states adopted and departed deposit insurance.




                                                   8
Our explanatory variables also come from published sources. Details appear in the data

appendix.

         A categorical variable indicates whether states possessed deposit insurance. Between

1907 and 1917, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Nebraska, Mississippi, South Dakota, North Dakota,

and Washington established such systems. All abandoned these regulatory regimes between 1921

and 1930. The systems were similar. All were funded via small assessments imposed on covered

deposits. Most imposed additional capital requirements on participating financial institutions. A

significant difference existed in only one dimension. The systems in Kansas, South Dakota, and

Washington were voluntary. Banks could choose whether to join. The systems in the other states

were compulsory.3

         The national-bank suspension rate proxies for economic forces influencing the fates of

state banks. The national-bank suspension rate is useful for several reasons. First, national banks

neither participated in statewide deposit-insurance schemes nor operated under state banking

regulations. Changes in national banking laws did not coincide with changes in state deposit-

insurance legislation. Second, interstate branch banking did not exist. National bank suspensions

were discrete events located in particular states. Third, national banks operated under a

nationwide regulatory system with a single, national currency. Identical rules applied in all

states. This common regulatory regime insures that differences in national-bank suspension rates

across states reflect differences in the economic forces that influenced banks’ fates. Fourth, the

economic forces that affected the fates of national banks also affected the fates of state banks.


3
    In Texas, banks had to choose between two compulsory systems. Banks could either join the Depositors Guaranty
    Fund, where they paid in annually 1 percent of their average daily deposits, or the Bond Security System, where
    they posted a bond of indemnity equal to their capital with a surety company. Even though banks had the
    freedom to choose one of the two plans, they do not have a choice between joining and not joining the system.
    Hence, the classification of Texas could go either way.



                                                         9
Neither type could survive sizeable losses on loans or incessant withdrawals of deposits. Both

types had to earn profits. Revenues depended on interest earned on investments and rates of loan

repayments. Costs depended on rents, wages, and interest paid to depositors. Fluctuations in

those factors influenced the bottom line of all banks. So, fluctuations in suspension rates of

national banks reveal a great deal about changes in economic conditions affecting state banks.

Fifth, direct information on general economic conditions does not exist. National income

accounts begin in 1929. Estimates for earlier periods are in dispute. Only scattered data exists on

income, investment, employment, consumption, and business conditions at the state level. Most

extant evidence comes from highly volatile sectors that surely interacted endogenously with bank

behavior. Even that information is sparse and imprecise. The national-bank suspension rate

serves as a substitute for that information. It is a useful measure of state-specific conditions,

provides a base line for interstate comparisons, and reflects the magnitude of shocks affecting the

financial system in each state.

       The national-bank suspension rate also enters the regression directly. Our data reveals

that failures of national banks often directly affected state banks in their communities. National

banks served as correspondents of state banks. The suspension of national bank correspondents,

particularly when unexpected, caused difficulties for downstream state institutions. The state

banks lost their links to the wider financial system and portions of their legal reserves. They had

to suspend operations. In addition, the suspension of national banks appears on some occasions

to have sparked withdrawals from and even runs on state banks in the vicinity. The failure of

national banks may have signaled to depositors the possibility of problems affecting the entire

banking system.

       Figure 2 displays the national-bank suspension rates averaged for states with (DI) and




                                                  10
without (Non DI) deposit insurance. Comparing Figures 1 and 2 reveals important patterns.

State-bank suspension rates in insured states exceeded those in uninsured states. National-bank

suspension rates in insured states also exceed those in uninsured states. So did other measures of

business and agricultural distress. These patterns suggest that differences in the fates of state

banks between insured and uninsured states were due in part or in whole to differences in

economic conditions.

       The national-bank suspension rate may understate one significant shock afflicting the

grain-growing regions of Middle America where there were many insured states. State banks

tended to have close links to local communities. Many loaned large portions of their portfolios to

agricultural interests. Farmers were the predominant holders of loans. National banks had closer

links to the business and financial communities. Their portfolios contained more industrial loans,

interbank deposits, and financial securities. Fluctuations in agricultural conditions probably had a

greater impact on state banks.

       To account for the differential impact of agricultural shocks, we employ two types of

evidence. First, the price of grain reveals returns from sales of crops. International grain markets

developed at the end of the 19th century. Supply and demand in the world as a whole determined

the prices of popular cereals such as maize, oats, and wheat. Aggregate supply depended upon

planting decisions of farmers throughout the world as well as the vagaries of the weather all

around the globe. Demand fluctuated along with demographic trends and tariff barriers. Those

fluctuations were exogenous to the banking systems of individual states. The data appendix

describes our sources for the prices of maize, oats, and wheat, the crops that comprised the

preponderance of produce in the grain-growing regions of the United States.

       Second, climatic conditions influenced yields of fields. Yields influenced farmers’




                                                 11
profits, repayment rates of agricultural loans, and the solvency of state banks. Previous scholars

measure yields directly, since data is abundant. We do not follow in their footsteps because

yields were not exogenous. Yields per acre, per worker, and on aggregate depended upon choices

of what and how much to plant on what type of land. Those choices varied according to credit

conditions, the willingness of bankers to extend loans on certain types of crops, and the ability of

farmers to diversify against risks. All of those factors depended upon decisions of financial

institutions. The component of yields that was undoubtedly exogenous to such decisions was

climatic conditions. An excellent indicator of the relevant information is the Palmer Drought

Index. The Department of Agriculture compiled the index from data on temperature and

precipitation at land stations scattered throughout each state. The Department of Agriculture uses

it as an indicator of conditions influencing yields of grain fields. We employ it because it is the

longest running consistently calculated series available. Details appear in the data appendix.


4. Grouped Logistic Methods and Results

       A natural way of analyzing the impact of deposit insurance systems exists. It is to

compare rates of bank suspensions in states that adopted deposit insurance and states that did not.

States that adopted deposit insurance are treatment states. States that did not are control states.

The empirical task is to compare suspension rates in treatment and control states, before and after

shifts in policy regimes, while controlling for exogenous forces that influenced suspension rates

and the endogeneity of policy changes. This section undertakes that task.

       Since the phenomena of interest are bank suspensions, which are discreet events, and the

independent variables are measured at the state level, the appropriate analytical framework is a




                                                 12
grouped logit model where the groups are the states.4 In this framework, the following formula

describes state-bank suspension rates:

(1)       SSRit = F (Yit φ SSR + NSRitψ + DI it γ + Z it λ + ∑ Aitsϕ s + ∑ Dits δ s + ε SSR ,it )

where SSRit is the state-bank suspension rate in state i in year t. Yit is an index of all exogenous

variables that influence state-bank suspension rates.5 NSRit is the national-bank suspension rate in

state i in year t. Note that some specifications also include the square of the national-bank

suspension rate. DIit is a dummy variable indicating the existence of deposit insurance in state i

in year t. The symbols         SSR,   ψ, and      represent coefficients on Yit, NSRit, and DIit respectively.

All of our regressions include constant terms, which for brevity we exclude from the formulas

above and below. Zit is a vector of additional explanatory variables, principally agricultural

prices, climatic conditions, state bank reserve requirements, state branch banking laws, and

region, state, and year fixed effects.            is a vector of coefficients for those variables.

          Aits     = 1 if deposit insurance is adopted in year t - s
                   = 0 otherwise

          Dits     = 1 if deposit insurance is abandoned in year t - s
                   = 0 otherwise

          s        = policy lead and lag indicator
                   = {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}

          The set of effects      s   and   s   controls for shocks occurring around the time of policy

changes and the endogeneity of regulatory decisions. This control is a crucial consideration

because states may have adopted deposit insurance during economic expansions and/or

abandoned deposit insurance after experiencing higher than normal suspension rates. Both

    In the absence of bank specific right-hand side variables, logits run on individual observations are mathematically
    equivalent to logits run on the grouped data.
5
    Assuming Yit as an index rather than a vector of all exogenous variables influencing state-bank suspension rates
    simplifies the algebra without altering the analysis.



                                                           13
situations may generate spurious correlations between policy regimes and suspension rates. So

can all other circumstances when temporary shocks to suspension rates influenced policy

decisions concerning deposit insurance. The set of effects             s   and   s   reveals these correlations

and distinguishes them from the typical impact of deposit insurance. The dummy variables that

determine these effects, Aits and Dits (for adoption of deposit insurance and departure from

deposit insurance respectively), extend three years before changes in deposit insurance regimes

and lag three years thereafter. Three years should have been long enough for shocks to induce

legislatures to change laws or for legal changes to take effect.6

         The national-bank suspension rate enters the regression directly as an exogenous

explanatory variable, and indirectly, as a substitute for the unobserved index of exogenous

explanatory variables. The national-bank suspension rate is itself a function of those variables.

(2)       NSRit = F (Yitφ NSR + ε NSR ,it )

where φ NSR represents the influence of the unobserved variable on the national-bank suspension

rate. Inverting (2), solving for Y, substituting the result into (1), and simplifying yields (3).

(3)                   (
          SSRit = F F −1 ( NSRit )φ + NSRit ϕ + DI it γ + Z it λ + ∑ Aitsϕ s + ∑ Dits δ s + ε it    )
where φ ≡ φ SSR / φ NSR and ε it = ε SSR ,it − φε NSR ,it . The formula for εit indicates that correlations

could exist between the error term and the independent variables. Estimates of coefficients could

be biased and inconsistent. A methodological appendix examines this issue. It employs

econometric theory and historical information about unestimable variances to show that our

regressions might slightly overestimate the impact of deposit insurance. Corrections to the

problem based on instrumental variables and the method of group averages indicate that the bias,

which appears to be positive as theory suggests, is small and insignificant in practice.7

           Now, denote all of the explanatory variables with the matrix Xit. Denote all of the

corresponding coefficients with the vector β . Substituting these denotations into equation (3)

yields a shorthand that will be useful later.

(3´)        SSRit = F ( X it β + ε it )

F is the logistic function,

                         exp(⋅⋅)
            F (⋅⋅) =
                       1 + exp(⋅⋅)

Thus, equation (3) represents a standard logit model estimated on grouped data. Its linear form

is:

   ⎛ SSRit       ⎞       ⎛ NSRit       ⎞
ln⎜⎜             ⎟⎟ = ln⎜⎜             ⎟⎟φ + NSRitψ + DI it γ + ∑ Aitsϕ s + ∑ Dits δ s + Z it λ + ε it
   ⎝ 1 − SSRit    ⎠      ⎝ 1 − NSRit    ⎠

We estimate the linear form with weighted least squares. The weights equal Nit * SSRit (1-SSRit),

where Nit is the number of state banks in state i in year t.8

           Table 1 presents grouped logit estimations for the period 1909 to 1929. Column (1)

reveals the basic correlation between deposit insurance and the log odds of state-bank suspension

rates. On average, more banks suspended operations in places with deposit insurance than places

without those policies. Predicted values of the dependent variable clearly reveal this. The

predicted suspension rate in states with deposit insurance is 5.34 percent. The predicted

suspension rate in states without deposit insurance is 3.72 percent. Column (2) shows that

business conditions account for much of that difference. The log odds of the national-bank

suspension rate is practically and statistically significant. The coefficient on deposit insurance

falls by four-fifths and ceases to be statistically significant. The difference in predicted

suspension rates falls to a similar extent. This makes sense. National-bank suspension rates

tended to be higher in places with deposit insurance. Fluctuations in national-bank suspension

rates coincided with fluctuations in state-bank suspension rates. The correlation accounts for a

large portion of interstate differences in suspension rates. Together, columns (1) and (2) replicate

the conventional academic wisdom. They show that on average, state-bank suspension rates in

places with deposit insurance exceeded those in places without deposit insurance and most of the

difference was due to economic conditions.

        Column (3) includes variables that alter the conventional conclusion. The dummy

variables Aits and Dits yield the effects          its   and   its.   All of the former are statistically

insignificant, except for   it,0 and    it,1.   These are usually positive and significant. This pattern

indicates that state bank suspension rates did not differ between states before the adoption of

deposit insurance, and thus, that the decision to establish an insurance system was probably not

based on historical experience. State bank suspension rates rose briefly when states established

insurance systems and then returned to pre-insurance levels, perhaps because moral hazard

altered the incentives of marginal banks and induced them to fail. All of the later are statistically

insignificant, except for   it,-1 and   it,1,   which reveal that state-bank suspensions surged the year

before states abandoned deposit insurance and the crisis continued at an abated level until the

following year. The coefficient on         it,-1   explains the correlation between deposit insurance and

suspension rates observed by previous scholars. The correlation exists because states abandoned

deposit insurance after experiencing higher-than-normal suspension rates. This result is robust.

Changes in the specification do not alter it. The same is not true for the coefficient                      it,1.   Its




                                                               16
standard error rises rapidly under different assumptions, such as altering starting and ending

dates (this is apparent in the next table). The coefficient on deposit insurance itself yields the key

conclusion. Its standard error is large relative to the coefficient. Standard statistical tests cannot

distinguish it from zero. Its sign is negative, suggesting deposit insurance reduced state-bank

suspension rates during normal years, if it had any effect.

         Columns (4) and (5) test various aspects of our specification. All control for excluded

explanatory variables. Column (4) includes crop prices, climatic conditions, year and region

fixed effects, and interactions between the presence of deposit insurance and measures of

macroeconomic distress (e.g. the national bank suspension rate). We do not report the

coefficients on these control variables, since their magnitudes do not alter our conclusions, and

their size and significance varies depending on the specification. They do add information to the

regression. They reduce the standard errors of other variables including NSRit, probably because

the former contains information lacking in the latter. Agricultural conditions had differential

impacts on state and national banks. The F-statistic on the inclusion of agricultural and climatic

variables always exceeds the significant level with one revealing exception. When the

regressions are restricted to agricultural states, they become insignificant in statistical and

practical terms. The deposit insurance – macroeconomic distress interaction terms are positive,

suggesting that economic downturns raised bank suspension rates more in insured than uninsured

states, which Alston et al interpret as a symptom of moral hazard at work, but are statistically

insignificant in this (and most other) specifications.9

         Column (5) restricts attention to states with deposit insurance and their immediate

neighbors. This exercise fits well with our quasi-experimental framework. The economies of


9
    These variables resemble those pioneered by Alston, Grove, Wheelock 1994.



                                                       17
deposit insurance states closely resembled those of their neighbors. Agriculture and unit banks

dominated both. Column (5) also refines the indicator for geographic fixed effects. Dummy

variables are now included for each state. These dummies capture state-specific economic

conditions as well as design features of deposit-insurance systems unique to each state. These

changes have little influence on the result. The null hypothesis that the coefficient on deposit

insurance equals zero cannot be rejected. Difference-in-difference estimates (for brevity not

reported) yield similar results. They control for state-level fixed effects and reveal patterns that

substantiate our suppositions. Changes in economic conditions were highly correlated with

changes in bank suspension rates. Changes in deposit insurance regimes were not.

        Column (6) substitutes an instrumental variable for the log odds of the national bank

suspension rate. The instrument equals 1 for observations where the log odds exceeds its median

and –1 for all other observations. The inclusion of the instrument does not alter the signs and

significance levels of the key variables. This invariance indicates that correlations among shocks

to national- and state-bank suspension rates do not distort our estimates. Additional regressions

employing the method of group averages on the top and bottom thirds and top and bottom

quartiles of the national bank suspension rate support this supposition. So do regressions also

employing instruments for the national bank suspension rate and its square.

        Column (7) accounts for the endogeniety of deposit insurance via two stage least squares.

The first stage estimates the likelihood that each state possessed deposit insurance. The

independent variables in this probit are the log of the national bank suspension rate, the Palmer

drought index and its square, and an array of state characteristics such as farm size and proximity

to the agricultural frontier that influenced the types the patterns of legislation in those states (see

Libecap and Hansen 2003 for details). The second stage employs the predicted values from the




                                                  18
first stage in place of the actual values. The results are consistent with our other estimates. So are

the results of similar regressions employing as the first stage White’s models of states’ decisions

to adopt deposit insurance [White 1983 pp. 197-204]. Thus, controlling for endogeneity of the

policy regime in this manner does not alter our conclusions.

           Our results seem robust to the inclusion of endogenous variables, such as the deposit-base

of the average bank, or the average capital-asset ratio, or the average size of agricultural loans,

which appeared in previous papers on this topic. We have included such measures in various

versions of our regressions. They reduce the coefficient on deposit insurance, which one should

expect and which is consistent with our claims. We do not include those regressions in our tables

because they do not change our conclusions.

           Our results do not change when one considers characteristics of the various deposit-

insurance regimes. We have rerun all of our regressions with dummies distinguishing voluntary

and compulsory systems. That was the principal difference among the different schemes. In

every regression, the dummies for voluntary and compulsory insurance have the same signs and

significance levels.10 Tests for equality of coefficients never reject the null hypothesis that the

coefficients are the same. Tests for the equality of predicted suspension rates yield the same

result.

           Table 2 replicates these results for the period 1921 to 1929. This exercise is essential. It

provides a baseline to which we can compare the multinomial estimates in the next section,

where we must restrict our analysis to the 1920s, because data on the causes of bank suspensions

10
     In our regressions, the voluntary and involuntary systems appear identical. There are several possible reasons
     why. First, all systems were voluntary in a sense. State banks could opt out of deposit insurance by changing to a
     national charter. Second, the voluntary systems ceased operating before the involuntary systems. Thus, time
     dummy variables (and all other variables correlated with time) may obscure differences between the two types of
     systems. Third, dividing the DI systems into voluntary and involuntary groups reduces the number of




                                                           19
exists only for that period. Column (1) reveals the basic correlation between deposit insurance

and state-bank suspension rates. Suspension rates in states with deposit insurance averaged 6.40

percent. Suspension rates in states without deposit insurance averaged 3.81percent. The

difference, 2.59 percent, is greater than for the longer period (in Table 1) because the crises that

induced departures from deposit insurance occurred during the 1920s. Columns (2) through (7)

show the correlation between deposit insurance and state bank suspension rates diminishes or

disappears after accounting for economic conditions and the endogeniety of policy decisions.

These estimates can be compared to our multinomial estimates, which cover the same period.

        Tables 1 and 2 substantiate a simple but significant supposition. The stylized fact

emphasized by earlier authors - that states with deposit insurance had higher suspension rates

than states without – only applies to the penultimate years of each deposit insurance system. In

typical years, suspension rates in insured and uninsured states were statistically

indistinguishable, after controlling for differences in economic conditions. In the year before

each state abandoned its deposit insurance system, which we often refer to as the ‘crisis’ year,

however, suspension rates significantly exceeded average levels. This suggests that deposit

insurance had little effect on aggregate bank suspension rates during good times. Aggregate

effects are apparent only during crises so severe that states abandoned deposit insurance in the

subsequent year.

        Table 3 reinforces this result. The top half of the table examines our 1909 to 1929

estimates. The rows report average predicted state-bank suspension rates. The columns refer to

specifications (3) through (6) from the tables above. For each specification, the result is the

same. The insured-state suspension rate resembles the uninsured-state rate except during the year


  observations in each by roughly half and raises the standard errors accordingly. The sample sizes may be too




                                                       20
preceding departure. A two-sample test of means fails to reject the null hypothesis that the

insured and uninsured rates are identical. A two-sample test of means rejects the hypothesis that

the uninsured rate equals the suspension rate in insured states during years preceding departure.

The bottom half of the table examines 1921 to 1929. The results remain the same. The

suspension rate for insured states during normal years resembles the suspension rate in uninsured

states. But, the suspension rate in insured states exceeds the suspension rate in uninsured states

during crisis years. Specification (5), which is our most robust regression, illuminates this point.

The insured and uninsured suspension rates are statistically indistinguishable and much smaller

than the suspension rate during the crises preceding the collapse of deposit insurance.

        Figures 3 and 4 summarize our grouped logistic regressions. Figure 3 presents average

state bank suspension rates (as in Figure 1) with one difference. The deposit insurance average

no longer includes the observation for the year before each state abandoned deposit insurance.

For example, since Washington abandoned deposit insurance in 1921, the deposit insurance

average for 1920 no longer includes the observation for Washington. Excluding these ‘crisis’

years illuminates a pattern. In insured states, suspension rates of state and national banks in the

insured states fluctuated in tandem (e.g. compare Figure 3 to Figure 2). Figure 4 controls for

those patterns as well as for differences in agricultural conditions and for the ‘crisis’ preceding

the demise of each deposit insurance system. The figure plots predicted values from regression

(4) in Table 2 for deposit insurance states after for each state setting the values of their

agricultural prices, drought index, and national bank suspension rates equal to their eastern

neighbors and after setting the dummy variables for leads and lags of departures from deposit

insurance equal to zero. These predictions lie close to the average of suspension rates for


  small to distinguish subtle differences between the two types of systems.

uninsured states. The hypothesis that the means and standard deviations of the two series are

identical cannot be rejected at the 5percent or 1percent confidence levels. The peaks and troughs

differ slightly. The difference arises because the group of uninsured states contains observations

from dozens of states on the eastern and western seaboards, where the pattern of suspensions

differed from those in the cattle and grain economies in the center of the United States.


5. Multinomial Logistic Methods and Results

        The grouped logistic framework has a natural extension to data concerning the causes of

bank suspensions. The causes fall into three categories: those discouraged by deposit insurance,

abbreviated runs; those encouraged by deposit insurance, abbreviated mismanagement; and those

orthogonal to deposit insurance, abbreviated neither. We begin our analysis by specifying a
                                                                                       neither               runs                         mismanagement

categories.

In (4), the coefficients                and                       capture the relationship between the explanatory

variables and the composition of bank suspensions. We estimate these coefficients with

maximum likelihood via the Newton-Raphson method.

          Table 4 presents our estimates. Column (1) contains the basic correlations. The share of

bank suspensions due to runs was lower in states with deposit insurance than in states without

such systems. The share of suspensions due to mismanagement was higher in states with deposit

insurance than in states without such systems. When national-bank suspension rates rose, the

share of state-bank suspensions due to runs increased.11 When national-bank suspension rates

rose, the share of state-bank suspensions attributed to mismanagement fell. The latter correlation

stems from three facts. During good times, mismanagement was the preponderant cause of state-

bank suspensions. During bad times, banks failed for reasons other then their own incompetence,

although mismanagement remained a common contributing cause. Our index weights

contributing causes less than principal causes. The sign of the coefficient merely reflects that

fact. The first two correlations have implications that are clearer. Deposit insurance increased

suspensions due to mismanagement. This increase suggests the moral hazard induced by deposit

insurance weakened the foundations of the financial system. Deposit insurance reduced runs on

banks. This reduction indicates deposit insurance protected the financial system from panics,

although the protection may have been limited, as the remaining columns suggest.

     We know from Table 2 that a coinciding aggregate effect existed. Thus, when national-bank suspension rates
     rose, the number as well as the proportion of state banks suspended due to runs rose. In other words, the




                                                                  23
       Column (2) improves the precision of our estimates by controlling for shocks to the

agricultural economy and crises occurring around the years when states abandoned deposit

insurance. The results are illuminating. In states with deposit insurance, the share of suspensions

due to runs fell, and the share of suspensions due to mismanagement rose during most years. But,

in the penultimate year of each system, the share of suspensions due to runs increased. A panic,

in other words, engulfed each system just before it collapsed. In the years thereafter, the share of

suspensions due to mismanagement declined. The decline probably occurred for two reasons.

The banking crises weeded out institutions with the weak managements, and the disappearance

of deposit insurance increased incentives for careful management.

       Columns (3) through (6) control for excluded endogenous variables. Column (3) adds

two new explanatory variables. One is the share of national bank suspensions due to runs. The

other is the share of national bank suspensions due to mismanagement. The inclusion of these

variables has little influence on the signs and magnitudes of the key coefficients. Column (4)

adds dummy variables distinguishing calendar years. Their inclusion and interaction with other

variables has little influence on the results. The coefficients, standard errors, and predictions

remain roughly the same. Column (5) restricts attention to the eight states with deposit insurance

and their immediate neighbors. Again, the results remain roughly the same. Additional

regressions including dummy variables for regions and states (which we do not report)

corroborate these claims. All reveal coefficients with magnitudes and directions similar to our

previous work. Column (6) employs an instrumental variable for the log odds of the national

suspension rate. The instrument is the same as in the preceding section. The result is also the

same. The instrument neither alters the signs, magnitudes, nor significance levels of the other


  suspension of national banks coincided with and may have triggered runs on state banks.

explanatory variables. This invariance indicates that correlations among shocks to the national

and state bank suspension rates do not bias our estimates.

       Table 5 summarizes our multinomial analysis. The columns correspond to the regressions

reported in Table 4. The entries are average predicted probabilities from the system of equations

(3´). Rows (b) and (c) correspond to the equations (3b´) and (3c´). The sub-rows (b.1) to (b.3)

and (c.1) to (c.3) parse the predicted values into those for states without deposit insurance, for

states with deposit insurance in all years except for the year preceding departure, and for states

with deposit insurance in the ‘crisis’ year preceding departure. Sub-rows (b.1) and (c.1) reveal

the composition of suspensions for the control group. Sub-rows (b.2) and (c.2) reveal the

composition of suspensions for the treatment group. The contrast between the control and

treatment groups reveals the impact of deposit insurance. First consider runs. In states without

deposit insurance, runs caused approximately 9.1 percent of all suspensions. In states with

deposit insurance, runs caused approximately 5.0 percent of all suspensions. Our approximations

are the average of the predictions from specifications (2) through (6). Thus, deposit insurance

reduced the share of suspensions due to runs by approximately 4.1 percent. The number of

suspensions due to runs, in other words, declined by slightly more than 45 percent. Now consider

mismanagement. In states without deposit insurance, mismanagement caused approximately 43.9

percent of all suspensions. In states with deposit insurance, the share due to mismanagement rose

to 46.7 percent. Thus, deposit insurance increased the share of suspensions due to

mismanagement by roughly 3 percent. The number of suspensions due to mismanagement, in

other words, increased by slightly more than 7 percent. For specifications, the magnitudes of

these two effects were similar or statistically indistinguishable. That is why the grouped logit

estimates in the previous section find that deposit insurance had little impact on net bank




                                                 25
suspension rates, even though the multinomial logit estimates in this section find that deposit

insurance had a great impact on the composition of suspension.

       Figure 5, which plots predicted values from Equation (2) of Table 4, illustrates how the

composition of bank suspensions changed before and after states abandoned deposit insurance.

In the years preceding departure, agricultural conditions soured in each state. National bank

suspension rates rose. State banks failed in large numbers. Suspensions due to runs rose, as did

suspensions due to insolvency (the omitted category). Anecdotal evidence indicates that panic

swept the banking systems in each state, as depositors foresaw the demise of the deposit

insurance system and rushed to withdraw funds. A few years after states abandoned deposit

insurance, the share of suspensions due to runs rose to a new level, higher than it had been under

deposit insurance. The share suspensions due to mismanagement fell to a new level, lower than it

had been under deposit insurance. The composition of suspensions converged towards that of

states that never possessed deposit insurance.


6. Discussion

       Deposit insurance clearly influenced the pattern of bank suspension during the 1920s.

Insurance reduced the share of suspensions due to runs and raised the share of suspensions due to

mismanagement and other manifestations of moral hazard. The effects were roughly equal. Thus,

the overall rate of bank suspensions differed little between insured and uninsured states after

controlling for exogenous economic conditions. In the penultimate year of each deposit

insurance system, however, the suspension rate surged, as did the share of suspensions due to

runs and real shocks, such as declines in asset values. Several factors apparently contributed to

the onset of these crises. Court decisions weakened the legal foundations of deposit insurance

during the late 1920s. Small banks proliferated in states with deposit insurance. Many of those



                                                 26
banks operated in towns where the economy depended upon a single crop or industry. Droughts

reduced crop yields. Inflows of crops from abroad reduced market prices of produce. Land

values fell.

          Similar economic shocks afflicted the neighbors of the eight insured states. Yet, banking

panics either did not occur or were much less pronounced in those places, suggesting that deposit

insurance either caused or exacerbated the crises. Perhaps, panics occurred when people began to

suspect the imminent demise of the deposit insurance systems. Possibly, the crises resulted from

a buildup of bad debt in insured banks. The link between deposit insurance and the onset and

propagation of financial shocks is unclear at this point in our research. Our data and methods,

which illuminate both the influence of deposit insurance on the composition of bank suspensions

and the correlation between deposit insurance and financial panics, are not suited towards

answering questions concerning the causes of these crises. One possibility that we would like to

examine is whether regulatory forbearance caused the clustering of bank suspensions during the

last year of the system. Our essay yields more concrete conclusions on a number of important

points.

          First, deposit insurance had positive and negative effects. The magnitude of the salutary

effect that we measure – a decline in runs by nearly half during non-crisis years – resembles that

claimed by our pro-insurance predecessors. The magnitude of the harmful effect that we measure

– an increase in the share of suspensions due to mismanagement by one tenth – resembles that of

the other studies. Our own findings as well as theirs, however, may be understated. Our category

mismanagement consists of banks that suspended operations due to the real world manifestations

of moral hazard, such as risk-taking, malfeasance, and incompetence. Our category

mismanagement does not include banks whose portfolio decisions raised the risks that they faced




                                                  27
without rising to a level that examiners deemed ill advised or incompetent. Including such cases

(if they existed) would increase our estimates. While the data do not exist, we can indirectly

estimate an upper bound based on events that were more readily identifiable and thus less likely

to have been undercounted. Runs were easier to observe. Examiners determined if banks suffered

runs by examining deposit losses before bank suspensions. Our multinomial regressions reveal

that suspensions due to runs fell at most by 5 percent of aggregate suspensions.12 Our grouped

logit regressions reveal that deposit insurance did not alter overall suspension rates, or in other

words, that the decline in suspensions due to runs offset the rise in suspensions due to moral

hazard. So, the upper bound for the rise in suspensions due to moral hazard in states with deposit

insurance is equal to the upper bound for the decline in suspensions due to runs, which is 5

percent.

           Second, deposit insurance influenced the composition of bank suspensions much more

than it influenced the aggregate suspension rate. This revelation underscores an issue emphasized

in the theoretical literature: the credibility of the insurance regime. When the regime is credible,

the incentives of depositors and managers change, which reduces runs while inducing moral

hazard. When the regime is not credible, neither group alters their behavior. Thus, the

magnitudes of deposit insurance’s beneficial and detrimental effects should shift in unison. The

net effect should remain near zero. That is what we find in our estimates.

           Third, during the 1920s, the principal causes of bank suspensions were mismanagement

and losses due to unforeseen economic circumstances, such as dramatic declines in crop prices

and land values after World War I. Our data sources contain innumerable examples of

mismanagement. Some banks failed to keep accurate accounts. Some failed to balance their

books. Others loaned the bulk of their assets to single firms, friends of the management, or

businesses with little prospect of repayment. Many lacked profitable business plans. Frivolous

expenses exceeded sustainable levels. Revenues fell far below the threshold for profits. Runs

caused only a small proportion of bank suspensions, even during the worst downturns.

Depositors seldom withdrew funds from solvent institutions so quickly that the institution could

not liquidate assets, rebalance their books, and remain open to the public. Six banks failed due to

mismanagement for every one bank that failed due to a run. Deposit insurance did not direct

regulatory resources toward that principal problem.

         These findings reinforce the cautionary conclusions drawn from the state deposit-

insurance experiments. Deposit insurance did not address the principal problems of the United

States banking system during the first third of the twentieth century. Lack of managerial capital

was a principal problem. Managers of small banks in rural areas seldom possessed extensive

training in technical topics. Some knew neither how to nurture their institutions during good

times nor how to protect their institutions from economic shocks. Runs were a second order

concern. Even if the state deposit insurance systems had eliminated all bank runs without

generating moral hazard, the overall rate of suspension would have fallen by no more than one

tenth.

         A similar situation exists in developing nations today, which is one reason that the policy

experiments of grain-growing states during the 1920s remains a valuable analogy for scholars

seeking to understand the costs and benefits of deposit insurance. In developing nations, the costs

of deposit insurance may be large. The benefits in terms of reducing bank runs may be small.

Policy makers should carefully calibrate these benefits and costs when deciding whether to

Methodological Appendix

         The accuracy of estimators is always a concern. Violations of standard assumptions may

yield estimators with undesirable properties. This appendix discusses four such issues about

estimators.

         The first issue is the use of national bank suspension rate as a proxy for economic

conditions influencing state banks. The national bank suspension rate is itself a function of those

variables and a random error term. This error enters into the estimating equation for state banks

and may affect the consistency of our estimators. Consider the equations whose estimate we

report in Column 2 of Table 2.

         ⎛ SSRit        ⎞       ⎛ NSRit       ⎞
(A.1) ln⎜⎜              ⎟⎟ = ln⎜⎜             ⎟⎟φ + DI it γ + ε it
         ⎝ 1 − SSRit     ⎠      ⎝ 1 − NSRit    ⎠

where ln( NSRit /(1 − NSRit )) = Yit φ NSR + ε NSR ,it and φ ≡ φ SSR / φ NSR and ε it = ε SSR ,it − φε NSR ,it . The

asymptotic properties of the estimators for φ and γ can be calculated. To simplify the notation,

label in the typical manner the dependent variable as y, the independent variables as X, the

coefficients as β, and the error term as ε (our notation follows Green 2000 pp. 375-381). The

matrix of independent variables is the sum of two components. The first consists of two vectors:

X* = [Y ⋅ φ NSR , DI ] . The second, which is stochastic, consists of a vector of random variables and

a vector of zeroes: U = [ε NSR ,0] . Thus, X = X*+U.

         This notation allows (A.1) above to be rewritten in the familiar form

(A.2)    y = Xβ + ε

The estimator of β, denoted b, is


                                                             30

         Q*                            [
                              = plim (1 / n)(X * ' X * )   ]
         ∑ uu                 = plim[(1 / n)(U ′U)]

         ∑ uε                 = plim[(1 / n)(U ′ε SSR )]


The matrices Σuu and Σuε represent the correlations of concern. Elements of the first are the

variances and covariances of the random elements among the independent variables. In this case,

the sole source of randomness is the error term for national banks, ε NSR . The variance of this

error term, denoted σ NSR
                      2
                          , is the only non-zero element in Σuu. Elements of Σuε are the covariances

between the random elements of the explanatory variables and the error term of the dependent

variable, ε SSR . The covariance of ε NSR and ε SSR , denoted σ SSR , NSR is the only non-zero element.

         Writing out the two elements of b from (A.4) illuminates the problem. The probability

limit on our estimate of the coefficient on the log odds of the national bank suspension rate

equals

                       2
                           and thus plim φ > φ . While these ratios and variances are unknown and

inestimable, economic theory and historical circumstances suggest overestimation is the likely

case. φ is the ratio of φ SSR and φ NSR , which should be close to or less than unity, since state

banks failed on average at higher (and higher varying) rates than national banks, suggesting the

former were more sensitive to changes in underlying economic conditions than the latter.

σ SSR, NSR is the covariance of random shocks affecting suspension rates of state and national

banks. σ NSR
         2
             is the variance of random shocks affecting suspension rates of national banks.

Shocks affecting state and national banks are likely to have been similar, if not the same, and

thus highly correlated. The magnitude of the shocks affecting state banks must have been at least

as high as the magnitude of shocks affecting national banks, since state-bank suspension rates

varied much more than national-bank suspension rates. These facts suggest that σ SSR, NSR equaled

or exceeded σ NSR
              2
                  , and thus, that we overestimate φ .

         Similar logic suggests that we also overestimate the coefficient on deposit insurance. The

second element of b from (A.4) illuminates the problem. The probability limit of γˆ equals

where q*i,1 is the (i,1)th element in (Q*)-1. (A.6) indicates that plim γˆ = γ if

Comparing this condition to the inequality that determines the consistency of φ strongly suggests



                                                           32
that γˆ overestimates γ . We overestimate γ in all cases where we overestimate φ and in many

more, since 2q *21σ SSR , NSR > 0 .

        Similar algebra can be used to derive the conditions for the consistency of estimators in

all other specifications estimated in this essay. In each case, the consistency conditions will be

similar. The balance between over and underestimation will depend upon the relative magnitudes

of σ SSR, NSR and σ NSR
                    2
                        . Since this bias generally goes against the argument advanced in this essay,

correcting it is not a necessity, although the correction should favor our argument by lowering

our estimate γ or leaving it relatively unchanged. Correcting for the bias using instrumental

variables and the method of group averages indicates that the later is, in fact, the case (see Tables

3, column 6 and Table 5, column 6).

        The second issue concerns the possibility that our error terms may not be independent

across space and time. Common shocks could bias our estimated coefficients. To alleviate that

concern, we include state, region, and time dummy variables in several specifications and/or

limit our analysis to states adjoining, and therefore similar to, the insured states. Common shocks

could also cause downward bias in our standard errors. We have examined this issue. The story

is what one would expect and what typically happens in studies of this sort. The nature of the

common shocks is not known. Assumptions must be made concerning temporal and spatial

clustering. Under some sets of plausible assumptions, our standard errors appear accurate and

our hypothesis tests correct after having been adjusting using the Huber-White and Newey-West

methods. Under other sets of plausible assumptions, the standard errors grow and many variables

that once appeared to be ‘statistically significant’ no longer appear to be so.

        In neither case do our key conclusions change. In our grouped logit regressions, the novel

finding was that deposit insurance was uncorrelated with suspension rates, except during the


                                                 33
penultimate year of the deposit insurance system. Correcting (i.e. enlarging) our standard errors

reinforces that result. In our multinomial logit regressions, our key conclusions concerning the

magnitude and signs of the marginal effects, which indicate that deposit insurance reduced

suspensions due to runs and increased suspensions due to moral hazard, are not affected by

changes in the standard errors.

Data Appendix

       The Committee on Branch, Group, and Chain Banking collected data on the causes of

bank suspension using a preprinted four-page form. A reproduction of the portion pertaining to

the information available in our database appears below.

       We calculate the dependent variables for section 3, causal state-bank suspension rates,

using the following formulas.

                     1⎡ K J                        K    J            ⎤
        SSRitrun =     ⎢ ∑∑ j kj
                        α          λ P + (1 − α ) ∑∑        η j C kj ⎥ for all k ∈ {runs on banks}
                     n ⎣ k =1 j =1                k =1 j =1          ⎦

                               1⎡ K J                     K    J    ⎤
        SSRitmismanagement =     ⎢α ∑∑ λ j Pkj + (1 − α )∑∑η j C kj ⎥ for all k ∈ {mismangement}
                               n ⎣ k =1 j =1             k =1 j =1  ⎦

                         1⎡ K J                     K    J    ⎤
        SSRitneither =     ⎢α ∑∑ λ j Pkj + (1 − α )∑∑η j C kj ⎥ for all k ∈ {neither}
                         n ⎣ k =1 j =1             k =1 j =1  ⎦

where n equals the number of state banks in state i in year t. J equals the number of state banks

that suspended operations in state i in year t. K equals the number of potential causes. P kj equals

1 if cause k was a primary cause of bank j’s suspension, 0 otherwise. C kj equals 1 if cause k was

a contributing cause of bank j’s suspension, 0 otherwise. λ j equals 1 divided by the number of

primary causes for the failure of bank j. η j equals 1 divided by the number of contributing

causes to the failure of bank j. α = 0.8. The set {runs on banks} consists of heavy withdrawals,




                                                        34
contagion, idle gossip, loss of confidence. The first of those causes appears on row 6 of the form

above. The remainder appears in row 10 under the heading “other causes.” The set

{mismanagement} consists of incompetent management, defalcation, dishonesty, carelessness

and neglect, exploitation, forgery of notes, lax supervision, suicides. The first and second of

those causes appear on rows 4 and 5 of the form above. The remainders appear in row 10 under

the heading “other causes.” The set {neither} equals all causes other than those in the sets {runs}

and {mismanagement}.

       To check the robustness of this categorization, we reran all regressions after redefining

the variables in broader terms. To the first category, we added suspension of affiliate, suspension

of correspondent, suspension of banks in vicinity, inability to borrow, and inability to liquidate.

To the second category, we added forgery of notes, lax supervision, loss in investment, misuse of

fund, outside investment, political loans, security speculation, and suicides of bank presidents.

The third category included all banks closing due to other causes.

       While many of the terms above seem self-explanatory, their variety reflects the lack of a

standard lexicon for the interwar banking industry. This lexical lacuna sometimes caused

confusion, because definitions of banking terms varied across jurisdictions, year, and region.

Each state-banking bureau published its own report and defined terms as it saw fit. Explicit

definitions seldom appeared. Multiple definitions often existed. Some varied according to

context. To minimize confusion, analysts at the Board of Governors strove to standardize the

definitions of the words with which they worked and design forms that were easy to use and

elicited accurate information. The design process was interactive and ongoing. The Board

circulated forms to agents around the country and asked them to suggest improvements.

Correspondence between the Board of Governors and the district banks announced up-and-




                                                 35
coming modifications and important decisions concerning the coding of ambiguous cases. A

series of memos defined key terms and explained how to fill out the forms. The survey that we

use was conducted at a time when the Federal Reserves lexicon was approaching its final form.

Many definitions had solidified.

       Definitions of key terms that differ from modern parlance appear below. The definitions

come from an internal memo on the topic entitled “Bank Changes - Definition of Terms [Federal

Reserve Committee on Branch, Group, and Chain Banking, 5 November 1930, file 421.113-1].”

A bank suspension occurred when a bank closed its doors “to the public either temporarily or

permanently by supervisory authorities or by the bank’s board of directors on account of

financial difficulties, regardless of whether or not the bank is ultimately classed as a suspension

by the supervisory authorities [memo, 18 November 1929].” The term sprang from the phrase the

‘suspension of payment of deposits.’ In lay terms, a bank suspended payments when a depositor

asked to withdraw funds, and a bank refused the request. Banks could halt payments for short

periods without officially entering suspended status. According to the official definition of the

Federal Reserve, banks suspended payments only if they closed their doors overnight. A bank

that closed its doors during the morning but resumed payments before the end of the business

day was not classified as a suspended bank. A bank that closed its door at three in the afternoon

and reopened the next morning shortly after its appointed opening time was classified as a

suspended bank. This in-house definition resembled several vernacular terms. Suspension and

closure sometimes served as equivalents, although the equivalence was loose. The terms were

not synonymous. Writers used them in various senses and seldom stated explicit definitions.

Sometimes closure meant suspension. Sometimes it meant suspension followed by bankruptcy.

Defalcation meant a fraudulent deficiency in money matters or a monetary deficiency through




                                                 36
breach of trust by one who has the management or charge of funds. The breach of trust must

have been a violation of the law. The most common example was embezzlement.

Correspondents were banks with ongoing relationships facilitated by deposits of funds. A

common situation involved a small bank outside a financial center (called a country bank) that

deposited funds in a bank in a reserve city (called a city bank) and received services such as

check clearing in return. Such deposits often formed a portion of country banks’ legal reserves.

In many cases, the suspension of the city bank precipitated the suspension of the country bank,

because the latter lost its legal reserves and linkages to the national financial system. Another

potential cause of bank suspensions was unusually heavy withdrawals. This often meant a run on

a bank. Rumors of financial difficulties spread among depositors. Fearing for the safety of their

savings, they rushed to empty their accounts. Their banks lacked enough cash on hand to satisfy

immediate demands. So, the banks suspended payments on deposits. In some instances, the term

heavy withdrawals referred to dramatic events of this type. But, a Federal Reserve study,

“Deposit Losses Before Suspension” by Thomas Kroll, concluded that long queues of

despondent depositors were a symptom, rather than a cause, of most banks’ demise. The

significant deposit losses occurred before ordinary men and women rushed to empty their

accounts. Businesses, banks, and wealthy individuals - who possessed better-than-average

information about financial events, multiple bank accounts, and the ability to transfer funds

quickly via wire or check - often transferred large amounts out of banks in the weeks or months

before ordinary individuals panicked over their accounts. Thus, the term heavy withdrawals

usually indicated that a bank suffered the loss of many large depositors in the weeks prior to the

suspension of payments. Researchers at the Federal Reserve called these events invisible runs.

       Our dependent variable for the estimates in Section 4, the state-bank suspension rate,




                                                 37
comes from the annual reports of the Office of Comptroller of Currency. These reports indicate

the number of bank suspensions in each year in each state. The Comptroller of Currency

gathered data on state bank suspensions from the regulatory reports of each state and via

correspondence with state banking authorities. Our key independent variable, the national bank

suspension rate also comes from the annual reports of the Office of Comptroller of Currency.

        We draw information about bank regulations from White [1983]. Data on legal reserve

requirements comes from Table 3.3. Data on branch banking restrictions comes from Table 3.5.

        The U.S. Palmer Drought index was downloaded in April 2000 from the National

Climatic Data Center data file number ds885.1. The Palmer drought index is a monthly data

compile by Tom R. Karl and Red Ezell that reports monthly average temperature and

precipitation by land stations in each state. The index ranges from -4 to +4. A -4 indicates

extreme aridity and +4 indicates extreme moisture. Both extremes are bad for agricultural

growth. Values near zero are good for growth. To obtain the value of our independent variable,

we average the monthly values for all of the weather stations in a state. Then, we square that

amount, creating an index ranging from 0 to 16 where low values indicates good growing

conditions and high values indicate bad growing conditions.

Note: Entries are average fitted values for the corresponding equation and model. Columns
report values obtained from corresponding columns of Table 4. Rows (b) and (c) pertain to
equation (3b´) and (3c´). Rows (b.1) and (c.1) indicate average fitted values for equations (3b´)
and (3c´) for all observations for which the indicator for deposit insurance equals zero. Rows
(b.2) and (c.2) indicate average fitted values for equations (3b´) and (3c´) for all observations for
which the indicator for deposit insurance equals one except those for which the indicator for the
year before departure equals one. Rows (b.3) and (c.3) indicate average fitted values for
equations (3b´) and (3c´) for all observations for which the indicator for deposit insurance equals
one and the indicator for the year before departure equals one. Elasticities evaluated at the means
of the independent variables yield similar results.
