                   On the Adequacy or Inadequacy of Keynesian
                    Balance—of--Payments Theory: A Rejoinder


                                      Abstract


     This note again refutes Kuska's proposition that equality between the

demand   for and supply of money ("money market equilibrium') implies equilibrium
in the balance of payments.     Indeed, under a regime of fixed exchange rates it
is precisely the balance of payments deficit or surplus that equilibrates the

money market.    The refutation of Kuska's proposition does not require any

special assumptions about sterilisation policies,       it is also established,

again contrary to Kuska, that in a two country world with a fixed exchange rate,

internationally mobile capital and endogenous interest rates, only one country

can independently achieve a money supply target.

     Failure to distinguish between the change in the money stock and domestic

credit expansion appears to be the source of Kuska's erroneous indictment of

"Keynesian" balance—of—payments theory.    We also establish the conditions

under which alternative (ex-ante) balance of payments definitions can be

substituted for an asset market equilibrium condition.

                            Willem H. Buiter and Jonathan Eaton*



            In a recent issue of this Review (September 1982) Edward A. Kuska has

    replied to comments by Alan V. Deardorff, Norman C. Miller and us (this

 Review, September 1981) on his article 'On the Almost Total Inadequacy of

    Keynesian Balance—of-Payments Theory", published by this Review in September

    1978.      In his original paper Kuska set forth four Propositions indicting a

    large number of balance-of—payments models (which he chose to call "Keynesian")

 as being "inadequate" or inconsistent.

            His Proposition 1 stated that omission of wealth in asset demand functions

 can have potentially bizarre implications for the implicit specification of

 "suppressed" asset demand functions.         Along with our fellow commentators we

agreed with this proposition, pointing out that it is well-known and has been

reflected in macroeconomic models for some time without affecting their

essential features or implications for policy in a fundamental way.           No more

need be said about this.

            Kuska's Propositions 2 and 3 are the source of the controversy.   Proposition

2 states that "Models which bring each country's demand and supply of money into

equality have zero overall balance—of-payments figures in all periods.          This is

true whether the supplies of money are taken to be endogenous or exogenous.             If

in addition, the model includes other equations which allow the overall balance-

of-payments to be non-zero, it is contradictory" (p.664).          In Proposition 3 he

states that "Models in which more than one market—clearing equation is suppressed

do not require equilibrium in any of the excluded markets" (p.664).1          Our cormient

demonstrated that Proposition 2 is based on an erroneous concept of equilibrium

in which beginnning-of-period asset supplies are equated to end-of—period demands.

1       Proposition 4 is a corollary of Proposition 2.
                                              -2-




    Proposition 3 we showed was false for the case in which bonds are internationally

    immobile (the one Kuska considered) but true if they are mobile between countries.

    We also pointed out that an implication of a proper specification is that, when

    bonds are internationally mobile, only one country can control or independently

 target its money supply.

             In his reply Kuska attempts to resurrect his Proposition 2 and 3, arguing

 that they fail to obtain only when "simultaneous sterilisation" (which he

 asserts is an "empirically false assumption") takes place.          In addition,

 concerning the endogeneity of one national money supply in a two-country fixed

exchange rate world, he claims that "Buiter and Eaton made a slip in their

analysis, for it transpires that both money market equations are redundant in

the general model' (p.888).


    I.   On confusing changes in the money supply with domestic credit expansion

             In fact, Kuska's two propositions are false regardless of whether or not

 the monetary authorities sterilise payments imbalances, as is his assertion

that in a two-country framework with traded bonds both national money

supplies are exogenous.           His results follow from an error that is at the same

time elementary and fundamental:          he simply confuses the change in the domestic

money stock with domestic credit expansion.            As can be found in any text on

the money supply process, in an "outside" money economy, the change in the

(high—powered) money supply equals net central bank purchases of domestic

government bonds (domestic money expansion) plus the domestic currency value

of the change in international reserve holdings.1

         Kuska introduces his error in his reply immediately following his equations

(15) and (16) repeated here:

         B       L - M -                                                            (1)

         B
             *
                 L * —M* —M*                                                        (2)



1        See, for example, Johnson's Lectures in Economics 1, (1971, p.182) quoted
         below.
                                                  —3—




    Here B denotes the home-coutry's balance of payments, L end-of-period demand

for home—country money, M is the beginning-of-period supply of home-country

money , and, most importantly, zM is money issued by the government to finance

its deficit, i.e., domestic credit expansion.                  Equivalent magnitudes for the

foreign country are denoted with asterisks.                  That AM constitutes only domestic

credit expansion is clear from Kuska's equations (1) and (3): AM and AM equal

government expenditure plus debt service less taxes less bond issue to the

domestic and foreign private sectors.                 To these he adds equation (2), which

states that AMe, "the amount of money supplied by the exchange authority in

Dreserving the value of the exchange rate" equals AR, "the change in reserves"

(p.889).             Equation (4) equates AM*e   to   AR*.   The change in total money supplies,
                                        *
which we will call AM and AM S are, of course, the sums of domestic credit

expansion and the change in reserves; i.e.


         AMS         AM + AMe                                                             (3)

         AMS AM + AM*e                                                                    (4)

Thus the end-of—period money supplies are given by N5 + AM + AR and
    *            *      *
M       + Al + AR ,         respectively.
         By themselves, Kuska's equations (15) and (16) (our (1) ahd (2)) are

almost correct.              Replacing M by M5 and M* by M*s would make them wholly correct.

We therefore replace (1) and (2) by

         B       L - M5 —    AM                                                         (1')

        B
             *
                 L* -M          —AM                                                     (2')

What     is wrong Ts        his interpretation of them, that "the balance of payments of

the government and private sectors is equal- to their excess demand for money"

(p.891, emphasis added).              The right-hand sides of his equations (15) and (16)


        We follow Kuska in assuming that money is only held by private residents
        in its country of issue.    In our comment we also permitted domestic money
        to be held by foreign authorities (and vice versa).    The loss of reserves
        for the domestic country was identified with the acquisition of domestic money
        by the foreign authorities net of the acquisition of foreign money by the
        domestic authorities (and conversely for the change in foreign reserves).
        In Kuska's exposition (followed here) reserves are best thought of as an
        "outside" asset such as gold.    No substantial conclusions are affected by
        this minor change in specification.

(our (1) and (2)) are no such things.                   The end-of-period demands are L and L*;
                                                                        *           *      *
the end-of-period supplies are M + M + tM                       and M       +   M       + tM   .   The

correct expressions for the excess demands for money are given by the negative

of the left-hand sides of his equations (19) and (20), repeated here, again

with M and M* replaced by M5 and M5 respectively.

              +   M   +   Me   -   L =   0                                                               (5)

         *s
               +M +M e*-L =0                                                                             (6)

The riaht-hand sides of Kuska's corrected equations (15) and (16) (our (1') and

(2')) give only the excess of one end-of-period money demands over beginning-

of-period supplies plus domestic credit expansions.1


          l.A         Money market equilibrium and a non-zero balance-of-payments

     If the right—hand sides of Kuska's corrected equations (15) and (16) (our

(1') and (2')) did in fact represent the excess demands for money then, of

course, his Proposition 2 would follow.                      Since the correct definitions are

provided by the negative of the left—hand sides of his amended equations (19)

and (20) (our (5) and (6)), equilibrium is perfectly compatible with
    = —eLM                0.

     What Kuska has failed to realise is that under a regime of fixed exchange

rates it is precisely the balance-of payments that equilibrates the money markets.

If end-of-period money demand exceeds the initial money stock by more than

domestic credit expansion in that period, then a balance—of—payments surplus

in that period provides the additional supply necessary to equilibrate end-of-

period supply and demand.                    Conversely if domestic credit expansion exceeds

the excess of end-of-period money demand over the beginning-of-period money


1    In this sense Kuska's reply represents a step forward from his first
     publication.    Instead of equating end-of-period demand to beginning-of-
     period supply he now adds to the beginning-of-period supply the
     within-period change from one source, domestic credit expansion.    The
     within—period change arisirfrom the change in in reserve holdings has
     not yet gained recognition in Kuska's equilibrium conditions.
                                                  —5—


stock, a balance—of-payments deficit ensues.1                       This point has been made

succinctly by Johnson (1971).

              'Assume a country on a fixed exchange rate system, that the

       public adjusts its money holdings to the desired level (always and

       instantaneously) through spending or not spending, that there is a

       high degree of substitutability between the goods of this country and

       those of the rest of the world, that the world price level is constant,

       and money demanded is a multiple of income (Md =                       KY).         Then the money

       supply existing at any time will be the sum of the assets backing the

       domestic money supply (international reserves and domestic credits

       MS =   R   +   D).   The basic assumption is that the money supply must

       always equal money demanded (Ms = Md).                   This means that through its

       domestic policy the monetary authority (by operations on D, through

       open market operations) does not determine the money stock.                                   The money

       stock is determined by demand.             What the authority determines is the

       size of the reserves, through the relation AR =                    B       =   Md   -
                                                                                               LD,   .   . ." (p.182
       emphasis added).

Note that sterilisation (let alone exact, simultaneous sterilisation) is nowhere

required.         The magnitude and duration of the balance-of—paymnts deficits that

a country can run are of course constrained by the size of its stock of reserves.


                              I.B    The exogeneity of money supplies

       The same confusion between changes in the money supply and domestic credit

expansion lead Kuska to conclude that, in a two-country framework, both money

supplies can be exogenous or independently determined.                                He states that "Buiter

and Eaton concluded that .          .. one   of the domestic money stocks must be endogenous,
                                *
that   is, either AM or AM must be treated as a variable" (p.891).                                       This
                                                                      *
statement is, of course, a non-sequitur, AM and AM are exogenous variables
                                                        *       *             *
(assuming, as does Kuska, that G, T, AA, C ,                T       and AD are policy—determined


1      As John Makin has pointed out to us in discussion, if Kuska's Proposition 2
       were correct a corollary would be that, in a regime of flexible exchange
       rates, the exchange rate would be indeterminate.    If money market
       equilibrium implied a zero balance—of-payments there would be no role for
       the exchange rate.
                                                                 -6-




and that no authority pegs interest rates), but they represent domestic credit

expansions.                The changes in the money stocks are given by our equations (3)
                                                                           *
and    (4).       The government can determine AM and AM independently, but since
     e =                          *            *        *
AM       AR   =   B    =    -eB       = -eAR       = -eAM e and since e is fixed while B is

endogenous, it is patently obvious that both countries cannot independently
                                      *
determine AMS and AM                      .    For that to be possible B would have to be exogenous.

Our conclusion that only one country can independently determine its money

supply when B is endogenous stands.                             Kuska correctly lists B as an endogenous

variable.             As we show in the next section B is in fact endogenous when bonds

are mobile, but not when they are non-traded.

        To sumarise, Kuska confuses domestic credit expansion with changes in the

money stock, leading him to an erroneous proof of his Proposition 2 and a false

result that both money stocks are exogenous when bonds are traded.1                             This

mistake represents the major logical error in Kuska's reply that demands

correction.                There are, however, a number of other fallacies and misleading

claims in his reply that require correction or clarification.


                      II.         Suppression of bond-market equilibrium conditions

        Kuska does not respond to our demonstration that his Proposition 3 is

false for the case of no capital mobility, the case treated in his first article.


1      From the false result that the two money stocks are exogenous, Kuska infers
       another demonstration of his Proposition 2:     . . . if the money stocks are
                                                                               '




       assumed to be exogenous and the demands are equal to them, AMe and AMe in
       (19) and (20) (our (5) and (6)) must equal zero.   These equations with
                                                            *
        (15) and (16) then force B and B to vanish, which is my Proposition 2'
       (p.895, emphasis added).    Here Kuska proves Proposition 2 by changing
       definitions of the money stock.    He shows on page 891, correctly, that
                                                                       *
       domestic credit expansions (AM and AM ) are exogenous.    Here he incorrectly
       calls these magnitudes the changes in the money stocks, thereby "proving"
       that the money stocks are exogenous.    On page 895 he has apparently adopted
       the correct definition of the money stock, but nevertheless applies the
                                                                       *
       theorem that was proven for AM and AM , and asserts that the two money
       stocks, now defined correctly, are also exogenous, which of course they are
       not.

    He does establish Proposition 3 using a model in which bonds are traded.                              As we

    pointed out in our comment, for this case his Proposition 3 would have been

    correct.      He does not qualify his result, however, for the no mobility case.

    In addition he introduces a misleading and spurious distinction between

    "Keynesian"    and "r"lonetary—Approach" definitions of the balance—of—payments,
    confusing ex ante and ex post or equilibrium notions.
           The sources of confusion can best be demonstrated by considering Kuska's

    full model, restated here in a slightly more compact form:

H, H ,       A, A and X      are measured in domestic currency.       V ,   C       ,   I,G,M,L

        These are identical to the ones we presented in our equations (17) through
        (22) except that Kuska's equations (24) and (25) (repeated here as (11)
        and (12)) equate output to income while ours equated goods supplied to
        goods demanded.   The two conditions are related by Wairas' Law so we have
        no quarrel with this change.

Finally, the home country's reserve gain must identically equal the foreign

loss:

        An important point is that equations (7) through (15) completely describe

a general equilibrium system without any reference to the balance of payments.

A definition of the balance of payments in terms of magnitudes determined by

this system can be appended, but it is not necessary for solving it.                                                                 If

formulated appropriately a balance-of-payments definition can be interpreted

as an equilibrium condition to replace any one of equilibrium conditions (7)

through (14).


           II.A           The redundancy of one equilibrium condition : traded bonds

        Assume that (7) and (11) and (8) and (12) obtain.                                                      Then (13) becomes:

While (14) becomes:

1       They are derived by combining the government and private sector constraints
        for each country, given by equations (9) and (12) and (10) and (14) of our
        comment.

Multiplying          (17) by e and adding it to (16) gives
                                 *             *                      *               *

Equations (18) and (15) thus do not imply that bnth bond markets are in

equilibrium.             Excess demand in one can be offset by excess supply in the

other.         Requiring that one bond market be in equilibrium as well as both

money markets and both goods markets does, however, insure equilibrium in

all markets.             One and only one bond market can be suppressed.                           Any five

of conditions (7) through (12) are sufficient to determine the endogenous

variables Y, y                        PD, and AMe.        Kuska is thus correct in treating AMe

as an endogenous variable when bonds are traded.                          A consequence, as we have
                             S           *
shown, is that AM or AM                        is also endogenous.

hold identically.                    Therefore (19) and (21) imply domestic bond market

equilibrium while (20) and (22) imply foreign bond market equilibrium.                                    Both

bond market equilibrium conditions are redundant.                         Thus any four of conditions

(7) through (12) are sufficient to describe equilibrium.                                  In this case one of

          A'D and AMe is exogenous.                        Both countries can independently determine

AM and AM         when bonds are not traded.

 II.C           On    "Keynesian" and 'monetary-approach' balance-of-payments definitions

        Kuska accuses our fellow commentators and us of attempting 'to utilise

a balance-of—payments equation to make the system determinate" (p.887).

This is false.                   In our comment, as above, we make no use of the balance—of-

payments equation as an equilibrium condition to determine equilibrium.                                                  The

balance-of-payments can be inferred from equilibrium in the money, bonds and

goods markets and the budget constraints.                                           Wairas' Law does, however, permit

replacing one equilibrium condition with a linear combination of that condition

and   others.             Thus replacing one bond market equilibrium condition with a
condition that equates the change in reserves to an expression for the balance-
of—payments that is derived using that bond market equilibrium condition is a

valid procedure.

        Kuska provides two sets of definitions of the balance-of-payments.                                                The

first set, which he calls the "monetary-approach" definitions, is given in his

equations (11) and (12), repeated here:

The second set, which he calls the "Keynesian" definitions,                                                 are given in his

 which are the conditions for equilibrium in the money market.                                    Thus the

 so—called "monetary-approach' definitions apply if and only if the money market

 is in equilibrium.               If the money market is in disequilibrium so that end-of—

period     money stocks do not equal L,                  then Kuska's "monetary—approach" definitions

do   not    hold.       It is not correct, as Kuska asserts, that "Even in this situation

where not all markets clear in an equilibrium sense, the budget constraints and

the monetary-approach definitions, and therefore equations (15) and (16), (our

equations (1') and (2')) must hold for any actual trading which takes place"

(p.895, footnote 10, emphasis in the original).

      Since Kuska's "monetary-approach" definitions of the balance-of-payments

are equivalent to money market equilibrium conditions, they cannot be substituted

as equilibrium conditions for either the bond market or goods market equilibrium

conditions.           On the other hand, combining what Kuska calls the "Keynesian"

definitions, (25) and (26), with the budget constraints (7) and (8), yields

These are linear combinations of money, bond and goods market equilibrium

conditions.         The so—called "Keynesian" definitions of the balance-of—payments,

then, can be substituted as equilibrium conditions for any one of the money,

bonds or goods market equilibrium conditions.                                 Thus suppressing two bond market

eouilibrium conditions even when bonds are traded is a valid procedure if the

appropriate balance—of—payments "equilibrium" condition such as our (25) and (26)

is introduced.

        As defined, Kuska's "Keynesian' definitions hold if and only if all three

markets are in equilibrium.                 Their correctness therefore requires more markets

 to be in equilibrium than Kuska's "monetary-approach" definitions.                     However,

 neither set of definitions holds in general ex ante or out of equilibrium.'                        If

one restricts the analysis to equilibrium positions only, all the definitions

are equivalent.


                  III.        On the "flow" specification of capital movements

        On page 893 Kuska shifts ground in his attack on "Keynesian" balance—of—

payments models, resurrecting the now very familiar issue of the "flow"

specification of capital movements: "Indeed, the balance—of—payments definitions

used in the literature are invariably different from those called Keynesian here,

being generally written as variants of:

        B" = X - eX* + eD - A* + F (r -              r*)                                       [(33)]


        B' =    [x*   -   X/e + A*/e -      Dj - e*F   (r -   r)'   (p.893).                   [(34)]



(Our    equations (33) and (34) appear as equations (31) and (32) in Kuska).
        Kuskas criticism of this specification is more justified than the rest
of his attack.            Comparing    (33)     and (34) with (25) and (26) shows that these
imply    that


        A (H* - A*)       -
                              eP0
                                    (D -   J)   = F (r -    r),                                 (35)


a rather unlikely functional form since beginning—of-period stocks do not

affect    the within-period movement of capital.
        In criticising this specification Kuska takes a position held by most

balance-of-payments           economists, "Keynesian' or otherwise, for well over a
decade.     Since the criticism by William H. Branson (1970),                  specification   of
international     capital movements in terms of asset market equilibrium has become

standard.       (See also, Branson (l976a, l976b), Turriovsky (1976), Dornbusch (1977),


1      Kuska's confusion on this point relates to the general issue of the
       applicability of Walras' Law ex ante in equilibrium and ex post.    Since
       a complete discussion would take us somewhat far afield the interested
       reader is referred to Buiter (1980).

Allen and Kenen (1980) and Whitman (1970)).         The only models that we know of

from the past decade that employ (33) and (34) are those by Frenkel and

Rodriguez (1982) and Dornbusch and Frenkel (1982).         If criticising the

"Keynesian" models for using a flow specification of capital movements is to

become the major thrust of Kuska's attack, he is only just joining the rest of

the profession.


                                    IV.    Conclusion

        Kuska's first paper and his reply both fall into the unhappy category of

"What's right is not new and what's new is not right".         Right but not new are

(1) the recognition that wealth should, in general, be an argument in asset

demand functions; (2) the proposition that, in general (but not in the model

without capital mobility analysed in Kuska (1978)), 4alras' Law permits the

suppression of only one equilibrium condition; and (3) the familiar criticism

of the "flow" specification of capital movements.         New but not right are the

following: (1) the proposition that (in a two—country, fixed exchange rate

world) equilibrium between money demand and money supply in both countries

implies balance—of-payments equilibrium.          Kuskas Proposition 2 is false

regardless of whether "the monetary authorities are able to sterilise exactly

and simultaneousli all balance-of-payments flows" (Kuska (1982, p.887) italics

in   the   original).   (2) The proposition that in a two-country world with a

fixed exchange rate, given public spending, taxation, and borrowing, both

countries' authorities can choose their money supplies independently.

        It is important to note that this whole unfortunate debate concerns

matters of logic, not of doctrine.        Those propositions of Kuska's that we have

demonstrated to be false are so regardless of whether one chooses to think of

oneself as a Keynesian, a monetarist, a Marxist or a Follower of the Line of the

Imam.       Kuska's attempt to convert an issue of logic into a "Keynesian" (or

generally inadequate) versus monetary-approach (or adequate) dispute merely
                                         -14-



obscures the real issue.   The source of the logical error in his reply is

fundamental and straightforward: he confuses changes in the stock of money

with domestic credit expansion.      In fact, when domestic credit expansion

does not equal the difference between end-of-period money demand and the

initial money stock,1 it is the change in reserves created by a non-zero

payments balance that creates the change in the money stock required to

maintain money market equilibrium.     This is the fundamental insight of the

monetary approach to the balance of payments.




    If there is monetary equilibrium in successive periods, this equals the
    change in money demand.
