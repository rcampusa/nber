              U.S. Budget Deficits and the European Economies:
                   Pesolving the Political &onony Puzzle


                                  ABSTRACT




     This   paper, prepared for the annual meetings of the American Economic

Association, discusses how the increases in the U.S. budget deficits since

1980 have affected the economies of Western Europe. The analysis emphasizes

that U.S. deficits have not only affected these economies directly but have

also induced them to adopt more restrictive monetary and fiscal policies than

they would otherwise have chosen. This induced shift in domestic policies is

the primary reason why European governments have pressed for a reduction in

the U.S. budget deficits despite the favorable impact of those deficits on

European trade surpluses.

      The .xperience of the past five years has dramatically underscored the

 international consequences of U.S. fiscal policy. The massive current and

 projected budget deficits were the primary cause of the sharp 60—plus percent

 rise in the real trade-weighted value of the dollar between 1980 and the end

 of 1984. The dollar's rise was -in turn the major reason that the U.S. current

 account shifted from a surplus in 1981 to an unprecedented deficit that

 currently exceeds 3 percent of GNP.1

      During the past four years, the exploding trade deficit has generated

calls in the United States to adopt protectionist policies and to abandon our

basic system of floating exchange rates. At the same time, European policy

officials have been unanimous in calling upon the United States to reduce   -its


budget deficit and to cooperate in -intervention to lower the doiiar!s value.

     The anguished cries from American exporters and from American firms and

employees that compete with imports from abroad are easy to understand. But

why have European officials been critical of our fiscal policy and eager to

see the dollar decline? Hasn't the U.S. trade deficit meant a substantial

improvement in the European trade balances? And shouldn't that have been the

mechanism by which the U.S. "locomotive" (to use a currently unpopular phrase)

pulled the European economies out of their recession? The European complaints

about U.S. fiscal policy and about the resulting strong dollar are a

political economy puzzle that deserves to be addressed.

     There is no doubt that the European trade balances have improved. For

the European Economic Community (EEC) as a whole, the trade balance with the

rest of the world improved by more than $50 billion between 1980 and 1984.

Exports rose sharply. French and German exports both increased about 17

percent between 1980 and 1984 and have continued to expand rapidly in 1985.

Nevertheless, during the past four years, growth in the European community

languished at an average annual rate of less than one percent and the

unemployment rate has doubled.

     It is of course possible that the rise in European unemployment and the

slow growth in Europe would have been even worse without the strong U.S.

dollar and our resulting trade deficit. If so, the vociferous complaints of

European officials are simply the normal behaviour of politicians seeking to

shift the blame for domestic policy failures to a convenient scapegoat. But I

think that there is a more serious and legitimate reason why the Europeans

have been critical of our fiscal policy.

     In considering the impact of recent U.S. fiscal policy on the European

economies, it is important to bear three things in mind. First, budget policy

is only one aspect of the change in U.S. economic policy that has occurred

since 1980. The increased budget deficits were accompanied by a monetary

policy that caused U.S. inflation to decline from 9 percent in 1980 and 1981

to 4 percent in each year since 1982. Thus a sound monetary policy and the
                                       -3-


expectation that such a policy would persist prevented the massive budget

deficits from leading to concurrent inflation or to a widespread expectation

of future inflation.2 In addition, business tax rules were changed in 1981 in

a way that reinforced the effect of the budget deficits on real interest

rates .3


     Second, U.S. policies affect the European economies not only directly

through trade and financial markets but also by inducing changes in the

policies of European governments. These induced policy changes have been

particularly important in the past few years and go a long way toward

explaining why European officials believe that their countries have been hurt

by U.S. fiscal policies despite the favorable effects on European exports.

     Third, although it is possible to generalize considerably about the impact

of U.S. policy on the European economies, it is also important to recognize

that the situation differs among the major countries. I will focus my

comments on the situation in Germany, not only because Germany is the largest

of the European nations, with nearly 30 percent of the EEC's total GDP, but

because it is also the dominant nation in the European Monetary System and the

primary trading partner of the other European nations. The impact of the U.S.

deficits on the German economy and particularly on German economic policy

therefore had profound effects elsewhere in Europe.



    2This gives a bit too much credit to monetary policy for the decline in
U.S. inflation. The interaction of monetary and budget policy, by raising the
exchange value of the dollar, was an important cause of reduced inflation. See
Sachs (1985).

    3See Feldstein (1976, 1980) for an early discussion of the likely impact
of such tax reform on real interest rates and Feldsteiri (1986) for evidence
that the enlarged budget deficits had a much bigger impact on interest rates
than the change in tax rules.

I.   The Direct Impact of U.S. Fiscal Policy

     The strong U.S. economic recovery and the surge in the U.S. dollar

undoubtedly contributed to a significant rise in European exports to the

United States. Since 1980, U.S. imports from Western Europe increased more

than 50 percent while the value of our exports to those countries has actually

declined. But the importance of this to Europe should not be exaggerated. The

U.S. represents less than 10 percent of the imports and exports of the EEC

countries; even when intra-EEC trade is eliminated, the U.S. is only one-sixth

of EEC trade. In fact, the total volume of exports of the EEC rose only 14

percent between 1980 and 1984, about one-third less than the increase in the

two previous four-year periods.

     The sharp rise in the dollar relative to the European currencies also had

two unfavorable direct effects. It caused a decline in the terms of trade

with the United States (and with other countries whose currencies followed the

dollar more closely than the ECU) and it put upward pressure on domestic

inflation in Europe. The German mark fell 45 percent in real terms relative

to the dollar between 1980 and the end of 1984, implying that German exports

to the U.S. bought 45 percent less in U.S. goods in 1984 than they did in

1980. Since U.S. trade represents 8 percent of Germany's GOP, this

corresponds to a real income fall of about 3 percent.

     The impact of the dollar's rise on European inflation is more difficult

to judge because of the induced policy response to which I will turn in a

moment. But a simple mechanical pass-through of the increased import costs

associated with the 70 percent nominal rise in the dollar-DM ratio between

1980 and the end of 1984 would imply a 6 percent increase in the German price
                                      —5—


level or about one-third of the actual price rise over that 4 year period.

This cost pass-through calculation is very crude. It understates the

inflationary effect to the extent that it ignores imports priced in dollars

that do not come from the United States and because it ignores the impact of

rising import prices on domestic prices and wages.

     The increase in U.S. real long-term interest rates raised not only the

value of the dollar but also the level of real long-term interest rates in

Europe. This increase in interest rates reflected in part the policy response

of the Bundesbank and other central banks that I will discuss in a moment.

But even with no change in European economic policy, the behavior of private

investors would have caused the real long-term interest rates on DPI and other

long-term bonds to move in the same direction as the real interest rate on

dollar bonds. The rise in the real long-term interest rate in Germany reduced

spending on construction and on investment in plant and equipment, industries

in which the decline in activity and increase in unemployment have been

particularly severe.

     This impact of U.S. long-term rates on European investment can also be

expressed in terms of the shift in the capital flow with the rest of the

world. Germany, which was importing capital to finance a current account

deficit in 1980, had a current account surplus in 1984 equal to more than 5

percent of gross fixed investment. For 1985, the current account surplus and

associated capital outflow is expected to reach more than 10 percent of gross

fixed investment. Europeans complain that this not only represents a fall in

activity in the investment sector but also, by keeping the capital stock

smaller than it would otherwise have been, retards the growth of productivity
                                      -6-


and therefore exacerbates the classical unemployment problem caused by wage

demands in excess of full—employment productivity.

     It is difficult to be confident about the net impact on employment and

output of the several direct effects of the U.S. fiscal deficits. The

positive impact of the expanded exports may, but need not, exceed the adverse

effects of the higher real interest rates and capital outflow. But these

direct effects are only part of the total impact of U.S. fiscal policy. The

large and persistent U.S. budget deficits also caused the European countries

to alter their monetary and budget policies in a contractionary way. To

understand the impact of U.S. deficits on European economic activity, it is

important to examine the nature of these induced changes in economic policy.


II. The Induced Policy Response

     Inflation was a principal problem on the minds of policy officials

everywhere in Europe as the 1980s began. The rise in the inflation rate after

the 1973 oil shock had just been slowly but painfully reversed when the 1979

oil shock restarted the inflation process. Inflation in the EEC as a whole

rose from 6.9 percent for 1978 to 12.4 percent for 1980. The Germans saw

inflation rise from 2.6 percent for 1978 to 5.3 percent for 1980. The German

government was determined to reverse this inflation, even if it meant

temporarily slower growth and increased unemployment.

    The sharp rise in the dollar that began in 1980 brought with it an

additional inflationary impulse: a 20 percent decline in the mark between 1980

and 1981. To limit the future decline in the mark, the Bundesbank slowed the

growth of money and raised short-term interest rates. The German money supply
                                      —7—


actually declined between 1980 and 1981. The mark nevertheless continued to

fall. To offset the resulting inflationary pressure, the Bundesbank appears

to have continued to manage monetary policy in a way that maintained greater

slack in he German economy than they would otherwise have preferred.      Money

supply growth from 1980 to 1983 was approximately half of what it had been in

the three preceding three-year periods and real GNP grew at an average annual

rate of less than one percent. This contraction of German monetary policy in

reaction to the rise of the dollar caused by U.S. budget deficits was an

important source of continued high unemployment in Germany and elsewhere in

Europe.

     All of this can be restated more formally as follows: the decline in the

mark that resulted from the rising U.S. budget deficits was a negative supply

shock to the German economy that shifted its short-run Phillips curve to the

right. The Bundesbank pursued a tight money policy aimed at limiting this

shift and, to the extent that the shift could not be prevented, at moving

along the Phillips curve to achieve lower inflation than would otherwise occur

but at the cost of higher unemployment.

     The enlarged U.S. budget deficits also appear to have caused German

fiscal policy to become more contractionary. This occurred for several

reasons. When the combination of high German interest rates and a slack

economy automatically enlarged the budget deficit, the German government

sought to counter this by cutting spending and allowing tax receipts to rise

as a share of income. It was also argued that shrinking the German budget

deficit would reduce inflationary pressure in Germany, would lower real

interest rates (including those paid by the government), and would free up
                                         —8-


funds to offset the capital outflow.

     These remarks are not meant as either praise or criticism of German

monetary and fiscal policy since 1980.     I want only to indicate how the

enlarged U.S. budget deficits, by raising real U.S. interest rates and thereby

reducing European currency values, induced the German government to adopt

contractionary monetary and fiscal policies. Because of Germany's dominant

position in the European Monetary System, the other countries of Europe had to

follow Germany's tight money policy.4 Moreover, because half of European

trade is within the EEC and Germany is the largest EEC market for each of the

other member countries, the slowdown in German economic activity was

immediately transferred throughout Europe.


III. The Falling Dollar

     The fall of the dollar that began in March 1985 opened new opportunities

for Germany and the other European countries. The dollar fell from 3.4 marks

at its peak to 2.8 marks in September (before the G-5 announcement on

coordinated intervention) and to less than 2.6 marks by the beginning of

December. Parallel shifts occurred in the values of the other EMS currencies.

     The preceding analysis suggests that Germany and the other EEC countries

would respond to this dollar decline by easing monetary policy. That is

exactly what occurred. Although German money market rates were at essentially

the same level in March 1985 as they had been at the start of 1984 (despite a

100 basis point decline in comparable U.S. rates and a significant decline in



    4This induced shift of national monetary policies in response to U.S.
fiscal deficits is the explanation of the rise in world—wide interest rates
that puzzled Summers and Blanchard (1984). Knight and Masson (1985) indicate
that a substantial rise in world-wide interest rates can also be ascribed to
the net fiscal expansion that occurred in the world economy as U.S. deficits
increased by more than European deficits declined. The fall in the OPEC
surplus reinforced this net decline in world-wide savings.

German inflation), during the six months after the dollar began to decline

German interest rates came down 150 basis points, widening the gap with U.S.

rates. The response was similar in other EMS countries: money market rates

have declined 150 basis points in France and Italy. Longer term rates have

also generally declined.

     The G-5 decision to try to bring the dollar down by coordinated

intervention has started yet another new phase. Although the Japanese have

strengthened the yen more than 15 percent by a sharp tightening of monetary

policy and by increasing the likelihood of fiscal expansion, the Germans and

other key European governments have only engaged in limited intervention

without any noticeable shift in monetary or fiscal policies. The more modest

strengthening of their currencies relative to the dollar since September has

reflected a continuation of the trend started earlier in the year, accelerated

by the market's fear of possible intervention and perhaps by the growing

recognition that the dollar remains too high to decline only at a rate equal

to the international interest differential (Krugman, 1985).

     The strengthening of the European currencies relative to the dollar

replaces imported inflation with imported disinflation. In this environment,

the European governments can more easily pursue expansionary monetary

policies. This opportunity will be reinforced if prospective U.S. budget

deficits and long-term interest rates continue to decline. Although such an

easing of European monetary policy cannot be a substitute for dealing with the

more fundamental problems that prevent a return to full employment in Europe,

it can help to reduce the current exceptionally high levels of European

unemployment.
