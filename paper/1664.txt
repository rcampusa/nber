                   Capital Accumulation and Uncertain
                    Lifetimes with Adverse Selection
                                  ABSTRACT



    This paper examines the implications of adverse selection in the private

annuity market for the pricing of private annuities and the consequent effects

on constrption and bequest behavior. With privately known   heterogeneous   mor-

tality probabilities, adverse selection causes the rate of return on private

annuities to be less than the actuarially fair rate based on population aver-

age mortality. However, a fully funded social security system with compulsory

participation can offer an implied rate of return equal to the actuarially

fair rate based on population average mortality. Thus, since social security

offers a higher rate of return than private annuities, consumers cannot com-

pletely offset the effects of social security by transacting in the private

annuity market. Using an overlapping generations model with uncertain life-

times, we demonstrate that the introduction of actuarially fair social secu-

rity reduces the steady state rate of return on annuities and raises the

steady state levels of average bequests and average consumption of the young.

The steady state national capital stock rises or falls according to the

strength of the bequest motive.

            Uncertainty about an individual's date of death affects the

individual's consumption and portfolio behavior as well as the bequest ulti-

mately left to the consumer's heirs. The early literature on lifetime uncer-

tainty' focused on the effects of stochastic lifetimes on individual consump-

tion and portfolio behavior, ignoring the effects on the bequests received by

subsequent generations.2 Much recent attention has been devoted to the effects

of stochastic lifetimes on bequests and the implications for the distribution

of wealth and the evolution of the capital stock. Sheshinski and Weiss (1981)

extended the Modigliani—Brumberg (1954) — Samuelson (1958) — Diamond (1965)

overlapping generations model to include uncertain lifetimes. They assumed

that all consumers are identical and, furthermore, that all consumers in a

given cohort die at the same date, thereby leaving identical bequests. How-

ever, if consumers die at different dates, then they will, in general, leave

bequests of different sizes. Abel (1985) and Eckstein, Eichenbauni and Peled

(1985) exploited the iritra—cohort variation in ex post mortality experiences

to analyze the steady state distributions of bequests, consumption and wealth

in models without private annuity markets and with consumers without bequest

motives.3 Abel (1985) also shows that the introduction of fully funded social

security crowds out steady state private wealth by more than one—for—one and

that it reduces all central moments of the steady state distribution of

wealth.


     The effects of social security in the presence of uncertain lifetimes

have been studied by Sheshiuski and Weiss (1981) and Abel (1985) in models in

which there is no private annuity market. However, if a competitive annuity

market were introduced into these models, social security would then have no

effect because the rate of return on private annuities would be the same as
                                       —2—

the rate of return implicit in actuarially fair fully funded social security;

thus   consi.ers would exactly offset the effects of social security by adjust-
ing    their purchases of private annuities. In    this paper 'we introduce a
private   market for annuities and demonstrate that with privately—known hetero—

genous mortality probabilities, social security does have real effects on the

allocation   of consumption. The reason is that adverse selection drives the
rate of return   on competitively supplied annuities below the actuarially fair

rate   of return based on the population average    cx   ante mortality probability;
however, because the social security system is compulsory, it is immune         to

adverse    selection and a fully funded system can offer a rate of return equal

to the actuarially fair rate based on population average mortality.


       Eckstein, Eichenbaum and Peled (1985b) examine the welfare—enhancing role

of mandatory social security when the private annuity market is subject to

adverse selection.4 However, there are two features of their model which make

it unsuitable for our purposes. First,    because they assume that consumers
have   no bequest motive, the availability of annuities implies, as noted by

Yaari (1965), that consumers will hold all of their savings as annuities, and

hence there will be no private intergenerational transfers in the form of

bequests. Second, because the consumption good is a non—producible, non—

storable endowment, aggregate savings is zero in every period; the saving of

the young is exactly offset by the dissaving of the old. In contrast, in the

model presented below, the specification of the utility function with a

bequest motive introduces a non—trivial portfolio allocation problem and leads

to intergenerational transfers in the form of bequests. Secondly, in the model

below, the consumption good can be invested at a rate of return R so that

aggregate saving need not be zero. Thus, this model can be used to analyze
                                     —3—

the effects of social security on capital accumulation.


     In section I, we examine the optimal consumption and portfolio behavior

of an individual consumer, taking as given the rate of return on private

annuities and the consumer's inheritance received from his parent. Using the

derived demands for private annuities by consumers with different mortality

probabilities, we study, in section II, the determination of the rate of

return on private annuities. In section III, we analyze the steady state

effects of introducing actuarially fair fully funded social security. We show

that the introduction of fully funded social security leads to an increase in

the steady state consumption of young consumers, an increase in the steady

state level of bequests, and to a reduction in the rate of return on private

annuities. Finally, we show that depending on strength of the bequest motive,

an actuarially fair increase in social security taxes will crowd out private

capital by greater than or less than one—for—one.




1. Consumption and Portfolio Behavior of an Individual


     Consider a consumer who may live either one period (with probability p>O)

or two periods (with probability l—p>O). Let I be the initial wealth held by

the consumer at the beginning of his life.      (The determination of I will be

discussed below.) During the first period of life the consumer earns a fixed

labor income Y, pays a social security tax T, and consumes an amount            At
                                                                           c1

the end of the first period, the consumer chooses a portfolio of annuities and

riskiess bonds. Let Q be the amount of annuities held in the portfolio; the

remainder of the portfolio, I + Y —T —        — Q, is held in the form of riskless
                                         c1
bonds. A one dollar annuity pays A dollars to the consumer in the following
                                                 —4--

period   if he survives; if the consumer dies young, the annuity pays nothing to

his heir. A one dollar riskless bond yields R dollars in the following period

to the consumer,     if   he survives, or to his heir, if the consumer dies young.

As shown in section II, A>R in a competitive annuity market.


     At the beginning of the second period, the consumer gives birth to an

heir and then the uncertainty about the length of the consumer's life is

resolved.    If the consumer dies at the beginning of the second period, his

heir receives a bequest, BD, consisting of the consumer's riskiess bonds with

accrued interest,


                                BD=(I+Y_T_c1.Q)R                                                  (1)

If the consumer survives to the end of the second period, he receives a social

security payment S, consumes an amount C2, and gives the remainder of his

wealth, Bs, to his heir. Since all uncertainty is resolved at the beginning

of the second period., the consumer who lives for two periods knows at the

beginning of the second period that he will leave a bequest of Bs where


                      B5 =     (I   +   'Y   — T —
                                                     c1
                                                          — Q)R +QA +   S —   c2                  (2)

We assume that the consumer who survives gives his heir the bequest Bs at the

beginning of the second period.                      Thus, regardless of whether the consumer

lives one period or two periods, the intergenerational transfer from the con-

sumer to his heir takes place at the beginning of the second period i.e., at

the beginning of the first period of the heir's life.


     Let the consumer's utility function be


                                p8V(BD) + (1—p)&U(c2) + (l—p)&V(B5)
                                                                                                  (3)
                    13(c1) +

where & (O<&11) is the one—period discount factor, U( )                       is   a strictly concave
                                              —5--

utility index of the conser's own consumption and V( ) is a strictly concave

index of utility derived from leaving a bequest. The utility function in (1)

is simply the expected value of utility, where the only stochastic element is

the consumer's date of death.5


     The consumer maximizes the utility function in (3) subject to his life-

time budget constraint. The lifetime budget constraint is obtained by first

substituting (1) into (2) to obtain



                                   Bs=BD+QA+S_c2                                             (4)

Then combining (1) and (4) to eliminate Q yields


                     Bs =   A(I   +   !   —T)+ S —
                                                     Ac1
                                                           —
                                                               c2
                                                                     —                       (5)

Substituting the lifetime budget constraint (5) into the utility function (3)

and differentiating with respect to c1, c2, and B' respectively, yields


                                  U'(c1) = (i—p)&A V'(B5)                                   (6a)

                                          U'(c2) = V7(BS)                                   (6b>

                              pVt(BD)         (l—p) 1E VS(BS)                               (6c)


    Annuities are said to be actuarially fair if the expected rate of return

on an annuity,      (i—p)A, is equal to the rate of return on riskless bonds, R.

Note that actuarial fairness implies that                      =    —a-—   so that from (6c) we
                                                           R        i—p
obtain VP(BD) =   V'(B5)    and hence BD        Bs. Furthermore, since BD            Bs, it fol-

lows from (4) that c2 = QA + S.6            Thus, if the rate of return on private

annuities is actuarially fair, the consumer's portfolio consists of:                         (1)

riskiess bonds which will be given to his heir as a bequest; and (2) annuities

which, along with the social security payment S, will be used to provide for

second—period consumption.
                                                —6—

       If the expected rate of return on annuities is smaller than the riskiess

rate of return R, i.e., A < 1A_           then it follows from (6c) that V'(BP) < V'(B)

so that BD > B3 and (from (4)) C2          >    QA + S.     In this case the Consumer does

not use annuities to provide for all of second—period consumption; some of

second—period consumption is provided for by riskiess bonds which have a

higher expected rate of return than annuities.7


       In order to obtain explicit solutions for the optimal levels of consump—

                                                                      1—a_1
tion       and bequests, we assume that U(c)=                 and V(B)—, as in Hakans—
son (1969), Fischer (1973) and Richard (1975), where ?>O indicates the

strength of the bequest motive and a>O. Therefore the utility function in (3)

is ]iomothetic, and the income expansion path for c1, c2, ED and                Bs is a ray
through the origin. The optimal value of each of these variables, as well as

the demand for contingent second—period income QA+S, is proportional to the

expected present value of lifetime resources I + Y — T +AS. It is shown in

Appendix A that




                         C1   (p,A)   =   Ø(p,A) (I +       Y —   T +   AS)             (7)


wh e r e




                                          0 < (p,A) < 1

                                           1(p,A) < 1.

Explicit expressions for ô(p,A) and q1(p,A) are presented in Appendix A.                 It


can be shown that 8q1/a < 0. Also, q1(p,A) will be positive if and only if
                                                 —7-.

                                                               1

If S=O,      then   (9) is necessary and sufficient for a positive demand                for   annui-

ties.       With actuarially fair annuities (A=1—), (9) is satisfied.


        It is convenient to rewrite (8), the demand for private annuities as


                          Q(p,A) =
                                     q1(p,A)(I     + Y — T) — q2(p,A)S                          (lOa)

where


                                             =                                                  (lob)
                                                 [1—q1(p,A)]A1
Since Q1(p,A) < 1 and 8q118p < 0, it follows from (lOb) that q2(p,A) > 0 and
        8
that q2
      —       >   0. Therefore, if I+Y—T > 0 and S >
                                                   — 0, then
        ap

                                                  <   .                                          (11)


II.     Equilibrium in the Private Annuity Market

     Suppose that consers are characterized by different probabil ities, p,
of dying young. We will refer to a consner with a probability p of dying
young as a type p consumer. Except for the difference in p, all consumers have
identical utility functions. Let E(p) be the fraction of young consumers with
probability of dying young less        than or equal to p.                 The support of the dis-
tribution         E(p) is [L,R) where 0 <                  <       <     1. We restrict the range of

values      of p in the population by assuming that that


                                                                                                 (12)
                                         1
                              (1—ps) (l+?)°+p11X
The effect of this assumption is to guarantee that condition (9) is satisfied

so that if S>0 is sufficiently small, then all consumers will have a positive
                                            —8—

demand for annuities.8


    A consumer's probability of dying young, p, is independent of the p of

his parent. Moreover, we assume that each individual knows his own value of p

but that annuity companies and the government are unable to determine an indi-

vidual consumer's p. e assume that there is no aggregate uncertainty; a frac-

tion p of each cohort of type p consumers will die young. Finally, we assume

that annuity companies cannot determine whether an individual consumer holds

annuities from other insurance companies. The effect of this assumption is

that the equilibrium in the annuity market will be a pooling equilibrium

rather than a separating equilibrium.9


     Assuming that annuity companies are risk—neutral and perfectly competi-

tive, the expected profits of annuity companies must be equal to zero. Let

M(p,A) be the expected profit per dollar of annuity with rate of return A

issued to a type p consumer. Therefore


                                    M(p,A) =   11   — (1—p)A                                 (13)

so thai        = A > 0. It is obvious that the equilibrium rate of return on
          ap
annuities,      A,   must lie between    R and R             : if A were less than   R   ,   then
                                                     1—p11

an annuity company could offer a rate higher than A and profitably attract all

buyers of annuities; if A were greater than
                                                         R      then annuity companies would
                                                       1-p11

suffer expected losses on all annuities sold.


     We will now show that the competitive rate of return on annuities, A,

must be less than A, the actuarially fair rate based on population average
                                        B

ity of dying young. First, we state the following well—known lemma.

LEM(A. Suppose that f(p)           0 as p p and that              f(p)dH(p) =   0.   If g(p) is


                                     B
strictly increasing, then                f(p)g(p)dH(p)       0, with strict inequality if


dH(p) is not degenerate.1°


        Let 7r(A;I+Y—T,S) be the expected profit of the annuity industry if the

private annuity rate of return is A. Observe that


                                              H
                       n(A;I+Y—T,S) = 1f M(p,A)Q*(p,A)dH(p)                                (14)


where Q*(p,A) =                   + Y — T)—q2(p,A)S is average annuity demand of type
                   q1(p,A)(I*
p consumers and 1* is the average inheritance received at birth. Using the

relation M(p.A) = M(p,A) + (l—p) (A—A) which follows from (13), we can rewrite

(14) as


                             B
                            p        —                       — pH
         ,t(A;I*+Y—T,S) =   f    M(p,A)Q*(p,A)dll(p)     + (A—A)f (1—p)Q(p,A)dH(p)         (15)




Since       M(p,X)dB(p) = 0 (fr (13) and the definition of ) and since                      < 0


(from (11)), the lemma implies that the first integral in (15) is negative.

Since (for S sufficiently nall) the second integral in (15) is positive,                     it


follows that if A>A, then n(A)<O. The result that IT(A) < 0 is, of course, a

consequence of adverse selection. Therefore, the equilibrium rate of return A

must lie in the open interval (
                                         i—p i—p

        The equilibrium rate of return on private annuities, A, must be a root of

 K       and        for which n'(A) < 0. We demonstrate in Appendix B that, in the

case of logarithmic utility ( =          1),     ir(A) is strictly concave for A > R and

thus there is a unique root A of ,t(A)                0 in     K ,_i—) and ,t'(A) < 0.11
                                                             1_EL



       The   equilibrium   annuity rate of return, A, can be expressed as a function

of I*+Y—T and S.           Observe from (lOa) that Q*(p,A) is a linearly homogeneous

function of I*+YT and S. Therefore, from (14), n(A;I*+Y-T,S) also linearly

homogeneous in. I*+Y—T and S. so that if A satisfies ,i(A;I*+Y—T,S)                 0, it also

satisfies ,i(A;(I*+Y_T),S) = 0 for any                    > 0. Hence A can be written as


                                      A =   A(I*+Y_T,S)                                     (16)

where A(.,.) is homogeneous of degree zero.


       To demonstrate that aA/,3S    <   0, recall from (lOa) that an increase in

social security benefits leads type p consumers to reduce their demand for
                                               0 q2
private annuities by q2(p,A). Since                    > 0, consumers with high p reduce

their annuity demands by more than low p consumers. Furthermore, since high p

consumers begin with a lower demand for annuities than low p consumers, the

percentage reduction in annuity demand is greatest for high p consumers. Now,

since it is the annuities sold to the high p consumers on which annuity com-

panies expect positive profits, this shift in the composition of annuity hold-

ers away from the profitable (high p) consumers leads to a reduction in
expected profits. In order to restore zero expected profits, the equilibrium
rate of return A must fall (since n'(A) < 0). Thus, the partial derivatives
of A(I*÷Y—T,S) are


                                                 <    0                                    (17a)

        III. The Steady State Effects of Changes in Social Security


        Let B(p) denote the actual ex post bequests (per capita) left by the

group of type p consumers born at the beginning of period t.        Letting B(p)
denote the bequests (per capita) of the consumers who died young and B(p)

denote    the bequests (per capita) of the consumers who survived two periods,
and recalling   that a fraction p of type p consumers dies young, we obtain


                           B(p) =             +                               (18)
                                     pB(p)         (1—p)B(p)
The homotheticity of preferences implies that B(p) and B(p) are each propor-

tional to the expected present value of lifetime income so that (18) may be

rewritten as


                           B(p) =   O(pA)[IfY_T+çlS1                           (19)

where I is the initial bequest (per capita) received at birth; At is the

rate of return on annuities purchased at the end of period t (and which pay

off in period t+1). An   expression for 6(pAt) is given iii Appendix A. We will
asse that O<e(p1A)<1 for L <           < H12

                  H
     Define B( B(p)dH(p) to be the average bequest left by members of the


generation born at time t. It follows from (19) that

                           I   so that (dropping the time subscript) (20a) may be

                                       1-(A)
We assume that


     A fully funded social security system operates by collecting T from each

young consumer and investing the proceeds in riskiess capital earning a gross

rate of return R. In the following period the social security tax cum

interest, RT, is divided equally among the surviving consumers. Since a frac-
tion 1—p of the consumers survives to the second period, the payment S

received    by each surviving consumer is

                                            S=AT                                    (22)


where we recall that      is defined as RJ(1—.              Equation (22) shows that the
marginal rate of return implicit in the social security system, 4,                  is   A

which, as we have shown in Section II, is greater than A, the equilibrium rate

of return on private annuities. Therefore,. an actuarially fair increase in

social security taxes and benefits increases the expected present value life-

time income I + Y — T +    A1S,    for a given level of inherited wealth I.


     We will confine our    attention      to a small increase in S and T starting

frc am initial steady state in which S=O.              It follows immediately from (lTb)


that a(I*+Y_T)I S=O = 0 so that


                                    dAt          — 8A < 0
                                                 —                                  (23)
                                           S=0

Thus, an increase in fully funded          social security reduces the steady state
                                                — 13   —


rate    of return on annuities.


       Henceforth, we   asse   that a1 (logarithmic utility) so that, as shown in

Appendix D, '(A) < 0. The state state level of bequests is found by substi—

tuting (22) into (21) to obtain



                            B = p(A)             (Y+(A— 1)S)                                     (24)
                                      1-0(A)


       Differentiating (24) with respect to S yields




                          (A) [A        -               +    '(A)       y dAp       > 0         (25)
             dS S0 =       —                                  —            dS s=o
                         1—0(A)                             (1—0(A))4



where the inequality follows from A<A              ,   0'(A)<O and (23). The increase in B*
occurs for two reasons. First, since social security pays a higher rate of

return than private annuities, the introduction of social security raises (by

(A1 —    X 1)dS)    the expected present value of lifetime resources for a given

initial wealth. Second, the fall in A causes the share of lifetime resources

passed on as bequests, (A), to rise. Therefore, the factor                                    in (21)
                                                                                    1 —( A)
rises.


       Next we examine the effect of social security on the steady state level

of average consumption of the young. 4                 , where


                                  4   = (A)(B*+Y—T+AS)
where


                                            B
                                                6(p,A)dB(p)<1                                   (26b)
                                           — 14 —


With   logarithmic utility, (A)           is invariant to A. Therefore, the effect of
social    security on 4         is proportional to the effect on B*+Y_T+AT'S which
increases     as a result of three effects:       (1) B* rises as shown in (25); (2)

since the       gross    return on social security, SIT, exceeds A, it follows that

—T+AS rises for a given A; and (3) A falls as shown in (23) so that, A1S,

the present value of the social security payment, rises. Therefore, the

expected present value of lifetime resources rises and a fortiori the average

consumption of young consumers also rises.14


       The steady state private capital stock at the end of a period is equal to

the saving of young consumers B*+Y—T—c1*. In a fully funded social security

system, the end—of--period capital stock held by the government is T.               The

steady state national capital stock K                 is the sum of private capital and

government capital


                                                                                   (27)

Substituting (24) and (26a) into (27) yields

                                        1-(A)
Differentiating (28) with respect to S, we obtain

Since '(A)<O it follows from (23) that the first term on the right hand side
                                          1
of (29) is positive. Since A>A                the second term on the right hand side of

(29)   will   be positive if  <(A)<1. In        this case, the right hand side of (29)

is     unambiguously     positive so that       the introduction of fully funded social

IV.   Conclusion


      In this paper 'we have developed an overlapping generations model based on

individual utility maximization subject to uncertainty about the date of

death. We used this model to examine the dynamic behavior of consimption and

bequests in an econcny 'with consiuners who have different probabilities of

dying. Even though there are markets in annuities and in riskless bonds, con—

sumers are unable to offset the introduction of actuarially fair social secu—

rity. The reason is that adverse selection in the private annuity market

leads to a rate of return on private annuities which is lower than the rate of

return implicit in compulsory social security.


      The introduction of actuarially fair social security raises the steady

state average levels of bequests and first—period consimption; it reduces the

steady state rate of return on private annuities. If the bequest      motive is

sufficiently weak, then an increase in fully funded social security benefits

reduces private wealth by more than one—for--one. With a sufficiently strong

bequest motive, an increase in social security taxes crowds out private wealth

by less than one—for—one.

1.   The seminal work in this area is Yaari (1965), which provided the frame-
     work for later work by Eakausson (1969), Fischer (1973), Richard (1975),
     Levhari and Mirnian (1977), Barro and Friedman (1977) and Kotlikoff and
     Spivak (1981).

2.   Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981) examine the role of the family in providing
     an (incomplete) annuities market but stop short of a full—scale overlap-
     ping generations model in which the intra—cohort distribution of bequests
     is determined endogenously.

3.   See Kotlikoff, Shoven and Spivak (1983) and Karni and Zilcha (1984) for
     interesting extensions of the overlapping generations model in which con-
     sumers within a cohort have different ex post mortality experiences.

4.   Their analysis is more general than an analysis of annuity markets which
     are based on lifetime uncertainty; it applies more generally to mandatory
     insurance as a partial remedy for adverse selection in insurance markets.
     In particular, Eckstein, Eichenbaum and Peled pay careful attention to
     various concepts of equilibrium.

5.   We follow Yaari (1965), Hakansson (1969), Fischer (1973) and Richard
     (1975) in specifying utility as a function of the size of the bequest
     left to one's heir. An alternative formulation which also gives rise to
     a bequest motive is to specify utility as a function of one's heir's
     utility as in Barro (1974) and Drazen (1978).

          The specification of utility as a function of the size of the
     bequest left to one's heir was chosen for tractability. The substantive
     results of this paper do not depend on choosing this specification rather
     than the specification suggested by Barro (1974). In particular, the
     fast that social security affects consumption and capital accumulation
     depends, not on the particular specification of the bequest motive, but
     rather on the fact that adverse selection drives a wedge between the
     rates of return on social security and on private annuities. In the
     absence of adverse selection, fully funded social security would not
     affect consumption regardless of whether the bequest motive is specified
     as in this paper or as in Barro (1974).

6.   Sheshinski and Weiss (1981) have derived a similar result in a model
     which is similar in spirit, but different in detail from the model in
     this paper.

7.   If A > j, then all of the results in this paragraph are reversed.

8.   To derive this implication, we observe that (as will be argued below)

     less than pH since this term can be written as
                                     —i
     [1 +   (1H)[(1          +      )a    )a_1])1E Therefore, given H X, and a, the set

     of possible values for                    is not empty.


            Since we have shown that (12) implies that N(PH, RL) > 0, it foi-
                                                                                     l—p

     (12) holds. Therefore, equation (12) implies that q1(p,A)> 0, since the

     denominator of the right hand side of (A—8b) is positive.

9.   The Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) demonstration that there cannot be a
     pooling equilibrium depends on their assumption "that customers can buy
     only one insurance contract". As they point out themselves, "this is an
     objectionable assumption" (p. 632). The appropriate equilibrium concept
     in the presence of monitoring of purchases from other companies still
     requires further research. The equilibrium described in this paper has
     some desirable characteristics and is suitable for our purposes.

11. More generally, when a is not equal to one we ave not ruled out multi-
     ple roots of ir(A) = 0 in the interval (                        L'—
                                                      Nonetheless, we can
     rule out as possible equilibria those ro fo1rwhich i'(A) > 0 by
     observing that if such an A were the prevailing rate of return on private
     annuities, a firm could offer a slightly higher rate of return and pro-
     fitably attract all annuity purchases. Thus the equilibrium rate A is
     characterized by n'(A) < 0. Henceforth, we assume that this inequality
                                    —3—

    holds strictly.

12. See Appendix C for conditions under which O(p,A)<1.

13. In Appendix C, we present condition under which O<e(A)<1. Thesecondi—
     tions guarantee that B*>O if Y—T+A S>O and will guarantee that B
    approaches the steady state B* monotonically.

14. It can also be shown that wth with logarithmic utility the introduction
     of actuarially fair social security leads to an increase in the amount of
     riskiess bonds held in the portfolios of young consumers. This result
     fllows froin1the fact that riskless bond holdings are proportional to
    A(I+Y—T+A S). (Substitut4g (A—3b) into (A15b) i Appendix A and then
    sehing e equal to 1 yields 6 = [I+&(l—p+X)1
                                                p&.Rj.) Since theAintro_
    duction of social security leads to a reduction in X, the factor
    rises. We have already shown that the steady state expected presen
    value of lifetime income rises with the introduction of social security.

     In this Appendix we calculate the optimal values of 01,c2,                    and BS for

the case in which U() and V() each have constant relative risk aversion equal

Substituting (A—la—c) into the lifetime budget constraint (5)                  yields

Re—writing (A—2) , we obtain

The average bequest left by a type p consumer, B*(p), is equal to

PBD +     (i_p)BS.       Therefore, from (A—3) and (A—5) it follows that


                                   B*(p) =   O(p,A)(I+Y—T+AS)              (A—6a)

        Finally we calculate the demand for private annuities by substituting

(A—ib) and (A—ic) into (4) to obtain

     First we differentiate (14) twice ,{th respect to A to obtain

Differentiating (lOb) with respect to A and using (B4) we obtain

                                    R =   (l_p*)A                                    (C2)


    Frc*i   the definition of 6(p,A) in (A—6b)      and using (A—3b) and (A—4b) it

can be shown that with logarithmic utility (a = 1)


                           O(p,A)                                                    (C3)
                                    6(p)8)A[(l—p)2+p2]
Then using (Cl) and (C2), we may rewrite (C3) as


                               O(p,A) =   6(p)BRy(p,p*)                              (C4}


    Differentiating     y(p,q) twice with respect to p and q demonstrates that

y(p,q) is strictly convex in p and in q so that


                               (p,q) 1[y(pL,q), y(pHq)]                              (C5)




                                                                 H
                          sup y(p,q) =    max[y(pp   ''    7'P'P

It can also be shown that


                               mm    y(p,q)   =   y(p,p)   = X                       (C7)



Combining   (C5),   (C6) and (C7 ), we obtain
                     y(p,q) < x[y(pL,p11), 7(R,L)] for                                      (C8)



     Note that for a given p'-' (or PH), .y(pL,pH) and (H,L) are maximized by

maximizing          (or minimizing DL). Recall, however, that we have restricted

the values of L and p11 in (12) in order to asse positive demands for annui—
                                                                               H
ties by all consiers. Setting p- equal to its lower bound                          yields



                                              < j(l—p11+X)(X+p11)                           (C9)


Similarly, setting p =        1+XL       we   obtain


                              7(LH) ( J(1_L÷),)+L)                                          (do)

Frmi (C9) and (do), it follows that



                          y(p,q) < 1[X+X2+max(pI1-p11 lL)]                                  (Cli)

From (Cli) it   follows that

                            y(p,q)   <   1         if      < pL < p11                   (C12a)

                                         or if 2 <                                      (C12b)

Thus horn (C4) and (C12), and recalling the definitions of                 and ,    we have



                    0 <      if    8K . 1 and if .       < max[pl,(3/4)i1'2]                (c13)



     Next we establish conditions under which Ô < 8 < 1. It follows immedi-

ately from (C4) that


                          6(p,A) 1 8K         sup 0(p)
                                                             K
                                                           sup   y(p,q.)                    (Cl4)



Since                             (H_L)(l_LR) it follows from (Cli) that if

        1 1, then
                       p y(p,q)                    =
                                                       (1+pj                       (C15)




Using the definition of (p). (C15) may be rewritten as




                 L
                     sup (p,q)
                            H           ô(p)
                                               )+ ,       f   pL+pll< 1.               (C16)

                p ..p,qIp
Using (C16) and the fact that      sup 0(p) =   Ø(H),    (C14) yields




                     O(pA) < H (l_6(H))+P < H, if          + pH < 1                    (C17)



     Now suppose that 6 = H =      =1   and that pL+pH.. 1.    It follows from (Cu)

that 6(p,A) < 1 and hence 6 < 1.     It follows from (C4) and (C8) that

O(p,A) ..   6(p) with strict inequality for p    p.     Therefore 6 >      SO   that    we

have established the existence of parameter values for which                < 1.

       In this Appendix, we show that with logarithmic utility (a                      1), '(A)1O

if S =   0.      It follows from the definition of (A) in (20b) that



                                                   =
                                                       h1dfl(p)                               (Dl)


Differentiating (C3) with respect to A yields


                              1LPA1 = _(p)o[pR+(l_p)(A_R)]M.AJ                                (D2)

Substituting (Dl) into (D2) yields


                                               H
                                          =   —tf(p)g(p)dH(p)<0 if S0                        (D3a)

The inequality in (D3a) follows immediately from the Lemma after observing

         H
that I       f(p)dfl(p)   =            ir(A) = 0 and showing that g1(p)O. Below, we show
                              (A—R)2

that if S=O, then g'(p)>O.


        Using (lOa), (A4b) and (A8b) we find that with logarithmic utility and

S= 0



                                       a(Q/•) =                                                (D4)

Differentiating (D3c) with respect to p and using (D4) yields
