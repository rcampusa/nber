         An Exploration Into the Determinants of Research Intensity



                                 ABSTRACT



      This paper explores the economic factors which determine the variation of

research effort across firms. The intra—industry coefficient of variation of

research intensity is much larger than those of traditional factors. We show

that this important fact is consistent with the theoretical argument that know-

ledge possesses unique economic characteristics, and that the demand for research

depends both on the parameters of the production function for knowledge and on

the ability of the firm to appropriate the benefits from the knowledge it produces.

We propose and implement a framework for decomposing the observed intra—industry

variance In research intensity into three components: demand inducement, a firm—

specific structural parameter, and errors in the observed variables. The main

empirical findings are that errors in the variables (especially research) are

important, that very little of the structural variance in research intensity is

accounted for by demand inducement, and that the bulk of the variance is related

to differences in the firm—specific parameter. Both the theoretical and empirical

analysis indicate that it is not reasonable to treat the demand for research in a

manner analogous to the demand for traditional Inputs, including capital. Sub-

stantially richer models are required to provide insight into the structure of in-

centives driving the demand for research.

                           RESEARCH INTENS ITY*



                              Introduction

       The recent interest of economists in the process of techno-

logical change derives in part from the unique economic charac-

teristics of knowledge. These characteristics, discus8ed formally

by Arrow (1962), indicate the likelihood of a divergence between the

private and social rates of return to research resources devoted to

producing new knowledge. It should not be surprising that these

same characteristics also affect the derived demand for research by

profit—oriented firms. This paper explores the economic factors

which determine the distribution of research effort across firms.

These factors are known as cross—sectional inducement mechanisms.

There are three sets of competing explanations in the literature,

each emphasizing a different aspect of the problem.

       Schmookler (1966), and Griliches and Schmookler (1963),

emphasize the importance of expected market size as an inducement to

research   effort.   They recognize that the cost of reproducing the

knowledge generated by research is low relative to the original cost

of producing it, and that the private return to research therefore

varies directly with the number of units of output in which the

knowledge is embodied, or the size of the market. Differences across


                                   1
                                                                       2



Industries in the cost of producing knowledge are downplayed, on

the argument that scientific knowledge is sufficiently well

developed to make the supply for new industrial knowledge highly

elastic at the same level of costs for all industries. Rosenberg

(1963, 1969 and 1974), while granting the importance of market size,
argues that the body of scientific and engineering knowledge grows

at different rates in different areas and that the application of

such knowledge to industries is more circumscribed than Griliches

and Schmookler suggest. He concludes that these differences in the

cost of producing industrial knowledge, or technological opportunity

are a major determinant of the observed distribution of research

effort. Schumpeter (1950), on the other hand, argues that research

effort generates temporary monopoly power for the innovating firm.

Since knowledge has a low reproduction cost, any economic unit aware

of the information embodied in an innovation can exploit it. Hence

the private benefits from the production of knowledge must be a

result of quasi—rents accruing to the producer of the innovation.

The key to this process is the ability of the firm to appropriate

the monetary benefits from the knowledge it produces. Schumpeter

therefore emphasizes the determinants of the degree of appropriability,

such as entrepreneurial ability, industrial market structure, and the

general institutional framework (including patent rights) in which

 the firm operates. Finally, any study which specifies empirical

measures of research effort and their relationship to economically

 useful knowledge must give careful attention to the influence of
                                                                            3


measurement and specification errors on the observed distribution

of research expenditures.

         These different issues in cr088—sectional inducement remain

unresolved and unintegrated into a general framework. This paper

presents a unified framework for analyzing interfirm differences in

research expenditures which takes account of the unique characteris-

tics of knowledge as an economic commodity. The model postulates

Cobb—Douglas production relationships and results in equations

determining the intensity of use of all inputs. Traditional factor

intensities in such a framework depend only on production function

parameters. The optimum research intensity depends, in addition, on

expected growth rates and appropriability. The intra—industry

coefficient of variation in research intensity in the comprehensive

cross—section of American manufacturing firms examined is more than

seven times as large as the coefficient of variation in traditional

factor intensities (1.81 compared with 0.24). This in itself

supports the theoretical arguments which indicate that research

demand   is   determined by a more complex set of factors than the demand

for traditional inputs and suggests that the inducement mechanisms

described in the literature do discriminate among firms.

         The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 specifies the

production function for knowledge which underlies the cost side of

the determinant8 of research demand. In Section 2 a model of the

private returns to new Industrial knowledge is presented. It is

shown that the cost of production and the returns from the use of new
                                                                       4



industrial knowledge jointly determine the private rate of return

to research resources and, in a profit—oriented economy, the

research intensity of the firm. Section 3 specifies the structure of

the stochastic terms. Section 4 applies the model to an examination

of the intra—industry variance in research intensity. Concluding

remarks provide a brief summary of results and a discussion of

implications.




                    1. Production Relationships


       This paper is limited to an analysis of an extended Cobb—

Douglas production function. Research resources enter the production

process by raising the productivity of traditional factors of

production in a disembodied maimer. Problems involved in the

construction of R&D variables have made this simple type of speci-

fication the most widely used framework in the empirical analysis of

the role of research resources in production, and in this respect the

data base used here is no exception.1 The general limitations of

 this type of framework have been ably discussed by Griliches (1973

 and 1975), and we will not repeat them here. Our specification

 differs from the one chosen by Griliches (1975) in two respects.

 First, we decompose "research resources" into its component inputs,

 research labor and research capital. Second, we explicitly incorpor-

 ate both an R&D gestation lag and a rate of obsolescence of produced
                                                                                5


 knowledge. Both of these parameters become determinants of the

 R&D intensity of the firm.

          The following discussion sets out the basic set of production

 relationships. We begin with the traditional production function:



               Q = y0KN H                                                      (1).


where


                    =     a constant, which may be both firm and time specific

               K =        stock of accumulated and still productive, own-
                          produced knowledge

               N   traditional labor services
                    =

               H = traditional capital services
               Q    = output (value added)

and all firm and        time   subscripts have been omitted for convenience.
Since   the stock of knowledge K is an unobservable variable, its units

are arbitrary. Hence, without loss of generality it has been

normalized such that       a   one percent increase in K raises output by

one percent.

         The generation of knowledge is summarized by its production

function:



                t - ALa
               kG   —
                     i (t—e)cb(t—e)                                            (2

where
                                                                      6



               =   the gross-increment in own-produced knowledge at t

                   specific

          Lte = research      labor services at t - 8

          C0 =     research capital services at t -     8


             U =   the   me     betweOn the time research is
                              lag
                   undertaken and its embodiment in the traditional
                   production processes of the firm



        Equation (2) states that knowledge is produced by research

labor and research capital and that the form of the production function

is Cobb-Douglas.2 Since the development of either a new technique or

new product requires the use of research resources over an extended

period of time, one would expect a distributed lag relationship to

connect the deployment of research resources and the resultant

increases in the firm's productivity.3 Since our data cannot sustain

an investigation of this distributed lag, we use the simplification of

a mean lag which applies to all units of research resources equally.

It should also be noted that we assi.ne the parameters a and b to

be the same for all firms in a given industry. These, plus the

firm-specific constant A1, are indices of what Scherer (1965) calls

the "technological opport'unity" of the industry. Variation in A1,

a and b reflects differences in the cost of producing new industrial

knowledge, or in Rosenberg's terms (1969), differences in the "supply

side" determinants of the rate of technical progress.

         Assuming geometric decay of knowledge at the rate of            and

 taking the growth rates of research capital and research labor to be

 constant both during and prior to the period of analysis (as required

 by our data), the net increment to                          is:4

stock   of productive knowledge becomes:

                              1+aL+bC

         This concludes the specification of the production

relationships. However, the next section will require expressions for

the reduction in unit costs attributable to an increase in research

labor and   research        capital. Assuming that the firm is a cost minimizer

facing fixed input prices, the unit cost function associated with (1)

can be expressed as


                    =       h(w,pH)
                               K                                                 (5)


where Z represents unit costs, and w and
                                                            denote the (fixed)
wage and rental rates for traditional labor and
                                                         capita] services,

respectively. Substituting (4) into (5) and differentiating the cost

            2. Private Rates of Return to Research Resources

                   and Optimal Research Input Intensities


           In the American economy the bulk of industrial research is

 performed by firms. If these firms are motivated by potential

 profits, the level of their research effort will be determined by the

  expected net income generated by investment in research resources.

 As a result, the large observed intra—industry variance in research

  intensity should be attributable to the variance in the expected

  private returns to research. The objective factors which could cause

  differences in the expected net income generated by the use of

  research resources are: 1) variation in the costs of research inputs;

  2) differences in the productivity of research resources in generat-

  ing usable industrial knowledge; and 3) differences in the ability to

  derive monetary benefits from a given unit of produced knowledge.

           Variation in costs of research inputs will be incorporated

  into the model and discussed in the next section. In connection with
                                                                         9



the productivity of research resources, the basic model assumes that

all firms in a given "industrytt produce a single homogeneous output

subject    to the same production   conditions (as specified in the previous

section),   and the model is tested separately on each "industry" in
our data set. Consequently, differences in the expected returns from
research beyond those caused by differences in the cost of research

inputs    will be associated with differences in the ability to derive

monetary benefits from a given unit of produced knowledge. However,

the industries in the data set are defined quite broadly, so there

could be some intraindustry differences in the output elasticity of

research resources. At this stage, we do not separate these supply

side differences from those in the ability to capture the monetary

benefits from knowledge. We return to this problem in the concluding

remarks.

          The difficulty in specifying a mechanism which determines

the stream of private benefits that accrue to new industrial knowledge

is a result of the fact (stressed by Arrow, 1962) that knowledge has

no, or a very small, cost of reproduction. Hence, the realized social

rate of return to an innovation will vary directly with the number of

units of output in which is it embodied. However, the fact that

knowledge has no cost of reproduction also has implications for the

characteristics of the private returns accruing to the producers

of an innovation. Since any economic unit aware of the information

embodied in the innovation can exploit it, the private benefits from

the production of industrial knowledge must be a result of quasi-

rents, or temporary monopolies, accruing to the producer of the
                                                                             10


innovation.5      The strength of these monopolies, that is, the abilities

of firms to appropriate the benefits from the knowledge which they

have developed, will determine the private return to research resources

and therefore the research intensity of finns. In short, the private

return to the development of a new cost-reducing technique will depend

on the number of units of output embodying this new knowledge and the

fraction of the cost reduction attributable to the innovation which

is appropriated     by   the innovating firm.

          We   begin   by reviewing the maximum appropriability environment,"

first described by Arrow (1962) and subsequently adapted to determine

the rate of return to research resources by Nordhaus (1969b). Consider

a constant cost industry in competitive equilibrium and an innovation

which reduces the cost of production for the f inns in the industry

and only for such finns. The maximum appropriabi]ity environment is

based   on the assumption     that the innovator patents the innovation

costlessly and leases the cost-reducing technique to all firms in the

industry (including itself), subject to the condition that the final

product   must sell at a uniform price           to consuming units. The lease

can be defined in terms of a royalty per unit of output produced with

the innovation, p0. The lessor acts as a monopolist and sets the

initial royalty so as to maximize profits subject to the constraint

that the royalty plus the new cost of production (p0 + Z1)             is less

than or   equal   to the pre— innovation cost of production (Z0 =P0).

In   virtually all cases the profit—maximizing royalty at the date
of introduction will be p0 =       Z0
                                        —
                                            Z1
                                                 =   Z. 6
                                                                                 11




         Since the maximum appropriability environment assumes that

the lessor will capture the direct potential benefits from all firms

in the industry, the revenue collected in the first year of the

innovation in that appropriability environment is the shaded region

in Figure 1, or p0Q               = ZQ where        Q   denotes the industry output

in the year the innovation is introduced. Arrow does not consider

the entire stream of revenues accruing to an innovation, nor does he

allow for the possibility of less than full appropriability. We-now

extend Arrow's discussion to allow for non-maximal, firm specific

appropriability environments and for the calculation of the entire

revenue stream accruing to the innovation.

        Let              be the fraction of industry output from which firm

1   receives   royalties on its innovation of age r,                p be the royalty
per unit of output, and Bit be total revenues accruing to the

innovation in year r. Then


               B.0 =                      =
                                 p.0k.Q        Zk.QQ                              (7)




and the discounted value of the stream of revenues generated by the

innovation (II)         is


               It   =
                             f   Bite_ttdr =    f   pitkjtQe_rtdt                 (8)



where r is the discount rate.

       The specification of non-maximal, firm-specific appropriability

environments is based on the following two assumptions:

        1. It is easier, or less costly, for a firm to capture the

benefits of the knowledge it produces through embodiment in its own

output (internal appropriation) than through embodiment in the output

of other firms.

        2. The revenues accruing to an innovation decline with the age

of the innovation.

        Internal appropriation is less costly because of the

difficulties involved in establishing a market for information.

First, prospective purchasers do not know the value of the information

before it is purchased, and the information cannot be secured in

divisible quantities. Second, the purchaser of the information may

resell it, or "reshape" and sell it, thereby undermining the original

seller's monopoly position. As a result, the information is not

likely to be sold to all potential users and the innovator will not

be able to capture the full benefits of the information from those

firms which do purchase it.7 By contrast, internal appropriati.on of
                                                                       14




the information is not subject to these marketing constraints, at

least not to the same degree.

        There are three factors which may cause revenues accruing to

the innovation to decline over time. First, new techniques will be

developed which either displace or partly substitute for the original

innovation.    Second, the use of the information in any   productive way

will reveal and spread it, in part by inspection of the resultant

output and the mobility of personnel among firms. This will tend to

erode the monopoly power of the innovator, thereby reducing either the

unit royalty which can be charged or the part of industry output. from

which royalties accrue, or both. Third, the accumulation (by a single

firm or group of collusive firms) of small innovations over time is

equivalent (in terms of cost reduction) to a large innovation. This

will eventually violate the Arrow royalty condition, which in turn

reduces the unit royalty that accrues to at least one of the

innovations.

        In order to maintain a specification which is both as general

as possible and consistent with the preceding two assumptions, we let

        We will interpret the parameters in the following manner:

6 is the rate of decay in the unit royalty, e                   is the proportion

of firm i's share of industry output from which the firm receives

this royalty, and ek is the (geometric) mean of this proportion over

all firms in the industry. However, it is impossible to distinguish

                                                                    k+k.
empirically between a rate of decay in the proportion e                     and 6,

or between a firm specific component in the rate of decay and eki.

Since appropriable revenues alone suffice to determine the private

benefits from an innovation, it is immaterial whether the firm specific

component applies to the royalty (the price side of revenues) or to

the number of units from which the firm receives these royalties (the

quantity side of revenues). Hence, these relationships may be

interpreted as saying that the revenues generated by a given innovation

of age t depend upon: 1) the importance of the innovation .Z; 2) the

age of the innovation t (through the rate of obsolescence of the

przvate returns from knowledge 6); 3) a firm-specific structural

parameter    eki which determines the extent to which the firm can

monopolize the information produced by its research resources; and
                                                                               16


4)    the expected output of the innovating firm                because   of the

relative ease of internal appropriation.8

          To obtain the present value of revenues generated by the

employment of the marginal unit           of   research labor at time t

substitute (6a), (7), and (9) into (8). Setting the price of output

equal to one (as it implicitly is in our data) and recalling from

(6a) that the cost reduction does not occur until 0 years after the

employment   of the unit of research           labor, we have

where g is the expected rate of growth of output of firm i.

Equating ItL to the wage rate for research labor (wy), taking a

first order Taylor's expansion of log(5+r-g) around log(6+r) and

rearranging terms, we can, express the optimal research labor intensity
      9
as:




                         wL
                log(——) = log             8c

        An analogous procedure for determining the optimal research

capital intensity yields:

                     PC
                            =
                                log   81

                                                       k              (llb)


where


                 =


and P is the price of research capital services.

        Several features of equations. (ha) and (llb) are worth noting.

First, since the returns from both research labor and research capital

are derived from the returns to industrial knowledge, any factor which

affects the returns to knowledge will influence the optimal intensities

 of both the research variables. It is this important fact which

 permits econometric identification of the relative importance of the

 unobserved structural parameter (kr) in determining the research

 intensities of firms.

        Second, equations (ila) and (llb) indicate that the firm's

 employment of research resources will vary directly with its

 expected market size and its "appropriability base," and inversely

 with the rate of obsolescence and the rate of discount. The

 importance of expected market size in determining the optimal level

 of research resources follows directly from the fact that knowledge
                                                                         18


                               10
has no cost of reproduction.        Schmookler (1966) demonstrated the

empirical importance of this point at an inter-industry level, while

Griliches (1958) has shown the dominant influence of expected

market size in determining the relative social rates of return to

hybrid seed innovations.
         The structural parameter k1) reflects the extent to which

a firm can capture the benefits from the cost-reducing innovations it

develops. This will be determined jointly by the market structure of

the industry (e.g., similarity of firms in terms of market power,

production processes employed, research orientation, ease of imitation),

the abilities of the entrepreneur or manager of the firm, and the

general institutional setting in which the firm operates--factors

associated with the Schumpeterian tradition.

         Third, for a given value of initial revenues accruing to an

innovation, the higher is the rate of obsolescence (5), the smaller

the   total value of private benefits from the innovation and therefore
the   less intense will be the research effort. Moreover, since research

produces a stock (knowledge) whose benefits accrue over the future,

the optimal research intensity will vary inversely with the rate of

discount. Finally, the longer the gestation lag (0), the larger

is   the influence of the future in determining the returns to RD, and
hence the more important the effect of expected growth on the optimal
R.PD intensity.12

         The model presented here posits a set of firms which produce

knowledge from research resources, and produce output by combining
                                                                        19


this knowledge with traditional factors of production. The price of

output is determined by the cost of traditional factors plus quasi-

rents generated by temporary monopoly power over the information

produced by the research resources. It is important to realize that

there will be no private benefits from the employment of research

resources without some degree of monopoly power. The       unique
characteristics   of knowledge as a corvnodity imply that the private
rate of return to research resources must be determined jointly by
the parcvneters of the production function for knowledge and the ability
of the firm to internalie the benefits from the knowledge it produces.
 This   point seems to be incompletely understood in the literature.




                  3. Structure and Identification of the

                          Three Equation Model


          The basic structural form of the model consists of factor demand

 equations for research labor, research capital and traditional labor.

By adding the relevant stochastic terms, this section converts the

model into an estimable form. Actually, two stochastic specifications

are investigated. The first specification, which imposesa fairly

stringent set of assumptions on the properties of the errors, produces

a simple three equation model and a transparent identification scheme.

The second specification relaxes the more stringent assumptions on the

errors, and enables both a more complete set of tests of the model and

an investigation of the intertemporal stability of the appropriability

parameter. The cost of this generality, however, is a more complicated
                                                                                      20


six equation    model. In this section we describe the three equation

model. The empirical results for this model and a summary of the

additional information in the six-equation model are presented in the

next section.

        Letting asterisks denote the optimal levels of each variable

and adding the factor demand equation for traditional labor to (ha)

and (llb), the structural form of the model is written as:


                log W   + log    L* -   log Q* = log             +   3g*   +
                                                                                k1   (12a)


                log P + log C* - log Q* =             log        +   cg*   -'   k.   (12b)


                log w +   log   N* -    log Q* = log       5                         (l2c)


        It is assumed     that    a firm's expected growth rate equals its

averge past growth rate plus a component which reflects common

expectational changes in the trend of industry demand.13 That is:


                 g =      g+            for   i = 1    .    .   .n                     (13)



 where j. is the average past growth rate of firm i, and tg is

 the commonly held, expected difference between the average past and

 future growth rates.

         The variable in (12) denoted by Q* is expected output, i.e.,

 the value of output upon which input decisions are made. We follow

 Mundlak and Hoch (1965) in assuming "partial transmission" of the error

 in output to the input decision-making process. Letting the
                                                                                 21


               °
superscript        denote the observed value of a variable, we have:

                      =
                                 Y112h1
                                  H e q q


and

                                                  1111
                   Q° = E[QOIflq] = y0KN 1N         2e q



where



                   E(Vq)
                             =
                                 E(Tlq)
                                          =   0   and   E[v] =                    (14)

          In   the context of the "simultaneity" literature, the partial
transmission       assumption is quite general, encompassing both the full

transmission assumption of Marschak and Andrews (1944) and the zero

transmission assumption of Zellner et al. (1966) as special cases. 14


The disturbance              should be interpreted as resulting from firm
                       TIq

specific   differences in management and            technology, and   the effect of

transitory factors which are known before input decisions are made.

The term     VqI on the other hand, results from            transitory factors which

are not    known before input decisions ate made,           such as machine

breakdowns, and from measurement error.

          The observed level of each factor of production differs from
its optimal level by an error which has two components, a decision

component resulting from an inoptimal choice of factor levels and a

pure measurement component. Letting c. be the sum of the two errors

for factor j         we have:
                                                                            22


              c°   = C*eC

                   =   L*e                                                 (15)


              N° = N*efl


where E(e.) = 0    and V(c.) =         for   j =   c,L,n.
          What remains is to specify the covariance structure of the

various error components, and it is in this specification that the

three and six equation models differ.

          It is quite conmon to assume that             is independent of the
                                                   Vq
errors in the various factors)5 That is,


               E(VqCj) =     0   for   j =   c,,n                           (16)'



The reasoning is twofold. First, since there are independent measures

of each variable, there is no reason to expect any correlation between

their respective measurement errors. Second, the non-measurement

component   of vq is due to acts of nature such as weather conditions
and machine performance (see Zeilner et al. [1966]), whereas the
decision component of the factor errors occurs before the realization

of        and is due to human (management) error. Assumption (16) is
     Vq
accepted a priori in the three equation model but is subjected to a

test in the six equation model described below.

          The three equation model also assumes a zero covariance among

the errors in the various factors. That is:


               E(cc.) = 0        for p j       and      p,j =   c,Z,n       (17)
                                                                             23




Since the underlying assumptions of behavioral models which result in

the error structure in (17) are not very persuasive, the six equation

model will allow for free correlation among the factor errors. The

advantage of the three equation model based on (17) is its simplicity

and, as the six equation results will demonstrate, the bias due to the

simplification in (17) is minimal.            16




       For the remainder of the analysis it will prove convenient

to redefine all variables as deviations from their sample means, but

for simplicity we leave the notation unchanged. With this under-

standing, substitution of        (13), (14) and (15) into (12) yields the

following system of equations in observed or manifest dependent

variables:


                                                                            (18a)
                1ogw+logL°_lOgQ° =                   ci+kj+cc_Vq
                log PC +   log   C° -   log   Q°   = cli + + -              (l8b)

                log w +    log N° - log   Q°       =   - vs                 (18c)


System (18a) -   (18c) forms     a set   of factor share equations for research

labor and capital, and traditional labor with the structure of the

 stochastic terms incorporated.

        The identification of the various components from (19) is

straightforward.    Any factor         which affects the returns to the   production
of knowledge   will affect the optimal intensities of both research

resources. Consequently, the covariance between the disturbances in

the two research intensity equations will capture a. However, this

covariance also picks up any measurement or expectational error in

output (Vq) Since the traditional labor intensity equation will also

contain the error in output, a can be identified by the covariance

between the research intensity and the traditional labor demand

equations. Finally, the variances of the errors in the research

resource variables are calculated as the residual portion of the

research intensity equations. It is also clear from (19) that if
                                                                                 25

                                          2
        0, then the estimate of               will be biased upwards or downwards

according as             0. However, the       consistency   of the estimated

is   unaffected by any correlation        among the factor errors.

          Let   us return to the variance in research intensity. The
research expenditures of a firm are calculated as the sum of the firm's
expenditures on research labor and research capital. That is:

                     =   wL°+PC°
                          r   c                                                 (20)

Since we define research capital to           include all RD expenditures other

than   payments to scientists and engineers, (20) is an identity.
Analogously, we define the optimal level of research expenditures as
the sum of the optimal levels of expenditures on research capital and
research labor:

                R* = wL*
                      r          +PC
                                   c                                            (21)

Substituting     (12a) and   (l2b) into (21), and using (20), (21) and the
error   components in (15), the observed research intensity can be

expressed   in terms of the structural parameters of the model as:

                 log R° - log    Q°   =       +    +    -                       (22)

where

                 t   =       +   (l-)c
and

                     =   a/(a+b)
                                                                                            26


        Equation (22) is definitionally equal to a linear combination

of (18a) and (l8b). Hence, any two linearly independent combination

of these three equations contain all the information available in the

data. The form of the data made it easier to estimate an equation

for research expenditures than for research capital. Therefore, the

system of factor share equations which will be estimated is:


             log R° -       log   Q°   =        +       +           + (1- 1I))c   +        (23a)
                                                                                      vq

             log   W   + log L° - log      Q°       = k1        +                          (23b)
                                                                            LCc)
             log w + log N° - log          Q°       =       -                              (23c)

which has the following variance-covariance matrix of disturbances:

                2      22           22 2
               Ok+     a+(l) ac+aq

                    (19)a- (19)22                               (+o)                        (24)

                             q                                                    qn
where     may be consistently estimated by the antilog of the constant

term in (23b). Of course, all the comments that applied to (18) and

(19) apply equally to (23) and (24).

        The parameters from (23) and (24) [or from (18) and (19)1

permit a decomposition of the variance in research intensity into

three components: 1) variance due to differences in the expected growth

rate of the internal appropriability base of the firm (a2a)

2) variance caused by differences in the appropriability parameter
                                                                                  27

(at) which determines the private benefits accruing to a cost—reducing
innovation,.given the internal appropriability base of the firm; and
3) variance      caused by measurement and decision errors in research
resources   and in expected output.

          In addition (24) allows for one formal and one informal test

of the underlying model. The system can         be       estimated with and without

the imposition of a zero covariance term between the disturbances from

equations    (23b) and   (23c). Under the null hypothesis that the            -




assumptions   of the model are true against the alternative that
         0 and/or       0, the ratio of the constrained to the
unconstrained log likelihood ratio will distribute asymptotically as
  2 18                                               .
          Also, of course, there are non-negativity restrictions on
 X1.
 all the estimated variances. Since these restrictions are equivalent

 to a ranking of the elements of the covariance matrix, and as such

 are not guaranteed by our estimating procedure, the non-negativity

 conditions      constitute an informal   test of the model.

          This    section begins with a brief description of the scope and

 the sources of the data, and then presents and interprets the empirical
            19
 results.         The data were gathered jointly by the National Science
                                                                          28




Foundation and the Bureau of the Census. They contain individual

company information on REED expenditures, the number of scientists and

engineers, total employment and sales--all based on the 1957-1965 annual

NSF-Census REED Surveys--and a variety of other company economic indica-

tors based on a match with the 1958 and 1968 Census of Manufacturers

and Enterprise Statistics. The data include observations on one level

year value and a corresponding growth rate for most variables.

        The sample used here consists of 433 large (1000+ employees)

firms which account for 48 percent of all RFD performed in American

industry in 1963, and 78 percent of all RED excluding Aircraft and

Missiles.20 The firms are broken down into four broad industry groups

-—Chemicals and Petroleum, Electrical and Communications Equipment,

Fabricated Metal Products and Machinery, and Motor Vehicles and other

Transport   Equipment--and the analysis is   performed on each of these

industries    separately.
        The data contain two measures of j, the average past growth

rate in value added. The first is a nine-year (logarithmic) average of

the past growth rate in sales (11).     while   the second is calculated as

the difference between the logarithms of value added in 1963 and 1957

divided by 6           Both     and      differ from j by pure
measurement    error, but     contains an additional error due to the
                                                                      29


discrepancy between the true past growth rates in value added and

sales.   The information in both these measures can be incorporated

in the analysis by letting:


                  =
                      ,i+')1                                             (25)



              g2 =

where

                      = E(v.g) = E(v12) = 0
              E(v)
and


              V(v) =       2    for   j =   1,2

That is, the observed measures of           and g2 are both subject to

classical measurement error and the two measurement errors are assumed

to be uncorrelated.21

         Equations (23), (24) and (25) fully specify the form of the

model to be estimated. Before presenting the empirical results,

however, exogenous information is used to derive a plausible range

for a. There are two reasons for our special interest in c. Recall

that a = (l/(r+cS] +   e   where r, S and 0 are the discount rate,

the decay rate in appropriable revenues accruing to the innovation,

and the mean lag between the outlay of research resOurces and the

beginning of the associated revenue stream. The parameters cS and 8

 are key parameters in calculating the private rate of return to

 knowledge producing activities. Second, a comparison of exogenous

 information on the value of c' with the direct estimates here will

 provide an informal test of the assumptions of the model (see fn.

 17). The estimates of cS and 0 are taken from Pakes and Schankerman

 (1978). The approximate ranges for t5 and 0 are 0.18 -         0.36   and 1.2

 -   2.5 (years), respectively. Based on a discount factor of 0.10,
 these estimates provide a fairly narrow a priori range for the

 coefficient 0.   of   between 3.3 and 6.1, which in turn will be compared

 to the actual estimates obtained here.



         All models were estimated using a full information maximum

results for the three equation model are presented in Table 1.1. The

earlier. None of the four industries had a test statistic with a

surprising value. Treating the x          deviate   for the various industries

as drawings from independent x2        distributions,   and summing over

industries, results in the more powerful ()/4           test    statistic. The

observed value of ()/4 was .744, while, the one and five percent

critical values of a ()/4 deviate are 3.33 and 2.37, respectively.

constraints were estimated. Of these, only one was negative and

this one (       in    the fourth industry) was less than one standard

deviation from zero.

        All of the estimated a coefficients are of the right sign and

statistically significant. Moreover, three of the four point

estimates of a lie in the interval predicted by the prior information

summarized earlier, and the single exception is less than one

standard deviation from that interval. To derive a summary measure

of a we tested the null hypothesis that the differences between the

various estimates of a are simply a result of random differences in

the estimators. The hypothesis is strongly accepted. The value of
                                                                         23
a for the combined sample is 3.85 with a standard error of 0.76.

On the whole, then, the data and the exogenous information provide

mutually consistent information on the magnitude of the parameters

which determine a.

        The most notable result of Table 1 concerns the effect of the

firmts past growth rate. Though this variable is neither statistically

nor economically insignificant in determining the firmts RD inten-
        24
sity,        differences in growth rates account for only a relatively

minor portion of the intra-industry variance in RD intensity. In

fact, line 7      of   Table 1 indicates that differences in growth rates

account for only two to four percent of this variance.

         As noted, the intra-industry coefficient of variation in RD

intensity is about seven times as large as that of traditional factors

of production. There are two possible explanations. First, the fact
                                                                      33




that knowledge has no cost of reproduction implies that, unlike other

factors of production, research intensity will differ both because of

variance in expected growth rates and because of differences in the

extent to which firms can appropriate the benefits of the knowledge

they produce. Second, the variance in the available measures of RD

intensity may reflect a larger "error in variabl&' than the variance

of other factors of production.

        The assumption that differences in expected growth rates could

be approximated by differences in average past growth results in

reasonable values of• a, but the variance in growth rates is too

small to account for a major portion of the observed intraindustry

variance in RD intensity. Hence, it is evident that a pure demand

inducement mechanism does not do well in explaining the intraindustrj

variance in RD intensity. The next obvious question is what portion

of that variance is due to error () and what part is explained by

the variance in the ability to appropriate the benefits from knowledge
                                                                            34


         Since the estimates of both       and           in the three equation
(at).
model are biased if there is any   correlation   among the factor errors,

we   now briefly describe and present   a summary   of   the   results of
estimating the six equation model which allows for free correlation
 among these errors.25
          The six equation model is constructed by adding the factor
demand equations for research capital, research labor, and traditional

labor in year t - 1    to those same equations for year t. Each error

component is assumed to be generated by a separate stationary stochastic

process. The model allows for a x0I2O test of the stationarity

assumptions (T1), a x8/8       test   of the assumption of no correlation

between the transitory portion of the output error and the factor

errors (T2), and a            test of the intertemporal stability of

the coefficients of the observed independent variables (T3). T1, T2,

and T3 test for consistency between the data and the assumptions used

tá identify the model. In addition, the six equation model investigates

two aspects of the intertemporal stability of the appropriability

paremeter. Let

Then   the model permits a test of the assumption that the variance in
the appropriability parameter is constant over time (a =                                               ),

surprising. It should be noted that the observed value of

indicates strong acceptance of the assumption of a zero covariance

between the transitory error in output and the factor errors in this

sample. The difference between the sum of squared residuals in the

model using all three test constraints and in the totally unconstrained

model can be used to produce a x6/36 test of the validity of the

model as a whole. The observed value of the x6/36 deviate was 0.91

which is less than its expected value under the null hypothesis that

all the constraints are satisfied. The                                      statistic which tested

at the five percent level, a sample with more than two time periods

would be required to determine more conclusively whether the variance

in the appropriability parameter is in fact constant over time.

        Table 2 summarizes the basic decomposition of the variance
in RD intensity from the six equation model. Note first that the

estimates of the growth coefficient    (ct)    are only slightly different

from the estimates from the three equation model. Since both models

estimate a consistently, this result was expected. Line 2 provides

the estimates of the total error variance in research expenditures

from the three equation model (a2TEM)          while lines 3 and 4 present

the estimates of a and the error variance in research expenditures

from the six equation model           Recall that the estimates of a2TEM

are biased upward or downward as              0. Accordingly, the large

negative values of a in the second and fourth industries account

                              is about twice as large as ar      in these

two industries.

        Line   5 provides estimates of the fraction of the variance in
research expenditures that is attributable to errors in research
resources   ar/alogR. The average and the coefficient of variation

of this fraction across the four industries are 0.09 and 0.24,

respectively. While these estimates of a/aogR provide only an

upper bound to the ratio of measurement error variance to total

variance in research expenditures, they do suggest the possibility

of a rather large "errors in variable" bias in micro analyses using

research expenditures as an independent variable. Auxiliary

           We now consider the basic decomposition of the variance in

research intensity. Lines 6 to 8 present the relevant information.

Line 6 lists the portion of the variance in research intensity

attributable to errors. One minus this value is the fraction of the

variance    in research   intensity accounted for by the structural form

of   the   model. The average and the coefficient of variation of this

fraction over the four industries in the sample are 0.72 and 0.12,

respectively. That is, 72 percent of the intraindustry variance in

research intensity is accounted for by the structural form of the

model and, as line 8 indicates, over 95 percent of this is accounted

for by differences in k.

            One further point is worth noting. Not only do differences

 in the appropriability parameter account for a large majority of the

 intra-industry variance in RD intensity, but the relative value

 of k associated with any given firm seems to be stable over time.

 That is, the autoregressive parameter (A) connecting the values of

 k and k_1 is essentially unity in all four industries.




                              Concluding Remarks


            This paper explores the factors which underlie the demand

 for research by profit-oriented firms. The intra-industry coefficient

 of variation of research. intensity is much larger than those of

 traditional factors. This important empirical fact is consistent with
                                                                      39



the theoretical argument that knowledge possesses unique economic

characteristics, and that the demand for research depends both on

the parameters of the production function for knowledge and on the

ability of the finn to appropriate the benefits from the knowledge

it generates. We propose a systematic framework for decomposing

the observed intra-industry variance in research intensity into

three components:   1) demand inducement, measured by growth rates

of output; 2) a firm-specific structural parameter; and 3) errors in

the observed variables.

       There are three principal empirical findings from this

decomposition. First, about 25 percent of the variance in research

intensity is due to errors in the variables and most of it is

concentrated in the measure of research capital. The noise to total

variance ratio in research expenditures Ca.JaOgR) is about ten

percent and should be considered in inicroeconomic studies using

research resources as an independent variable. Estimated coeffici-

ents of observed research expenditures are likely to be substantially

biased downward since the bias depends on the error-variance relative

to that part of the variance in the research variables which is not

correlated with the rest of the regressors.

       Second, about 75 percent of the intra-industry variance is

related to the structural parameters of the model, but very little of

this structural variance is accounted for by differences in growth

rates. This result is somewhat surprising. Schmookler (1966) and

others demonstrated the role of demand inducement in determining the
                                                                       40


inter-industry pattern of the level of research, and Pakes (1979)

confirms its influence on the inter-industry distribution of

research intensity. We are left with a striking contrast between

the role of demand inducement at the intra-industry and inter-

industry levels of aggregation, but to explore it is beyond the

scope of this paper.

       By far the greatest part of the intra-industry variance is

related to differences in the firm-specific parameter k. This

parameter is structural in the sense that it is consistent between

the research labor and capital demand equations and does not appear

in the traditional factor demand equations. Moreover, the value of

k associated with any given firm seems to be quite stable over time.

If there are no intra-industry differences in the elasticities of

the knowledge production function (technological opportunity), the

variance in k is due entirely to interfirin differences in appropri-

ability. The industry groups used here are quite broadly defined

and there is probably some variance in research elasticities, part

of which will be captured in      A definitive breakdown of o into

appropriability and technological opportunity components remains for

future research.

       The more general, and we believe more important, implication

of this inquiry is one which does not depend on the specific inter-

pretation given to c1. Both the theoretical and empirical analysis

indicate that it is not reasonable to treat the demand for research
                                                                      41


in a manner analogous to the demand for traditional factors of

production, including capital. This conclusion is reinforced by

evidence in Nadiri (1978), in which a generalized set of factor

demand equations is estimated on micro panel data. The F(113,904)

test statistic for the presence of firm-specific effects in the

research demand equation is 121.3, which should be compared both to

the five percent critical level of 1.08 and to the value in the

traditional capital demand equation of 18.6. These results also

hold when the sample is stratified by size of the firm. The general

conclusion we draw from all this evidence is that substantially

richer models are required to provide insight into the structure of

incentives driving the demand for research and thereby to explain

the distribution of research-related growth across firms.

                              Notes


       *We would like to thank Zvi Griliches for many constructive

discussions of the issues in this paper, and Gary Chamberlain and

Bronwyn Hall for econometric and computing suggestions. We grate-

fully acknowledge the financial support of the National Science

Foundation, Grant GS-2726X.



       'The problems alluded to are of two types. First, errors in

R D variables make more complicated input relationships difficult

to estimate (Griliches and Ringstaad, 1971). Second, a lack of good

price and quantity indices on the separate outputs that a firm

produces precludes the use of multiproduct production functions.



            points are in order. First, ttresearch capital" refers

to an aggregate of all research resources other than research labor.

Second, in this paper the firm-specific constant captures the

effects of "learning by doing" and of other firms' research as inputs

in tk production process of the firm in question.



        3Griliches (1973, 1975) has discussed the various lags

 connecting research resources and productivity. One of the few

 attempts to analyze the lag structure empirically is Evenson's study

 (1968) of aggregate data for American agriculture.
                                                                        43


       4Since knowledge is a produced capital input, we must make

some approximation with respect to the employment of research

resources in the pre-sample period. The data we use are for 1963

and contain 1957-1963 average growth rates. Using the fact that

research resources in American industry grew at a fairly constant

rate between the end of World War II and the mid-l960s, a specifica-

tion analysis indicated that the constant growth rate assumption was

the best approximation for our sample.



       5This is a well known result which has been discussed by

Arrow (1962), Machlup (1962), and Nordhaus (1969a, 1969b). Patent

laws are in fact a device for strengthening these monopolies by

bestowing institutionally created property rights on the producers

of information. See Bowman (1973).



       61f P1 is the profit maximizing price for a monopolist with

constant unit cost Z1, the "Arrow royalty" described in the text will

yield maximum profits if and only if P1 >         If the industry demand
                                            P0.
is price inelastic over the relevant range, the Arrow royalty will be

optimal regardless of the magnitude of the cost reduction due to the

innovation. If the industry demand is price elastic, the condition

                            <
P1 > P0 can be written
                                I(P1)J,     where t denotes the price

elasticity of industry demand. It is apparent from this inequality

that the Arrow royalty will be optimal for all but the most major
                                                                        44



innovations and will certainly be optimal for the cost reduction

resulting from the employment of the marginal research resource.



       7As Arrow (1962, P. 615) remarks: "In the absence of

special legal protection, the owner cannot simply sell information

on the open market. Any one purchaser can destroy the monopoly,

since he can reproduce the information at little or no cost. Thus,

the only effective monopoly would be the use of information by the

original possessor. . .   .   With   suitable legal measures, information

may become an appropriable commodity. Then the monopoly power can

indeed be exerted. However, no amount of legal protection can make

a thoroughly appropriable commodity of something so intangible as

information."



       8Since the appropriability base is allowed to vary among

 firns, the specific decomposition used here is immaterial. However,

 any assumption on the statistical properties of the appropriability

 parameter will be restrictive. The decomposition chosen here has

 two advantages. First, it permits an indirect test of the only

 econometrically relevant assumption on the properties of k (see fn.

 17.) Second, since royalty payments, which are about three percent

 of research expenditures (Wilson, 1975, Chapter 3), are included in

 our measure of output, one would want to make the firm's output a

 direct determinant of the returns to its research.
                                                                          45


          9Since only the moment matrix of the variables was available,

we were limited to linear combinations of the original variables

and forced to use Taylor approximations. The ratio of the

approximation error to the true value is just over two percent, and

if g is distributed symmetrically, this will not affect the estimate

of a.




          "°This should be distinguished from the role of market size

in models of the demand for traditional capital. The level of

investment in traditional capital is related to the expected growth

of output (accelerator models), whereas in our model the level of

investment in the stock of R D depends on the expected level of

output.



          11Lucas (1967) tested this point on aggregate data for

American industry and obtained coefficients of the expected sign and

magnitude.



          12This does not mean, however, that an increase in e raises

the optimal RD intensity since 0 affects both         and



          13This formulation is not too unreasonable and has the

advantage of producing a simple econometric model which is directly

estimable with the available data. The data did allow us to

experiment with more sophisticated expectations formulae which
                                                                                  46



permit the firm to take into account both its own and the industryts

past growth performance in formulating expectations on its own future

growth rate. The results are similar to those reported here.               Pakes

(1978) uses a general rational expectations formulation on a differ-

ent data set and obtains similar results.



         14The special cases are vq = 0 and riq =          0   respectively. We

have investigated a more general model which assumes differential

transmission to different factor demand equations, but again the

results did not differ significantly from those presented here. Note

also that K picks up the effect of all research expenditures that

have already gestated and are still productive. Also, we have

ignored   the difference between E (e")          and 1.



          15See Mundlak (1963), Mundlak and Hoch (1965),           and Zeilner
 et   al. (1966).



          16           .                     .
               Two   points   should be noted in connection with (17). First,

 any   error    in the assessment of revenues (e.g., differential monopoly

 power or a difference between the expected and the actual price of
 output) will be captured in    and will not bias the three equation
 results.       Second, the assumption E[c) = 0           is more troublesome
 than                                             = 0 for two reasons. First,
        the assumptions E(c2,c) = E(EcCn)

 there is a test of the latter two assumptions embodied in the three

 equation results. In addition, since research resources affect
                                                                                          47


output only after a gestation lag, if there is a production function

constraint which connects the values of different contemporaneous

factor decision errors, it will cause a non zero correlation between

      and        ,    but   not between either         or c and e
             c                                   2..      c         n


            17Since k. is a structural parameter, the assumption that k

is orthogonal to the error components is roughly analogous to the

classic regression assumption of independence of the errors and the

regressors. The assumption E(k) = 0, however, requires additional

comment. There is no reason to expect k to be correlated with ,

but    we can do better than rely on our intuition. If E(k)                      0, the

estimates of a derived from the models which rely on zero correlation

should differ from estimates based on other techniques. An assort-

ment of exogenous information on the components of a (described in

the next section) yields estimates of a which are very similar to

those obtained from our models, and this may be interpreted as an

indirect test of the assumption E(k) = 0.                     We might add, however,

that if E(k)                 0, we can reinterpret a and k such that the estimate

of         becomes that portion of the underlying variance in appropriabil-

ity that is orthogonal to the variance in .



            18Actually,         the null hypothesis of the          test is      -

= 0.       However, under the alternative that                  -         0, the event
                                                                    acn
       =             will   occur only on a set of measure zero. Accordingly, we

neglect this possibility.
                                                                     48



       19Griliches (forthcoming) provides a more complete descrip-

tion of this data base.



       20The original sample consists of 883 firms. We discarded

the data for the "aircraft   missiles" and the "all others" indus-

tries. The first was dropped because it is dominated by government

financed RD (74 percent versus 20 percent in the other industries).

Our market-inducement model has limited applicability, unless it

were known that privately and government financed R F D are close

substitutes and the supply of the latter is very elastic. Moreover,

there were only 31 firms and there were inconsistencies in the data.

The "all others" category was discarded on the grounds that it

contains both intra-industry and inter-industry variance in RD

intensity.



       21Actually, since value added is a component of sales, part

of    is likely to be transferred to V2 and there will be some

correlation between these errors. We show below, however, that the

maximum possible bias caused by this correlation is minimal and

certainly does not warrant discarding the information in one of the

 growth rate measures.



        22The models presented here are a special case of a more

 general class of structural equation models described by Jreskog

 (1973a) and Wiley (1973).
                                                                       49


              can be shown that if any of the measurement error in

value-added is transferred to sales, the estimates of cx reported

above are biased downwards. However, even under the polar

assumption that all the measurement error in value-added is trans-

ferred to sales, the estimate of cx becomes only 4.15 with a standard

error of 1.01. Therefore, the unbiased point estimate lies between

3.85 and 4.15.



       24The elasticity of RED intensity with respect to past

growth rates, evaluated at the sample mean of the growth rate, is

about 0.25.



       25For the details of the six-equation model and its empirical

results, see Pakes (1978) or Schankerman (1979).



       26Unfortunately, we cannot decompose the estimate of     into

a decision and a measurement component, but two pieces of evidence

suggest that the bulk of o consists of measurement error. First,

almost all of the errors in research expenditures are due to errors

in research capital. Since reported research includes all (rather

than only the capitalized portion) of research capital expenditures,

we (and all other investigators in this area) have a measure of gross

investment in research capital rather than the desired measure of

research capital services. On this account we would expect a large

measurement error component in research capital. Second, preliminary
                                                                     50



application of the three equation model to industry averages of

all variables indicates that the error variance in research expen-

ditures in these aggregate variables approaches zero. The averaging

procedure would tend to cancel out the part of the error variance

caused by measurement error and by random, inoptinial choice of

factor levels, but it would not eliminate that part caused by a

misspecification in the structural form of the model.
