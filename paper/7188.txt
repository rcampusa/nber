                                                Abstract

In this paper, I examine the effect of business cycles on the employment, earnings, and income of persons
in different demographic groups. I classify individuals by sex, education, and race. The analysis uses
data from the Current Population Survey's Outgoing Rotation Group file, covering the period 1979-1992,
and March Aimual Demographic files (ADF) covering the period 1975-1997. Many different individual
and family outcome measures are considered including: employment to population ratios, weekly
earnings, hourly earnings, aimual hours, aimual earnings, family earnings, family transfer income, and
total family income. The regression model is specified such that the key parameters measure how the
labor market outcomes of less skilled workers vary with the business cycle relative to the variability for
high skill groups. The analysis uses variation across MSAs in the timing and severity of shocks. The
results consistently show that individuals with lower education levels, nonwhites, and low skill women
experience greater cyclical fluctuation than high skill men. These results are the most striking when
examining comprehensive measures of labor force activity such as the likelihood of full-time year around
work. Government transfers and the earnings of other family members decrease the differences between
groups, as business cycles have more skill-group neutral effects on family income than individual
earnings. The paper examines the stability of these results by comparing evidence across the 1982 and
 1992 recessions. The evidence suggests that the 1992 recession led to more uniform effects across skill
groups than earlier cycles.
1. Introduction

        One of the most substantial risks facing workers is the potential for job loss, either permanent or

temporary. The possibility of a loss in earnings and employment is likely to be of greater concern to less

skilled workers because of difficulties in replacing lost income with savings and the earnings of

secondary earners. Many government transfer programs have been established to reduce the variability

of family income over the business cycle. Because of recent changes in welfare programs, however,

there is some uncertainty as to the role that the safety net can and will play in subsequent recessions.

        Recent evidence suggests that state and federal policy changes are leading to increases in

employment among AFDC recipients (Blank, Card and Robins, this volume). With increases in labor

market attachment comes the potential for increases in family income and earnings. However, with

increasing labor market attachment, also comes the risk of recession and loss of family income. The

potential for cyclical fluctuation in earnings is very different than the relatively constant transfer that a

family expected from AFDC.

        This paper examines the impact of changes in local economic conditions on the employment,

earnings and income of individuals in different skill groups. The skill groups are defined by sex, race,

and education level. The emphasis in the paper is evaluating the relative impact of cycles across these

demographic groups. This is done in three parts. First, I present trends in labor market outcomes by skill

group. This simple analysis provides suggestive evidence that the employment and earnings patterns of

less skilled groups show greater fluctuation in economic cycles than higher skill groups. Second, I

examine how changes in labor market outcomes vary across skill groups within metropolitan statistical

areas (MSAs). In particular, I present figures which compare the changes in a particular labor market

outcome over a particular time period (e.g. from peak to trough of a recession) for one skill group against

another within an MSA. Last, I extend the graphical analysis to a regression framework thereby

estimating quantitatively the impact of a shock to an MSA on the relative outcomes across skill groups.


                                                       1
        The analysis uses data from the Current Population Survey's (CPS) Outgoing Rotation Group

(ORG) data, covering the period 1979-1992, and March Aimual Demographic files (ADF) covering the

period 1975-1997. The advantage of the ORG data is that the samples are about three times as large as

the ADF, which is particularly important when presenting results by skill groups within MSAs. The

labor market outcomes that can be identified in the ORG data, however, are somewhat limited and

include employment status last week and earnings last week. Ultimately, broader measures of individual

and family well-being are important. The ADF provides comprehensive data on employment, earnings,

and income over the past year. The analysis of the ADF data uses hourly earnings, aimual hours, aimual

earnings, family earnings, family transfer income, and total family income. By combining evidence from

the two data sources, the results tell a comprehensive story about the impact of business cycles on

workers and families. The data also cover a relatively long time period, allowing for examination of the

recessions over three decades.

        The results consistently show that the labor market outcomes of less skilled workers exhibit more

variability over business cycles than higher skill groups. Nonwhites, and those with lower education

levels are more impacted by changes in local economic conditions. Further, high skilled women have

significantly less sensitivity to business cycles than low skilled, especially low skilled nonwhite, women.

These patterns hold for both recessions and recoveries. These groups are more likely to have reductions

in employment and earnings during a downturn, and also more likely to have gains in recoveries.

Examining individuals in isolation, however, gives an incomplete picture of the effect of cycles on well-

being. The results also show that government transfers and the earnings of other family members

decrease the differences between groups resulting in more skill-group neutral effects of business cycles

on family income than individual earnings.

        Many previous studies have examined the effects of business cycles and local labor markets on

individuals and families. This paper contributes to the literature in three ways. First, the focus in this


                                                     2
paper is on comparing the responses across groups defined by sex, education and race. This provides a

comprehensive distributional analysis that has not been done in the existing literature. Second, the paper

presents an empirical framework and applies it to an extensive set of individual and family outcomes.

Previous studies typically focus on a relatively narrow set of outcomes. Third, the framework is used to

examine whether the effects vary different business cycles.

        The study is inherently a descriptive one, and does not make any attempt to causally identify why

there is variation across skill groups in the relative responsiveness to cycles. Among the reasons that

groups may have different responses to cycles are that they have different mobility rates, labor supply

elasticities, and they work in different industries and occupations. There are two ways that I explore

why the differences occur. First, we can examine the "channels" by which the differences occur by

looking at wages, hours, and earnings separately and by examining the components of family income.

Second, I compare the characteristics of workers in different skill groups to see if groups with higher

cyclical responses are more likely to be employed in occupations and industries with higher layoff rates.

        The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 provides a summary of the existing literature

on the impact of local labor markets on employment, earnings, and income. Section 3 describes the data.

Section 4 presents the trends in individual and family outcomes over time by skill group. Section 5

describes the empirical approach. Section 6 provides a preliminary graphical analysis of differences in

responsiveness to cycles across skill groups. The main regression results are presented in section 7.

Section 8 concludes.



2. Previous Literature

        This study has connections to many different areas of research including the literature on wage,

earnings, and income inequality; trends in employment and earnings for women; determinants of labor

market outcomes and differences between groups; and worker displacement. It is not feasible, nor


                                                     3
desirable to provide a comprehensive review of the literature here. Instead, this review will focus

explicitly on those studies that examine the effect of local labor market conditions (or other measures of

business cycles) on employment and income.

        The applications that are the most relevant to this analysis include those that examine the effect

of business cycles and local labor markets on employment outcomes (Bartik 1991, 1993a, 1993b, and

1996, Blanchard    and Katz 1992, Holzer 1991), real wages (Bils 1985,       Blank 1990, Keane et al 1988,

Solon et    al 1994), racial   differences in labor market outcomes (Bound and Holzer 1993 and 1995), labor

market outcomes of disadvantaged youths (Acs and Wissoker 1991, Bound and Freeman 1992, Cain and

Finnie 1990, Freeman 1982, 1991a, 1991b), and family income, poverty and income inequality (Bartik

1994, Blank 1989, Blank 1993, Blank        and Blinder 1986, Blank and Card 1993, Cutler and Katz 1991).


These studies almost universally find an important role for local      labor market conditions.

        For the    purposes of this analysis, I will focus three features of these studies. The first is the


variables   used to control for the characteristics of the area labor market. The second is the outcome

measures. The third is the degree to which differences across groups is explored.

        The studies of disadvantaged youths relate labor market outcomes to local (typically

Metropolitan Statistical Area or MSA) unemployment rates. That literature has consistently found that

higher local unemployment rates lead to reductions in employment and earnings (Acs and Wissoker

1991, Bound and Freeman 1992, Cain and Finnie 1990, Freeman 1982, 1991a, 1991b), with larger effects

for blacks, younger workers, and less educated workers (Acs and Wissoker 1991, and Freeman 199 ib).

        The studies of family income and poverty have typically used either national (Blank 1989, Blank

1993, and Blinder 1986, Cutler and Katz 1991) or regional (Blank and Card 1993) variation in

unemployment rates or GNP. The studies have found a consistent negative relationship between

unemployment rates and inequality and poverty. Of particular interest is Blank (1989) who disaggregates

household income into many components and examines the relative cyclicality of the components. She


                                                          4
finds earnings and capital income to be pro-cyclical and some transfer income to be counter-cyclical.

Overall, she finds greater variation over the cycle for those that are young, male, and nonwhite.

        The literature that is most relevant for this study is the literature that uses variation across MSAs

in labor market conditions to examine labor market outcomes across different demographic groups

(Bartik 1991, 1993a, 1993b, 1994 and 1996, and Bound and Holzer 1993 and 1995). The studies by

Bartik use growth in employment, changes in the manufacturing share of employment, and changes in the

average wage premium implied by the area's industry mix. Bound and Holzer (1993, 1995) use skill

group specific measures of employment growth, using as weights the skill group's participation in each

industry at the begiiming of the period. The results differ somewhat across the studies, but they generally

show that changes in labor demand lead to larger changes for blacks, younger persons, and those with

lower education levels. The patterns seem to hold for men and women

        Distinct from the literature on labor market outcomes, above, is the literature that uses panel data

to examine the cyclicality of real wages. The literature uses primarily aggregate measures of business

cycles (national unemployment rates of GNP growth) and asks the question to what degree are aggregate

wage fluctuations over the cycle due to changes in the composition of the work force. The results vary

somewhat across the studies but generally find that the composition effect alone leads to counter cyclical

wage patterns. Accounting for this composition effect, wages are found to be pro-cyclical with greater

fluctuations for those who are male, young, and working in private sector.

        Overall, these studies raise several possible explanations for the differences across groups in the

sensitivity to business cycles. An often cited explanation is variation across demographic groups in

mobility rates. The larger the long run supply elasticity for the demographic group, the lower the

expected effect of a demand shift on wages and employment. Those with slower rates of population

mobility will have larger effects. A second explanation is that different demographic groups tend to be

employed in difference sectors and occupations that may be associated with greater or lesser risks of


                                                     5
layoff.



3. Data

          The study uses the Outgoing Rotation Group (ORG) and March Aimual Demographic File

(ADF) data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS Outgoing Rotation Group (ORG) data,

which pools monthly survey observations, has sample sizes about three times as large as the ADF, but the

labor market outcomes included in the survey are limited. I use indicators for employment last week,

full-time employment last week, and earnings last week, where full-time includes those working at least

35 hours per week. The data covers 1979-1993 with about 325,000 observations per year.1

          The ADF (or March CPS) is an aimual demographic file that includes labor market and income

information for the previous year, at the individual and family level. Many different individual and

family outcome measures are considered including work at all, work full-time full-year, number of weeks

worked, average hourly earnings, aimual hours, annual earnings, family earnings (head and spouse),

family transfer income, and total family income. All measures are aimual and correspond to the calendar

year previous to the survey. Full-time is defined as those working at least 35 hours per week last year,

and full-year is defined as those working 50 or more weeks last year. The ADF data is available

begiiming with the 1964 survey year. Because of major changes in the survey begiiming in 1976, this

study uses the 1976-1998 surveys covering years 19751997.2 The sample size is approximately

150,000 persons per year.

          The earnings data is topcoded in both surveys. In the ORG data, weekly earnings are topcoded at




          'The data is available through 1995. However 1994 and 1995 data were dropped because the variables
identifjing MSAs appear to be incorrect

          2Prior to the 1976 survey year, weeks worked last year was a categorical variable and usual hours worked
per week last year was not available. Hours worked last week was available, but is a noisy measure of hours worked
last year.

$999 through 1988, and $1923 from 1989 on. In the ADF data, aimual earnings are topcoded at $50,000

through 1981, $75,000 from 1982-1984, $100,000 from 1985-1988, and about $200,000 from 1989 on.

Following Katz    and Murphy (1992) and more recently Blau (1998), the earnings of topcoded individuals


are   adjusted to be 1.45 times the topcoded value. Begiiming in 1996, instead of giving each topcoded

observation the value of the topcode, the CPS assigns the mean among the sample of topcodes (by

demographic group). The earnings figures can be as high as $600,000 in this period. I make no

adjustment for topcoding in these years. There is no apparent topcoding of family earnings or family

income. Real earnings and income are constructed using the CPT-U-X1 deflator.

          For most of the analysis, the micro-data is collapsed into cells defined by MSA, year, and skill

group. Skill groups are defined by education (<12, 12, 13-15, 16+ or          12,   >12) , race (white, nonwhite),

and sex. The nonwhite group includes both blacks and white Hispanics. The ORG data identifies 44

MSAs, while the ADF data (begiiming a few years earlier) identifies 35 MSAs. In order to better

approximate labor market areas, the MSAs are combined in their consolidated MSA (CMSA) units where

applicable. Examples of CMSAs include New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. The final sample

includes 35 MSA!CMSAs in the ORG data and 27 MSA!CMSAs in the ADF.3 For the remainder of the

paper, these geographic unites will referred to as MSAs. Based on 1990 population figures, my MSA

sample accounts for about 60 percent of the total metropolitan population or 50 percent of the total

population. The sample accounts for virtually all of the metropolitan population in 1975. The median

MSA in the ORG data contains about 200 observations per year, compared to about 75 observations per

year in the ADF. Once the cells are further refined to skill groups, some cells get very small. When

possible, data are combined into two year periods to reduce the problem of small skill group-MSA-year


          3Considerable effort was made to insure that the MSAs were comparable units over time. For example, It is
relatively common for an MSA to split into two. The split off MSAs were combined making the series comparable
over time. However, some MSAs grow over time as additional areas are added to an existing MSA. These changes
can not be addressed. Fortunately, changes in MSA definitions occur only once per decade, following the decennial
census. These "seam years" were dropped from the analysis in sensitivity tests.

cells. All analyses in the paper are weighted using the person weight.

        The same sample selection criteria is applied to both the ORG and ADF data. The sample

includes persons between 22 and 62 years old. I exclude the self-employed, those working without pay,

and those with positive earned income but zero hours of work. Following Katz and Murphy (1992),

individuals with real weekly earnings of less than $67 in 1982 dollars (i.e. one half of the value of the

minimum wage assuming a 40 hour work week) were excluded. The final sample has about 220,000

person observations per year in the ORG sample and 70,000 observations per year in the ADF sample.

The unit of analysis in the ORG data is the individual.



4. Trends in Labor Market Outcomes Among Skill Groups

        As a starting point, this section presents simple time series trends in labor market outcomes by

education, race and sex. In the interest of space, the discussion uses only the ADF data. The analysis

introduces some of the labor market outcomes that will be used in the empirical analysis. This analysis is

a starting point for characterizing the trends in the outcomes variables and how they vary across different

groups. Using these simple figures to make comparisons across groups in their responsiveness to cycles,

however, may not be possible because of the difficulties in separating secular trends from cycles.

Therefore, these results should be viewed as only first step.

4.1 Definitions

        Skill groups are defined by education, race and sex. Low skill workers are typically defined

using education level and most often include persons with less than a high school education. This

analysis uses data covering a period of three decades and is concerned with making comparisons across

groups over time and cycles. It is important for the analysis that the skill groups are defined to be

comparable over time. However, education levels have been rising over time for all demographic groups,

and this shows up most dramatically at the lowest levels of educational attainment. In the presence of


                                                     8
rising education levels, even if the distribution of earnings and income are unchanged over time, then one

would expect that the relative position of low educated persons (e.g. high school dropouts) would decline

over time. That is, over time, this group would become more and more disadvantaged.

         Figure 1 presents trends in the percent of persons with various education levels in the ADF

sample, by race and sex. This figure shows that the percent of persons with less than a high school

education has fallen dramatically in this period. Between 1975 and 1997, the percent of white men with

less than a high school education declined from 25 percent to less than 10 percent. For nonwhite men,

the percent with less than a high school education declined from 50 to 30 percent. At the same time,

among whites, the percent with a high school diploma has held steady while those with greater than a

high school diploma has increased. Among nonwhites, both high school and more than high school

groups are increasing.4

         In the presence of these dramatic increases in education levels over this period, the main analyses

in this paper will compare those with a high school education or less to those with more than a high

school education. Those with a high school education or less are defined to be less skilled workers.

This group will be less disadvantaged group than high school dropouts, however, and where possible I

examine outcomes across all four education groups (<12, 12, 13-15, 16+).

4.2 Trends in Employment, Earnings and Income using ADF

         Figures 2a presents trends in employment to population ratios for men for 1975-1997 by race and

education. There are two definitions for the employment to population ratios. The Any- Work EPOP is

the employment to population ratio where a person is considered employed if they worked at all last year.



         4Beginning in the 1992 survey, the CPS records the degree earned rather than the years of schooling
completed. As is evident in the figure, this decreases the percent with a high school diploma, and increases the
percent with greater than a high school diploma.

          5An alternative approach is to define skill groups by their relative position in the earnings or wage
distribution (i.e. less than the 20th percentile). Because this analysis is not limited to workers, skill groups would
have to be assigned using predicted wages. This may be examined in future work.

                                                           9
The FTFYEPOP is the employment to population ratio where a person is considered employed if they

worked full-time (at least 35 hours) and full-year (at least 50 weeks) last year. In each page, the left two

graphs are for whites and the right two graphs are for nonwhites. The top figures present the Any-work

EPOP and the bottom row of figures presents the FTYR EPOP.

        As expected, EPOP ratios are higher for those with higher education levels. Less educated

nonwhites tend to have higher EPOP ratios than whites. Among men with less than a high school

education, the Any-work EPOP is declining significantly over this period. By the mid- 1990s, fully 30

percent of men are not working at all over the year. This undoubtedly is in part due to the changing

composition of the lowest education group over this time period. More relevant for this analysis are the

cyclical trends in these ratios. The figures suggest that employments rates of those with lower education

levels and nonwhites exhibit more cyclical variation. During this period, unemployment rates peaked in

1982 and 1992. There seems to be more cyclical fluctuation in the full-time employment rates (FTYR

EPOP) than the any work employment rates (Any-work EPOP). For nonwhites with less than a high

school education, the Any-work EPOP also varies significantly over the cycle. This is striking given that

the measure is any work in the entire calender year. The high rates of non-work in trough of the

recession is consistent with the persistently high unemployment rates for this group. It should be noted

that some of the variability in the measures for nonwhites reflect small sample sizes, especially for higher

education groups.

        Figure 2b presents trends in aimual hours and earnings for men. The figures have the same

format as above with whites on the left and nonwhites on the right. The top row of Figure 2b shows

mean aimual hours worked and the bottom row shows mean aimual earnings. It is important to note that

these earnings and hours figures are averages over all individuals in the race-education-sex-year group,

and includes workers and nonworkers. Therefore, the change in earnings is comprehensive and may vary

due to changes in changes in hours, weeks, hourly wages, as well as changes in the composition of the


                                                    10
work force.

         In general, the pattern for annual hours worked is similar to the trends for the EPOP ratios.

These figures show that, to a greater extent than in other measures, both aimual hours and real aimual

earnings show cyclical variation for college educated white men. While the average hours and earnings

of less educated individuals also show cyclical variation, the relative variability of low versus high

education groups is less dramatic than the employment figures. Tn graphs not presented here, the

variation in aimual hours worked comes more from variation in weeks worked per year than from hours

worked per week. That may be due to measurement error in hours worked per week or it may reflect that

nature of employment reductions that firms engage in.6

        Figures 3a and 3b present similar figures for women. These figures show that employment and

earnings for women are increasing secularly over this period for all groups, but at a substantially slower

rate for women with low education levels and nonwhites. These trends dominate all of the figures and it

is difficult to make any inferences about the variation over the business cycle.

        Although not shown here, family earnings and family income also show cyclical variation.

Family income, and to a lesser extent family earnings, shows less variability across demographic groups

compared to the fluctuations in individual earnings. Our empirical model will explore the reasons for

this difference.



5. Empirical Model

         The goal of this analysis is to estimate how individuals in different demographic groups are

affected by changes in macroeconomic conditions. One approach to estimating this effect is to take the

time-series trends presented above and regress the outcomes on a measure of the business cycle such as


        6Figure 2b shows that average earnings for college educated white men increased substantially starting in
1995. This is due to the change in the topcoding in the CPS. I examine the sensitivity to dropping these years in the
subsequent analyses.

                                                         11
the unemployment rate. This approach is not taken here for two reasons. First, aggregate measures of

business cycles do not necessarily capture the relevant cycle if there is area variation in the timing or

severity of the cycle. Second, the unemployment rate (or some other aggregate measure of employment)

can be mechanically related to the dependent variable (e.g. the EPOP ratio for less skilled persons). This

reflection or endogeneity problem makes the interpretation of such estimates difficult. One approach

used in the literature is to use instruments to identify the effect (Bound and Holzer 1993, 1995). As an

alternative, this analysis treats the shock to a local area as unobserved and compares the response to the

shock among different groups. This avoids the reflection problem and has the added advantage of

differencing out an MSA effect. All of the comparisons across groups are made within MSAs which

takes advantage of the wide regional variation in the timing and severity of recessions.

         For this and all remaining analyses in the paper, I start with collapsing the data into cells defined

by MSA (m), time (t), and skill group (j). Let y1, be the mean of a given labor market outcome for group

j in area m in year t.   Suppose one could observe some exogenous measure of the business cycle in the

MSA in time t, represented by ymt. Putting the variables y in logs, one could characterize the log of the

mean labor market outcome for groupj in MSAm in period tby the following equation:

                           ln(y1) =              ÷    ÷      +
                                                                 Yj'11(Ymt) ÷ €jmt                       (1)


The labor market outcome of groupj is a function of permanent differences across groups (a0), a skill

group specific trend (a'), permanent differences across areas (IJ'm), overall time effects (ô),and a

"cycle" measure ymt Note that the coefficient on mt varies with group so the effect of MSA fluctuations

can differ across the groups. The key parameters are the y's.

         If the equation is differenced (thereby purging the permanent MSA and group effects) over some

time period t then the equation becomes:




                                                      12
                                Alfl(Yjmt) =       ÷ U ÷ YjM11(Ymt) ÷ %mt                                     (2)


Now, Alfl(Ym) represents the shock to a particular MSA in time t. The problem with estimating this

equation is finding an exogenous measure of the shock Am (y). The approach used here is to treat the

shock as unobserved and estimate each of the Alfl(Vm) as parameters. I therefore estimate the following

equation:


                                                        +
                                     Alfl(Yjmt) = ccj        Yi Pint +                                       (3)


The Pmt are the parameters capturing the shock to MSA m in period t. The model is identified by the

assumption that the responsiveness across skill groups y is constant across MSAs.7 The main interest of

the paper is to compare the      in order to determine the relative responsiveness across groups. The model

can be extended to look for structural changes in the intercepts (skill group trends) and slopes (skill

group responsiveness to cycles) over time and, to some extent, across space. The approach is a simple

way to allow for comparisons between multiple skill groups over multiple time periods.

         The analysis will use many alterative individual and family outcomes in order to fully

characterize the impact of cycles on different groups. Accordingly, model (3) is estimated for each of the

outcomes of interest. First this estimation is done one equation at a time. In this estimation, the

parameters capturing the skill group response to the shock (y) have to be normalized to fix the scale of

the estimated shock parameters (p). We choose a "reference" skill group and normalize the y for that

group to 1. The parameters for the other skill groups are interpreted as the response relative to the




          7This approach is feasible due to the use of multiple skill groups. The number of observations are J*M*T
where J is the number of skill groups, M is the number of MSAs, and T is the number of time periods. There are
M*T nuisance parameters, one for each year in each MSA. In practice I have 8 skill groups which turns out to be
more than enough to estimate the parameters precisely. Note that by estimating MSA-time specific effects, the time
effect v, drops out of the equation. These parameters may not be consistent because with each additional period T,
M (number of MSA5) additional parameters must be estimated.

                                                        13
response for the reference group. In addition, the intercept for the reference group is set to 0, so the

intercepts for the other skill groups are interpreted as the average trend for groupj relative to the trend

for reference group.

         This estimation does not take account of the fact that the MSA-time "shocks" (Pmt) enter each of

the labor market outcome equations. Therefore I also estimate the models by pooling the equations and

constraining the PmttO be equal across the equations. This "pooled" model has three advantages. First,

only one normalization on the y's is necessary across all the equations. We can therefore not only

examine how the sensitivity to cycles varies across groups, but how it varies across different outcome

variables. Second, there may be efficiency gains to accounting for the common parameters across the

equations. Third, conceptually it is attractive to think of a single "shock" to an area which is then filtered

down to different outcomes (e.g. hours, earnings, income) and different groups.8

         While the model in (3) in logs, in practice I examine the models using both changes in logs and

changes in levels. The change in the logs is attractive because of the interpretation as percent changes in

the variable. In practice, we do not know if the correct form for the model is in levels or logs. Because

the mean levels of the outcomes vary substantially across the groups, the estimates of the ycan be

significantly biased towards finding greater responsiveness to cycles for less skilled groups if the model

is mis-specified.9 We will investigate the sensitivity to this assumption in the estimates below.

         These regressions are estimated using both the ORG and ADF data. Skill groups are defined by



         8Note that even though the shocks are equivalent across equations, the parameters can not be "added up"
across equations. That is because the dependent variable is the change log of the mean within a cell. Specifically,
even if y = y1 * y2, the log of the mean of y does not equal the log of mean of y1 times the log of the mean of y2.

        9To see this point, assume that the true model is linear in the changes in levels. Then (dropping the MSA
subscript) equation (3) becomes A y = + g3. Ay + . Let y1 denote the mean level ofy1 andy denote the mean
level ofy. Then the equation can be transformed to be A y1 'y =          'y + g3.* (y 1y1) Ay1 /y + e 'y . Using an
                                                                        a1

                                                                    y1A1og(y) jt ,where y = g3.*(y/yf) . So if
approximation for the log, this implies that A 1og(y3) =        +             +

pointing this out and Dave Card for helping to formalize it.

education, race and sex. There are a total of 8 skill groups (2 sex * 2 race * 2 education). With the

exception of average hourly earnings (which is averaged over workers) all variables are constructed as

means over the entire population in these cells using the CPS sample weights. To increase cell sizes

(which is important for nonwhites), the data are grouped into two year periods.

         The variables used in the analysis include: employment rates, hours worked, earnings, average

hourly wage, as well as family measures such as head's earnings, spouse's earnings, transfer income and

other family income. Each of these variables is averaged into the cells using the characteristics of the

individual (e.g. sex, education, race). Therefore, the entire analysis is based on individuals, even though

some of the measures are "family" based measures. I do this so that I can directly compare the results for

individual and family outcomes. The alternative is to create cells using observations on families, using

the head's characteristics to define the cell. This makes it difficult to coimect the individual and family

measures. 10

         The two education groups are those with a high school education and less, and those with more

than a high school education. The choice of two education groups (compared to the four groups used in

the aggregate analysis) is made for two reasons. First, and most importantly, I argued above that with

increases in education levels, the group with less than a high school education is becoming more

disadvantaged over time. This showed up quite dramatically in the simple trend graphs presented above.

By choosing somewhat broader education classes, I hope to minimize the problems with making over

time comparisons with a group whose composition is changing. The down side of this approach is that

the "low" education group is not that low, and this will probably attenuate the differences between low

and high skill groups. Second, the use of four education groups leads to very thin cells, especially with



         '°In an earlier version of this paper, I used the family-based analysis to analyze the family variables.
Following Karoly (1992) and others, I create adjusted family measures by dividing by the family's poverty threshold.
This adjusts for family size using the implicit equivalency scales which account for age structure and economies of
scale. Neither of these adjustments changed fundamentally the results from what is reported here.

nonwhites.



6. Preliminary Analysis of Differences Across Low and High Skill Groups

         As a preliminary analysis, the differences across groups are explored using graphs that plot

Alfl(Yjm) for a particular low skill groupj against the Alfl(Yrm) for a "reference group" r for a given time

period t. This approach can generate simple comparisons between the sensitivity of employment,

earnings and income of less skilled groups to high skill groups. The presentation here will be limited to

the ADF file.

         In particular, I look at changes between the trough and peak a given cycle. All of the figures in

this section use the 1982 recession as the cycle, measured as the change from 1979 (previous peak) to

1982 (tough). The 1982 recession is chosen because it was the most severe recession in the period

covered in the CPS data. The reference group for all figures is high education white men (those with

greater than a high school education), chosen because they appear to be the group with the least

sensitivity to cycles. This approach is best applied to groups that are not experiencing significant trends

over time. It can be difficult to extract the cycle from the trend in this simple analysis. Consequently, in

this section, I present graphs only for men. The regression results, presented in the next section, provide

estimates for all 8 skill groups11 12

         All of the graphs have the same form. First consider the top left graph of figure 4. Each point

on the graph represents a pair for an MSA. On the y-axis is the change in the log of the Any-Work EPOP




         "One could in principle de-trend the data for women before plotting the data. Another possibility is to
control for the trend by using high skill women as the reference group for women. Both of these approaches were
implemented but, in part to keep this section brief, the discussion of women is postponed until the regression results.

         '2As mentioned above, the CPS data is combined into two year periods to increase the number of
observations in each cell. Still, some of the nonwhite skill groups have very few observations in some of the smaller
MSAs. For the graphs, a cell is only included if there are at least 20 observations per cell. On average, this drops
about 5 MSAs on the nonwhite graphs.

                                                          16
(last year) for white men with a high school education or less (the low skill group). On the x-axis is the

change in the log of the same EPOP measure for the reference or high skill group defined as white men

with more than a high school education. The figures differ only in the choice low skill group and labor

market outcome. The top right graph compares the change in Any- Work EPOP for nonwhite men with a

high school education or less to the reference group. The bottom row of graphs presents the same

analysis for the FTYR EPOP. The points on the graph are weighted to reflect the size of the MSA. The

larger the circle, the larger the MSA.

        Each graph includes a 45 degree line to make the comparison between groups easier. If the

points generally lie below the 45 degree line, than the percent change in the outcome for the less skilled

group is greater (more negative) than the change in the outcome for the high skill group. If the points

are clustered on the line, then the responses are similar. A point above the 45 degree line means a larger

response among the high skill group than the low skill group.

        One advantage of this approach is that it makes use of rich variation across labor markets in the

U.S. As an illustration of this, Table 1 compares the outcomes across MSAs in the 1982 and 1992

recessions. In particular, I measure the change in the log of the male employment to population ratio for

any work (Any-work EPOP) last week based on the ORG data for each MSA from 1979-1982 and 1989-

1992. For each of the two time periods, the table presents the MSAs with largest and smallest percent

changes over the period. The 1982 recession hit the industrial Midwest hardest. For example Detroit,

Pittsburgh and Cleveland had reductions on the order of 10-15 percent while San Francisco, New York

and Boston experienced reductions of only 1-3 percent. In the 1992 recession, on the other hand,

reductions on the order of 7 to 10 percent were experienced in San Diego, Boston and New York and the

effect in the industrial Midwest was relatively mild.

        Returning to Figure 4, several observations can be made. Looking at the Any-work EPOP graph

shows that white men with low education levels have fluctuations in employment rates that are fairly


                                                    17
similar to white men with high education levels. Most of the observations are clustered on the 45 degree

line. The same is not true for nonwhite men. The figures on right suggest that nonwhite men are

significantly more impacted by the negative shock in this period than the reference group. Note that

almost all of the observations lie below the 45 degree line. In many cases their percent change in the

EPOP ratio is many times larger than the rate for the reference group. Using FTYR EPOP, both white

and nonwhite low skilled men appear to be more negatively impacted by the 1982 recession than white

high skilled men. Within the low skill group, nonwhites appear to be significantly more affected than

whites. The difference between the races is particularly evident with the Any-work EPOP.

        Figure 5 repeats the analysis and compares the change in the log of mean aimual hours worked

(top row) and mean aimual earnings (bottom row) for low skill to high skill men. Recall that aimual

earnings is averaged over both workers and nonworkers and thus reflects changes in employment, hours

per week, and wages. This figure shows that white and (especially) nonwhite low skill men show larger

reductions in hours and earnings than white high educated men. These patterns are similar to that found

above FTYR EPOP. In figures not shown here, family income and family earnings also show greater

responsiveness among low skilled men. The differences between groups appear, however, to be smaller

than that found for aimual earnings. This is likely to reflect the ongoing increases in employment and

earnings among married women, evidence of secondary workers entering the labor market to replace the

recession-induced lost earnings of the primary earner, or the counter cyclical pattern for transfers for low

skill groups. These patterns are explored further below.



7. Regression Results

        The preliminary analysis above shows that low skill men were more impacted by the 1982

recession than high skill men. Within skill groups, nonwhites are affected more adversely than whites.

These results, while illustrative, are somewhat qualitative and may be sensitive to the presence of trends


                                                     18
for skill groups. In addition, the results speak to one particular time period, and do not take full

advantage of the differences in the timing of cycles across areas. This section extends the analysis by

providing estimates of equation (3) above using the full time periods covered in the data. This approach

uses year to year changes to take full advantage of the variation in the timing of the economic changes

across areas.

        The observations for the regressions are the cells defined by skill group, MSA, and time. There

are 6 time periods and 35 MSAs in the ORG data and 10 time periods and 27 MSAs in the ADF data.13

With 8 skill groups, this yields a total of 1680 observations in the ORG and 2160 observations in the

ADF. The reference group for all regressions is high education (>12 years of education) white men. All

models are estimated using weighted nonlinear least squares using the cell's weighted count of

individuals. The precision of the estimate of the dependent variable varies with the size of the cell, and

the weights will down-weight the small cells. No cells are dropped from the analysis.

7.1 Results for Weekly Measures using ORG Data

        We being by presenting estimates using the ORG data and estimate each labor market outcome

equation separately, without accounting for common MSA shock across the equations. The results for

these "single equation" estimates are in Table 2. Each column in the table corresponds to estimates for a

different equation, and they differ only in the definition of the dependent variable. The table only

reports the parameter estimates for the y's (relative impact of the shock across skill groups). Because the

MSA-time shock, Pmt, is unobserved and estimated as a parameter, some normalization must be made to

fix the scale. In these initial regressions where each equation is estimated separately, we normalize the

parameter for the impact of the cycle on the reference group to 1 (Y 1=1). The parameters for the other


        '3For the analyses of both data sets, the data are combined into two year periods. The ORG data cover
1979/80 - 1991/92. 1993 was dropped because there was no year to pool it with. The ADF data cover 1975/76-
1995/96 with 1997 dropped. After differencing the data, there are 6 time periods in the ORG (198 1/82 - 199 1/92)
and 10 time periods in the ADF (1977/78 - 1995/96). By combining two years, the resulting first differences span on
average a two year change.

                                                        19
skill groups are interpreted as the response relative to the response for high skill white men. In addition,

the intercept for the reference group is set to 0, so the intercepts for the other skill groups are interpreted

as the average trend for group j relative to the trend for high skill white men.

        The ORG data describes the nature of your work last week. Table 3 shows three measures. The

Any- Work EPOP is the employment to population ratio where a person is considered employed if they

worked at all last week. The FT EPOP is the employment to population ratio where a person is

considered employed if they worked full-time (at least 35 hours) last week. Lastly, mean real weekly

earnings are used. Columns (1) and (2) present estimates where the EPOP is specified as changes in logs.

Columns (3) and (4) estimate these models using changes in levels of EPOP. Column (5) presents

estimates for changes in log weekly earnings. The statistical significance of the parameters are

determined by testing whether the coefficient is significantly different than 1 (e.g. no differences across

groups). The significance tests in all of the tables refer to that null hypothesis.

        The results in columns (1) and (2) show that there are sizeable and statistically significant

differences in the responses to cycles across skill groups. The results in column one show that, for a

given shock, the fluctuation in the Any-work EPOP is 1.4 times greater for low skill white men and

almost 4 times greater for low skill nonwhite men than the response for high skill white men. The results

for FTEPOP (column 2) are generally similar the Any-work EPOP. The results for women show that the

employment and earnings of high skill white women show significantly less cyclical fluctuation than all

groups, including high skill white men. That may be due to differences in the industries and occupations

that men and women are working in. Alternatively, it may also reflect the fact that women may act as

"added workers" who enter the labor force in recessions to make up for lost earnings of the principle

earner. These issues will be explored at more length below. Low skilled nonwhite women are the most

severely impacted by cycles. The results in columns one and two show that, for a given shock, their

employment rates fluctuate 5 times as much as high skill white men.


                                                      20
         These large parameters for low educated women are attenuated somewhat when the models are

estimated in levels instead of logs. These estimates are shown in columns (3) and (4). As discussed

earlier, if the level model is correct, then the low mean employment rate among these groups (e.g. FTYR

EPOP rates for less educated women are 0.42 for whites and 0.37 for nonwhites) will lead to larger

parameters for those groups. Some of these impacts are significant. The most extreme example is

coefficient for low skill nonwhite women which, in the Any-work EPOP is reduced to 1.44 from 5.42.

For the remainder of the paper, I rely on the more conservative level equations for EPOP regressions.14

         The results in column 5 show that the differences across skill groups are smaller when using real

weekly earnings. In a given period, the percent change in real weekly earnings of white low skill men is

1.2 times as large and the change for nonwhite low skill men is about 2 times as large as that experienced

by white high skill men. This may reflect greater rigidities in wages for low skill workers. For example,

if equilibrium wages rates are driven down in recessions, to the extent that the minimum wage creates an

wage floor for low skill workers, the reduction in earnings for low wage workers will be smaller, relative

to high skill workers, than their reduction in employment. Alternatively, this may reflect how the

composition of workers changes over the business cycle and how this compares across skill groups.

This point has been discussed in the empirical literature on cyclical behavior of real wages (for example

see the recent paper by Solon et al, 1994).

         The estimates from pooling the three equations for the ORG data are presented in Table 3. The

top portion of the table presents the y parameters along with their standard errors for each skill group.

Note that only one normalization is needed to identify the model. Here we normalize the coefficient for

high skill white men to 1 in the Any-work EPOP equation. All of the coefficients are now relative to that

group's outcome. Looking across the columns one can see how the fluctuation of one measure compares



        '4The results for changes in levels of earnings generated similar results to changes in logs (not shown here).
The changes in logs will be used for the rest of the study.

                                                         21
to another. Overall mean weekly earnings vary the most across the cycle for all groups, followed by the

FT EPOP and then the Any-work EPOP. For example, for low educated nonwhite women, the response

in mean earnings is three times as large as the response for employment rates. In order to better compare

the results to the "single equation" estimates in Table 2, the bottom portion of the table divides each

parameter by the estimated y for the reference group in that equation. The statistical significance refers

to testing whether these parameters (in the bottom portion of the table) are significantly different from 1.

        Comparing the estimates in the bottom portion of Table 3 to the estimates in Table 2, very

similar patterns emerge. Nonwhites and less educated workers experience fluctuations larger than other

groups. Even within education groups, nonwhites fare worse than whites, possibly reflecting their more

disadvantaged status. White women in both high and low education groups experience less cyclical

variation than all other groups. Nonwhite less educated women exhibit more fluctuation, but less than

their male counterparts.

        All remaining regression models will be estimated using the "pooled model". This does not

change the qualitative results significantly.

7.2 Results for Aimual Measures using ADF Data

        The ADF data allows for two important extensions to the analysis of the ORG data. First, I

examine more comprehensive measures of employment cone sponding to activities over the past year

thereby getting at changes in the duration and intensity of employment. Second, I can examine family

measures in addition to individual measures. The family is the key economic unit and, for policy

purposes, an analysis limited to individuals would be incomplete. An analysis of families may differ

from one of individuals in that families contain varying numbers of potential workers with differences in

propensities for intra-family substitution of labor market activity.

        The results for the ADF are presented in two tables. Table 4 presents the results for individual

labor market outcomes (FTYR EPOP, annual hours, aimual earnings, and hourly wages) and table 5


                                                     22
presents the results for the family outcomes (head's earnings, spouse's earnings, other family income,

and family earnings and income).15 In each table, a "pooled model" is estimated and the parameter for

the reference group in one equation is normalized to one. The format of the tables are identical to Table

3, with estimated parameters and standard errors in the top portion of the table, and adjusted parameters

along with tests for statistical significance (different from 1) in the bottom portion of the table.

         Looking at the top portion of Table 4, the magnitude of changes in aimual earnings are larger

than aimual hours or employment rates. This is not surprising as aimual earnings captures changes in

employment and hours worked. Average hourly wages (averaged over workers) are, along with the other

measures, pro-cyclical. This is consistent with the more recent real wage studies. The bottom portion

of Table 4 provides estimates of the relative responsiveness across groups. This shows similar patterns

to those with the ORG data. The responsiveness to a shock is higher for those with lower education

levels and nonwhites, and lower for high educated white women. The results are particularly striking

when you compare white and nonwhite low educated groups. For both men and women, nonwhites are

significantly more impacted by business cycles than whites. For example, the equation for mean aimual

hours worked shows that white low skilled men are 1.3 times more affected than high skill white men,

while nonwhite low skill men are more than 3 times more affected.16

         Similar to the ORG, the results for earnings show smaller differences across groups than the

employment measures. Again, this may reflect differences across groups in the types of workers who

experience unemployment (or reductions in hours) or differences in wage rigidities between high and low

skill workers. This can be examined more directly by looking at the estimates for the equation for the



          '5For the purposes of this analysis, the "head" is defined as either the head of the CPS family or subfamily
(if the person is part of a family), or the individual themselves if they are an unrelated person of secondary
individual. In married couples, the man is always assigned to be the head. If there is no spouse in the family, a value
of 0 is used.

         '6We also estimated models with Any-work EPOP. Those estimates show large but no statistically
significant differences across groups.

                                                         23
average hourly wages (column 4). Most of the parameters are less than one and imply that the cyclical

fluctuations in the wages of high skill white men are larger than that found for nonwhites, women and

less skilled workers. This dampens the differences across groups in aimual earnings.

        The estimates for the pooled models of family outcomes are presented in Table 5. Family

income is disaggregated into head's earnings, spouse's earnings, and other family income. Other family

income includes transfers, capital income, and earnings of other family members. The table also includes

summary measures for family earnings and family income. Individual aimual earnings are also included

to provide some reference to the earlier tables on individual outcomes. 17 Examining the top portion of

Table 5 shows that the earnings of heads is less variable than overall earnings. Comparing head's

earnings (column 1) to family earnings (column 5) shows that in the most disadvantaged groups

(nonwhite or less educated) there is little evidence of labor substitution among family member as family

earnings fluctuates more than head's earnings. Among more skilled families (high educated whites)

family earnings fluctuates less than head's earnings. That can be seem more directly by the small

coefficient on spouse's earnings for high educated, white groups. Transfers tend to reduce the size of the

shock, which can be seen by comparing the estimates for family earnings and family income.

        By examining the bottom portion of the table, with parameters normalized to 1 for the reference

group in each equation, one can compare how the different family measures impact groups differentially.

In general, these figures match the general pattern of findings thus far. Those with lower education

levels and nonwhites show greater responsiveness to cycles than the high skill and white groups. The

most striking results exist for spouse's earnings, with much greater fluctuations for low educated

nonwhite, and to a lesser extent white, individuals. This is in part due to lower marriage rates in these

groups, but may also reflect differences in the propensity for women to be "added workers".


         '7Note that the parameter estimates for individual earnings in Table 5 do not match exactly the parameters
in Table 4. That is because different equations were estimated, which generates somewhat different estimated MSA
shocks. The coefficients are quite comparable.

                                                        24
         Including non-labor income has a significant impact on the differences in cyclical responses

across skill groups. In general, the gaps between groups narrow when considering family income

(column 6). This pattern was also found by Blank (1989) and Blank and Card (1993). The reduction in

volatility is especially evident for nonwhite less skilled individuals. For example, family earnings of less

educated nonwhite women fluctuate three times as much as the reference group, but their family income

fluctuates only 2.5 times as much as the income of the reference group. This is a 15 percent reduction.

In analyses not shown here, the reduction in the impact of cycles on low skill families comes from receipt

of counter-cyclical government transfers such as welfare and unemployment assistance.18

7.3 Discussion

         The results from the analysis of the ORG and ADF data show consistently that, relative to high

skill white men, nonwhites and those with low education levels have greater fluctuation in cycles.

Highly educated white women are the only group that consistently shows lower responsiveness compared

to the reference group. Here we explore why. First, some groups may be less tied to the labor market

and may rely on government transfers or the labor earnings of other family members. Another hypothesis

is that the jobs held by individuals in these groups vary in ways that would lead to expected differences

in employment fluctuations. It is fairly well established that jobs in construction and manufacturing,

laborers, younger workers, and those in non-union employment experience more employment

fluctuations, while jobs in the public and FIRE (finance, insurance, and real estate) sectors, managerial

jobs, and union jobs experience less employment fluctuations.

         These possibilities are explored in Table 6, which presents means of some of these variables for

each of the skill groups used in the analysis. The patterns in the table match in many ways the patterns

found in the regressions. For example, highly educated white women, the least responsive group, are


          18J explored estimating models with more dissaggregated measures of family income such as various
transfers. In practice, few families receive these transfers and most of the parameters were not statistically
significant.

                                                         25
least likely to be in construction and manufacturing and are much more likely to be in retail trade, FIRE,

and public sector jobs. They are also more likely to be in managerial and professional jobs, and less

likely to be in operator/laborer positions. Nonwhite less educated men, on the other hand, are the most

represented in construction, manufacturing, laborer positions, and have the lowest union participation

rates. This simple analysis gives mixed evidence for nonwhite less skilled women, found to be the most

responsive group. On the one hand, they have the highest rates of nonattachment to the labor market and

highest welfare reliance which would smaller cyclical fluctuations. On the other hand, those that are

employed are more likely to be in manufacturing and in laborer positions, which would lead to higher

rates of cyclical fluctuation.

7.4 Extensions

        All of the regression results hold the skill group responsiveness to be fixed over the entire time

period. The two maj or business cycles covered in the data, the 1982 and 1992 recessions, differed a

great deal in which industries and occupations were most impacted. Farber (1997), using data from the

Displaced Worker Surveys, shows that in the early 1990s displacement rates among higher educated

workers increased relative to those with lower education levels. The impacts of changes over time in the

relative responsiveness is explored in this section using the ADF data. First, graphs comparing high and

low educated men are presented for the 1989-1992 period which can be compared to the earlier graphs

for 1979-1982. Second, the regressions are estimated allowing for different skill group parameters for

the years 1975-1988 versus 1990-1996.

        Figure 6   presents changes in the log of mean aimual hours and earnings for low skill men

compared to the reference group, high skill white men. Comparing this to Figure 5,the comparable

figure for 1979-1982, several important differences emerge. First, the effect of the downturn on the low

skill group is much closer to the effect on high skill group. The MSA observations are clustered much

closer to the 45 degree line (the line of equal effects). Second, this feature is found for both whites and


                                                    26
nonwhites, although more so for whites.

          This is explored further in Table 7. The table reports results for equations for individual

earnings, family earnings and family income and uses the same pooled model as above. The only

difference is the addition of a set of skill group specific cycle parameters that apply to the post-1988

period:


                             1T1(Yjmt) =   a. + (y. +        * Post88) Pmt + jmt                             (4)


The coefficients ' i represent the change in the responsiveness between the early and later periods. 1988

is chosen as the break year because it is the end of the recovery from the 1982 recession. The top portion

of the table presents the cyclical responsiveness parameters for the overall period (y) and the bottom

portion presents the parameters for the difference between pre and post 1988 period (y& There are two

normalizations in the pooled model, one for the overall period and one for post 1988 period. As above,

the coefficient for high skill white men in the overall period is normalized to 1. In addition, the

parameter capturing differences between pre and post 1988 period is set to 0 for this group. In the

bottom of the table, I also include renormalize all of the coefficients by subtracting the value for the

reference group. These are in italics. The statistical significance tests are that the top panel figures are

different from 1 and the bottom panel figures are different than 0.

          These results fairly consistently show that the relative responsiveness of cycles by the low skill

groups has declined relative to high skill white men over this time period. That is, all coefficients are

negative in the bottom of the table. This is consistent with Farber (1997). 19 The largest reducitons occur

for the most disadvantaged groups. For example, referring to the results for aimual earnings, the relative

responsiveness of low skill nonwhite men fell by -0.81. The relative responsiveness of family income



          '9Bartik (1995) finds no evidence of changes over time. Bartik's sample, however, ends in 1987 which is
likely to be before the changes started taking place.

                                                        27
fell by -1.08 for low education nonwhite men from an overall level of 2.09. The table indicates that

many of these reductions are statistically significantly different from zero. The reductions for low skilled

nonwhite women were not as large. Overall, these results show that the 1992 recession was much more

skill-group neutral than the 1982 recession.

         Several sensitivity tests were performed for these models. In all cases, specific parameters

changed somewhat but the qualitative results were the same. Changing the defmition of race from

white/noithispanic and black/hispanic to white and black, led to larger racial differences. Hispanic men

appear to be more like whites in that they have relatively high employment rates and relatively less

cyclical variation. They also have relatively low education levels so they are a sizeable fraction of the

low educated nonwhite group. Expanding the skill groups by considering four education groups led to

larger differences between education levels. However, the precision of the estimates declined somewhat

and many of the differences were not statistically significant.2°



7. Conclusion

         This paper uses data from the Current Population Survey covering the period 1975-1997 to

examine how business cycles impact the employment, earnings, and income of low skill groups relative

to high skill groups. The results consistently show that those with lower education levels, nonwhites, and

low skilled nonwhite women, are more impacted by cycles than high skill white men. The analysis of

family income shows that there is evidence that government transfers are effective at narrowing the

differences in impacts across demographic groups.



          20Other specification tests included (1) limiting the MSA sample to the largest 15-20 MSAs, (2) dropping
"seam" years when the MSA boundaries change, and (3) dropping the 1995 and 1996 ADF years when the topcode
on earnings increased significantly. The results were not sensitive to changing the MSA sample or dropping the
seam years. Dropping the most recent ADF years did lead to modest increases in the relative responsiveness of the
earnings and income of low skill groups. Looking back at Figure 2b, the earnings of high educated white men
increased significantly with the increase in topcodes in 1995. Given that this was in a recovery, dropping those years
leads to larger differences in the cyclical variation skill groups.

                                                         28
        The results also suggest that the 1992 recession and subsequent recovery had differential impacts

compared to the 1982 recession and recovery. In particular, in the 1989-1996 period, the sensitivity to

cyclical variation of less skilled groups was still larger than high skill groups, but the differences

narrowed. This may be in part due to the fact that the less skilled groups had somewhat low employment

rates going in to the 1992 recession. It also may reflect differences in the industries that were affected in

the 1992 versus 1982 recessions. Tdentifing the sources of this change is important and should be

examined in future work.

Notes: Author's tabulations of CPS Outgoing Rotation Group Data. EPOP is defined as the weighted number of men working
last year over the weighted male population in the MSA. The sample includes all men who are between the ages of 22 and 62.
We exclude those working without pay, the self employed, and those with weekly earnings less than $67 in 1982 dollars. For
more detail on sample selection, see text.

Notes: Each column is a separate regression where the dependent variable is the change in the log or level of the labor market
outcome evaluated at the mean for the cell defined by MSA, year, and skill group. The parameter estimates reported in the table
are the coefficients on the MSA-time shock for each skill group. The regression also includes intercepts for each skill group
capturing average growth rates in the labor market outcome for each skill group. The regression is estimated using nonlinear
weighted least squares, using the cell's population as the weight. The sample is from the CPS ORG data and covers 1979-1993.
The data are grouped into two year periods to increase cell sizes. All labor market outcome variables correspond to the week
preceding the interview. For details on sample selection and variable construction, see the text. Standard errors are in
parentheses. A ** [*] indicates the parameter is significantly different from 1 at the 1% [5%] level.

Notes: Each column presents estimates of an equation where the dependent variable is the change in the log of the labor market
outcome evaluated at the mean for the cell defined by MSA, year, and skill group. The equations are estimated jointly with the
MSA shocks common to each equation. The parameter estimates reported in the table are the coefficients on the MSA-time
shock for each skill group. The regression also includes intercepts for each skill group capturing average growth rates in the
labor market outcome for each skill group. The regression is estimated using nonlinear weighted least squares, using the cell's
population as the weight. The sample is from the CPS ADF and covers 1975-1996. The data are grouped into two year periods
to increase cell sizes. All labor market outcome variables correspond to the week preceding the interview. For details on sample
selection and variable construction, see the text. Standard errors are in parentheses. A ** [*] indicates the parameter is
significantly different from 1 at the 1% [5%] level.

Notes: Each column presents estimates of an equation where the dependent variable is the change in the log of the labor market
outcome evaluated at the mean for the cell defined by MSA, year, and skill group. The equations are estimated jointly with the
MSA shocks common to each equation. This specification allows the effects of MSA shocks to differ over the period. The top
panel presents estimates corresponding to the full period and the bottom presents estimates for the post 1988 period. The
numbers in italics in the bottom panel represent the changes in the skill group coefficient in the post-88 period relative to the
change for skill group 1. Standard errors are in parentheses. In the top panel, a ** [*] indicates the parameter is significantly
different from 1 at the 1% [5%] level. In the bottom panel, a ** [*] indicates that the parameter is significantly different from 0
at the 1% [5%] level.
