Evidence From Maternity Leave Expansions of the Impact of Maternal Care on Early Child
Development

JEL No. J13,J22

                                           ABSTRACT

We study the impact of maternal care on early child development using an expansion in Canadian
maternity leave entitlements. Following the leave expansion, mothers who took leave spent between
48 and 58 percent more time not working in the first year of their children's lives. We find that this
extra maternal care primarily crowded out home-based care by unlicensed non-relatives, and replaced
mostly full-time work. However, the estimates suggest a weak impact of the increase in maternal care
on indicators of child development. Measures of family environment and motor-social development
showed changes very close to zero. Some improvements in temperament were observed but occurred
both for treated and untreated children.

1.0 Introduction
       Is parental or non-parental care best for children? Conflicting answers to this question

fuel the so-called ‘mommy wars’ over maternal work when children are young. One source of

the lack agreement is that non-parental care appears to have different impacts in different

populations. Karoly et al. (1998) summarize the compelling evidence from social experiments

showing that high quality early childhood care interventions can improve cognitive outcomes for

children at risk. On the other hand, recent evidence from samples including all types of children

suggests that non-parental care can lead to behavioral problems and that maternal employment in

a child’s first year of life can lead to delayed cognitive development.

       Commentators have pointed out that the credibility of the inferences in this literature

varies considerably owing to differences in empirical design. Perhaps the strongest evidence is

for at-risk children, because experimental designs have featured randomization into high quality

non-parental care. However, current policy debate centers not on targeted interventions for at-

risk children, but on universal programs such as pre-school for 4 year olds, extensions of

maternity leave in the US, or universal child care programs for infants in Canada. There is much

less experimental evidence for broader populations of children, so inferences lean more heavily

on observation: comparisons of children whose parents have chosen non-parental care to children

whose parents have not.

       In this paper we provide new evidence on the developmental impact of maternal care

based in a significant increase in maternity/parental leave in Canada. At the end of 2000, the

duration of job-protected, partially-compensated, maternity leave increased from roughly six

months to one year in most provinces. Many mothers were thereby provided with an opportunity

to significantly extend the period they remained at home post-birth. Importantly, this episode


                                                                                                    1
allows a researcher to study observationally equivalent women having children in neighboring

years under starkly different maternity leave policy regimes. This provides a source of

exogenous variation in the exposure to maternal care for a wide spectrum of children.

        Our results on child development rest on the strength of this first-stage relationship

between maternity leave and time at home. Following Baker and Milligan (2005, 2007) and

Hanratty and Trzcinski (2006), we show that the increase in maternity leave led to a very

substantial increase in the amount of maternal care Canadian children received in the first year of

life. For mothers who were eligible for leave, we estimate that the amount of maternal care their

children received in the first year of life rose by over 3 months, an increase of roughly 50 percent

over the pre-reform average. Importantly, this increase in maternal care led to a large reduction

in maternal full-time work. Previous research identifies a negative link between full time

maternal work in a child’s first year of life and their subsequent cognitive development.

        Of course, any effect of an increase in maternal care depends on what type of care is

displaced. We find the increase in maternal care is associated with a large decline in unlicensed

care provided by a non-relative in someone else’s home. Past research has raised questions about

the quality of this type of care, so the contrast to maternal care is clear.

        To investigate the impact of this significant change in the care of young infants, we draw

on the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY). The NLSCY is a

nationally representative survey that tracks the behavioral, social, emotional and cognitive

development of children. We currently observe children born after the change in maternity leave

up to age 29 months. At these ages the NLSCY provides a variety of parent-reported

information. These include measures of parenting, temperament, social/motor development, the

achievement of milestones, family function and children’s social and family environment. While

some of these indicators are related to subsequent cognitive performance, we also note that they

                                                                                                    2
may be important for adult economic success in their own right (Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua

2006).

         We find that the reform led to a significant increase in the amount of maternal care

children received, with corresponding decreases in full time maternal employment and

unlicensed non-relative care in someone else’s home. The impact of these changes on our

measures of development, however, is negligible. The effects on measures of family

environment and motor-social development are very close to zero. Some improvements in

temperament are observed but appear to reflect common trends across all mothers rather than

only mothers eligible for the leave.


2.0 Previous research on care at young ages
         For the vast majority of mothers, work and non-parental care go hand in hand when their

children are very young. Therefore a focus of the literature is on the relationship between child

development and the mother’s decision to work when their child is an infant.

         The National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY) is a source for much of the research

on this topic in the United States. The majority of studies on early maternal employment

(specifically, the first year of life) using these data find negative effects on later cognitive

outcomes, although there is some dissent (see Waldfogel et al. 2002; Bernal and Keane 2006).

This conclusion is supported by analysis of the NICHD-SECC data (Brooks-Gunn et al. 2002),

which concludes that full-time maternal employment in the ninth month of life has negative

cognitive effects that manifest by 3 years of age. As a point of contrast, studies using various

other data generally find no negative impact of early maternal employment on the outcomes of




                                                                                                    3
school aged children (see Brooks-Gunn et al. 2002).1 Nevertheless, in her survey of this

literature Waldfogel (2006) concludes that “…the research on this point is now quite clear.

Children do fare better on average if their mothers do not work full-time in the first year of life,

although… the effects vary by context” (p.45).

         Complementary to this research are studies of the effects of non-parental care on other

dimensions of development. Magnuson et al. (2007), Baker et al. (2005), Loeb et al. (2007) and

the research summarized in Belsky (2006) suggest that larger and longer exposures to non-

parental care lead to problem behavior: disobedience, defiance and aggression. The risk appears

to grow both in the cumulative duration (months) and intensity (hours per week) of exposure in

the first years. Loeb et al. (2007) finds that entry into non-parental care before the age of one can

have particularly detrimental effects.

         In any discussion of these results an outstanding issue is the quality of non-parental care.

Measures of child care quality are evolving, and often expensive to collect. The data that exist

suggest that while higher quality child care can enhance the cognitive benefits of non-parental

care for older children (Belsky 2006), it does not attenuate any negative effect of early maternal

employment (Brooks-Gunn et al. 2002). Furthermore, quality does not appear to play a strong

mediating role in the relationship between exposure to non-parental care and behavior (Belsky

2006).

         Against this background, our study has a number of attractive features. First, the change

in maternal care we observe spans the 9 months-old milestone where previous research has found

a relationship between maternal employment and cognitive development. Second, we have

access to a relatively rich description of the children’s environment. Finally, the variation in

 These conclusions contrast with studies of the effects of pre-kindergarten that more consistently show positive
cognitive effects. See for example, Magnuson et al. (2007).


                                                                                                                   4
maternal care we observe as a result of the maternity leave reform is less likely correlated with

other determinants of children’s outcomes. In many of the previous studies cited, the inference

is observational rather than causal, and so may be biased by unobservable background factors

that differ systematically across families. Progress in the literature is marked by new data sets

(e.g., the NICHD SECC) that gather more extensive menus of observable background factors in

the hope that the additional factors can contain any selection effects. In contrast, our study makes

use of policy-induced variation in maternal care. While more likely free of omitted variables

biases, our inference is limited to mothers whose choice of time at home post-birth responds to

changes in maternity mandates and compensation.


3.0 Maternity Leave Policy
       Jurisdiction over maternity leaves in Canada is split between the federal and provincial

governments. Provincial labor standards legislation governs the amount of time that mothers

may stay at home post-birth with a right to return to their old job. The legislation typically sets

eligibility based on a minimum period of pre-birth employment, bans dismissal due to

pregnancy, mandates a maximum duration for leave, mandates a right to return to the previous or

a similar job, and specifies which terms of employment are preserved during the leave. In no

province is the employer obligated to pay an employee while on this leave.

       Income replacement during the leave is funded by the federal government. Within the

federal Employment Insurance (EI) system there is a program of maternity/parental (henceforth

maternity) leave benefits that mothers may claim when their earnings are interrupted by giving

birth. Eligibility and benefit entitlement are determined by the same rules used to calculate

unemployment benefits. Benefits are based on earnings averaged over the 6 months preceding

the claim. In the period we examine, the replacement rate is 55% up to a cap of $39,000, which


                                                                                                      5
implies a maximum weekly benefit of $412.50 per week. A two week waiting period with zero

benefits lowers the effective replacement rate over the full span of the leave. Eligibility is based

on a minimum of 600 hours of employment in the 12 months preceding a claim. Claiming these

benefits does not trigger any job protection, and some mothers will not return to work after

completing a claim.

       The reform we analyze originates in the federal EI system. Prior to December 31, 2000,

the duration of maternity leave benefits was a maximum of 25 weeks: 15 weeks that could only

be claimed by the mother, and a further 10 weeks that could be split by the mother and the father

(with no restrictions on how these 10 weeks were split). Starting with children born on

December 31, 2000, the total duration of benefits was increased to 50 weeks as the number of

weeks of benefits that could be claimed by either the mother or father rose to 35 weeks. The

reform also included a reduction of the required hours of employment for eligibility from 700 to

600.

       This change in the rules for maternity leave benefits triggered a corresponding change in

the duration of job-protected maternity leave in the provinces’ labor standards legislation. Prior

to December 31, 2000, the duration of the job protection ranged from a low of 18 weeks in

Alberta to a high of 70 weeks in Quebec. With the change in the EI rules all provinces except

Quebec changed their labor standards legislation to increase the duration of job protection to at

least 52 weeks. Most provinces made the change coincident with the change in the EI rules.

Alberta (February 7, 2001) and Saskatchewan (June 14, 2001) changed their legislation early in

2001. These changes are summarized in Figure 1.

       In addition to any change in maternal care, this reform may also have changed family

income because the EI replacement rate is less than 1.0. In some simple simulations, however,

we find that on an after-tax/transfer, after childcare cost basis, the effective replacement rate is

                                                                                                       6
close to 1.0 for a median earning woman. For women earning less than the median, the EI

benefit (which depends on previous earnings) is lower but still may yield higher after-tax and

after paid childcare income than work. For higher earning women, the effective replacement rate

falls beneath 1.0, meaning that they may suffer an income shortfall in the leave extension period

relative to the pre-reform situation. We note that these high earnings women are more likely to

work for employers that have a program to top up EI benefits to a higher fraction of pre-birth

earnings.


4.0 Data

           Our analysis is based on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Children and

Youth (NLSCY). The NLSCY is a nationally representative survey of children that has

complete cross-sectional coverage of children aged 0 to 5 over six waves of biannual data

starting in 1994-95 and ending in 2004-05. We focus on the children born in years surrounding

the reform; in years 1998 through 2003. We can observe these children at ages 6 through 29

months, although certain outcomes are only available for specific age ranges. Below, we describe

the measures available to us, and discuss the validity and use of these measures.

           The NLSCY includes a wide variety of indicators of child development, home and care

environments, school performance and health. At the ages that we observe the treated children

both pre cognitive and non cognitive measures are available, but not direct cognitive

assessments.2

           A first set of variables allows us to relate the policy change to the children’s care

environment. For this purpose, there are variables recording the child’s age when the mother

    The first cognitive testing in the NLSCY is performed at 48 months of age.


                                                                                                   7
returned to work, and some limited characteristics of the employment. There are also detailed

questions on the types of non-maternal care a child receives, including hours per week and

whether the provider is licensed.

      The next set of variables describes the child’s development. Many of these variables are

available only for particular age ranges. For the ages we study, there are measures of

temperament, motor/social development, family function, parenting, parent/child activities and

the achievement of milestones. All are parent-reported and obtained through the interview

process. Several of these measures have been used in previous research. The Motor and Social

Development (MSD) scale (Baker et al. 1993) was developed at the US National Center for

Health Statistics for the general measure of early child development in large, population-based

surveys. It uses questions with high validity and reliability from leading measures of child

development (Denver Prescreening Developmental Questionnaire, Bayley Scales of Infant

Development and Gesell Development Schedules). This scale has also been used in the US

National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, the British National Child Development Survey, and the

US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. The parenting scales, one measuring

positive interaction and another measuring practices that provoke aversion, were developed at

Chedoke-McMaster Hospital, McMaster University, based in part on the Parent Practices Scale

of Strayhorn and Weidman. These scales are also used by the Fast-Track project, an

experimental intervention in the US to understand anti-social behavior among young children.

The general functioning subscale of the McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD) is used to

measure family (dys)function. The FAD has been used in numerous studies, translated into

seven languages and has been extensively evaluated. The NLSCY also includes measures of the

ages at which significant milestones are achieved (first steps, first words etc.). The questions

about the child’s temperament were taken from the Ontario Health Study and the Montreal

                                                                                                   8
Longitudinal Survey. These questions are based on the Child Behavior Checklist of Achenbach

and the Social Behavior Questionnaire. Finally, we also draw on questions about non-school

activities of the parent and child and questions about literacy, focusing on how often parents read

stories, teach new words and do play activities with their children.

       Parent-reported data may suffer from systematic biases. For example, a parent who stays

home with a child may have a greater chance of becoming aware of a behavior since more time

is spent with the child than if the parent worked. However, reviews of the validity of parent-

reported data typically suggest they are informative about the underlying object they are intended

to measure and often display strong correlation with professional assessment ( De Los Reyes and

Kazdin 2005; Rydz et al. 2005). Furthermore, there does not appear to be clear evidence that any

bias in parents’ reports of their children’s development is correlated with their characteristics (De

Los Reyes and Kazdin 2005).


5.0 Empirical Framework and Identification

       In this section we introduce our empirical framework, describe various sample omissions

that we make to achieve identification, and discuss some issues of interpretation and estimation.


       5.1 Empirical Framework

       Our inference is based on comparisons of average outcomes by birth cohort. We begin

with the estimating equation

(1)     y i = X i β + ∑ γ t YOBti + u i ,
                      t




                                                                                                    9
where y is the outcome of interest for individual i, X are conditioning variables and YOB denotes

year of birth.3 The γ t , t ∈ {1999,2000,...,2003}, provide birth cohort-specific estimates of the

conditional mean of y, relative to the excluded year 1998.

         If the reform led causally to a change in a given outcome, we expect that the estimates of

γ t will display a distinct pattern before and after the program change. The change in maternity

leave is in effect for the birth cohorts 2001 through 2003, and so we anticipate a discrete change

in the estimates between the cohorts 2000 and 2001. All else equal, we would also expect the

estimates for cohorts 1998 through 2000 and for 2001 through 2003 to be relatively similar in the

absence of any other factor driving changes in the dependent variable in these years.

         A visual inspection of the estimates of γ t , which we report for each outcome variable in

the appendix, provides an informal check of the coherence of the data to the hypothesized

pattern. It also allows us to investigate counterfactual policy reforms (for example, supposing

the change in maternity leave occurred at the end of 1999 or 2002, instead of at the end of 2000)

as a robustness check for our inferences. Once these checks are satisfied, we then summarize the

impact of the reform more concisely by estimating the equation

(2)      y i = X i β + φPOSTi + ε i ,

where POST equals 1 for cohorts born after the reform (2001 or later). POST provides an

estimate of the impact of the reform, as the difference in the conditional mean of y between

cohorts born before the change in the maternity leave and cohorts born after.




3
  The control variables (X) include dummy variables for male children, single month of child’s age, province, city
size, mothers’ and fathers’ education (4 categories), age (6 categories) and immigrant status, and the presence of up
to 2 older or younger siblings. For some dependent variables we also report a specification that adds the month of
birth provincial unemployment rate as a control for local labor market conditions. Because the interview process
spans several months, we use the average unemployment rate for the months September through May in the relevant
years.


                                                                                                                  10
        5.2 Identification and Interpretation

        The success of this strategy, of course, is not assured. Generally, conditional on the Xs

the estimate of POST will pick up any unobserved variable that is correlated with it and the

dependent variable. For example, underlying trends in the outcome measures or other changes in

the developmental environment of the children could contaminate our estimate of POST. We can

anticipate some of these unobserved variables and control for them through adjustments to our

sample. We have identified two policy changes of importance, either of which could potentially

affect family outcomes or child development and therefore damage the credibility of our

inferences.

        The first is the extension of the subsidized childcare component of Quebec’s family

policy to 0 and 1 year olds in the fall of 2000. Under this extension, children of these ages

became eligible for heavily subsidized childcare, at $5 per day. Baker et al. (2005) report that

the introduction of subsidized childcare in Quebec over the period 1997-2000 had a large impact

on the functioning of families with young children, and the behavioral development of these

children. To avoid confusing any impact of the change in maternity leave with this change in the

price of non-parental care, we omit observations from Quebec from our sample.

        The second significant change in policy is the increase to the National Child Benefit, a

benefit paid to low-income families with some attachment to the labor force. For example, the

annual benefit for single child increased from $605 in 1998 to $1293 in 2002. Milligan and

Stabile (2007) show that this change had a substantial impact on the employment of single

mothers. Because the benefit is income–tested at the family level, it had a much smaller effect

on two parent families.4 As a result, we omit observations for single-parent families from our


4
  In 1998, the National Child Benefit was reduced to zero for family incomes above $25,921. By 2002, this
threshold had reached $32,960. A much smaller proportion of two-parent families fall under these thresholds.


                                                                                                               11
analysis sample. It is worth noting that due to relatively low rates of single parenthood in

Canada, this omission removes only about 10 percent of births over the period.5

         An alternative to tailoring the sample to exclude specific confounding factors is to

construct a control group of children who are exposed to the same influences as children in our

analysis sample, with the exception of the change in maternity leave. While older children might

be natural candidates for this role since they appear in the same waves of the survey but were

born too early to be affected by the maternity leave change, this idea is frustrated by the structure

of the NLSCY. There are distinct differences in the indices of development, family function and

the questions about non-school activities for different age groups that render these measures less

comparable across ages.

         Because we do not observe pre-birth employment consistently across waves in the

NLSCY, we cannot precisely identify those women who were eligible either for job-protected

leave or for EI maternity benefits. As a result, our analysis samples contain mothers who were

potentially ineligible because of insufficient work prior to the child’s birth and also those who

may have been eligible but did not take benefits to which they were entitled. For this reason,

equations (1) or (2) should be interpreted as an “intention to treat” design, with ‘eligibility'

meaning the mother had a child after December 31, 2000 and ‘take-up’ meaning that the new

mother actually took a leave.6

         The intention-to-treat estimates are informative about the impact on child development of

having a child after the policy changed. This is interesting if one is concerned about the

population-level impact of the policy change. More informative about individual behavior is the

Alberta and Saskatchewan in the months between December 2000 and the point when the provincial maternity leave
mandate changes a few months later.

  In an intention to treat design, assignment to treat is random, but take-up of the intervention among the eligible is
less than complete. See Bloom (1984).

‘treatment on the treated’ parameter, which measures the impact of actually taking a leave on

child development. To move from the intention-to-treat to the treatment on the treated

parameters requires us to scale the intention to treat estimates by a factor reflecting the

proportion of women who had a birth and took a leave.7

         To implement this scaling, we take the following approach. In Statistics Canada’s Survey

of Employment Insurance Coverage data, 70 percent of mothers with children aged less than one

year had insured employment in the 12 months preceding childbirth in 2000, rising to between

74 and 75 percent in 2001 through 2005.8 If this pre-birth employment meant these mothers

were eligible for the job protection aspect of maternity leave, then we should scale our estimates

by 1.33 (1/0.75). The presence of insured employment, however, does not guarantee EI benefit

receipt. These same data show that the proportion of mothers with any insurable employment

who ultimately are eligible for and claim benefits is 80 percent in 2000 and 2001 rising to

roughly 85 percent in 2002-2005. If we are interested in the impact of being eligible and taking

up EI benefits, then we should scale our estimates by 1.57 (1/(0.75*0.85)). In the discussion of

results that follows we make reference to both the 1.33 and 1.57 scaling factors as the lower and

upper bound implied by the available evidence.

         Still another method to obtain the treatment effects is to restrict the analysis sample to

only those who might be eligible. While the NLSCY does not collect good information on pre-

birth employment, the information on post-birth employment is much better. We can use this

information to select mothers who are likely to have been eligible for both the EI maternity

benefits and the job-protected maternity leave. We implement this approach by selecting

 The source is Statistics Canada (2006), which reports results from the Survey of Employment Insurance Coverage.
The increase between 2000 and 2005 suggests that the reform led to an increase in the pre-birth employment of
mothers, but the match is not exact because each survey runs from April though January of the following year. In
contrast, the reference period for benefits is for employment in the 12 months preceding the birth of a child who can
be up to 12 months old. Unfortunately there are no data on maternity benefits preceding the 2000 survey.


                                                                                                                  13
mothers who return to work within a year of their child’s birth. Note that a comparison of the

results in the restricted and full samples provides yet another check on our identification. The

comparison reveals whether “likely eligibles” or “likely ineligibles”, as we define them, drive the

result in the full sample. This can only be an informal check, however, because the incidence of

return to work post-birth is potentially affected by the change in maternity leave.


         5.3 Estimation

         Equations (1) and (2) make clear that an estimate of POST rests on the variation of the

conditional mean of y across six birth cohorts. Recently, Donald and Lang (2007) have pointed

out the importance of explicitly accounting for the finiteness of the “effective sample” in the

estimation—that is, the fact that in some respects we only have six aggregated observations

rather than the thousands of individuals in the underlying microdata sample. To account for this,

we use a two-step procedure. We first estimate equation (1) with no constant, which provides

estimates of the YOBt effects for each birth cohort.9 We then use these estimates as the

dependent variable in a six observation regression following equation (2), except the only

explanatory variables are a constant and POST, and we weight by the sum of the individual

weights by year of birth. There are 4 degrees of freedom in these regressions so the critical value

for statistical significance at the 5-percent level is 2.78. All the substantial inferences of the

paper are robust to alternative methods of calculating the standard errors.10




9
  These are similar to the γ reported in the Appendix, but rescaled since we now include the full set of cohort
                           t

dummies including one for the 1998 birth cohort.
10
   We tried various other methods for calculating standard errors. First we tried using robust standard errors and
clustering on the year of birth. The resulting standard errors were implausibly small. Second, we tried a model fully
saturated with province-year of birth interactions, then regressed the interaction coefficients on POST. This is
similar to the method of Solon, Whatley, and Stevens (1997). Finally, we followed the advice of Bertrand et al.
(2004) and regressed our outcomes on a full set of province-POST interactions that then served as the dependent
variable for a second stage regression. These last two methods yielded inferences errors to the ones we report.


                                                                                                                  14
6.0 Results
       We present results in three steps. First, we examine the impact of the reforms on work by

new mothers—and its complement, maternal time at home. Second we trace the change through

to the types and timing of different modes of non-parental care. Finally, we explore the impact

of the induced changes in care on child development and the family environment.


       6.1     Maternal care and work

       Estimates of the impact of the increase in maternity leave on the amount of maternal care

a child receives are reported in Table 1. As a summary statistic, in the first row we report the

result for a measure of the months of maternal care in the child’s first year of life. This variable,

which takes values between 0 and 12, is constructed from a report of the mother’s return to work

post-birth. The sample for this analysis is the mothers of children aged 13-29 months, so labor

market behavior over the first year of life is fully observable.

       The estimate in the first column indicates an increase of 2.2 months, which is 26 percent

of the pre-reform mean. The causal interpretation of this estimate is supported by the individual

YOB estimates reported in appendix Table A1. We graph these estimates in Figure 2 to

illuminate our identification strategy. There is a clear shift in the estimates starting with the

2001 birth cohort.

       This is an intention-to-treat estimate. To obtain the treatment on the treated, we can scale

the estimate, resulting in an increase in maternal care of between (2.2*1.333) 2.9 and (2.2*1.57)

3.5 months. The pre-reform mean of this variable among those who actually took maternal leave

is presumably different (and likely smaller) than the mean for the full sample. To obtain an

estimate of this mean we can restrict the sample to mothers who are likely treated by the policy

change based on their post-birth employment behavior. Restricting the sample to mothers who


                                                                                                    15
returned to work in the 12 months following birth, the estimated increase in maternal care in the

first year of life is 3.150 (0.239) months, which sits at the midpoint of the interval defined by our

scaling technique. The pre-reform mean in the sample is 6.02 months indicating that our scaled

estimates suggest the reform led to an increase in maternal care of between 48 and 58 percent for

treated mothers.

       In the third column of Table 1 we add the provincial unemployment rate as an additional

regressor. This variable proxies for labor market conditions that could affect the mother’s return

to work decision. Estimates conditioning on this variable, however, are virtually identical to the

originals, suggesting that local labor market conditions were not influencing our results in the

second column. We have also estimated a specification (not reported) omitting all the

explanatory variables except the YOB effects. The results are again very similar, revealing that

there is no significant observable variation in the types of mothers and families having births as a

result of the reform. This provides some additional justification for our empirical approach.

       In the next five rows we map out the distribution of the effect across different months

over the first year. Recall that before the reform, maternity benefits were available for up to 25

weeks, and job protection was available for 18-35 weeks in the provinces included in the analysis

sample. In light of this, the largest impact is exactly where it is expected—in months 6 through

12—and in each case the estimates of the individual YOB effects (reported in the appendix)

support a causal interpretation. The proportional increases are substantial, ranging from 11

percent at 6 months to 67 percent at 12 months. Using the sample of mothers who returned to

work in the first year we can obtain (but do not report) direct estimates of these proportional

changes for the treated. They range from 17 percent at 6 months through 726 percent at 12

months.




                                                                                                   16
       In the last two rows of Table 1 we investigate the type of work displaced by this increase

in time at home. Here, we use the sample of mothers of children aged 7-12 months (the ages that

gained leave coverage through the reform), and define 0/1 indicators for currently working and

working full time (30+ hours per week). The results indicate a 30 percentage point decrease in

the proportion at work, two-thirds of which is a decrease in full-time employment. Therefore,

the majority of work displaced by the reform was full-time. This provides important context for

our analysis of development, because it is full-time work in this age interval that previous

research has related to cognitive delay.


       6.2     Changes in non-parental care


       To interpret our estimates of the impact of the reform on child development, it is useful to

know what sort of non-parental care the increase in maternal care displaced. This information is

provided in Table 2. We show estimates for two samples: children aged 7-12 months and 13-24

months. We expect the primary impact of the reform to be evident in the younger sample. The

older sample provides a check whether there is either a direct impact on older children, or a

persistent effect of some impact that starts at a younger age.

       In the first row is a global measure of whether the child is in some type of non-parental

care. We estimate a decrease of over 18 percentage points for children aged 7-12 months, and

effectively no change for children aged 13-24 months. As expected, the primary effect of the

reform is at ages 7-12 months. However, the magnitude of the effect presents a puzzle as it does

not match the decrease in work of the mothers of these children reported in Table 1. We resolve

this discrepancy in the next four rows where we split the sample into four mutually exclusive

categories: 1) mothers who work and use (non-parental) care, 2) mothers who work and don’t




                                                                                                   17
use care, 3) mothers who don’t work and use care, and 4) mothers who do not work and do not

use care. The results reveal that the 29 percentage point decrease in work is split across mothers

who do and do not use care (0.23+0.06). The 0.186 decrease in non-parental care reflects the

balance of a reduction in work with care (-0.23) and an increase in no work with care (+0.04).

As noted by Baker et al. (2005), the non-trivial proportion of mothers reporting work with no

care is likely a result of the underreporting of very informal care arrangements in the NLSCY.

As a result, the increase in maternal care as a result of the reform likely exceeds the direct

estimate of 18 percentage points. Furthermore, scaling for treatment, the impact on those likely

eligible for leave is at least 25 to 29 points.

        In the next row of the table we report the result for the number of hours per week if in

care. In the younger sample there is a significant reduction of over 5 hours off a pre-reform

mean of 29 hours. There are at least two explanations of this result. First, there is a composition

effect resulting from the fact that the mothers who stay home longer after the reform would

otherwise be heavy users of non-parental care. Second, the longer periods at home post-birth

after the reform allowed mothers to introduce their children to non-parental care more gradually.

While the former explanation is consistent with the strong decrease in full-time work, the latter

explanation may be consistent with the increase in the proportion of mothers not at work and

using care.

        The remaining rows of Table 2 disaggregate the changes in non-parental care. For ages

7-12 months, the drop in care in another’s home is 11.7 percentage points, of which 10.0

percentage points is unlicensed. Most of this (7.0 percentage points) is in the homes of non-

relatives, while 2.9 percentage points is in the homes of relatives. Again, the estimates of the

individual YOB estimates in the Appendix support a causal interpretation of these changes. A




                                                                                                   18
basis for expecting a change in child development from the reform depends on the extent that the

quality of care between unlicensed non-relatives and mothers differs.


       6.3      Changes in development and environment


       We now turn to our measures of child development and of the domestic environment.

Again, we examine children aged 7-12 months and 13-24 months separately, looking for both

concurrent and persistent effects of the strong increase in maternal care.

       In the first three rows of Table 3a we present the results for indices of parenting behavior

and family function. Each is built up from the answers to a series of questions about how the

parents interact with the child and with each other. The positive parenting index ranges from 0

to 20 with higher scores reflecting more positive behavior. The hostile/ineffective index runs

from 0 to 8 and here a higher value indicates less effectiveness. Finally, the family functioning

scale ranges from 0 to 36 with a higher value indicating more dysfunction. Baker et al. (2005)

report a significant deterioration in similar indices as a result of a strong increase in non-parental

care following the introduction of heavily subsidized universal childcare in Quebec. In that

study, however, the change in care was primarily experienced by children older than the ones

studied here.

       The estimates for both age groups are mostly small and all are statistically insignificant.

Furthermore, in each case the estimates of the individual YOB effects show regular inter-birth

cohort variation that is not related to the timing of the extension of maternity leave. Finally, in

many cases the standard errors are small, indicating that our evaluation has some power.

Remembering that we need a t-value of 2.78 for significance at the 5 percent level, the standard

errors for the estimates for positive parenting indicate that we can rule out effects larger than 11




                                                                                                      19
percent of the standard deviation of the pre-reform mean in the younger sample. For ineffective

parenting and family function the corresponding calculations are 15 and 31 percent of the

standard deviation. In the older sample they range from 12 to 17 percent. Each of these bounds

is fairly small given the large magnitude of the increase in maternal care.

       The next set of measures captures different dimensions of the child’s temperament. Each

is a 7 point scale where lower numbers indicate a better result. For example, a lower value for

how easily upset indicates that the child does not get upset very easily. Many of the questions

require an evaluation of the child relative to other children, although for some the scale maps out

specific responses (for example, how many times per day the child is irritable). We are therefore

reluctant to assign a specific interpretation to the magnitude of the estimates, but some meaning

can be found in their signs.

       Few of the estimates are statistically significant. Furthermore, given the standard errors

in most cases we have the power to rule out changes of greater than 10 to 15 percent of a

standard deviation. An exception is the estimate for difficulty calming the child, which is

positive and statistically significant for both ages and indicates greater difficulty following the

maternity leave reform. In each case the individual birth cohort estimates in the appendix

suggest a causal effect. For the younger age group this result is accompanied by a statistically

significant increase in crying, although in this case the YOB estimates suggest a causal

interpretation is not as clear. We test the robustness of these results below.

       In Table 3b, we continue the investigation by looking at security, development, and

parental involvement. The first set of variables in the table measure the child’s reaction to new

experiences, persons and places and may provide some indication of the security they feel. The

estimates are negative for persons and places indicating better reactions, and the result for

persons is statistically significant in the older sample. The final two variables provide overall

                                                                                                      20
assessments of the attention the child demands and the level of difficulty they present. The

estimates for both variables for both age groups are negative. The estimate for attention in the

older sample is statistically significant, and the estimates for difficulty in each sample are just

shy of the critical value.

        In the next section of Table 3b are the variables for development. First is the estimate for

motor/social development. This index is built up from questions about the child’s physical

(ability to crawl, walk etc.) and cognitive/social (ability to say words, count, wash hands)

capabilities.11 We use a standardized score that is set to have a population mean of 100 and

standard deviation of 15. In application, scores within one standard deviation of the mean are

interpreted to be in the range of average development. Baker et al. (2005) found a reduction in

this measure of motor/social development with the increase of non-parental care from the

Quebec universal childcare program. Here, the point estimates are negative for each age group,

but also very small and statistically insignificant. Moreover, the individual YOB estimates in the

Appendix provide little evidence of a causal effect. The standard errors imply we have the

power to detect impacts of more than 29 (37) percent of a standard deviation of the pre-reform

mean in the younger (older) sample.

        If we believe the motor/social development measure captures early cognitive skills, then

this result suggests that the cognitive effects of early maternal full time employment reported for

older children in other studies do not have a manifestation at the younger ages we examine

  Bodnarchuk and Eaton (2004) find that parent reports of motor and milestone measures perform quite well in their
validation exercise.




                                                                                                               21
here.12 However, we also note that our result contrasts with some previous observational

evidence of the effect of maternal care on motor/social development using NLSCY data.13

        The next two variables record the age at which certain developmental milestones are

attained. We report the results for only two of the five milestones collected in the survey,

because changes in the wording of the questions across waves render the interpretation of the

others difficult. For both the age at which the child first sat up and the age at which they took

their first steps the estimated coefficients are statistically indistinguishable from—and very close

to—zero.

        The final set of variables in Table 3b captures interactions between parents and children

that may enhance later cognitive development. Each measure expresses the frequency of the

indicated interaction on a five point scale ranging from 1 indicating rarely to 5 indicating daily.

In almost all cases the estimates are small and statistically insignificant indicating no change in

the frequency of the interaction with the increase in maternal care. The exception is an increase

in story telling for the older age group, although interpretation of this result is complicated by the

lack of any effect for the younger children. A limitation of these variables is that the highest

frequency recorded is daily, so these variables are not able to capture a change in the intensity of

a daily interaction.

        In general, most results in Tables 3a and 3b show no impact—but there are a few

statistically significant effects. However, in an analysis with this many regressions, a certain

which cognitive testing starts to be performed more intensively.

   Sherlock et al. (2007) use the same motor/social development scale from the 1998-99 NLSCY wave, comparing
the children of mothers who return to work at different times post-birth. They measure impaired development as
being more than one standard deviation below the mean and find that each month a mother stays at home post-birth
reduces the probability of impaired motor/social development by 3 percent. We tried forming their measure of
impairment and applied our estimation methodology to it, finding an estimate on POST of 0.028 (0.020). Moreover,
the standard error is small enough to yield sufficient power to detect an effect as small as negative 5.6 percent,
which in our sample rules out an impact as large as that found by Sherlock et al. (2007), who found a 3 percent drop
for each month of delayed return.


                                                                                                                 22
number of statistically significant estimates will be obtained by chance. An examination of the

YOB estimates in the appendix provides a check if these results are causally related to the reform.

To provide another perspective, we turn to a control group analysis of the mothers likely not

eligible for the extended maternity leave as they show little attachment to the labor force post-

birth. Specifically, we compare those who returned to work within twelve months of birth to

those who did not; the former sample should have a much higher level of treatment. Recall that

we used this strategy for the labor supply results in the discussion of Table 1 and found the

estimate from the sample of mothers who returned to work within a year sat amid our estimates

of the treatment on the treated by the scaling methods.

       The results of this analysis are presented in Table 4. We expect the estimates from the

sample of mothers who returned within a year of birth to be larger than the estimates in Table 3a

by a factor of between 1.33 and 1.57. We expect the estimates for the complementary sample to

be close to zero. There is some evidence of this pattern for the calming variable. The estimate in

the sample of children whose mother returned to work with in a year is almost statistically

significant and just over 20 percent larger than the corresponding estimate in Table 3a. This

gives some indication that the calming result is robust. For the attention, new person, difficulty,

and stories variables, however, we do not find robustness. The mothers who were likely not

eligible show, if anything, a larger effect—although in no cases are the impacts in the two

samples statistically distinct. Therefore, this investigation further limits our conclusions,

indicating that the increase in time at home had little impact on the development variables in the

NLSCY.




                                                                                                    23
7.0     Interpretation

       While we have documented very large changes in the maternal care of children aged 7-12

months old, we have found few concurrent or persistent impacts on their development as

captured by our NLSCY variables. This may be surprising because previous research suggests

non-parental care at these ages can have cognitive effects. Also, the developmental measures in

the NLSCY are drawn from best practices in the field and are responsive to changes in non-

parental care in other studies. Furthermore, our first stage is very strong: we examine large

changes in full-time maternal work and full-time non-parental care which previous studies

identify as important.

       A priori, the developmental variables we examine provide a reasonable summary of

facets of a child’s progress that could be affected by a change in care. For example, without

committing to the direction of the effect, a child’s attainment of certain motor or social

milestones or her/his behavioral reaction to changes in places or new persons could depend on

whether the majority of his/her care is currently provided by the mother, or in a home-based

childcare arrangement. The fact that we do not observe any changes in these outcomes implies

one of two possibilities: either the effects are not present, or whatever effects occur they are not

captured by the variables available in the NLSCY.

       If the effects are not present, some caution in interpretation is still needed. We are only

able to observe the children up to age 29 months, so it is possible that in the future some impacts

will become evident. That is, the impact may lie dormant and manifest only at older ages. If this

occurs, the mechanism for the later impacts will remain unclear since we have not uncovered

them here. This would frustrate our understanding of the impact of extra maternal care. We will




                                                                                                     24
be able to examine this ‘dormant impact’ hypothesis in the future as later waves of the NLSCY

become available.

       If instead there are effects on non-parental care at very young ages but the variables in the

NLSCY do not capture them, then there are potentially important implications for survey design.

While parent-reported measures of development have their critics, they are part of the content of

most children’s surveys because they are cost effective, can be updated on a regular basis though

a remote interview and are generally viewed as being informative about many dimensions of

development. If measures of the type available in the NLSCY cannot capture changes that are

occurring, then reliance on common parent-reported responses might need review.

       A final important issue is the intended purpose of the questions asked about infants.

Identifying children who are at risk of developmental delay is one objective. However, a survey

that is effective in identifying at-risk children may not be effective in capturing changes in

development in the more advantaged population of two-parent families that we study. The

tension raised here is the one identified in the introduction: the evaluation of universal public

policies may require different evidence than the evidence traditionally used to analyze at-risk

families.


8.0 Conclusions

       The decision of how much and whether to work during the first year of a child’s life

confronts most new mothers. Research on the developmental costs and benefits of maternal care

has produced mixed results—and typically must address the difficult problem of unobserved

correlates of the maternal work decision. In this paper, we have presented evidence on the

developmental impact of more maternal care resulting from the expansion of maternity leave

policies in Canada. Among mothers who took leaves, we estimate an increase in the time at


                                                                                                    25
home post-birth of around 3 months or over 50 percent of the pre-reform level. This increase in

time at home primarily displaced full time work and unlicensed care provided in someone else’s

home. However, even with these extraordinary changes, we find little evidence of a change in

child development. Our estimates indicate that the family atmosphere is unchanged and that

temperament and motor-social and developmental milestones respond little to the extra maternal

time.

        Our study offers three important advantages. First, we address the selection problem

generated by unobserved correlates through our exploitation of a policy reform that allows us to

view similar families under different policy regimes. Second, the impact of the reform is at ages

six to twelve months, a range identified as critical to development is past research. Finally, we

study a heterogeneous group of children, which may be more relevant to the evaluation of

universal child policies than experimental evidence using only children at risk.

        Our primary conclusion that this change in maternal care had little effect on child

development up to 2 years of age has two alternative interpretations, which are topics for future

research. First, the development impacts of the changes we analyze may manifest at older ages.

Second, the parent-reported measures of child development we use, which are common to many

surveys, may not capture the changes in development induced by the maternity leave reforms.
