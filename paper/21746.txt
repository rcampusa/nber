                                            ABSTRACT

In the coming years, a substantial portion of Germany’s workforce will retire, making it difficult for
businesses to meet human capital needs. Training older workers may be a successful strategy for managing
this demographic transition. This study examines relationships between establishment training programs,
wages, and retirement among older men and women. Using unique matched establishment-employee
data from Germany, the authors find that when establishments offer special training programs targeted
at older workers, women—and especially lower wage women—are less likely to retire. Results suggest
this relationship may be due to greater wage growth. For men, findings suggest establishment offer
of inclusion in standard training programs may improve retention of low wage men, but analysis of
pre-existing differences in establishment retirement patterns suggests this relationship may not be
causal. Our research suggests targeted training programs likely play an important role in retaining
and advancing careers of low wage older women.

       The aging of populations in many developed countries has significant implications for

working populations and the age composition of workforces within organizations. Driven

primarily by increased life expectancy and declining birth rates, these demographic trends are

consistent across developed economies (Danson 2007). Germany in particular is Europe’s “first

and biggest test of the problems caused by an ageing and declining population” and is predicted

to lose five million workers due to aging over the next 15 years (a 12.5 % decline), with

immigration and new entry into the labor force by younger workers expected to fill only a small

portion of this gap (Elliott & Kollewe 2011). Germany’s overall population will shrink 18.8% by

2060 (Eurostat 2011), and the working age population (15-64 years old) could fall by 35%

(Wanger, Weber, & Fuchs 2013). By the end of the current decade workers over age 50 will

constitute 40% of the labor force (Buss & Kuhlmann 2013). As the largest economy in Europe,

Germany’s continued economic success is critical to Europe and the global economy. With an

unemployment rate under 6%, an aging population, and a shrinking labor force, German firms

must confront how they develop and make use of the knowledge, skills, and abilities of their

older workers.


       Facing an aging workforce, German policymakers have encouraged people to work

longer by gradually raising the age at which workers can obtain full pension benefits (Börsch-

supan & Wilke 2003). At the same time, German employers are making use of various human

resource practices to discourage early retirements or extend working lives. For example, German

corporation BASF has launched the “Generations@Work” initiative, engaging its employees in

life-long training, human resource development, health management, ergonomics, work-life

balance, and flexible working hours (Blau 2011). Agreements negotiated between the chemical

industry and the industry trade union include a "demography fund" to support a variety of
                                                                                                     2


practices related to management of older workers, including training. Yet, there is limited

research on the role workplace policies and practices play in encouraging or discouraging longer

work lives or about the mechanisms through which such practices operate (Dietz & Walwei

2011; Paullin & Whetzel 2012; Schlick, Frieling, & Wegge 2013).


       This paper focuses on the relationship between employer provided training and the

retention and wages of older workers. The few previous studies examining these relationships

obtain inconsistent findings and several important questions remain regarding this link. First,

what is the mechanism through which training promotes longer working lives? There are a

variety of theories that are used to explain this relationship, including human capital theory and

psychological theories about changing work motives over the life cycle. We expand these

perspectives by arguing that training’s effect on the retention of older workers will vary across

the wage distribution. Second, establishments that offer training to their older workers may adopt

different approaches to training delivery. They could focus on involving their older workers in

the standard training programs offered to the rest of their workforce, or they could create targeted

training programs especially designed for older workers. Is one better than the other for

improving retention? Third, to what extent does the effect of training on retention differ by

gender? There are gender differences in labor market experiences and acquisition of human

capital over the life-cycle, suggesting that the response to training near the end of one’s working

life may also differ between men and women.


       We use data from the 2002, 2006, and 2008 Linked Employer-Employee Dataset (LIAB)

of the German Institute for Employment Research (IAB), which combines survey data for a

large, stratified random sample of German establishments with social security records for all
                                                                                                   3


establishment employees covered by the social security system: approximately 80% of the

German work force.


                                       Literature Review


Training and retention of older workers: Existing evidence


       Studies across the age spectrum show a positive link between training and retention in the

overall workforce (Hausknecht & Trevor 2010; Heavey, Holwerda, & Hausknecht 2013), but the

few empirical studies focused on older workers have yielded conflicting results. Picchio and van

Ours (2012), using data from 7,257 individuals from 1996-2001 in the European Community

Household Panel , found that training led to greater worker retention in the Netherlands for

workers aged 50-64. Herrbach, Mignonac, Vandenberghe, and Negrini (2009) use individual

survey data from a sample of 514 late career managers to examine the relationship between

training and retirement timing and also found a positive relationship between training and

retention. Similarly, in a study of older professionals and nurses, Armstrong-Stassen and Ursel

(2009) found that employer engagement in training and development practices negatively

influenced workers’ intention to turnover. Furthermore, they found that this relationship was

partly mediated by perceived organizational support.

       Using the European Household Panel, Fourage and Schils (2009) observed that training

participation rates were positively associated with labor market participation rates in Europe, but

that some early retirement schemes discouraged training participation and that this relationship

varied considerably by country. In a study of older Dutch public sector employees, Montizaan,

Coervers, and De Grip (2010) found that employees who recently experienced an increase in

pensionable age were more likely to participate in training. Boockmann, Fries, and Goebel
                                                                                                                         4


(2012) found no relationship between either standard or specific training on the exit rates of 40-

65 year old employees. Similarly, Kristensen (2012) concluded there is only a small relationship

between general training through the lifespan and working life duration, and argued it was not

large enough to justify government-funded training programs.

         Many of the previous studies have limitations that may explain some of the conflicting

findings and why understanding the relationship between training and retention of older workers

is difficult. Picchio and van Ours (2012) measure training as whether or not the worker

participated in firm training the previous year. Therefore, their analysis provides an estimate of

the effect of training among the trained; however this estimate misses any workers who may

have retired to avoid the training. Herrbach, Mignonac, Vandenberghe, and Negrini (2009) use a

measure of training availability but their measure confounds the availability of any sort of

training with the efficacy of the training. 1 The analysis from Armstrong-Stassen and Ursel

(2009) focused only on managerial, professional, and nursing occupations. In addition, they do

not measure training or retirement directly. They rely on employee perceptions of whether their

organization is currently engaged in training activities and employees’ intention to keep working.

         Boockmann, Fries, & Goebel (2012) used a smaller version of the LIAB dataset that was

limited to a random draw of 300 establishments. Although they found no relationship between

establishment training and employee retention, they do not control for the overall rate of training

participation among workers within the establishment. This may be an important omission

because firms that train older workers may also have higher rates of training throughout the


1
  Respondents use a 5 point Likert scale to rate the availability of training opportunities that are "adapted to their
needs", "extend their computer skills", "develop their management skills", and "continuously update their skills."
But respondents are not asked to rate the availability of any training opportunities. Therefore, it is possible that
respondents who were offered ineffective training or training that did not address the specific skills asked about in
the survey would be coded in the same way as respondents who did not receive any training opportunities.
Furthermore, the sample consisted only of managers and the relationship between training practices and retention
behavior may vary by occupation.

organization, offer better quality training, or be more invested in employee development in

general. Moreover, this study does not investigate the mechanisms through which training is

thought to affect older worker retention.

       Our work addresses gaps in this literature in several ways. We use a broader

representative sample of establishments with greater statistical power, incorporate controls for

the amount of training participation occurring throughout the establishment workforce,

investigate potential differences in effects by gender, and focus on discerning the mechanism by

which training affects older worker retention. With regard to this last point, we examine joint

effects of training practices, and how they may operate in conjunction with other establishment

practices for older workers. In addition, we explore wages as a likely mechanism for explaining

the relationship between training and retention of older workers.

Establishment Training Practices and Other Practices for Older Workers

       Establishments that train their older workers face a choice. They can offer programs that

include older workers in a standard training program designed for their entire workforce, offer

targeted training programs, or use some combination of these two delivery strategies. This

decision may influence both the effectiveness of the training itself and any relationship with

retention.


       Psychological research indicates that training programs vary in effectiveness from one

individual to another (Ford & Oswald 2003) and that training interventions are more effective

when designed specifically for individuals or groups of similar individuals (Beier 2012). Older

workers may benefit more from some training methodologies than from others (Callahan, Kiker,

& Cross 2003). As people age, they experience a reorganization of traits and skills: cognitive

processing speed slows whereas knowledge-related abilities grow (Kanfer & Ackerman 2004).
                                                                                                      6


Several studies in the organizational psychology training literature suggest that training targeted

specifically toward older workers is more effective for them, providing more extensive human

capital development and, arguably, a stronger positive relationship with wages (Charness,

Kelley, Bosman, & Mottram 2001; Hedge, Borman, & Lammlein 2006; Sterns & Doverspike

1988; Sterns 1986). Based on this literature, we expect establishments that offer targeted training

programs, whether in combination with involvement in standard training or as the only training

practice for older workers, to have higher older worker retention rates (i.e., lower retirement

rates).


          Other practices may also encourage longer working lives, either individually or as part of

a system of human resources (HR) practices. These include reduced performance requirements,

mixed-age work teams, special equipment for older workers, and partial retirement allowing

older workers to reduce their work hours before retiring. Because HR practices offered in

bundles may have synergistic effects (B. E. Becker & Gerhart 1996), we examine both direct and

joint effects of training practices and other practices related to older workers. We expect that

practices which allow older workers to perform work differently, such as reduced performance

requirements and special equipment for older workers, and practices such as partial retirement

that create schedule differences between older and younger workers, will be more likely to

increase retention when combined with the offer of targeting training. Conversely, we expect the

use of mixed aged teams to have a more positive effect on retention when older workers are

included in offers of standard training also available to younger workers.


Gender differences

          There are strong reasons to believe the relationship between training and retention may

differ by gender among older German workers. On average, German women have substantially
                                                                                                     7


different labor market experiences than men, including less formal education and higher rates of

part-time work (Brenke 2015). Occupational segregation by gender can also leave women with

poorer economic stability upon retirement, which may affect their retirement decisions (Perkins

1993). Older men may have less to gain from training programs than older women if the returns

to training in terms of productivity diminish with the amount of training received or if they are

already at the top of their pay grades and thus would not choose to undertake further training

because there would be little change in their pay. Alternatively, because of their longer labor

force tenure, men may be more likely to select into industries that value industry and

establishment specific human capital. If training programs for older workers complement prior

investments then the gains from training may be greater and retention effects stronger for men.

Finally, in Germany statutory age of eligibility for social security benefits has differed by gender.

In cohorts born before 1946, women could retire with full old age social security benefits earlier

than men, creating gender differences in the investment horizons for returns to training.

A Possible Mechanism: Training and Wages


       Human capital theory predicts firm specific training enhances productivity and increases

wages within the current firm relative to alternative employment opportunities, which enables

the training firm to pay higher wages and provides incentives for both employers and employees

to maintain the employment relationship (G. Becker 1962). In samples of workers of all ages,

studies have found that on-the-job training is linked to higher employee productivity (Barrett &

O’Connell 2001; Bartel 1995; Conti 2005; Konings & Vanormelingen 2009; Zwick 2006),

slower depreciation of human capital (Groot & Maassen van den Brink 2000; Neuman & Weiss

1995), future employability (Crépon, Ferracci, & Fougére 2007; Lechner, Miquel, & Wunsch

2005) and wage growth (Bartel 1995; Dearden, Reed, & Van Reenen 2006; Groot 1999).
                                                                                                      8


However older employees have fewer remaining years of work to reap the returns on their

training investment (Ben-Porath 1967). So, even if training would increase productivity and

wages, the effort required to participate in it may outweigh the benefits because the individual is

close to retiring.


        There are three reasons to expect training to increase retention especially for lower wage

workers. First, if there are diminishing returns to training then those with less human capital may

experience the greatest increase in productivity and wages when they participate in training, and

those with less human capital (lower wage workers) are more likely to participate. Second, for

institutional reasons even training that would boost productivity may be less likely to lead to a

raise for high wage employees if they are already at the top of their paygrades. Third, even if

training would lead to the same wage growth for low and high wage earners, high wage earners

are likely to have greater non-labor income and have greater pension wealth assuming the same

years of service under the German pension system. Thus, high wage earners would be more

likely to respond to an increase in wages by choosing to retire than choosing to work longer. In

addition to expecting differences in the effects of training on retention across the wage

distribution, if wages are a mechanism through which training improves retention then the same

training practices that promote retention should also be associated with greater wage growth.


                                             Methods

Sample

        This study uses matched data from the Linked Employer-Employee Data (LIAB) of the

German Institute for Employment Research (IAB). The LIAB connects the German IAB

Establishment Panel, an annual nationally representative survey of German establishments, with

individual-level administrative data for the employees of participating establishments. The
                                                                                                                 9


dataset includes all employees subject to social security and employed in one of the surveyed

establishments on the reference date of June 30th. The IAB establishment panel began in 1993;

however, not all questions are asked in each survey year. Questions about establishment training

activities involving older workers were included in 2002, 2006, and 2008, so only those years are

used in the present analysis. Over time, the sample of establishments has expanded to reflect

changes in the German economy and remain representative of German establishments and

establishments do not appear in every survey year both due to closure and survey non-response;

thus our dataset is based on an unbalanced panel of individuals within establishments. 2


        Each individual may appear in the dataset up to three times (once in each year). The

analysis sample includes all individuals between ages 50 and 65. Workers younger than 50 are

excluded because the questions about training on the establishment survey specifically refer to

workers age 50 and older. Workers older than 65 are excluded because 65 is the normal

pensionable age for German workers and very few work beyond this age. 3 Our analysis sample

contains 759,931 person-year observations for 50-65 year olds over the three study years,

including 522,939 observations for men and 236,992 for women.


Key Variables


        The dependent variable in the analysis is retirement from the establishment: “Retire.”

Retire is equal to 1 in the last year a worker appears in the LIAB data (using all years 2002-

2008) and 0 in all earlier years (provided the establishment continues to appear), with missing

values for years after the worker has left the data set. Because training information is only

2
  A detailed discussion of sample selection and non-response can be found in (Heining, Scholz, & Seth 2013). Full
sample descriptive statistics for key variables are presented in Appendix Table A1.
3
  The number of person-year observations in our data at age 65 is approximately 7% of the number at age 60. At age
66, it falls to 0.8%.
                                                                                                    10


available in 2002, 2006 and 2008, we censor many retirements in our analysis dataset. For

example, a worker who is employed in 2002 and retires in 2003 contributes only one observation

to the analysis in 2002 with Retire equal to 0. The 2003 retirement is censored because if the

establishment did not offer training in 2002 but indicated training was offered by 2006 we cannot

determine whether the individual’s retirement preceded or followed the change in training

practices because the training practice could have begun in 2003 and continued on through 2006.


       The key independent variables are binary indicators of the presence (1) or absence (0) of

two training practices for older workers: Standard and Targeted. Standard indicates whether

older workers are offered “advanced training activities” that are offered to other groups and thus

delivered in a standard way and not specifically for older workers. Targeted indicates whether

the establishment offers “special further training” specifically designed for older employees. It is

important to note that we do not observe any information about the content of the training

delivered using either method. Standard and targeted training programs may deliver general or

firm specific skills. The distinction here is in the design and delivery of the training content.

Standard reflects a “one size fits all” approach and Targeted reflects the availability of custom

programs designed for older workers.


       An additional important covariate, Participation, provides a measure of training

participation across all establishment employees. Participation is reported in the establishment

survey as either the number of individuals participating in training over the year or the number of

instances of training. In the latter case, an employee participating in two training programs would

be counted twice. Establishments decide how to report their training participation. We

normalized this variable by dividing it by the total number of employees in the establishment

multiplied by 100. We control for their choice of reporting using Reporting, a binary indicator
                                                                                                     11


equal to 1 for establishments that report training participation as total incidences. Thus,

regressions that include Participation also include Reporting as well as an interaction between

the two variables. Participation was not included in the 2002 or 2006 establishment survey

modules so we match data from the 2001 and 2003 surveys to these years. This decision is

supported by descriptive statistics that show Participation was relatively stable over time within

establishments; Participation had an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.943, indicating that

less than 6% of the observed variance in Participation is due to within-establishment changes

       Although the Participation variable indicates the extent to which workers in the

establishment have participated in training, it does not tell us which workers participated. This

means what we are estimating are the “intention-to-treat” (ITT) effects of an establishment

offering Standard and Targeted training, rather than the specific effects of an individual

receiving trainings (although moderated by our inclusion of Participation). One issue is that

establishment training practices are not randomly assigned, introducing potential selection bias

into the estimates. We minimize the likely bias by including observable time varying attributes,

and establishment fixed-effects, which will account for all potential time-invariant confounders.


       Specifically, we specify a discrete time hazard model where Retire is a function of our

training practices Standard and Targeted, Participation, individual characteristics, establishment

attributes, general time effects, and establishment fixed-effects according to:
                                                                                                      12

In [1], the subscripts i, j, and t index individuals, establishments and survey year; P*R is the

interaction between Participation and Reporting; X is a vector of individual covariates and Z are

time varying establishment covariates, both defined below; λt is establishment fixed effects. All

estimated standard errors are heteroscedasticity robust and clustered at the establishment level.

We estimate Equation [1] separately for men and women to flexibly model likely gender

differences in the relationship between our key variables, other covariates, and retirement

behavior.


       In [1], β1 and β2 estimate the effects of offering each type of training on retirement hazard

rates, which are defined as the probability that an individual retires in year t provided that they

have not retired by t-1. If the offer of training promotes retention of older workers then its

coefficient should be negative. β3 estimates the marginal change in retirement likelihood

resulting from a one percentage point change in the training participation measure for

establishments that report Participation as the number of individuals (Reporting = 0), and β3 +

β5 provides the marginal effect for establishments that report number of training incidences

(Reporting = 1). β4 reflects any differences in retirement behavior when establishments change to

reporting training as incidences instead of individuals. Fixed differences between establishments

due to different reporting styles are captured by λj.


       X includes individual establishment tenure, daily wage rate, educational attainment, and

whether the individual works part-time. Among full-time employees, we control for blue-collar

versus white-collar occupations. All regressions control for individual age using a full set of age

dummy variables to capture discontinuities in retirement behavior due to norms and pension
                                                                                                   13


incentives. Z includes time varying measures of establishment annual revenue, total employment,

and average employee wage. We also include a subjective measure of establishment profitability,

rated on a five-point scale from “unsatisfactory” to “very good,” to better capture financial

performance.


       Including establishment fixed effects helps to rule out the possibility that establishments

adopting training practices for older workers are generally better places to work and so would

have higher retention rates, even without offering training. However, it does not eliminate the

possibility that establishments adopting training practices also implemented other practices that

are aimed at older workers that could affect retention. Synergistic bundles of practices with

similar goals are common as part of high-performance work systems (Appelbaum, Bailey, Berg,

& Kallleberg 2000), and it may be the entire bundle of practices, rather than just training

practices, that lead to higher retention. To address this possibility, we add a set of indicator

variables for other older worker practices to Equation [1] including: the use of special equipment

(Special Equipment) or lower performance targets (Lower Performance) for older workers, offers

of partial retirement (Partial Retirement), use of mixed age teams (Mixed Age), and any other

practices for older workers (Other). We also interact these variables with Standard and Targeted

to determine whether the effects of training may differ when used in conjunction with other older

worker practices.


       To examine wages as a potential mechanism through which training practices may affect

retention, we first expand Equation [1] to include interactions between individual wages and

each training practice. This allows the effects of offering standard and targeted training to differ

for persons earning lower versus higher wages, relative to the entire sample average. We

summarize the results of this model by estimating marginal effects of each practice at the 25th,
                                                                                                    14


50th and 75th percentiles of the labor market wage distribution defined separately for men and for

women and with the inclusion of younger workers’ wages.


        However, an individual’s position in the labor market distribution is not necessarily the

same as position within the establishment earning distribution. As explained, one reason to

expect a weaker relationship between training and retention among older workers is older

workers are more likely to be near the top of their pay grades within the establishment. Although

we do not have information on actual pay grades, our data contains individual wages for all

workers (young and old) within the establishment in each year and from this information we

construct establishment specific wage quintiles and define a categorical variable, EWQ, which is

equal to the establishment wage quintile each older worker in our analysis sample falls within.

We again expand Equation [1] to include interactions between each training practice and EWQ,

which allows us to examine whether the relationships between training practices and retention

differ by position in the establishment wage distribution. If relationships between training and

retention are weaker because older workers are near the tops of their pay grades, we would

expect to see point estimates that are closer to zero or even positive for individuals in the highest

establishment wage quintiles and point estimates that are negative for individuals in the lowest

quintiles.


        If wages are a mechanism through which training practices influence retention of older

workers, then there should be a direct relationship between establishment training practices and

wages. To test for this relationship, we estimate the following regression equations:




ln(𝑤𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑑𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑗𝑡                         [2]

𝐸𝑊𝑄_𝑈𝑝 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑑𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑑𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑗𝑡                             [4]


        +𝛽4 𝑅𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽5 𝑃 ∗ 𝑅𝑗𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝜃 + 𝑍𝑗𝑡 𝛿 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡


        Equation [2] is a semi-log wage equation. Because Standard and Targeted are dummy

variables, we compute the percentage change in individual wages associated with the

                                        �1) - 1] and 100[exp(𝛽
introduction of each policy as: 100[exp(𝛽                    �2) - 1], respectively (Halvorsen &

Palmquist 1980). Because individual wages in year t are the dependent variables in this model,

the vector of individual control variables X does not include individual wages in this equation
                   −
and is denoted as 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 . All other variables and parameters are the same as in Equation [1]. If

training does lead to higher wages for older workers, we expect to find positive estimates for

both β1 and β2 in Equation [2].


        In Equation [3] we specify a wage growth equation to attempt to answer the question: Is

individual wage growth greater among older workers when their establishments offer either type

of training? The dependent variable is now the percentage change in individual wages from the

current survey year, t, to the next survey year, t+1. Here individual wages are included as a

control variable in the vector Xijt, so β1 and β2 estimate the percentage point difference in wage

growth when establishments offer each training relative to when they do not, holding wage levels

constant at the market average for survey year t.
                                                                                                    16


       If establishments that offer training simply pay better all the time and pay larger raises

over time and do not do so because the training has enhanced the productivity of their workers, it

is possible any relationships between training and wages or wage growth we find after estimating

Equations [2] and [3] will be spurious. Establishment fixed effects will not control for time

varying differences in wage levels and growth across establishments; that is, we cannot rule out

the possibility that individuals in establishments with these training practices have different wage

trajectories. Instead, we use the EWQ variable, which measures individual’s positions within

their establishment’s wage distribution in each year, to create the binary variable EWQ Up,

which is equal to 1 if the individual moves up one or more quintiles within the establishment

wage distribution from year t to year t+1. Because EWQ is defined on the establishment wage

distribution observed in each survey year t, EWQ Up captures whether individual wages are

increasing relative to movements in the overall distribution of establishment wages. Because we

do not observe who participates in the offered training programs and who does not, we cannot

directly test whether wages, growth or movements up the establishment wage distribution differ

among training participants and non-participants.

Differences in establishment and individual characteristics by training activities

       To understand the context in which training activities for older worker are occurring, we

review differences in observed values of establishment characteristics by establishment training

practices Standard and Targeted. Table 1 contains means for selected establishment covariates

by training practice. Specifically, we average covariates across survey years for each

establishment and then take the grand mean of those averages for establishments that
                                                                                                                    17


consistently offer neither practice, both practices, and one but not the other in all survey years.

There are 770 additional establishments that change training practices during the study period.

         Relative to establishments with neither practice, establishments that consistently offer

either or both of the training practices have higher training participation in the establishment as a

whole, employ fewer unskilled workers and more workers overall, and are more likely to offer

other practices for older workers. Very few establishments offer targeted training without

standard training but those that do appear to be similar to establishments that offer only standard

training, except average wages are lower in establishments offering only targeted training. There

are some significant differences in the number of retirements per year by training practice. In

general establishments that offer training of either type have more retirements, but they also have

more employees overall. The ratios of retirement turnover to employment are very similar for

each establishment group. 4

         In total, because of the higher wages in establishments that offer standard training or both

practices and the greater prevalence of other older workers practices, there is evidence that

training establishments may be better places to work overall than establishments that do not

train, and this observation underscores the importance of controlling for these observables and

using fixed effects estimation to address unobserved time constant heterogeneity in

establishments. Also, the differences in average wage levels suggest that correlations between

individual wages and training practices may be spurious, so it is important to examine individual

wages relative to the establishment wage distribution and exploit the longitudinal data available

to examine movements within the establishment wage distribution.

Relationships between training practices and retirement

  The ratios are: 0.007 for establishments offering standard training only, 0.006 for establishments offering targeted
training only, 0.008 for establishments offering both, and 0.006 for establishments offering neither.

           In Table 2, we test the relationship between offers of training and retirement. Models 1

and 2 contain our baseline estimates of the relationship between establishment training practices

and retirement for men and women, respectively5. The analysis suggests there is no relationship

between the offer of either standard or targeted of training and retirement among older men, and

no relationship between overall training participation in the establishment and retirement for

either men or women. We find the probability of retirement is 1.61 percentage points lower for

women when establishments offer targeted training than when they do not (p = 0.07). When we

control for establishment use of other practices for older workers (Columns 3 and 4, Table 2)

there are no important changes in the estimated effects of training practices or many other

covariate coefficients. The only statistically significant relationship between retention and other

practices for older workers is for partial retirement among men; men employed in establishments

that offer partial retirement have a 1.38 percentage point lower likelihood of retirement (p =

0.03).

           Contrary to our expectations, findings do not differ if we expand the model to include all

two-way interactions between training practices and other practices for older workers. For

example, for women, we find the offer of standard training was associated with a 3 percentage

point increase in retirement likelihood when used alone, but the coefficient estimate for the

interaction between offer of standard training and offer of partial retirement was -3 percentage

points. So the total effect of offering standard training when partial retirement is also offered is

effectively zero (See Appendix Table A3). In general, there is no consistent pattern that supports

the joint effects of training and other practices on retirement likelihood.

           Above, we argue that training may promote longer working lives through increased older

worker wages. Interactions between wages and training practices suggest there are systematic

differences in the effects of targeted training between low and high wage women (Figure 1).

Women whose wages are at the 20th percentile of the market wage distribution for women have

retirement likelihoods that are 2.64 (p = 0.01) percentage points lower when their establishment

offers targeted training. At the 40th wage percentile the estimated effect is 2.11 percentage points

lower (p = 0.03), at the 60th it falls to 1.67 percentage points lower (p = 0.07), and for women at

the 80th percentile the estimated reduction is only 1.09 percentage points and is not statistically

significantly different from zero (p = 0.23). Although the estimate at the 20th percentile is

statistically significantly different from zero, it is not different from the estimate at the 80th (p =

0.27) and therefore we have suggestive but not definitive evidence of strong effects of targeted

training on retention for lower wage women. For involvement in standard training, there appears

to be no effect on retention for women at any wage level. A positive trend also exists across the

wage distribution for both standard and targeted training among men, but no estimates are

statistically significantly different from zero and the point estimates for lower wage men are far

smaller (in absolute value) than for lower wage women (Figure 2).

        When we measure individual wages by quintile within the establishment wage

distribution and interact the quintile dummies with each training practice, the differences in the

effects of targeted training between the lowest earners and others are even larger. For women, we

find a 3.29 percentage point reduction when establishments offer targeted training, which is also

statistically significantly different from zero (p = 0.00) and from the estimate for top quintile

earners (p = 0.08) (Figure 3). Interestingly, we also find that when establishments offer standard

training, women in the 4th and 5th wage quintiles have retirement likelihoods that are 0.9 (p =

0.06) and 1.5 (p = 0.00) percentage points higher than when standard training is not offered. We

find a 2.05 percentage point reduction in retirement likelihoods for men in the lowest wage
                                                                                                   20


quintile when establishments offer standard training, which is both statistically significantly

different from zero (p = 0.00) and from the 0.48 percentage point increase in retirement

probability estimated for men in the top quintile (0.00) (Figure 4). In total, these estimates

indicate training matters most for men and women who earn the least, and while offering

standard training significantly improves retention for low wage men and targeted training does

not, the opposite is true for low wage women.

Why does training improve retention among low wage earners?

        To understand why the offer of training appears to improve retention most among lower

earners, we investigate the relationship between training practices and wages. Descriptive

statistics in Table 1 suggest establishments that have training practices for older workers pay

higher wages. To examine this apparent relationship more rigorously, we regress log wages on

training practices and individual and establishment characteristics with and without

establishment fixed effects (Table 3). If the correlation between wages and training is simply

because these establishments always pay more overall and not due to the training per se (i.e., if it

is spurious), then any positive relationship in the OLS regression should not persist when

establishment fixed effects are added. This is precisely what we find for women. Women’s

wages are 2.3% higher in establishments that offer standard training to older workers relative to

those that do not, and also 2.3% higher in establishments that offer targeted training to older

workers according to the OLS regressions (Column 1, Panel B). However, the fixed effects

estimates suggest this relationship was due to fixed establishment characteristics and not the

practices themselves because all point estimates for women in the fixed effects regressions are

not statistically significant and imply a percentage difference in wages close to zero when each

practice is offered relative to when it is not (Column 2). For men, we find statistically significant
                                                                                                   21


positive relationship (p = 0.03) between the offer of standard training and wages in the fixed

effects model, but the point estimate indicates wages are only 0.4% higher when establishments

offer standard training (Column 2, Panel A).

        Although training practices may not be associated with economically important

differences in wage levels, they could generate greater individual wage growth. As explained

previously, human capital theory predicts training will lead to longer employment relationships

because it boosts both worker productivity and wages. If wages are in fact the mechanism for the

relationship between training and retention, we should see greater wage growth associated with

the practices that promote retention: offer of standard training among men and targeted training

among women.

        To test this relationship, we first estimate Equation [3] where the dependent variable is

individual wage growth across survey years. Our sample size is much smaller in these models

due primarily to the fact that many people in our sample retire during the 2 and 4 year gaps

between surveys, and also because of establishment attrition across survey years (due both to

closures and non-participation in the survey). These regressions suggest wage growth is 3.08

percentage points higher for women (p = 0.06) in establishments that offer targeted training and

3.48 percentage points lower for men (p = 0.06). Also, for men the offer of standard training is

associated with wage growth that is 2 percentage points higher than in establishments without it

(p = 0.10) (Column 3).

        Although the relationships between wage growth and training practices do exhibit

expected patterns given that we find the offer of standard training was associated with greater

retention among low wage men and targeted training was associated with greater retention

among low wage women, these estimates could simply reflect higher overall wage growth
                                                                                                         22


throughout establishments that have these practices. To isolate wage growth among older

workers from potential differences in establishment payroll trends, we estimate Equation [4] with

a “wage mobility indicator”, EWQ_Up, as the dependent variable to indicate whether the older

worker is in a higher wage quintile within the establishment wage distribution in the next survey

year.

         For women we find targeted training is associated with a two percentage point higher

probability of being in a higher wage quintile in the next survey year (p = 0.06), which is

consistent with our wage growth findings and suggests older women in establishments with

targeted training are moving up the establishment wage distribution (Column 4, Panel B). We do

not find the same for men. Instead, men in establishments that involve older workers in standard

training are 2.4 percentage points less likely to be in a higher wage quintile by the next survey (p

= 0.08) (Column 4, Panel A). Although the point estimate for targeted training for men is large

relative to other estimates and is positive, it is not statistically significant (p = 0.25). In total,

there is no evidence that training of either type is associated with greater wage mobility among

men.

Reverse causality: Does higher retention lead to adoption of training practices?

         The foregoing analysis relies upon establishment fixed effects and an extensive list of

time varying covariates to address non-random assignment of training practices across

establishments suggested in the descriptive statistics in Table 1. Yet, establishments may be

adopting training practices in response to past trends in retention that would not be captured by

establishment fixed effects. For example, establishments may only offer training to older workers

because the establishment has high retention rates and they know employment relationships will
                                                                                                     23


be long enough to recoup the training investment. This potential reverse causality may lead us to

infer the wrong explanations from our main results.

        To empirically investigate this possibility, we run two regressions—one for each

training practice—with training practice variables Standard and Target in survey year 2006 as

the dependent variables and regress them on establishment and worker characteristics in 2002.

Results are reported in Appendix Table A4. We find two significant associations between 2002

retirement behavior and establishment offer of training practices. First, men who retired in 2002

were 2 percentage points less likely to work in establishments that offer standard training.

Although the effect size is small, the sign suggests establishments that started offering standard

training in 2006 may have already had higher retention rates among men to begin with, which

means the relationships we found between standard training and retention among men may not

be attributable to a causal effect of training on retention. Second, we find women who retired in

2002 were 1 percentage point more likely to work for establishments that offer targeted training

and we find no association between men’s retirement in 2002 and the offer of targeted training

practices in 2006. This suggests establishments that adopted targeted training programs for older

workers had worse retention rates among women to begin with and no difference in retention

among men. So our finding that women are less likely to retire when working in establishments

offering targeted training is less likely to be due to reverse causality and may actually slightly

underestimate the true relationship between offer of targeted training and retention if the

establishment fixed effects do not fully capture pre-existing differences in retention rates.

                                             Discussion

       Our results suggest that the relationship between establishment training practices and the

retention of older workers is complex. On average, establishment training offerings are
                                                                                                    24


unassociated with longer working lives for men, but older women employees had retirement

rates that were 2 percentage points lower when targeted training was offered relative to when it

was not. Also, for both men and women in the lowest quintile of their establishment’s wage

distribution we find training practices are associated with lower retirement likelihoods, but the

delivery of training matters. Low wage women are less likely to retire if offered training targeted

to meet the needs of older workers but the offer of involvement in standard establishment

training programs does not change women’s retirement behavior. The opposite is true for men.

       We also find evidence that wage increases may be a mechanism through which

establishment training offerings are related to retention of older female employees. For women,

targeted training offerings were associated with wage growth across survey years and a higher

likelihood of moving up the establishment wage distribution, but offer of standard training was

associated with neither. These findings are consistent with the relationships we find between

training practices and retention of female employees: women were less likely to retire when

offered targeted training but standard training had no relationship with retirement behavior.

       The evidence for men is less consistent. Although we find standard training is associated

with lower retirement probabilities among low wage men, and we find men’s wage growth is

greater when standard training is offered, we find no evidence of wage increases relative to the

establishment distribution and some evidence that older men’s wages may fall relative to the

establishment distribution when standard training is offered. So, we cannot rule out the

possibility that men’s wage trajectories are simply steeper in establishments that offer standard

training to older workers and no causal link exists.

       These results raise several questions. First, why might wages be an important mechanism

for women, but not for men? Second, why do we see relationships for targeted training and
                                                                                                   25


retirement likelihood among women and not standard training? Gender differences in lifecycle

labor supply and human capital profiles offer potential answers for both of these questions.

Evidence from previous research suggests that women have substantially different lifecycle labor

supply patterns than men, especially in Germany (Ollier-Malaterre 2014). Women in the cohorts

we study are far more likely to work part-time and to exit the labor force during prime working

age years and this impacts their acquisition of human capital and earnings (Mincer & Polachek

1974). Rates of re-entry into the workforce are high among German women aged 40 to 60. For

example, at ages 30 to 34 women born in 1946 to 1950 had a labor force participation rate of

57.9% and it rose to 65.6% by ages 40 to 44 and was 71.9% at ages 50 to 54 (OECD.Stat 2015).

Women re-entering the workforce may have substantially different needs for training than other

workers. So, an establishment that offers targeted training to fill skills gaps or address skill

obsolescence may be able to increase women’s productivity, and in turn their wages. Because

men tend to have fewer career interruptions, targeted training may not have any impact on their

wages or retirement behavior. Unfortunately without more information about the actual content

of training and a thorough analysis of employment histories, we are unable to do more than

postulate this explanation, but given our findings and the importance of understanding women’s

lifecycle labor supply this seems an important area for future research.

        Involvement in standard training activities may not move older men up the earning

distribution because they are more likely to be at the top of their pay grades and therefore would

not see a meaningful financial return on training. Lacking information on pay grades, we have

used position within the establishment earnings distribution as a proxy. Future research using

data with paygrade information or in restricted samples of large establishments where pay

distributions could be computed within occupations may offer a more rigorous test.
                                                                                                                      26


          Finally, even if the financial returns to training are the same for men and women,

women are more likely than men to experience financial insecurity upon reaching retirement age

(Brenke 2015). So, women may be more likely to respond to an increase in wages by postponing

retirement whereas men may be more likely to respond by retiring earlier. 6 The LIAB does not

contain direct measures of pension wealth or private savings to test this possibility.

           These findings have important implications for policy. The National Council on Aging

reports older women in the U.S. receive $4,000 less than older men in annual Social Security

benefits due to differences in work histories and wages (National Council on Aging 2015). A

recent Dēmos.org and Institute on Assets & Social Policy (IASP) brief indicates the proportion

of single women over age 65 who are economically insecure rose by one-third between 2004 and

2008 (Meschede, Cronin, Sullivan, & Shapiro 2011). Our results suggest offering targeted

training may both improve women’s earnings while working, and encourage longer working

lives.

         We caution that if our findings for women are the result of training helping women who

are re-entering the workforce to make up for human capital decay and skill obsolescence then

these practices may be less effective in organizations with high rates of labor force participation

among prime-aged women and for younger cohorts of women who have higher rates of labor

force attachment. This would be an interesting area for future research. A study that compares

organizations with different female age profiles, gender composition, and training practices

could be very helpful in further clarifying the relationship between training practices and the

retention of older workers.

  That is, the substitution effect associated with a wage increase may be more likely to dominate the income effect
for women than men.
                                                                                                     27


                                   Limitations and Conclusion

       The study has a few limitations that should caution interpretation of the results. First, the

results of the wage growth and mobility analyses should be confirmed in panel data with lower

attrition rates. Second, we can only estimate intent to train effects as opposed to average

treatment effects as the dataset does not include individual training participation. Finally, in

some specifications the reporting style of Participation is statistically significant, which makes

the results more difficult to interpret and suggests reporting style may be associated with other

firm characteristics related to employees’ retirement decision. This may mean there are

relationships between offer of training to older workers and overall establishment training

participation that are missed in this analysis.

       When establishments offer targeted training for older workers, women—and especially

lower wage women—are less likely to retire. This may be because offers of targeted training are

associated with both greater wage growth and movement into higher wage quintiles within the

establishment. Although we find some evidence of lower retirement probabilities for men in

establishments that involve older workers in standard training, we also find retirement

likelihoods among men may already be lower in these establishments before practices are

adopted. Also, although standard training is associated with higher wage growth for men our

findings suggest this may be because these establishments have higher wage growth overall

rather than among older men in particular.
