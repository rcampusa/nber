         MEN, WOMEN, AND ADDICTION:   THE CASE OF CIGARETTE SMOKING


                                 ABSTRACT

     Cigarette demand equations, derived from the Becker-Murphy
model of rational addictive behavior, are estimated separately for
men and women. These demand equations account for the reinforce-
ment, tolerance, and withdrawal factors characterizing addictive
consumption. Results obtained from these demand equations support
the hypothesis that cigarette smoking is an addictive behavior.
Particularly interesting are the findings that men are responsive

to changes in the price of cigarettes, with a long run price
elasticity centered on —0.60, while women are virtually unrespon-

sive to price changes.      Men, however, are found to behave more
myopically than women.

                         I. INTRODUCTION

    Recently, economists have modeled addictive consumption as a
rational behavior. These models capture the distinction between

addictive consumption and other consumption by recognizing that,
for addictive goods, current consumption depends on the level of

past consumption. This time dependence of consumption incorporates
the notions of tolerance, reinforcement, and withdrawal charac-
teristic of addictive consumption. Tolerance allows for a reduced
effect of current consumption as past consumption is larger.
Reinforcement implies a learned response to past consumption.
Finally, withdrawal is a negative physical reaction as consumption

is terminated.

     This paper uses demand equations derived from the Becker-
Murphy [1988) model of rational addiction to estimate separate
cigarette demand equations for men and women which explicitly take
account of the addictive nature of cigarette smoking. This is the
first analysis of differences in male/female behavior in the
rational addiction framework. Chaloupka (1988, 1989], and Becker,

Grossman, and Murphy (1988) have estimated cigarette demand
equations in the context of the Becker-Murphy addictive model.
     Men and women have responded differently to the policy
initiatives of the anti—smoking campaign since the release of the
Surgeon General's report on the health consequences of cigarette
smoking 25 years ago. Historically, men had always smoked at much
higher rates than women, but the differences between the two have
become much smaller since 1964. At that time, 52.9 percent of men

                                1
were smokers, while only 34.1 percent of women were smokers

[USDHHS, 1986).    During the years which followed, significant
progress was made in reducing smoking participation among men, with
only limited progress made in reducing the fraction of women who

smoked. By 1985, the male smoking participation rate had fallen
to 33 percent, while the comparable female rate had fallen to only
28 percent. Moreover, surveys show that fewer men are initiating

smoking today than there were twenty years ago, while the fraction
of women initiating smoking today is identical to that in 1970

[USDHHS, 1986).
     In addition to the observed differences in the historical
smoking patterns of men and women, several other differences have
been described. For example, women face additional health risks

from cigarette smoking which are complicated by pregnancy.       In

particular, smoking during pregnancy leads to lower birth weight,

a greater likelihood of spontaneous abortion, increased incidence
of bleeding during pregnancy, and a higher rate of still births.

Children of women who smoke during pregnancy have greater neonatal
and infant mortality rates than those born to nonsmokers, including

an increased risk of the sudden infant death syndrome. Also, there

can be adverse effects on the child's long-term growth, intellec-
tual development, and behavioral characteristics due to the
mother's smoking during pregnancy [USDHHS, 1980).
     Additionally, there is a synergy between cigarette smoking and

the use of oral contraceptives containing estrogen which increases

the risk of suffering a stroke or heart attack {USDHHS, 1980].

                                 2
    Similarly, the Surgeon General notes that "women may not start

smoking, continue to smoke, quit smoking, or fail to quit smoking
for precisely the same reasons as men"      [USDHHS, 1980].     For

example, women smokers have been much less successful in smoking
cessation than their male counterparts, with women in organized
cessation programs experiencing more severe withdrawal symptoms
than men [Ashton and Stepney, 1982]. Also, women tend to smoke
"low tar and nicotine cigarettes, smoke fewer cigarettes per day,
and inhale less deeply than do men" [USDHHS, 1980].           Also,

differences in nicotine metabolism between men and women have been
suggested. Analogously, women appear to smoke more in stressful
situations (to relax themselves) than in situations where they are

bored (to stimulate themselves), while the opposite is observed

among men.
     Finally, in those studies by economists which consider the
demand for cigarettes by men and women separately, significant but
conflicting differences in the responses to price and income
changes have been estimated.     For example, Atkinson and Skegg
[1973] find that men are unresponsive to changes in cigarette
prices but do respond to the negative publicity on cigarette
smoking. Mullahy [1985], on the other hand, finds that men are

more responsive to changes in price than women.      Mullahy also

observes that cigarette smoking is an economically superior
behavior for men while it is an economically inferior behavior for

women.

                       II. THEORETICAL MODEL
      This work uses the Becker-Murphy model of rational addiction.

In this model, tastes are constant and the individual is assumed
to be fully rational. This is in contrast to other economic models

of addictive behavior which treat addicts as myopic and/or having

endogenous tastes.    While assuming complete rationality appears
strong, it seems more consistent than the assumption underlying the

myopic models.    In myopic models, individuals are assumed to be

aware of the dependence of current consumption on past consumption

but ignore the resulting dependence of future consumption on
current consumption when making current decisions.
      At any moment in time, an individual's utility is assumed to
be a function of three factors:

(1)      U(t) = TJ[C(t), A(t), Y(t)],
C(t) is the current consumption of the addictive good, cigarettes.
ACt) is the "addictive stock," or depreciated sum of all past
cigarette consumption, at time t. Y(t) is a composite of all other

factors affecting utility.        Current cigarette consumption is
assumed to have a positive effect on utility (Uc>O). This can be
used to illustrate withdrawal, since total utility falls when
current cigarette consumption is reduced.      Due to the combined
effects of tolerance and the health consequences of smoking,
accumulated past consumption is assumed to have a negative effect

on current utility (UA<O).     To capture reinforcement effects in
consumption, assume that increases in the addictive stock increase

the marginal utility of current consumption (U>O). Finally, for

                                   4
concavity, it is assumed that all second partials are negative

(U11<O, i=A, C, 1).
      Following Becker and Murphy, a simple investment function for

the addictive stock is specified as:

          A(t) =    C(t)   -
(2)

where 6 is the constant rate of depreciation of the addictive stock
over time. Cigarette consumption at time t, can be thought of as
gross investment in the addictive stock.

      Assuming a time additive utility function, a constant rate of

time preference, a, and an infinite lifetime, the lifetime utility




                j
function is:

(3)       U =       eat U[C(t), A(t), 1(t)] dt.

Rational behavior implies maximization of this function subject to

a lifetime budget constraint. Ignoring the allocation of time over

the life—cycle, treating Y(t) as a composite good whose price,
P(t), is the numeraire, and assuming perfect capital markets, the
appropriate budget constraint is:

(4)
          J et(Y(t)            + Pc(t)C(t)] dt   R(O),

where Pc(t) is the money price of cigarettes at time t, r is the
market interest rate (assumed constant), and R(O) is the discounted

value of lifetime income and assets.

      Maximizing (3) subject to (2), (4), and an initial stock
condition yields the following first order conditions:


(5)       U1(t) =    zet            ,   and:

                                         5
(6)           Uc(t) =     c(t),
where:

(7)           Tc(t) =   pc(t)
                                  (cr)t   - $ e_   r_t)U(l.) dr.

ir(t)   can   be thought of as the full price of the addictive good,

and consists of two parts: the money price, P(t), appropriately
discounted, and the discounted future utility costs, or shadow
price, of the addictive stock. Since U(t) is always negative, the

full price of smoking is greater than its money price. The larger
the rate of depreciation, the lower the shadow price of the stock,

resulting in an increase in consumption. Similarly, the greater
the rate of time preference, the lower the full price of the
addictive good, cigarettes, and, therefore, the greater its
consumption. Finally, the shadow price of the stock is rising as
the level of the stock increases, since U < 0.

                          III. EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK

       Following Becker and Murphy (1988) and Becker, Grossman, and
Murphy [1988), a quadratic utility function in the three arguments,
Y(t), C(t), and A(t) is assumed. The assumption is also made that
the individual's rate of time preference is equal to the market

rate of interest (that is, a=r).                The resulting instantaneous

utility function is:
                                                    U                U
(8) U(t)= bY(t) + bCC(t) + bAA(t) +                       Y(t)   +         C(t)2   +


             UAA
              2
                    A(t)2 + UYAY(t)A(t)         +
                                                    UCAC(t)A(t) + UycY(t)C(t).

       Maximizing out with respect to Y(t), converting to discrete
time, and using the resulting first order conditions for C(t) and
A(t), the following demand equations are derived (for a detailed
derivation, see the mathematical appendix):


(9)        C(t) =         + iPc(t)    +
                                           fl2Pc(tl)     +
                                                             P3Pc(t+l) +
                                          +
                            4C(t—l)           5C(t+1)
and:

           C(t) =     +
(10)                                  2Pc(t+l)          + Ø3C(t+l) + 4A(t)

       In both demand equations, current consumption is predicted to
be negatively related to the current price of cigarettes, but
positively related to both past (when included) and future prices.

In the Becker-Murphy model, addiction implies that consumption in

different time periods are complements. Thus, current consumption,



                                          7
if the good is addictive, is expected to be positively related to

future consumption.      Similarly, when lagged consumption is
included, current consumption is predicted to be positively related

to lagged consumption.     However, when the stock enters, no
prediction can be made concerning the direction of the relationship

between it and current consumption.'       Finally, these demand
equations hold the marginal utility of wealth constant.2
       Mullahy's estimates for a myopic model of cigarette smoking

support the hypothesis that cigarette smoking is an addictive
behavior for both men and women. Becker, Grossman, and Murphy's
[1988] application of Becker and Murphy's rational addiction model

to a pooled data set of the states of the U.S. over time supports
the hypothesis that cigarette smoking is an addictive behavior and

finds some evidence that individuals behave rationally. Chaloupka
[1989) estimates these demand equations using data on individuals
in the United States, finding support for the hypotheses that
cigarette smoking is an addictive behavior and that individual's
do not behave myopically. The estimates presented below are the
first to examine differences in the cigarette smoking behavior of
men and women in the context of the Becker—Murphy model of rational

addiction.

                             IV. DATA

     The data employed in the estimation of these demand equations

come from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination

Survey (NHANES2).   This is a national survey of approximately
28,000 people ages 6 months to 74 years conducted from 1976 to 1980
by the National Center for Health Services Research. Population
groups thought to be at high risk from malnutrition were over-

sampled.   Each individual completed detailed questionnaires on
their health histories and most underwent a comprehensive physical

examination.   Data on dietary patterns, including alcohol and
cigarette consumption, was also collected.
     Based on an individual's county and state of residence,
cigarette price and excise tax series were added to the data set.
The cigarette price is a weighted average statewide price for a

pack of twenty cigarettes based on the prices of single packs,
cartons, and vending machines sales, inclusive of state sales taxes

and, where applicable, local excise taxes, where the weights are
the national proportions of each type of sale.       Due to large
differences in cigarette prices across states (arising from
substantial differences in excise tax rates) smokers residing in
high tax localities have an incentive to purchase cigarettes in a
low tax locality. This incentive depends on the price difference
and the costs of purchasing and transporting the cigarettes from
one area to another, and increases the closer an individual lives
to a lower price locality.    Failing to account for this border
crossing phenomenon would result in estimated price coefficients

                                9
biased towards zero. To capture this casual smuggling, an equally

weighted average of the "border price" (the lowest price within
twenty—five miles of the individual's county of residence) and the

local price of cigarettes is used for cigarette price. All prices
and taxes are deflated by the national monthly Consumer Price Index

and a local price index developed by Mullahy based on the procedure

described by Fuchs, Michael, and Scott [1979).
     To estimate demand equation (9), consumption in three consecu-
tive periods is required, but only two consecutive periods are
provided in the survey data. In NHANES2, data were collected on

current cigarette consumption, lagged cigarette consumption, and
consumption at the time when the individual smoked his or her
greatest average daily quantity. The timing of maximum consump-
tion, however, is not reported. Also available are the number of
years prior to the interview the individual began smoking regularly

and the number of years, for former smokers, that the individual

has not smoked.     The following strategy is employed in the
estimation of demand equation (9). What is reported as current
consumption C(t) is treated as future consumption C*(t+l) and what

is reported as lagged consumption C(t-l) is treated as current
consumption C*(t), requiring an estimate of C(t—l) (actual C(t-

2)). For never—smokers, C*(t_1) is equal to zero. Similarly, for
individuals who either began smoking less than two years prior to

their interview or stopped smoking two or more years prior to their

 interview, C*(t_l) is equal to zero. For the remainder, individu-

 als smoking two years prior to their interview (about one—fourth

                                 10
of the sample), maximum consumption is used as a proxy for C(t-

1) .

       To estimate demand equation (10), current and future consump-
tion and a measure of the addictive stock are required. Current
and future consumption are obtained as described above.                 An

estimate of the addictive stock is obtained as follows. Recalling
the assumptions concerning the formation of the addictive stock and

assuming that the initial stock is zero, the stock at time t is:

(11)       A(t) =   E:   (l_&)t_l_1C(i)

Defining the term (1_6)t.1 as D(i), and using the definition for
covariance, equation (11) can be rewritten as follows:

(12)       A(t) =        D(i)C(i)       = tDC + tCov[D(i), C(i)]


                =
                     [   1 -   (1_6)t        + tCov[D(i), C(i)]


where D and C are the means of D(i) and C(i), respectively.
       The covariance term is assumed to be zero based on observed

lifetime smoking patterns.          Thus, to estimate the stock, mean
cigarette consumption, an assumed constant rate of depreciation,
and the number of years the individual has smoked are required. For

never—smokers, the stock is zero. For smokers, maximum consumption

is used as a proxy or mean consumption, with a modified version
of (12) used to compute the stock for former smokers.              Finally,
various depreciation rates are assumed and the sensitivity of the
results to these rates is discussed below.'



                                        11
     In each equation, the individual's age, age squared, race,
real family income, and a measure of educational attainment are
included as independent variables. Race is measured by a pair of
dichotomous variables, the first is equal to one if the individual

is black and is equal to zero otherwise, and the second is equal
to one if the individual is neither black nor white and is equal

to zero otherwise.   The income data reported in the survey is
categorical. The midpoint of each range is used as an approximation

for income, with the exception of the highest category ($25,000 and
over) for which $30,000 is used. The resulting measure is then
deflated by the annual CPI for the month during which the in-
dividual was interviewed and the state CPI. Also included in each

equation as a measure of educational attainment is the number of
years of formal schooling completed (with an upper bound of 17 for

those with 17 or more years of formal education).       Finally, a
dichotomous variable equal to one if the individual is a native
American and equal to zero otherwise is included due to the tax-
exempt status of cigarette sales on Indian reservations.      This

variable should be positively related to smoking as it indicates
(possibly) that the individual faces a lower price for cigarettes.

     Also included in the estimated demand equations are indicators

of marital status and labor force status.       Marital status is
captured by a set of dichotomous variables indicating that the
individual is widowed, divorced, separated, or single, with married

as the excluded category.    To measure labor force status, two
dichotomous variables indicating non—participants and unemployed

                                12
participants are used. These variables are included in an attempt

to capture the effects of stressful life—cycle events, such as
divorce, separation, and unemployment, on cigarette smoking. In
the Becker—Murphy model, stressful life—cycle events are predicted
to either lead to greater consumption of the addictive good or to
induce individuals who were not consumers to initiate consumption

and, hence, become addicted.

                           V. RESULTS

    Estimates of demand equations (9) and (10) are reported in
Table 1. Panel A of Table 1 contains the results for men, while
the estimates obtained for women are contained in Panel B. Column

1 of the two panels in Table 1 contains the estimates of equation
(9) where no assumption is made about the rate of depreciation on

the addictive stock.    Column 2 of the two panels in Table 1
contains the estimates of equation (9) assuming a 100% rate of
depreciation on the addictive stock (resulting in the exclusion of

past and future prices from the equation). Columns 3 and 4 contain

estimates of equation (10) assuming rates of depreciation of eighty

and sixty percent respectively. All equations are estimated using
Instrumental Variables procedures rather than Ordinary Least
Squares procedures due to the endogeneity of past and future
consumption in equation (9), and the addictive stock and future

consumption in equation (10) .   In   equation (9), current consump-
tion is specified as a function of one lag of consumption, one lead

of consumption, and lagged, current, and future cigarette prices,
implying that current consumption is independent of other past and
future prices, suggesting that further lags and leads of prices are

suitable instruments for lagged and led consumption.         Similar

arguments can be made for using several lags and leads of prices
as instruments for the addictive stock in equation and future

consumption in equation (10).         Thus, the set of instruments
employed includes the exogenous variables affecting consumption,
four lags of price, current price, and four leads of price, and

four lags, current, and four leads of the excise tax on cigarettes.

Excise taxes are included in the set of instruments to reduce
collinearity problems.
     In all models estimated for men, the estimated coefficients

for past, current, and future prices, future consumption and past
consumption conform to the predictions of the model. Among women,
however, the estimates for the coefficients on prices are less
consistent with the predictions of the model, while those on past
and future consumption are as expected.

     In all estimated equations for men, current average cigarette
consumption is found to be negatively related to the current price
of cigarettes. This relationship is significant with the exception
of the models estimated using the addictive stock.6 Similarly,
when included, past and future prices have the anticipated positive

effect on current consumption. In the models which include both
the lagged and led price of cigarettes, the coefficient on past
price is larger in magnitude than the coefficient on future price,

as predicted by the model. Similarly, past and future consumption
both have positive effects on current consumption. The effect of

past consumption is always significant at the one percent level,
indicating that cigarette smoking is indeed addictive, as expected.
The effect of future consumption on current consumption for men is

generally much less significant indicating that men are behaving
myopically. As predicted, in the two equations presented contain-
ing both past and future consumption, the coefficient on past
consumption is larger in magnitude than that on future consumption.


                                17
Finally, although the model did not predict the direction of the
relationship between the addictive stock and current consumption,

the addictive stock is found to have a significant positive effect

on current consumption in all estimated equations, suggesting that
the reinforcement effect of past consumption is larger than the
opposing effect of an increase in the full price of smoking as the

stock increases. In general, more significant estimates consistent
with the predictions of the model are obtained for prices, future
consumption, and the alternative measures of past consumption as
a higher rate of depreciation is assumed on the addictive stock.
     The results obtained for women are different in several
respects from those obtained for men. In all estimated equations

for women, cigarette prices (current, past, and future, when
included) do not exhibit a significant impact on average cigarette
consumption, indicating that women will not be responsive to
changes in cigarette prices arising from the increased excise
taxation of cigarettes. However, the estimated coefficients for
past and future consumption indicate that women are behaving much

less myopically than men. In all estimated equations containing
past and future cigarette consumption, a positive relationship is
obtained between cigarette consumption in adjacent periods and
current cigarette consumption, with almost all• estimates sig-
nificant at the one percent level. Moreover, the ratios of the
coefficients on past consumption to the coefficients on future
consumption suggest a much lower rate of time preference among
women than among men. This may explain the relative insignifance

                                18
of the money price of cigarettes on the demand for cigarettes among

women.   If the rate of time preference is low, as discussed
earlier, then the shadow price of the addictive stock plays a much
larger role in the determination of the full price of smoking.

Thus, money prices of cigarettes may be relatively less important
than the future health and utility consequences of smoking to women
in the calculation of the full price of smoking leading to little

or no response as money prices change.
     This discussion is supported by the estimates obtained for the

income variable.    A positive relationship is obtained between
income and average cigarette consumption in all equations estimated
for men, while the opposite is observed in all equations estimated

for women. If cigarettes and health are both normal goods, then
an increase in income will have an unclear effect on average
cigarette consumption. If an individual has a lower rate of time
preference, the effect of income on health (i.e., the individual
increases his/her production of health by consuming more medical
care and other inputs into health production, and reducing
participation in unhealthy activities) may be stronger than the
effect of income on current consumption, leading to less cigarette

consumption.
     An initial examination of the estimates of the exogenous
determinants of demand may lead to the conclusion that these
variables have little impact on demand. These results, however,
may be misleading since the influence of these exogenous variables

may be through their effects on future consumption and either

                                19
lagged consumption or the addictive stock. This possibility is
supported by the estimates of comparable ordinary least squares
equations where the significance of the exogenous determinants of

demand is substantially higher. The qualitative findings, however,
are similar across estimation techniques and specifications.
     For both males and females, a positive but diminishing
relationship is observed between age and average cigarette
consumption, with a stronger relationship observed for men. Black
men and men of other races are found to smoke less than white men,
on average, consistent with observed differences in cigarette
smoking among men of different races.     Native American men are

found to smoke significantly more, in some models, on average than

other men. Among women, however, there appear to be no differences
in average cigarette consumption attributable to race or ethnicity.

Finally, men with more formal education smoke significantly less
than those with fewer years of formal education. A much weaker
negative relationship is observed between cigarette smoking and
education among women.
     The marital status and employment status variables were
included in an attempt to measure the impact of stressful hf e-
cycle events on cigarette consumption. With respect to employment
status, male and female non—participants are found to smoke
significantly less than their employed counterparts, with a
quantitatively larger relationship found among men.       This was

anticipated given that the day—to-day work environment is a major
determinant of the stress an individual is under. On the other

                                20
hand, unemployed individuals may be under greater stress leading
them to smoke more. These predictions are supported, somewhat, by

the positive, though insignificant, coefficients on the unemploy-
nient variable for both men and women. The results for the marital

status indicators are much less well defined.

       Of particular interest in this work is the long run price
elasticity of demand for cigarettes. To obtain an estimate of this

elasticity, assume that, in the long run, a steady state level of
consumption is reached (Ca) which serves to replace depreciation on
the addictive stock (Ca = 6A*, where A* is the optimal level of the

addictive stock). This implies that a permanent change in price
will lead to some change in consumption in each period, and, as a
result, in the optimal level of the addictive stock, until a new
steady state equilibrium is achieved.                    The resulting long run
elasticities are:

Estimates of the long run price elasticities of demand for men,
based on the coefficients on cigarette prices, future cigarette
consumption, and a measure of past cigarette consumption imply that
increased cigarette prices would be an effective means of reducing

long run cigarette consumption among men. For men, the long run
price elasticity of demand falls in the range from -0.643 to

                                            21
-0.536, suggesting that an increase in price of 15 percent (the
price increase associated with proposals to double the Federal
cigarette excise tax rate from 16 cents per pack to 32 cents per

pack) would lead to a drop in average cigarette consumption among
men of between 8 and 9.6 percent. For women, however, estimates
of the long run price elasticity of demand based on the insig-
nificant price estimates suggest that increases in excise taxes

would have no impact on cigarette consumption.
     A serious problem in the estimation of the various demand
equations is the collinearity between cigarette prices and the
measures of past and future consumption, possibly resulting in the
low statistical significance of the estimated price coefficients.

One approach to reducing this problem is to impose the restrictions

suggested by the model. In particular, when estimating equation
(9), the restriction could be imposed that the coefficients on
future price and future consumption be smaller by the factor
l/(l+c) than the coefficients on past price and past consumption,

respectively.    Similarly, when estimating equation (10), the
restriction that the coefficient on future price be equal to the
coefficient on current price multiplied by the factor -(l-6)/(l+a)

could be imposed. Table 2 contains estimates of the coefficients
on prices, future consumption, and past consumption or the
addictive stock, along with the estimated long run price elasticity

of demand, when these restrictions are imposed.        The results

presented as Model 1 impose the restriction that l/(1+a) =   0.8,

while those presented as Model 2 use a value for the discount
factor suggested by the estimation of the model least subject to

the collinearity problems (that imposing a depreciation rate of one
hundred percent on the addictive stock).7 This factor is 0.42 for
men and 0.90 for women. Panel A of Table 2 contains the estimated

coefficients and associated long run price elasticities of demand
for men, with the comparable estimates for women presented in Panel

B.

     None of the restrictions imposed on the price and/or consump-

tion coefficients has a statistically significant effect, implying
that the restrictions are valid. The main result of the imposition

of the linear restrictions is that the statistical significance of

the price and consumption coefficients is improved in those
equations estimated for men, thus improving the estimates of the
long run price elasticity of cigarette demand.8 The estimated
price elasticities, however, are almost unchanged. The long run
price elasticity of demand for men now falls in the range from
-0.55 to -0.69, while that for women remains statistically no
different from zero.

                        VI. CONCLUSIONS

    This paper uses cigarette demand equations derived from the
Becker-Murphy [1988] model of rational addiction to estimate
cigarette demand separately for men and women with data on
individuals in the United States.    Instrumental variables tech-

niques are used to estimate unrestricted and restricted versions
of these demand equations. The focus on differences in the smoking

behavior of men and women is important due to the different health
risks associated with smoking for the sexes and the observed
differences in their response to the anti-smoking campaign of the

past 25 years.
     In general, the estimates for both men and women support the

hypotheses that cigarette smoking is an addictive behavior.
Comparing the smoking behavior of men and women, the estimates
imply that men are much more responsive to changes in cigarette
prices than women, while women behave much less myopically than
men. The estimated long run price elasticity of demand for men
centers on -0.60, while the estimates obtained suggest that women
are virtually unresponsive to changes in the money price Of

cigarettes.
     The estimates presented above lend some support to the
hypothesis that increasing the price of cigarettes by increasing
excise taxes on cigarettes is an effective policy for reducing
smoking, at least among men. A doubling of the Federal excise tax
on cigarettes from 16 to 32 cents (as has been proposed as part of
a deficit reduction program), resulting in an increase of approx-

                                26
iinately 15 percent in price (assuming a competitive market) would
lead, in the long run, to about an 8 to 10 percent fall in
consumption among men.    However, this increase would have no
significant impact on the cigarette consumption of women.

 Assistant Professor, University of Illinois at Chicago. I'd like
to thank Michael Grossman, Gary Becker, Kevin Murphy, John Mullahy,
Henry Saffer, participants at the Western Economic Association
meetings, and seminar participants at Yale University and the
University of Chicago for their helpful comments on earlier drafts
of related papers. Any remaining errors, as well as any opinions
expressed are the author's.       Any comments or suggestions are
welcomed.

1. The effects of the stock on current consumption are ambiguous
due to the opposing effects of reinforcement and the increase in
the shadow price of the stock. Part of the full price of smoking
includes the negative effects of the stock on future utility. As
the stock increases, the discounted sum of these effects increases,
increasing the full price of smoking (through the increase in the
shadow price of the stock), and discouraging consumption.
2. Non—addictive models of consumption ignore all future and past
effects are ignored. Myopic models of cigarette demand, such as
Mullahy's [1985], treat current demand as a function of current
price as well as some measure of past consumption and/or prices,
but not future consumption and prices. Thus, the estimates allow
for the testing of the rational addiction hypothesis.          See
Chaloupka [1988, 1989] for a more detailed discussion.
3. Alternatively, one could assume that maximum consumption occurs
at some arbitrary point in the individual's smoking history, after
which it declines at some constant rate (or lirearly) until it
reaches C(t—l).    Based on this assumption, C (t—l) could be
predicted. However, a mechanical relationship now exists between
the dependent variable C (t) and the independent variable C (t-l)
which may result in a spurious relationship between the two.

4. Evidence presented in the Surgeon General's reports suggests
that many of the physiological effects of cigarette smoking
disappear relatively soon after cessation. Similarly, most of the
withdrawal symptoms associated with the cessation of the smoking
habit occur relatively soon after stopping, with the only lingering
symptom being a craving for nicotine.      This suggests that the
assumed rate of depreciation should be relatively high.
5. There are two problems associated with the estimation of these
demand equations: the endogeneity of past and future consumption
and the limited nature of the dependent variables. Relatively more
emphasis is placed on the endogeneity problem than on the limited
dependent variable problem. In general, doing two stage instrumen-
tal variables estimation with this type of limited dependent
variable model is quite tricky.


                                  29
6. All statements concerning the statistical significance of
prices, past consumption (or the addictive stock), and future
consumption are based on one—tailed tests. When no significance
level is indicated, it is assumed to be ten percent.

7. Other values for l/(l+a) were assumed ranging from 0.4 to 0.95
with very little effect on the estimates.

8. Becker, Grossman, and Murphy [1988) derive several other price
elasticities of demand based on their version of equation (9).
These various elasticities depend on the timing of the price
change, whether the change is permanent or temporary, and whether
the change is anticipated or unanticipated.      Chaloupka [1988)
develops comparable elasticities for equation (10).     The model
predicts the relative magnitudes of these elasticities. When the
coefficients on price and/or consumption are estimated in an
unrestricted model, mixed support is found for the predictions
concerning the relative magnitudes of the various elasticities for
men. However, the imposition of the restrictions generally lead
to estimated price elasticities in the demand equations for men
which conform to all predictions of the model. Due to the complete
insignificance of price as a determinant of the demand for
cigarettes by women, this discussion is not relevant.

       Following Becker and Murphy (1988) and Becker, Grossman, and Murphy
(1988), a quadratic utility function in the three arguments, 1(t), C(t), and
A(t) is assumed. The assumption is also made that the individual's rate of
time preference is equal to the market rate of interest (that is, a=r). The
resulting instantaneous utility function is:

It should be pointed out that aM and acc are both negative from the assumption
of concavity. Assuming that addictive consumption has no effect on the
marginal utility of the composite good Y (Ucy=O), then a>O.
         At this point, to get an empirically tractable demand equation for
cigarettes, the model is converted to a discrete time framework.1 In discrete
time, the maximization problem is the following:


 (A14)      V*[.] = K + Max [E0(1+a)_tF(e(t)s A(t)]1


         1 Given the specification for the stock accumulation process, C(t) can
 be replaced with 6A(t)/5t + 6A(t), making the maximization problem one
 involving only A(t) and &A(t)/6t. For a complete solution to this problem,
 and an interesting discussion of the addicts response to changes in various
 factors over the life cycle, see Becker and Murphy (1988).

where:

(A15)    A(t) = C(t—l)        + (1—6)A(t—1)

A typical first order  condition with respect to cigarette consumption for
this maximization problem is:

define the term in brackets in equation (A17) as Uc(t) and define the right
hand side of equation (A18) as VA(t). Making these substitutions, equation
(A16) can be rewritten as:
