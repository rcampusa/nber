     Women who have first births relatively late in life earn higher wages.

This paper offers an explanation of this fact based on a staple life-cycle

model of human capital investment and timing of first birth. The model

yields conditions (that are plausibly satisfied) under which late

childbearers will tend to invest more heavily in human capital than early

childbearera. The empirical analysis finds results consistent with the

higher wages of late cbildbearers arising primarily through greater

measurable human capital investment.

I.   Introduction

        Between 1970 and 1983, the first birth rate in the U.S. declined by 19

percent. In addition, according to survey data collected by the Census

Bureau, the proportion of childless women increased substantially between

1976 and 1985 in the age groups 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39 (see Table 1). An

extensive body of previous research has established that these trends

reflect both (1) an increased tendency to permanently forego childbearing

and (2) an increasing tendency to delay the initiation of childbearing,

among those women who do ultimately bear children, (see Bloom, 1982, 1984,

and 1987; Bloom and Pebley, 1982; Bloom and Trussell, 1984; O'Connell,

1985; and Rindfuss1 Morgan, and Swicegood, 1988) After many years of

remarkable stability, the female/male wage ratio also began to increase in

the l980s (from 0.60 in 1980 to 0.64 in 1984). There is some evidence that

this latter change is associated with relative increases in human capital

accumulation on the part of women (see Smith and Ward, 1984; O'Neill,

1985)

        This paper develops some explicit theoretical linkages concerning the

relationship between a woman's fertility-timing behavior and her human

capital acquisition and wage profile. We develop a simple model in which

women make their human capital investment and fertility timing decisions

conditional on preferences over the timing of their first birth. By

simplifying the nature of the fertility/work decision, we are able to

describe the conditions under which a woman who prefers (and therefore

expects) to be a delayed childbearer will invest more heavily in her human

capital than a woman who prefers to have an early first birth. The model

suggests that these conditions are fairly general: if the discount rate is

greater than the economy-wide growth rate of wages for workers who are not

human capital investors, then delayers will be more likely to invest in

human capital. Our empirical analysis indicates that data for white women

aged 28-38 in 1982 provide some support for our theoretical model. There

exists a strong positive relationship between several proxies for human

capital investment and the age at which a woman bears her first child.

However, the empirical analysis does not support the proposition that the

usual proxies for human capital represent more investment for women who

choose to delay their childbearing.



II. Stylized Facts

     Our empirical analysis uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Young

Women (MLS). This MIS   survey   has been conducted every year (or every other

year in some periods) since 1968, when it started with 5,159 women aged

14-24. The main purpose of this survey has been to gather information on

the labor market experiences of young women. Questions on ages of children

in various years of the survey enabled us to calculate age at first birth.

We have used the NLS data through 1982 to construct a data set with wage,

labor market and fertility timing data for a sample of working women aged

28-38 in 1982. Like many longitudinal data sets1 the NLS Young Women's

Cohort has suffered from sample attrition over time; still, the 1982

reinterview includes roughly 70 percent of the original respondents.

The NLS data offer a number of advantages compared to other data sets used

to study the correlates of fertility timing. For one, the longitudinal

structure provides a method of accounting for unobserved heterogeneity.

lore importantly, perhaps, the richness of the MIS data permit us to

construct typically unavailable measures of several key determinants of

earnings. The variables used in this study whose construction relies on



                                   2
data from a large section of women's work lives (in many cases their entire

career to date) include actual labor market experience,1 tenure, and

occupational training.

      Table 2 reports statistics descriptive of wages, human capital, and

other characteristics of white women2 classified into four groups on the

basis of the age at which they bore their first child: (1) women who had

their first birth before the survey in which they were age 22 (early"

childbearers); (2) women who had their first birth between ages 22 and 26

(inclusive); (3) women who first gave birth after age 26 ("late"

childbearers); and (4) women who had not given birth by the time of the

1982 survey ("childless" women).3 Only individuals with no missing data

for any variables (except the training, occupation, and early wage

variables) are used to compute the statistics reported in Table 2. The

statistics are reported separately for women who were currently employed on

the date surveyed in 1982, and for women who were not employed at that

time; the differences in the reported statistics across age-at--first-birth




1This is preferable to potential experience, usually approximated as age
minus education minus 5, which is known to be a poor indicator of actual
experience for women (see Garvey and Reimers, 1980).
2The sample excludes all nonwhites. Initial investigations suggested that
the estimated effect of age at first birth on wages in wage regressions for
blacks was very different from the estimated effect for whites. Also, the
percentage of blacks who delayed childbearing past the age of 26 was very
small -

3Kany of the women who are classified as childless in 1982 will eventually
become late childbearers. We would like to separate these women from those
who will remain permanently childless, but are of course unable to do so
with our data.
4The training variable is missing for some individuals, and otherwise
seemed to contribute little independent information. Consequently, we
retained observations for which this variable could not be constructed.
The training and other variables are explained more fully in the footnotes
to Table 2

categories tend to be very similar for these two samples. With the

exception of the early wage variable, all values are for 1982.

     Table 2 reveals a pattern of increases in the 1982 wage, and in all of

the human capital measures, as age at first birth increases; childless

women tend to have values of these variables that are close to those of the

late childbearers. These are raw means, of course, and therefore do not

control for the influence of some of the variables in the table on others.

For example, a natural explanation for the positive association between

wages and age at first birth is that educational attainment is positively

related to age at first birth.5 Also, the small experience and tenure

differences in Table 2 actually do represent a substantially more intensive

rate of investment in experience- and tenure-related human capital for

delayed childbearers, since their greater investment in education leaves

them with relatively less potential time for accumulating experience and

tenure.6 The training measure does not follow as consistent a pattern as

education, tenure, and experience, but it does reveal a weak tendency to

increase with age at first birth. Finally, later childbearers and

childless women are more likely to be in professional and managerial

occupations than earlier childbearers, who are more likely to be in

administrative, service and blue collar occupations.

     The early wage variable reported in Table 2 represents an attempt to




5while it is not noted in Table 2, it is also true that later childbearers
are not delaying simply because they spend more years in school. In fact,
higher education is associated with more delaying net of the extra years
spent in school. This follows from calculations that show that the
difference between age at first birth and the age at completion of
schooling is greater for those women with more education.
6This is clear from the fact that educational attainment increases with age
at first birth, while the average age in each age-at-first-birth category
is roughly the same (except for the childless, for whom it is the lowest).

                                4
measure the hourly rate of pay at    which   women begin their labor market

career following the completion of their schooling. In selecting this

variable, we found the earliest wage (in 1968 or later) for each woman in a

year in which she was not in school, and had not previously had her first

birth. We were able to find such a wage for 988 of the 1,817 women in our

sample.7 The differences in the average level of the early wage across

age-at-first-birth categories are similar in pattent to those for the 1982

wage. however, the differences tend to be somewhat larger with the 1982

wage. For example, the average early wage of "late" childbearers is 37

percent higher than the average early wage for "early" childbearers, while

the 1982 wage for late childbearers is 43 percent higher than the 1982 wage

£ or early childbearers, For the childless compared to the      early
childbearers, the difference grows from 31 percent in the early wage to 38

percent in the 1982 wage.8

     Some of the relationships revealed in these descriptive statistics

replicate results found in other studies. Previous analyses of the

covariates of age at first birth uniformly reveal that educational

attainment varies positively and strongly with first birth timing and the

likelihood of being childless (Bloom, 1982, 1984; Bloom and Trussell,

1984). A related literature documents and studies the relationship between

teen childbearing and schooling (e.g. ,   Furstenberg, 1976; Furstenberg, at
al, 1987; Geronimus and Koreninan, 1990; Hofferth, 1984; McCrate, 1989;

Upchurch and McCarthy, 1989). However there is considerably less research




7since this variable is from different years for different women, we make
corrections for differences in the price level and the level of labor
productivity across the years.
8These comparisons are made using the early wage averages for the part of
the sample that was working in 1982.

on the direct relationship between a woman's wages or earnings and the

timing of her childbearing.9 Bloom (1987) finds that in the younger of two

cohorts analyzed in the June 1985 CPS, there is a positive relationship

between age at first birth and wages, even controlling for schooling, time

out of the labor force, and several other determinants of earnings. While

a great deal has been written about the impact on wages of interruptions in

labor force attachment for childbearing and childrearing, this research has

not focused on the timing of these interruptions per se (Polachek, 1975;

Mincer and Ofek, 1982; Corcoran, et al., 1983; O'Neill, 1985).

     One line of research that does explore specific links between wages

and fertility timing is the "business cycle" work of Butz and Ward (1979).

The idea underlying this work is that working women will tend to have

children when real wages are relatively low, as during a recession. This

theory could also have implications for the cross-section relationship

between fertility timing and wages, although there have been few attempts

to test these implications)°

    What appears to be lacking in the existing literature is a

model that explains all of the relationships in Table 2 in a reasonably

unified manner. In the next section we offer a theoretical model in which




9To our knowledge, the only prior empirical studies of this subject are
Trussell and Abowd (1980), Bloom (1987), and Lundberg and Plotnick (1989).
Both Lundberg and Plotnick, and Trussell and Abowd, focus on the effects of
teenage childbearing only.
10Macunovich and Lillard (1989) attempt to apply the Butz and Ward model to
micro-data. In contrast to fertility responses to aggregate wage
movements, however, they identify effects of wages on fertility timing from
cross-section wage variation and time-series wage changes in a panel data
set. It seems that a complete test of the Butz and Ward model using
micro-data, however, should distinguish expected from unexpected wage
changes1 and examine the effects of unexpected changes.

human capital and fertility timing decisions are made jointly. Our model

suggests that women who prefer to delay the initiation of childbearing will

invest more in human capital than women who prefer to begin their

childbearing earlier. After presenting this model, Sections IV and V

explore more fully some of its empirical implications.



III. Theoretical M2lcl

     The defining feature of the standard human capital model is that

individuals have the opportunity to invest in training that enhances their

productivity but that is costly to obtain. Workers find it desirable to

obtain training when its benefits -   - higher   wages after the training is

completed --   outweigh its costs. In this section, we extend a simple human
capital model to allow childbearing to affect the human-capital investment

decision through the effect that withdrawal from the labor force after

childbearing has on the benefits of the human capital investment. The

key implication of the model is that relatively late childbearing is

associated with greater human capital investment; factors that lead to

relatively late childbearing also lead to greater human capital investment1

and vice versa.

     In analyzing the human-capital/fertility-timing decision for women, we

make several simplifying assumptions.11 First, we assume that all women are

equally productive in the labor markec at the start of their working

career. Second, all women bear one, and only one, child. Third, all women




    simpler version of our model, due to Edelfson (1980), is presented in
Montgomery and Trusselj. (1986). Happel, Hill, and Low (1984) and Razin
(1984) and Cigno and Ermisch (1989) also present economic models of
fertility timing decisions, but only Cigno and Ermisch have treated human
capital accumulation as determined jointly with fertility timing.

work from time 0 to time R, except for a period of length r following

childbirth when women leave the work force and have no earnings; women must

choose to have their child at some time between time 0 and time R-r.

Fourth, all women have the option of investing in one type of human capital

which increases a woman' s productivity (and thus her wage), at the rate

s, while she is working; the cost of the human capital investment is C (at

time 0) and is the same for all women. Finally, the only source of income

for a woman is her own earnings.

    We also assume that a woman's lifetime utility depends both on the

present value of her lifetime income and on the time period in which she

has her child, i.e. U-U(YT) where Y is the present value of lifetime

income and T is the time period of childbirth women prefer both higher

incomes and earlier periods of childbearing (i.e., we assume 13>0 and

Uc0).   For tractability, we use a linear utility function, U—Y-aT, with
a>0. Women differ in their preferences toward early childbearing, so that

a varies across women.

    At the start of her working career, a woman has two choices to make:

one, whether she should invest in human capital; and, two, when she should

have her first child. We seek a description of these two choices in the

following way: first we derive an expression for the optimal age at first

birth conditional on either investment (with optimal age 9)   or
non-investment (T*); second, given that the women is optimizing in her

choice of time of childbirth, we ask whether her lifetime utility would be

higher under investment or under non-investment.

     The complete details of the solution for these two decisions are quite

cumbersome (due to the possibility of boundary solutions for time of birth)

and therefore are presented in the appendix. Here we highlight the nature



                                   S
of the solution by focusing on the case where all women choose an interior

solution for time of birth (I.e., O<T*a-r). If a woman chooses to invest

in human capital, then the present value of her lifetime income is



         .YI

where w is the initial wage, q is the economy-wide rate of growth of wages.

and r is the discount rate. U(Y11T) is maximized with respect to T, for

which the first-order condition for a utility extremum is


       P1.81(T) —   we(5t   T11I)T1 —           a       .        (1)

The left-hand side of (1) represents the marginal benefit from delaying

childbirth, and equals the present value of the wage received prior to

childbirth minus the present value of the wage received when returning to

the labor market after childbirth. The right-hand side of (1) is the

marginal cost of delaying. It follows that the marginal benefit of

delaying will only be positive if q<r, which we assume throughout. The

condition will represent a maximum if si-q-rCO, which we also presently

assume. (If s.+-q-r>O, the optimal time for the birth will be either 0 or

R-r;    this   case is discussed in the appendix).

        lf the woman chooses not to invest in human capital, her lifetime

income is

The condition for a utility extremum is

                                       9
which is also the condition for a maximum when q<r. The left-hand side of

(2) represents the marginal benefit of delaying for a non-investor.

     It follows from equations (1) and (2) that a woman who has invested in

human capital will choose to delay her childbearing more than if she had

not invested in human capital. This fact is illustrated in Figure 1, which

graphs the marginal benefit and marginal cost functions for both investors

and non-investors. While the two marginal benefit functions are equal when

T—O, at any time T the slope of the investor's marginal benefit function is

larger (less negative) than the slope of the noninvestor's function. As a

result, T*>T*  must hold. As a decreases (as in the fall from a to s in
         I  I!                                                 0        1

Figure 2), the larger slope of the investor's marginal benefit function

implies that the difference between    and T* will increase, as long as Tt

has not reached R-r, the upper boundary for childbearing ages}2

     The next step in our analysis of the decision process is the human

capital investment decision. Given that the woman will be optimizing on her

fertility timing once she has chosen whether or not to invest, we can

derive the indirect utilities of the two choices as functions of the

parameters of the problem, i.e.1 VaV.(w,q,r,s,s,C), j—I,M. Then a woman

will choose to invest in human capital if VI>VN. As is demonstrated in the

appendix, the indirect utility from investing grows more quickly as a

declines than does the indirect utility from not investing; this means that

women with less strong preferences for early childbearing are more likely

to find VI>VN to be true than women more desirous of an early birth.

     This result is illustrated in Figure 2 for the case where both




       also that as s increases, the investor's marginal benefit function
will grow less steep (swinging out to the right but keeping the same
y-intercept), which increases Tt. and the difference between     and T.

the lower value of a to find investing optimal than for a woman with the

higher value, since the left-hand side of (3) increases as a decreases but

the right-hand side remains unchanged.

13This difference may be positive, though in this case all women would end
up choosing to make the human capital investment.

childbearing? As discussed earlier, we expect women with lower values for

a to delay their childbearing more, while we also expect them to be more

likely to invest in human capital)4 With human capital investment

increasing the wages of investors relative to non-investors at all times

after T'-O, we expect to observe delayed childbearers having higher wages

than otherwise similar women (in terms of initial productivity) who choose

to bear their child earlier. It also follows that the difference in the

wages of delayed and early childbearers will grow over time due to the

higher rate of human capital investment among delayed childbearers.

    While the model has been discussed in terms of variation in the taste

parameter a being only the difference between women, it is also true that

increases in a, or decreases in C, make it more likely both that women will

delay childbearing and that they will invest in human capital. Futhermore,

slight changes in the model do not alter the basic conclusions. For

example, if the model is changed to reflect the fact that women have more

difficulty continuing their investment in human capital after having their

first child, so that wages grow at the rate q (and not at the rate q+s)

after returning from childbirth even for women who were earlier investing

in human capital, our primary conclusions still hold. Likewise, if there

is depreciation of human capital while a woman is out of the labor force,

delayers will still invest more in human capital, as depreciation merely

increases the difference between the leaving and returning wages and so

"swings out" the M31(T)   curve,
     Differential investment in human capital is not the only reason why




     contrast, Cigno and Ermisch (1989) suggest that higher human capital
accumulation (prior to marriage) should lead to earlier births.



                                   12
delayed childbearers might be expected to have higher wages. Suppose there

were no possibility to invest in human capital, and that all women had the

same value for the childbearing utility parameter a. Instead, women differ

in their initial level of productivity (and so their wage) at the time they

enter the labor force, From equation (2) we know that a higher initial wage

will shift upwards the marginal benefit curve, as from MB to MB; in Figure

3. As a result, women with higher initial wages will more often choose to

delay, and so delayed childbearing will be associated with higher wages at

all points in the woman's lifetime, Differences in initial wages may also

be part of the explanation for the fact, discussed in section II, that more

educated women tend to delay their childbearing more after completing their

schooling.

     The empirical implications of our model are that women who choose to

delay childbearing will accumulate more education, and, to the extent that

labor market experience and tenure represent human capital investment, will

also accumulate more experience and tenure. This greater investment will

raise the relative earnings of later childbearers. We might expect two

additional findings, because we may not be able to perfectly measure human

capital investment, but rather must regard variables such as education,

experience, tenure, and even our training measure, as proxies. First, we

may find that fertility timing has an effect on wages after controlling for

measurable human capital, though such residual effects could also be due to

unobserved heterogeneity in the initial productivity of workers. Second,

we may find higher returns to education, experience, and tenure, for

delayed childbearers, in wage regressions. We explore these possibilities

in the   next   section.

     It is difficult if not impossible to measure human     capital   directly.

As a result, labor economists often interpret wage variation attributable

to observable variables as resulting from differences in investment in

human   capital,   relying on a theoretical structure that relates the

observable variables to human capital investment. One      famous   example is

Mincer's interpretation of labor market experience as representing

investments in on-the-job training (see Mincer, 1974). In the present

context, this approach suggests including age-at-first-birth variables in a

wage regression as potentially reflecting differences in human capital

investment not captured by other human capital prnies that are included in

the regression. In this section, we consider this approach, as well as

more explicit tests of the human     capital   model.

     Table 3 presents least squares estimates of log wage equations for the

NLS sample of working women considered in Table 2. The wage variable is

the reported hourly wage and salary income usually earned in the

respondent's primary job at the time of the survey. In all of our

regressions, we include as independent variables dummy variables for the

same classification of age at first birth as was used for Table 2; age at

first birth less than 22 is the omitted categoryJ5 In column li, we

report coefficient estimates from a least-squares regression of the natural

logarithm of the wage on these timing dummy variables, as well as dummy

specifications of age-at-first-birth effects. A linear specification Was
clearly inadequate, and the dummy variable specification is more readily
interpretable than other non-linear specifications that appeared to fit the
data equally well.

whether the woman was married with spouse present, or was instead divorced,

widowed or living apart from her spouse (never married is the omitted

category))6 Since the number of children a woman has given birth to is

correlated with age at first birth (see Table 2), we also include dummy

variables for two children, and for three or more children, as independent

variables. The choice of omitted category for the number of children

classification implies that the childless coefficient measures the

difference between childless women and early childbearers with one child.

As the estimates in Table 3 make clear, substantial wage differentials by

age at first birth persist once these controls are added. Women with age

at first birth between 22 and 26 earn on average 11 percent more than early

childbearers, and these differentials rise to about 30 percent for late

childbearers and childless women.

     Because few (if any) controls for human capital investment are

included in the specification in column (I), these estimates of wage

differentials due to age at first birth may reflect differences in the

observable proxies for human capital such as education and experience. In

column (2), we add education to the regression)7 Not surprisingly, the

wage differentials by age at first birth fall considerably. Nonetheless,

sizable and statistically significant differentials remain for late

'7The education variables are years of schooling, and a dummy for
post-college (i.e, more than 16 years of schooling). Specifications
including dummy variables for high school and college degrees were also
estimated, but the coefficient estimates were statistically insignificant
and small.

childbearers and childless women, consistent with differences in human

capital investment above and beyond education,

     Human capital investment may also occur on the job. Following Mincer

(1974), in column (3) we add linear and quadratic terms for experience and

tenure to the regression. The coefficient estimates for experience and

tenure are statistically significant, and of the expected sign and

magnitude. The age-at-first-birth coefficients are further reduced by the

inclusion of experience and tenure, and though individually are

statistically insignificant, remain marginally significant in a joint

F-test. Inclusion of occupational dummy variables -      - which   may reflect

human capital investment differences - -   further   reduces the coefficient for

"late" childbearers, and leaves the three age-at-first-birth dummy

coefficients jointly insignificant (at the .05 level).

     The estimates in Table 3 yield two findings. First, differences in

observed proxies for human capital investment (schooling, experience, and

tenure) can explain a sizeable portion of wage differentials associated

with fertility timing. Second, wage differentials remain once account is

taken of these proxies, consistent with there being differences in

unobserved human capital investment (although the statistical evidence on

this point is not strong). We next attempt to determine whether these

remaining fertility-timing effects actually reflect further differences in

human capital investment.

     Including dummy variables for fertility timing may be a crude way to

estimate effects of differential human capital investment that remain once

our proxies are included. A better specification may be to let the

coefficients of these proxies vary with age at first birth. These types of

effects could arise if the education of women who intend to delay



                                16
childbearing consists of more human capital investment (thus giving rise to

higher returns to education), or if later childbearers invest more per unit

of labor market experience or tenure, in column (1) of Table 4, we let the

coefficient on the years of schooling variable differ for late childbearers

and childless women by including interactions of education with the 27+ and

childless dummiesJ8 In column (2), we let the linear experience and tenure

coefficients vary by age-at-first-birth category, while in column (3) we

let the returns to all three human capital proxies vary. Focusing on

column (3), we see that the point estimates of the education interactions

are consistent with greater human capital investment for each year of

education for later childbearers. For example, the return to education is

almost 60 percent higher for the the late childbearers (27+) relative to

the <22 category.19 But these differences are not statistically

significant. While the point estimates of the experience interactions are

small and insignificant, the tenure interactions are jointly significant.

The tenure coefficient estimates suggest that late childbearers receive a

higher return to tenure, but also provide the anomalous result that

childless women receive lower returns to tenure (this latter inference

supported by a marginally significant t-statistic). Overall, the patterns

of these interactions do not support the proposition that our human capital

measures represent more human capital investment for women who delay their

childbearing.




18An interaction for the 22-26 category was not included because the
estimates in Table 3 provided no evidence that these women earn higher
wsges than early childbearers once observable human capital proxies are
included in the wage regression.
11n unreported results, we verified that these differences do not simply
reflect nonlinearities in education effects entailing higher returns to the
higher levels of education of later childbearers.

1. Standard errors of estimates are reported in parentheses. Controls included in all specifications include:

present and divorced, widowed or separated); duny variables for residence in the South and in an SNSA; and

     As a final attempt to better capture human capital differences, we

utilize the training measure presented in Table 2 as a more direct measure

of human capital investment. In column (4) of Table 4 we repeat the

estimation of the specification in column (4) of Table 3 using the smaller

sample with nonmissing training. Then, in column (5), we add to this

specification the training measure, The estimates suggest that each

additional year of training leads to a 5 percent increase in wages.

However, inclusion of training does not affect the fertility timing

coefficient estimates, or   the   coefficient estimates for experience and
          20
tenure.

     Our next step in the empirical work is to explore whether these

conclusions are affected by the failure to control for two other potential

influences on the relationship between wages and fertility timing: the

direct effect of wages on fertility timing; and the effect of fertility

timing on labor force participation.

     The idea that wages may directly affect fertility timing was

illustrated in the discussion of Figure 3 in Section III. This discussion

suggested that fixed omitted variables in a wage equation (e.g. ,     ability,
aggressiveness, and "spunk"), which would tend to increase starting wages,
                                             21
should also lead to delayed childbearing.         To examine this possibility, we




200ne interpretation of these results is that much of the human capital
investment undertaken by delayed childbearers does not occur in the formal
settings captured by the training variable.
21The presence of fixed effects in the wage equation error is a plausible
explanation for why there may be a correlation between the wage equation
error and the age-at-first-birth variables, leading to biased coefficient
estimates. However, since current wages should have little direct effect
on past childbearing behavior, a correlation between the curnnt wage and
the age-at-first-birth variables is unlikely to arise from a correlation
between age at first birth and the current-period innovation in the wage
equation error.

                                    18
include as a regressor the residual from a regression of the early (log)

wage on characteristics of women at the time of the early wage observation;

this residual should control for any fixed effects in the wage equation

error term.22 In columns (2), (5), and (7) of Table 5, we re-estimate three

specifications from Tables 3 and 4, using the smaller sample for which the

early wage variable was available. In columns (3), (6), and (8) we add the

early wage residual to each of the specifications.23 The results suggest

that there is some persistence in wages over time; the coefficient on the

early wage residual (which is measured, on average, 11 years prior to 1982)

ranges from .27 to .30. The coefficient estimates for the fertility timing

dummy variables fall when the early wage residual is included, although the

decline in the coefficients is small relative to the standard errors of the

coefficient estimates. The implication is that heterogeneity in initial

wages does not affect to any great extent the measured relationships

between wages and fertility timing. In columns (1) and (4) we report

coefficient estimates for the age-at-first-birth dummies when they are

included as regressors in the early wage equations.24 These estimates also

do not reveal a strong correlation between starting wages and the timing of

(later) fertility once the effects of human capital on wages are removed.




     cannot calculate a standard fixed-effects estimator because the
age-at-first-birth dummy variables are fixed over time.
23The early wage residuals differ by specification. In column (3), the
early wage residual is from a regression that does not included experience
and tenure (since the 1982 regression does not include these variables).
while in columns (6) and (8) the early wage regressions do include
experience and tenure. However, the early wage regressions for column (8)
do not include the age-at-first-birth interactions with education.
24The age-at-first-birth dummies were not included in the early wage
regressions used to generate the early wage residuals in columns (3), (6),
and (8).

observation were drawn are included.

     Since the estimates in Tables 3 through 5 are based on samples of

women that exclude those women not working in 1982, inferences from these

estimates may suffer from sample selection bias (see Heckman, 1979). The

nature of our sample definition implies that our estimates are conditional

on women working, and so may not correspond to the population of all women.

In particular, it seems plausible that the age-at-first-birth coefficients

may be affected by our sample selection, since from Table 2 there are clear

differences in the proportion of women working across age-at-first-birth

categories.   (This proportion varies from 53 percent among the late

childbearers to 86 percent among the childless.) This difference may be

due to reservation wages varying systematically by womens' age at first

birth, so that late childbearers have higher reservation wages, and

childless women lower reservation wages, than earlier childbearers.25 If

so, then we would expect equations estimated with the complete population

(i.e., not conditional on working in 1982) to exhibit larger differences in

wages between early childbearers and the childless, and smaller differences

between the early childbearers and the later childbearers, than we observed

in earlier tables.

     To study the influence of selectivity on our wage equation estimates,

we re-estimated specification (2) in Table 3 -    - where education, but not

experience and tenure are included --   using   a maximum-likelihood procedure

for the two-equation model suggested in Heckman (1979)26 In column (1) of




25Reservations wages would follow this pattern if the presence of children
(and especially young children) raised the opportunity cost of market time
for women.

26Experience and tenure were not included in the wage equation or the probit
equation for working in our selection-corrected estimations. Tenure could
not be included, since it is zero if and only if the woman is not working,
while past labor market experience is very likely to be correlated with


                                20
Table 6, we present estimates from a model where several variables are

included as determinants of working status (husbands income and

unemployment, alimony and child support, and several family background

variables) but are assumed not to belong in the wage equation

specification. Compared to Table 3, these results suggest that --

consistent   with our expectations - -   the   27+ effect was overstated in our

earlier estimations, while the childless effect was understated; but the

change in the coefficients due to the selection correction is not very

large. Since it is also possible to correct for selectivity without

imposing the restriction that the additional variables (mentioned above) be

excluded from the wage equation we re-estimated our selection model

without imposing these restrictions.27 These alternative estimates are

presented in column (2). In contrast to the previous results, with this

specification the 27+ coefficient estimate increases while the childless

coefficient drops, relative to the least-squares estimates, and the changes

are larger than observed in column (1). However, there are two reasons to

prefer column (1) and the conclusion that selectivity is not important to

the relationships we observe between wages and fertility timing: one, the

likelihood-ratio statistic (x2—14, with 13 degrees of freedom) for testing

the exclusion restrictions in column (1) is not significant; and, two, the

positive sign of the error correlation in column (1) is more plausible.28




the error term in the probit equation for currently working.
271n this specification, identification comes from the nonlinearity
associated with the assumption of bivariate normality for the error terms.
28The negative correlation coefficient found in specification (2) suggests
that low-wage women are more likely to be working than high-wage women, all
else the same. Given that exogenous income variables are included in the
probit equation, this seems unlikely.

following family backound variables are included in both equations husband's income and weeks husband spent
unemployed (both set to zero for unmarried women); the sum of income fro. alimony and child support (set to zero
for never married women); father's education; mother's education; naber of siblings; a dummy variable equal
to one if the respondent's mother worked when respondent was age ii; a dummy variable equal to• one if the
respondent lived with both a father and a mother at age 14; and dummy variables corresponding to each of these
variables, equal to one when the variable was missing (in which case the variables were set equal to zero).
In columns (1) and (3) these variables were excluded from the wage equation.

v.   fl Relationship   Between Human çpjtal an   Fertility   Timing

     The results in the previous section indicate that wages are higher for

delayed childbearers because they have greater accumulation of observable

proxies for human capital. As mentioned, this is consistent with our model

of joint human capital and fertility timing decisions, In this section, we

explore the alternative possibility that the correlation between human

capital and fertility timing is spurious, in the sense that human capital

and timing appear to be related because both are primarily determined by
                                      29
the family background of the woman.

     We would like to be able to disentangle the structural relationship

between timing and human capital, but the exclusion restrictions necessary

to identify such a model appear to be so arbitrary that an interpretation

of the results as valid structural estimates would be highly dubious.

Instead, we focus on the equilthrium" relationship between fertility

timing and human capital. In particular, we consider whether the positive

relationships between age at first birth and the human capital variables in

Table 2 are to any extent due to unobserved heterogeneity associated with

family background. We estimate regressions of education, experience, and

tenure on the same set of age-at-first-birth dummy variables used earlier.

We then add an extensive set of family background variables available in

the NLS.30 We do not assert that these variables capture all sources of




29Lundberg and Plotnick (1989), McCrate (1989), and Ceronimus and Korenman
(1990) have considered this possibility for education.
30Ceronimus and Korenjuan (1990) take this a step further by looking at

                                 22
unobserved heterogeneity. Indeed, if we find that the inclusion of these

variables partially reduces the association between fertility timing and

human capital, we would have to allow for the possibility that a more

complete set of variables could explain the entire relationship. However,

if we find no diminution in fertility timing effects once we control for

background, it seems more reasonable to conclude that heterogeneity does

not underlie the results.

     The first two columns of Table 7 report results with education as the

dependent variable. In column (1) the background variables are excluded,

while in column (2) they are included. When these variables are added, the

coefficients of the fertility timing dummy variables decline by 20 to 25

percent. Thus, we cannot decisively reject the view that the

education/fertility-timing differentials reflect unobserved heterogeneity

rather than human capital investment choices.

     In columns (3) and (4) we estimate regressions with experience as the

dependent variable, and with education included as an independent variable.

The equation is identified by assuming that the errors of the education and

experience equations are uncorrelated.31 in the equation for experience in

column (4), we also add the early wage residual, to allow for the

possibility that delayed childbearers accumulate more experience because

they start off with (and possibly continue to have) higher wages. The




differences in schooling completion, conditional on whether or not a teen
birth occurred, for a sample of siblings. By looking at within-family
differences, they may be able to control more thoroughly for differences in
family background and other sources of heterogeneity.
31
  With this restriction, our two-equation model follows the classical
recursive-system form. Qualitatively similar results were found using
reduced-form experience equations, although the changes in the coefficient
estimates when the age-at-first-birth variables are added are more
difficult to interpret in this case.

of these variables, equal to one when the variable was missing fin which case the variables were set equal to
zero).
addition of the early wage residual and the family background variables

leaves the estimated age-at-first-birth effects on experience unaltered.

In columns (5) and (6) we use tenure rather than experience as the

dependent variable; with tenure, inclusion of family background and the

early wage residual reduces the 27+ and childless coefficient estimates by

10 percent or less.

     We are therefore quite comfortable concluding that heterogeneity

related to family background does not explain the estimated experience and

tenure differences associated with fertility timing. Our theoretical model

of the relationship between fertility timing and human capital investment

offers an explanation of these differences. It may also partially explain

the correlation between education and fertility timing, although our

results suggest that this empirical relationship is at least partly due to

heterogeneity associated with family background characteristics.



V. Summary and Conclusions

     This paper has developed a model of a woman's optimal human capital

investment behavior over the life cycle conditional on her preferences over

the timing of her first birth. In the context of this model we show that

late childbearers will tend to invest mare heavily in human capital than

early childbearers. Our model also suggests that women with higher initial

wages will choose to delay their childbearing more. Our empirical analysis

explores the validity of these theoretical linkages between fertility

timing and the wages that women earn while in their late 20's and 30's.

Fertility timing is strongly associated with differences in wages, as well

as differences in education, experience and tenure, The wage differences

are largely explained by difference in these latter variables, which appear



                                24
to be quite good proxies for human capital. We find that the differences

in the human capital proxies with respect to age at first birth can be only

partly attributed to underlying heterogeneity. Thus, the human capital

differences seem to explain an important component of the overall

relationship between labor market outcomes and fertility timing.

    We wish to emphasize that our results are consistent with the human

capital hypothesis, but cannot be said decisively to confirm this

hypothesis. In fact, what may be a stronger test of our theory - -   that   the

usual human capital proxies represent greater investment for delayers -     - is
given   little support by the evidence. Still, our model does provide a

unified explanation of the relationships we observe between human capital

and fertility timing. We take it as a challenge for future research to

develop and test alternative, encompassing models that also explain these

empirical relationships.

Notation:

     —   present    value of lifetime income for a woman who invests in human

          capital
Y — present         value of lifetime income for a woman who does not invest in
         human capital
w — wage received at beginning of work career
T — point in time at which woman bears her first (and only) child
r        length of period spent out of the labor force after childbirth
R — time of retirement
s —      growth rate of (real) wages due to investment in human capital
q —      growth rate in wages due to general wage growth
r —      discount   rate

Assumptions:

    (i) all women are identical (in terms of productivity-related
        characteristics) ac the start of their working career;

    (ii) all women work from time 0 to time R, except for the period of
         length r following childbirth.   r is the same for all women; in
         particular it does not depend on T.

    (iii) all women have identical discount rates;

    (iv) all women have the option of investing in one type of human capital
         by paying C (at time 0) and receiving a higher growth rate of their
         wage over time, with the difference in the growth rate of wages
         between investors and non-investors equaling s,

    (v) a woman's lifetime utility depends only on the present value of her
        lifetime income and the age at which she has her first child, i,e.
        U—U(Y,T), with ÔU/8Y>O and 9U/3TcO. In particular, we assume IJ—Y-aT,
        with a>0.


A. Fertility Timing Decisions

      (1) Optimal timing for human capital investors

     From text equation (1), we know that the first order condition for a
utility extreaun conditional on a woman investing in human capital is:


          ME(T) -          (s+q-r)T[1(q-r)TJ    a   .    (Al)
Note that if q<r, the optimal timing is always T*O. For there to be an
interior solution for T*, it is necessary that (Al) represent the
conditions for a maximum and not a minimum, This will be the case if


                                        26
                3MB1(T)/BT —       w(s+q)e+                  T[1(r)Tj <
    i.e.        if s+qcr. If s+q>r, then either T*O or T*R-r.
               Assuiiiing s+clcr, we have the following description of T* for investors:


                                                                               a
                   —o                                             if                        t       1



                         1                                                         a
        T* —                                                      if 1 >                        >
           I        (s+q-r)      log
                                        [1(q-r)rj                             1(q-r)r]

                   — R-c                                          if (s+qr)(R-r)

The condition for T*0 is that MB(O)a; the condition for T*4tr                                           is that
MB(R-r)a                 Note that 8T*/BaO              i.e.,      the lower the preference for early
childbearing the longer the delay before first birth.
           If s+q>r, then the woman chooses to delay until R-r as long as


J    M31(s)ds            a(R-r). This leads to                   the   optimal timing decision:
    0


                                                    a                       (s+q-r)(F.-t)   - 1
                     —       0         if                              >
                                            w[l-e- r)r                       (s+q-r)(R-r)
               I
                     —       R-r        otherwise.

The upper boundary for T* will hold for lower values of a. ENotice that
                                   e(5_r17) -                1
wher a_w[1.e(1aT]                                                  the woman is indifferent between
                                       (s+q-r) (R-r)
choosing           T*_O or       T*Rr, since the utility of both choices is equal.]

        (2)     Optimal      timing for non-investors
The first-order              condition for a utility extremuxu (text equation (2)) is

                                            —   a                          (A.2)

The     second-order condition for a maxjuj is satisfied if:
                                                        27
                                                 <

which holds under the assumption q<r. The description of the age at first
birth choice is:


                                                                             a
            —O                                              if                                 1

                                                                         w[ 1- e -
                                                                                       r) r

                                                                                               a
          — R-r                                                   (q-r)(R-r)



As with T* 3T*/3as0.                 The condition for T*O is the same as for T*—O
(assuming s+qcr); however, T*Rr is less likely than Tt_R-r. The
expression for the difference in optimal fertility times between
investors and non-investors (assuming an interior solution for both) is:

                             -s                             a
    T*T* —                                      log                              > C
     I N
                      (s+q-r)(q-r)                     w[l-e
                                                                (q-r)r   I




so that investors will wait longer until their first birth. In addition,
Tt_R.r is more likely than T*Rr. which also supports the idea that
investors are more likely to delay. It also follows that o(Tt-T)/aa<O. so
that changes in timing preferences have a larger effect on investors'
timing decisions than on non-investors'.



  B. Hwnan Capital Investment Decision

     Given that boundary solutions to the age at first birth decision are
possible, it is necessary that we analyze the investment decision under
several cases (corresponding to whether or not an investor or non-investor
would be at one or the other boundary). There are five separate cases that
are exhaustive of the possibilities. (Again, throughout this section we
will assume that q.cr). Under each case, we derive the following: one, the
conditions under which the case holds; and two, an expression for the
difference in the indirect utilities V—V(w,q,r,a,s,C), j—I,N    between                            ,



investors and non-investors. The discussion assumes that the only
characteristic that varies across women is the value for a in the utility
function.

           N
                   —                                                           C0
                         (s+q-:)(q-r)
                                                                                        -



                                                  log[           5(q.)]


   Case (4): Tt_R-r ; OCrR-r


       This can happen under one of two sets of conditions:

                                                                                 a
           (A) if s+cj<r                      and (-r)(Rr)

                                                                                 a
  or       (B)           if s+q>r             and                                             c 1


                                                            30
           The difference in indirect utilities is:
                                                                        W
      v -v —                        (s+q-r)(R-r)1              -
       I       14
                        (s+q-r)L                           J           (q-r)
                              a                       a
                        -
                                      1-log                                 -   a(R-r)   -   C.
                            (q-r)


Again, lower values for a will be associated with a greater likelihood of
investment in human capital, since:


     (V i-v )                 1                   a
                        —            log                           -    (R-r) C 0.
       8a                   (q-r)



      Case (5): 9—R-r ; T—R-r

                                                                                  [(q-r)(R-r)1

Conditional on this case holding, the likelihood of investing does not
depend on a.
     Combining cases where appropriate, it follows that there will exist a
single value for aa* such that women with a>a* will choose nor to invest
in human capital while those women with asa* will choose to invest. The
Appendix table summarizes how the difference in indirett utilities is
affected by changes in a. The value for a such that V-V—O will be 8*;
with lower values of a making higher-numbered cases more likely, it follows
that as a is decreasing below a*, V-V must be nonnegative and
nondecreasing, while as a increases and is greater than a*,                                           must be

nonpositive and nonincreasing)    Lower values of a will thus be associated
with more delaying and greater investment in human capitaL

    For this reasoning to hold, it                        is   also necessary that V-V not experience
discrete downward jumps when moving from one case to another. Continuity
of V-V rules out any such discrete downward jumps. If s+qCr we know

utility of T*_0 and T*_Rr is the same at the point where the investor

continuous function of
a.
