Different Strokes for Different Folks: Experimental Evidence on the Effectiveness of Input
and Output Incentive Contracts for Health Care Providers with Varying Skills

                                          ABSTRACT

A central issue in designing performance incentive contracts is whether to reward the production
of outputs versus use of inputs: the former rewards efficiency and innovation in production, while
the latter imposes less risk on agents. Agents with varying levels of skill may perform better
under different contracts as well – more skilled workers may be better able to innovate, for
example. We study these issues empirically through an experiment enabling us to observe and
verify outputs (health outcomes) and inputs (adherence to recommended medical treatment) in
Indian maternity care. We find that both output and input incentive contracts achieved
comparable reductions in post-partum hemorrhage rates, the dimension of maternity care most
sensitive to provider behavior and the largest cause of maternal mortality. Interestingly, and in
line with theory, providers with advanced qualifications performed better and used new strategies
under output incentives, while under input incentives, providers with and without advanced
qualifications performed equally.

1. INTRODUCTION

         Performance incentives have long been used to correct a range of principal-agent problems

(Jensen and Murphy 1990, Hall and Liebman 1998, Lazear 2000, Roland 2004, Rosenthal,

Fernandopulle et al. 2004). A central issue in the design of performance incentives is whether to

reward an agent’s use of inputs or instead to reward outputs directly (Khalil and Lawarree 1995,

Prendergast 2002, Raith 2008, Prendergast 2011). 1 A key underlying assumption in models of

output incentive contracts is that workers know the production function, and if correctly

incentivized, can find the optimal combination of inputs to produce a given level of output.

However, if workers have low levels of human capital or skills, this assumption might be

untenable, leading to suboptimal input choices. Alternatively, agents’ knowledge of the production

function is less relevant for them to be rewarded according to input use (following explicit

guidelines given by better-informed principals). But an important drawback of input incentive

contracts is that highly skilled agents might be penalized if they take advantage of local contextual

information that might be relevant when choosing optimal input combinations to achieve desired

outputs.

         In this paper, we study input and output incentive contracts for maternal health care in India

– and the ways in which health providers with varying levels of skill respond to them – through a

field experiment. The production of maternal and neonatal health is complex, and in India, there

is considerable scope for improvement in performance and substantial variation in health

providers’ human capital. We randomly assign maternal health care providers to two treatment

arms and a control arm. Providers in treatment arms were given incentive contracts rewarding


1
 The decision depends on a variety of considerations, including the costs of monitoring inputs relative to outputs; the
degree of risk aversion of agents relative to principals; the riskiness of the output measure; the degree to which
productivity is heterogeneous across agents; the extent of distortions due to multi-tasking; and the feasibility of
principals dictating inputs to agents (Lazear 1986, Baker 2002, Prendergast 2002)



                                                          3
performance either for input use (adherence to guidelines for best practices) or production of

outputs (good maternal and neonatal health – low levels of post-partum hemorrhage, sepsis, pre-

eclampsia, or neonatal death). We also study how responses to performance contracts vary by

levels of skills by comparing performance of providers with advanced medical training to those

with basic medical training. We focus on providers’ implementation of new strategies in the two

contracts and how the effect of these innovations varies by providers’ skill level.

       We conducted the experiment in rural areas of Karnataka, an Indian state with poor levels

of maternal and neonatal health in 2012 - 2014. Karnataka’s maternal mortality rate (MMR) was

144 deaths per 100,000 live births, and its neonatal and infant mortality rates were 25 and 31 per

1,000 live births, respectively (NHM 2013, Mony, Jayanna et al. 2015). The top three causes of

maternal mortality are post-partum hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, and sepsis, and the major risk

factors for neonatal mortality are infections (sepsis and tetanus, for example), pre-term births, and

birth asphyxia. Policy efforts to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes have long focused

on promoting childbirth in medical facilities (rather than in private homes), where many of these

causes can – in principle – be prevented or managed. However, despite rapidly rising institutional

delivery rates (reaching 94.3% in 2015-16) (Government of India 2016), poor maternal and

neonatal health outcomes persist because of low quality maternal health care in medical facilities

(NRHM 2015).

       The quality of public services such as health and education in developing countries is

generally low (Chaudhury, Hammer et al. 2006, Das, Holla et al. 2012, Das and Hammer 2014,

Mohanan, Vera-Hernández et al. 2015, Das, Holla et al. 2016), and the use of performance

incentives is increasingly widespread (see Finan, Olken, and Pande (2015) and Miller and Babiarz

(2014) for reviews). Output incentives are more common in the education sector (Lavy 2002,




                                                  4
Glewwe, Ilias et al. 2010, Muralidharan and Sundararaman 2011, Behrman, Parker et al. 2015),

while incentives based on service delivery indicators such as institutional deliveries, delivery of

prenatal care, vaccinations, and healthcare utilization are typically used in the health sector

(Basinga, Gertler et al. 2011, Soeters, Peerenboom et al. 2011, Miller, Luo et al. 2012, Gertler and

Vermeersch 2013, Ashraf, Bandiera et al. 2014, Gertler, Giovagnoli et al. 2014, Miller and Babiarz

2014, Olken, Onishi et al. 2014, Celhay, Gertler et al. 2015, Dupas and Miguel 2016, Sherry,

Bauhoff et al. 2017). 2,3,4 The predominance of input incentive contracts in the health sector – an

environment in which there is often considerable scope for innovation using local/contextual

information 5 – underscores the importance of empirical research comparing contractual bases in

health.

          On average, we find that providers in both the input and output contract arms achieved

similar improvements in maternal health, reducing rates of post-partum hemorrhage (PPH – the

leading cause of maternal mortality both in India and globally) by approximately 21 percent.

Performance on other dimensions of maternal and neonatal care (pre-eclampsia, sepsis, and

  There have been few efforts to directly reward health outcomes in developing countries. Two recent exceptions in
China and India study interventions outside the medical care system, focusing on childhood malnutrition. Primary
school principals in China, who were offered performance incentives for reducing anemia, were able to reduce anemia
prevalence by 25% by the end of the academic year (Miller, Luo et al. 2012, Luo, Miller et al. 2015). In India, Singh
(2015) found that frontline workers in India’s Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program who were
offered high levels of incentives were able to reduce severe malnutrition by 6.3 percentage points. The Plan Nacer
program in Argentina introduced performance incentives based on 10 indicators, of which two were outcomes (birth
weight and APGAR scores) and the remaining 8 were self reported / administrative service delivery indicators (Gertler,
Giovagnoli et al. 2014).
3
  Fritsche, Soeters, and Meessen (2014) report that the World Bank’s health results trust fund, which supports
performance based financing programs in health, had over 60 projects at various stages of development. Other
examples of performance incentives in developing countries include: (Basinga, Gertler et al. 2011, Peabody,
Shimkhada et al. 2011, Soeters, Peerenboom et al. 2011, Van de Poel, Flores et al. 2016)
4
  A recent high-profile health sector example is the Better Birth trial – a RCT promoting adherence to the “Safe
Childbirth Checklist” in rural India, finding some improvement in provision of inputs on the checklist but no
significant improvement in health outcomes (Semrau, Hirschhorn et al. 2017).

  See http://www.innovationsinhealthcare.org/ for examples of efforts that adopt novel approaches to improving
access to care and improving quality of health care.

neonatal survival) did not change in either contract group relative to the control group. 6 In

achieving PPH reductions, providers in both groups used similar strategies (and similar input

combinations), focusing on stocking medicines that reduce bleeding after delivery, for example.

We also find little evidence that output contract providers developed or implemented novel

strategies on average to improve outcomes despite having the flexibility to do so. Moreover,

despite equivalent PPH reductions in both contract groups, input contract payments were

substantially smaller than output ones: average payments for input and output contracts were INR

13,850 and 56,812 respectively (about US $252 and $1033 in 2010). 7

         Health providers with varying levels of skills responded very differently to input- and

output-incentive contracts, however. High skill providers with advanced medical training in

obstetrics and gynecology in output contracts stated that they had implemented new health delivery

strategies and produced better health outcomes, reducing PPH rates by 9 percentage points relative

to lower skilled providers with basic medical training but no advanced qualifications. In contrast,

there were no significant differences in implementation of new strategies or health outcomes

between high and low skilled providers in the input contracts group.

         We also investigate two potential concerns with our study. First, because we reward

providers according to contracted outcomes among their patients, providers could potentially

manipulate the composition of their patients rather than improving their performance (selecting

patients more likely to experience good health outcomes, for example). To address this concern,


6
  Note that of the four outcomes, two (pre-eclampsia and neonatal mortality) were included primarily to address
concerns about multi-tasking (i.e., to minimize reductions in effort focused on these conditions). However,
providers can do relatively little to prevent pre-eclampsia, and there are relatively many non-medical factors that
contribute to neonatal mortality.
7
  Our incentive contracts were not specifically designed to achieve identical levels of outcomes, since the underlying
production function was unknown. The identical levels of performance in the two treatment arms is only a convenient
accident that now enables us to directly compare the cost to the principal of these two types of contracts. However,
since we do not observe providers’ responses across a full range of rates for rewards, we are unable to draw inferences
about efficiency of the two contract structures.



                                                          6
incentive contracts were explicitly structured to be nullified if providers diverted risky patients,

and we collected population surveillance data to test for patient selection; we do not find evidence

of providers in treatment arms referring high risk patients away to other hospitals. Second, a

natural concern with performance incentives is the possibility of “multitasking,” or the diversion

of effort from unrewarded outcomes to rewarded ones (Holmstrom and Milgrom 1991, Prendergast

1999, Mullen, Frank et al. 2010). To minimize the possibility of effort diversion, our incentive

contracts covered all major inputs and outputs involved in maternity care including neonatal

health, and maternity care was deliberately chosen as a relatively narrow area of medical practice. 8

        Our paper makes two key contributions to existing literature.                         First, because we

purposefully designed our study to observe and verify both input use (beyond what is ordinarily

possible in real-world settings) and outputs, we are able to test the effectiveness of input and output

incentive contracts. 9 While there is a wide theoretical literature on this topic (Jensen and Murphy

1990, Holmstrom and Milgrom 1991, Khalil and Lawarree 1995, Hall and Liebman 1998,

Prendergast 1999, Lazear 2000, Prendergast 2002, Laffont and Martimort 2009, Prendergast

2011), the empirical literature that explores the relative effectiveness of contracting on inputs vs.

outputs remains thin. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to empirically compare

the performance of agents under input and output contracts in a health care setting. Second, we

study the important role of provider training and skill in differential behavioral responses to each

type of contract. By focusing on how agents’ performance varies by level of human capital, we




8
  The restricted scope of pregnancy and maternity care was also a rationale for selecting obstetric providers for our
study. Although obstetric care providers typically refer neonatal care to pediatricians, many of the providers in our
sample are the only healthcare providers in their area. Hence we include neonatal health outcomes in the contracts to
minimize concerns of multitasking.
9
  We collect detailed information on inputs, using 48 indicators for five key domains of medical care delivered to
mothers and their infants throughout pregnancy, delivery, and post-natal care.

extend the growing literatures on the impact of performance incentives and optimal contracts

(Callen, Gulzar et al. 2015).

         The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides a simple conceptual

framework of input and output contracts, followed by details of the study design, data collection,

and analysis in Section 3. Section 4 presents results, including mechanisms that might explain our

findings, and Section 5 concludes.


2. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

         In this section we outline a basic principal-agent framework to elucidate the trade-offs

between input and output contracts and the role played by agent skill. In our set-up, a principal

(health authority) hires an agent (health care provider) to maximize health, 𝑦𝑦, net of monetary costs

paid to the agent, 𝑤𝑤. A health care provider produces health according to: 𝑦𝑦 = ℎ(𝜃𝜃1 𝑒𝑒1 , 𝜃𝜃2 𝑒𝑒2 , 𝜀𝜀),

where 𝑒𝑒1 and 𝑒𝑒2 are inputs chosen by the provider; 𝜃𝜃1 and 𝜃𝜃2 are productivity shifters that vary

across providers; and 𝜀𝜀 is a random component with cumulative distribution function 𝐺𝐺𝜀𝜀 , which is

strictly positive for all values of 𝜀𝜀. The health production function ℎ(∙) is increasing in all of its

arguments and strictly concave. The provider’s objective is to maximize utility from

payments , 𝑈𝑈(𝑤𝑤) , net of input costs, 𝑣𝑣1 (𝑒𝑒1 ) + 𝑣𝑣2 (𝑒𝑒2 ) ,       where 𝑈𝑈 ′ (∙) > 0, 𝑈𝑈′′(∙) < 0, 𝑣𝑣 1′ (∙) >

0, 𝑣𝑣2′ (∙) > 0, 𝑣𝑣1 ′′(∙) > 0, 𝑣𝑣2 ′′(∙) > 0.

         We assume that there are two type of providers, H and L, with high and low levels of

medical training (qualifications) corresponding to high and low levels of (clinical) skills. The

proportion of low skill providers among all providers is 𝜋𝜋. Low skilled providers believe that the

health production function is 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 = ℎ(𝜃𝜃1𝐿𝐿 𝑒𝑒1 , 𝜃𝜃2𝐿𝐿 𝑒𝑒2 , 𝜀𝜀), with 𝜃𝜃1𝐿𝐿 ≠ 𝜃𝜃1 and 𝜃𝜃2𝐿𝐿 ≠ 𝜃𝜃2 . In other words,

low skill providers have incorrect beliefs about the productivity shifters. Alternatively, high skill




                                                          8
providers hold correct beliefs – that is, 𝜃𝜃1𝐻𝐻 = 𝜃𝜃1 and 𝜃𝜃2𝐻𝐻 = 𝜃𝜃2 . We also assume that the distribution

of 𝜀𝜀 as well as those of 𝜃𝜃1 and 𝜃𝜃2 are independent of provider skill. 10

         We assume that both input choices (𝑒𝑒1, 𝑒𝑒2 ) and output (𝑦𝑦) are verifiable. Principals know

the distribution of productivity shifters, 𝐹𝐹𝜃𝜃1 ,𝜃𝜃2 , but they cannot make contracts with agents

contingent on the values of these productivity shifters. In other words, principals cannot take

advantage of local/contextual information, reflected in 𝜃𝜃1 and 𝜃𝜃2 , when writing contracts. Unlike

the standard setting in which a contract can be made fully contingent on agents’ production

functions, this restriction implies that input incentive contracts will not necessarily be optimal

(even if inputs are verifiable) and output incentive contracts can be more efficient (Khalil and

Lawarree 1995, Prendergast 2002, Prendergast 2011).

         An input incentive contract is a function 𝑤𝑤(𝑒𝑒1 , 𝑒𝑒2 ) that remunerates providers according to

input levels. The principal will choose 𝑤𝑤(𝑒𝑒1, 𝑒𝑒2 ) such that

                                   𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 ∬ ℎ(𝜃𝜃1 𝑒𝑒1 , 𝜃𝜃2 𝑒𝑒2 , 𝜀𝜀) ∂𝐹𝐹𝜃𝜃1, 𝜃𝜃2 ∂𝐺𝐺𝜀𝜀 − 𝑤𝑤(𝑒𝑒1, 𝑒𝑒2 )

                                                                                                      �,
                               𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠: 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀{𝑒𝑒1,𝑒𝑒2 } [𝑈𝑈(𝑤𝑤(𝑒𝑒1 , 𝑒𝑒2 ) − 𝑣𝑣1 (𝑒𝑒1 ) − 𝑣𝑣2 (𝑒𝑒2 )] ≥ 𝑈𝑈

      � is the provider’s reservation utility. Implicitly, an input incentive contract is only feasible
where 𝑈𝑈

if the principal can observe input levels (𝑒𝑒1, 𝑒𝑒2 ). Note that the provider does not bear any financial

risk because payment is only contingent on input levels, which are completely under his/her

control. Also, both high and low skill providers will choose the same input levels because both

maximize the same function, 𝑈𝑈(𝑤𝑤(𝑒𝑒1 , 𝑒𝑒2 )) − 𝑣𝑣1 (𝑒𝑒1 ) − 𝑣𝑣2 (𝑒𝑒2 ), which is independent of health
                                                                                                                         11
outcomes produced – and hence their beliefs about the health production function.


10
   By way of example, our set-up assumes that the effect of a certain medicine is the same independently of being
prescribed by a high or low skill provider, but the two types of providers might differ in how effective they perceive
the medicine to be.
11
   This is true because we are assuming that providers are not altruistic. In other words, they will not provide additional,
unrewarded inputs that they know to be beneficial if not compensated for doing so.



                                                               9
Consequently, input-based payments allow the principal to circumvent low skill providers’

incorrect beliefs about the productivity shifters. Under input incentive contracts, average health

outcomes, 𝑦𝑦 = ∬ ℎ(𝜃𝜃1 𝑒𝑒1 , 𝜃𝜃2 𝑒𝑒2 , 𝜀𝜀) ∂𝐹𝐹𝜃𝜃1 𝜃𝜃2 ∂𝐺𝐺𝜀𝜀 , are therefore also the same for high and low skill

providers.

          An output incentive contract is a function 𝑤𝑤(𝑦𝑦) that remunerates providers according to

health outcomes produced. In this case, a provider of type 𝑗𝑗 ∈ {𝐻𝐻, 𝐿𝐿} who wants to achieve average

implying that provider input choices (𝑒𝑒1 , 𝑒𝑒2 ) depend on their beliefs about their productivity

shifters (𝜃𝜃1 , 𝜃𝜃2 ).

          The model above assumes that both input choices and outputs are verifiable and allows us

to consider trade-offs between input- and output incentive contracts. On one hand, provider

remuneration under the output incentive contract, 𝑤𝑤(𝑦𝑦), is partly random and not completely under

the control of the agent. This risk introduces a distortion in the output incentive contract, requiring

principals to compensate agents for this risk. On the other hand, because principals (health

authorities) cannot take advantage of local/contextual information (reflected in 𝜃𝜃1 and 𝜃𝜃2 ) when

establishing contracts, an input incentive contract could lead some providers to choose inefficient

combinations of inputs (𝑒𝑒1 , 𝑒𝑒2 ). Output incentive contracts can circumvent this by allowing

providers to choose (𝑒𝑒1 , 𝑒𝑒2 ) according to their own productivity shifters (𝜃𝜃1 , 𝜃𝜃2 ).




                                                              10
         In the output contract case, high skill providers, who hold correct beliefs about the

productivity shifters (𝜃𝜃1 , 𝜃𝜃2 ) can make more efficient input choices than with input incentive

contracts. The amount of inefficiency for low skill providers in our model depends on how

incorrect their beliefs about 𝜃𝜃1𝐿𝐿 , and 𝜃𝜃2𝐿𝐿 are. It therefore remains possible that input incentive

contracts deliver more efficient input choices among low skill providers. 12

         A testable implication of our conceptual framework is that health outcomes will depend on

provider skills under output incentive contracts (with better health outcomes for more skilled

providers), but that health outcomes will be independent of provider skill with input incentive

contracts. Moreover, we expect higher skilled providers under output contracts to tailor their input

choices to their local/contextual information.



3. STUDY DESIGN, INCENTIVE CONTRACT STRUCTURE, DATA COLLECTION, AND ESTIMATION

3.1. Design and Implementation of the Experiment

         Our experiment and data collection activities spanned two years, from late 2012 to late

2014. 13 The timeline of the project is shown in Figure 1, with details about when data were

collected indicated at the bottom, and timing of the intervention visits indicated at the top.

3.1.a. Eligibility of providers

         Using multiple data sources, we identified the potential universe of private obstetric care

providers for inclusion in our study. The first source was data collected by the Karnataka state

government on all private sector doctors who provided obstetric care (i.e., those who cared for

pregnant mothers and conducted deliveries) in rural areas – at least 10 km away from district


12
   Ultimately, the relative efficiency of input- or output incentive contracts depends on a variety of parameters
including the amount of risk, providers’ degree of risk aversion, the variability in productivity shifters ,the proportion
of low skill providers, and how misinformed low skill providers are.
13
   This study was approved by Duke University Office of Human Subjects Research (Pro00031046).

headquarters. Second, during field visits by our enumerators to verify these providers, our field

teams located additional providers who were inadvertently missed in the government survey and

conducted interviews with them to confirm eligibility. Further eligibility for providers’ inclusion

in our study was based on conducting at least two deliveries per month, practicing primarily in

OBGYN clinics, willingness to participate in the study (including responding to surveys and

signing the incentive contracts), and continuing to practice in the same location over the study

period. 14

3.1.b. Randomization

         The set of providers that we randomize come from the two different sources mentioned

above. Of the 120 eligible providers in the data from the state government, using simple

randomization, 38 providers were assigned the input group, 40 to the output group, and 42 to the

control group. Other eligible providers, who were inadvertently left out in the government-funded

survey and identified by our field team during fieldwork, were randomized as follows: once the

provider was confirmed to meet all eligibility criteria, the field team would call our project office

to assign the provider to a study arm. This allocation was done according to a list of sequential

unique identifiers, which were randomized prior to fieldwork (this list was unknown to field

enumerators). Using this procedure, 2 providers were allocated to the input group, 13 to the output

group, and 5 to the control. 15

         In all, 140 providers met all eligibility criteria and signed the incentive contracts in our

study (note that the control group also signed a contract). Of these, 5 providers declined to




14
   Providers working in large multi-specialty hospitals were not included in our sample. We targeted smaller facilities
in order to ensure that providers would have sufficient agency over their facilities’ health provision.
15 Note that we could not ensure an equal number of providers across arms because we did not know how many

providers the field team would find, and we did not want to have a predictable sequence so that our field
enumerators could anticipate the treatment allocation of a potential provider.



                                                          12
participate over the course of the study, and were classified as attritors from the study (2 from the

input incentive group and 3 from the control group). Our final analytical sample thus includes 135

providers: 53 providers in outputs arm, 38 providers in inputs arm, and 44 providers in control

arm. 16 Table 1 shows the number of providers who were identified in sampling and the attrition.

        Table 2 reports summary statistics for our final sample of providers used for analysis. Just

over half of providers were female. Nearly 60 percent had advanced qualifications in obstetrics or

a related field – we refer to this group as “MBBS plus”. Of the remaining, over half had either

basic training in allopathic medicine, equivalent to an MD in USA or comparable training in

Ayurvedic medicine – corresponding to MBBS and BAMS degrees respectively (Mahal and

Mohanan 2006) .The average provider had been practicing for nearly two decades. Joint tests of

orthogonality show there are no significant differences in provider demographics between the three

study arms (Appendix Table A1). The attrition of five providers across the three study groups was

not statistically different at the 5% level (Appendix Table A2).

3.2. Study Arms / Contract Types

        The three contracts (control, input incentive contract, and output incentive contract) were

designed to be as comparable as possible other than the basis of payment. Providers were first

introduced to the contracts during visits between February and April 2013 (Figure 1 shows our

study timeline). During these initial visits, all providers (including those in the control group)

were given copies of letters of support from the state government and a full set of reference

materials including guidelines for maternity care from the World Health Organization (WHO) and

Government of India (GoI). 17 These letters also provided a broad overview of what participation


16
   Further details on enrollment of providers and sample sizes at each stage are included in the pre-analysis plan
(https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/179).
17
   A complete set of guidelines was also provided to the providers on a CD. If a provider was unable to access the
materials on the CD, she was offered the option of having the hard copy versions sent to her at no charge.



                                                       13
in the study would entail, including future meetings and payments to compensate participating

providers for their time to compile patient lists and complete surveys.

       Each provider was also given a copy of his/her randomly assigned contract. Each treatment

group contract explained the specific basis by which the provider would be rewarded at the end of

the study period, including details of reward calculations and payments (Appendix 1 shows each

type of contract and accompanying WHO guidelines). The contracts specified that the final

payment will be made only at the end, and there were no interim incentive payments.

       Input and output incentive contracts were designed to have equal maximum level of

payments. Payment levels were also set to ensure that the project could meet payment obligations

in the event that all providers achieved the maximum performance level. The resulting contracts

offered providers the potential to earn up to approximately INR 150,000 (about US $2,700 at the

time of the contract – slightly more than 15 percent of a specialist doctor’s salary in Karnataka).

       The control arm contract was designed to inform providers about our study of maternal and

child health, to provide the same WHO and GoI guidelines, and to require control providers to sign

an ‘agreement’ confirming their willingness to participate in a study of maternal and neonatal

health. The control contract did not mention reward payments made to other providers in the study.

       Enumerators were trained to ensure that the providers fully understood their contracts,

including basis and structure of incentive payments, the potential reward payments possible for

strong performance, and the fact that providers would not lose money by participating in the study,

regardless of their performance. Contracts also specified that providers’ performance on rewarded

outcomes would be evaluated using data collected from household surveys with their patient




                                                 14
population. 18 Finally, providers in all three arms were offered INR 2,500 (about US $45) at each

visit as compensation for the time required to participate in the study. This small payment also

aimed to develop credibility for future reward payments.

3.2.a. Output Contract Structure

        Output incentive payments were offered for achieving low rates of four adverse health

outcomes (post-partum hemorrhage (PPH), pre-eclampsia, sepsis, and neonatal mortality) during

the study period among a provider’s patients. PPH, pre-eclampsia, and sepsis are the three leading

causes of maternal mortality globally, accounting for 27%, 14%, and 11% of all maternal deaths

(respectively) between 2003-09 (Say, Chou et al. 2014). However, unlike PPH and sepsis, there is

little that healthcare providers can do to prevent pre-eclampsia – a hypertensive disorder that

occurs during pregnancy.           Similarly, only 10.5% of neonatal mortality is attributed to

complications during childbirth (Liu, Oza et al. 2015). As a result, we did not anticipate marked

incentive effects on pre-eclampsia or neonatal mortality (but included them to minimize reductions

in effort focused on them – i.e., to mitigate multitasking).

        Ideally, we would have set the reward levels for each health outcome optimally: the

rewards that maximize the principal’s utility subject to the participation constraint of the provider.

However, this requires detailed knowledge of the production, utility, and cost functions, which

were unknown when designing the study. Our approach (described below) therefore resembles one

of a cautious policy maker, ensuring that total incentive payments do not exceed a fixed budget

constraint.




18
  To avoid possible collusion or gaming, information about specific survey questions used to calculate rewards was
not shared with anyone outside of the study team, including the enumerators when they first met providers to
implement the contracts.



                                                       15
         For neonatal mortality, a provider would receive INR 15,000 unless one of their newborn

patients died. For each of the other three maternal health outcomes (PPH, Pre-eclampsia, and

Sepsis,), the reward payment for output i, 𝑃𝑃(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ), was a decreasing linear function of incidence rate

𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 , with payment increment 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 for incidence rates below a pre-established incidence rate ceiling

𝑥𝑥𝚤𝚤
���:

                                                             𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 − 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ),   𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ≤ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖
                                             𝑃𝑃(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ) = �
                                                                       0        ,   𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 > 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖

We set 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 equal to the pre-intervention average rates, which we estimated using existing data

from government surveys. To set levels of 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 , we first allocated the remaining available budget

for output contracts (after deducting payment for neonatal mortality) to each of the 3 outputs

equally. 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 for each output was then determined by dividing the available budget for that output

by the potential improvement for that output (i.e., the difference between the pre-intervention

average level of 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 and 0.05, which assumes providers would, on average, not be able to eliminate

negative health outcomes completely): 19

                                       (𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 − 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝)�

                                                                        (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 − 0.05)

The final reward payment for providers in the output group was then the sum of rewards for each

of the four outputs.




19
   For example, pre-intervention rates of post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) were estimated at 35 percent (𝑥𝑥̅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = 35)
in the study area. Providers could earn 𝛼𝛼𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = Rs. 850 (equivalent to about $17 at the time of the contract) for every
percentage point below 35 percent incidence of PPH in their patient population. If the rate of PPH measured in their
patient population over the study period was 25 percent, they would earn $170; if they were able to completely
eliminate PPH in their patient population, they would earn $595.



                                                                       16
3.2.b. Input Contract Structure

         Providers assigned to the input treatment arm were offered incentive payments for health

inputs provided to patients according to 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. 20

These inputs are categorized into five domains: pregnancy care, childbirth care, counseling for

postnatal maternal care, newborn care, and counseling for postnatal newborn care. 21 Analogous

to the structure of output incentives, for each domain i, the input reward payment 𝑃𝑃(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ) was

structured as an increasing linear function of the input level 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 – the share of measurable inputs for

appropriate care for domain 𝑖𝑖, averaged over the provider’s patients – with incremental payment

𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 above a pre-established performance floor 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 %:

                                                          𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 �𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 − 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 �, 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ≥ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖
                                          𝑃𝑃(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ) = �                                    .
                                                                     0       , 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 < 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖

As in the output contract case, 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 for inputs was calculated by dividing the available budget by the

projected range of improvements from the pre-intervention average rates to an average of 90%. 22

The final reward payment for each provider was the sum of rewards earned for performance in

each of the five domains of care.

3.2.c. Control Arm Contracts

         Providers assigned to the control arm received contract agreements that provided the same

information, guidelines, and participation payments as in the two incentive contract arms – but had

no payments related to performance. Control providers were also told that the project team would



20
   These were the most up-to-date guidelines at the time of the intervention.
21
   Details of the measurement of these health inputs are below and in Appendix 2: Calculation of Inputs and Outputs.
22
   For example, pre-intervention coverage of the inputs in the Childbirth Care domain was estimated at about 65
percent (𝑥𝑥𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ 𝐶𝐶𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 = 65) in the study area: patients receive 65% of appropriate childbirth care according to
WHO guidelines. Providers earn 𝛼𝛼𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = Rs. 750 (equivalent to about $15 at the time of the contract) for
every percentage point in coverage of these inputs above 65 percent. If 75 percent of a provider’s patients had received
appropriate level of inputs for the Childbirth Care domain, she would earn $150, and if she were able to provide this
level of care for 100% of her patients, she would earn $525.



                                                                 17
collect survey data from their patients and received the same follow-up visits as intervention arm

providers.

3.3. Data Collection, Household Sampling, and Measurement

         We collected data from providers through multiple interviews over the study period and

from households at end of the study period (Figure 1 shows details of timing of data collection and

intervention visits to providers). Through our provider surveys, we collected information about

providers’ medical practices, staffing, and infrastructure, as well as intended strategies for

improving quality of care and health outcomes.

         Additionally, we collected patient lists from providers to create our primary patient

sampling frame. A natural concern with this approach is that providers would have incentives to

selectively report only patients with relatively good performance indicators. To minimize this

concern, we also collected data from approximately 75 households (not used in this analysis) in

areas surrounding the clinic to ensure there were no cases with negative outcomes at the providers’

facilities but were not reported by providers, or that were inappropriately referred away. The

incentive contracts also clearly explained that any instances of patient list manipulation, either

through selective referrals or reporting, would nullify the contracts. 23

         Using patient lists, we then aimed to sample 25 women who had recently given birth at the

provider’s facility. 24 Enumerators collected the list of patients and a study team member managing



23
   See page 5 of sample contracts in Appendix 1 for exact language on selective referrals that would nullify contracts.
Using data collected from communities around the provider, we verified that there were no unusual patterns of referral
suggesting providers did not respond by selecting patients with better outcomes or selectively reporting by providers.
24
   Power calculations were conducted prior to the data collection. Estimated pre-intervention performance rates and
feasible improvement levels (i.e., target levels) were determined using existing data from government surveys and
calibrated through piloting with doctors in Karnataka and Delhi to ensure that they were locally appropriate. We
assumed 25 mothers per provider and an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.05. At the individual level, all five
categories for quality of care have at least 85 percent power to detect improvements that reach the target levels, with
the “Childbirth Care”, “Postnatal Maternal Care”, and “Postnatal Newborn Care” categories having at least 95 percent
power. Two of the four outputs, post-partum hemorrhage and pre-eclampsia, have at least 85 percent power to detect



                                                          18
the field project conducted random sampling of patients. In instances where there were fewer than

25 deliveries over the timespan of data collection, all listed patients were surveyed. These surveys

measured the four major health outcomes 25, input use in the five domains of maternity care, and

basic socio-demographic information. We aimed to interview every mother within approximately

2 weeks after she gave birth to minimize recall inaccuracy (Das, Hammer et al. 2012). In practice,

we conducted surveys with new mothers between 7-20 days after delivery, and also did a very

brief follow up with these mothers after 28 days after birth to assess the infant's status. In total, we

interviewed 2,895 new mothers. 26

        Measurement of health input use and outputs poses important challenges, especially in

developing country contexts where reliable administrative data on input use are not available.

Using providers’ reports of outcomes leads to concerns of gaming when incentives are tied to

performance. Furthermore, providers may not always be able to accurately identify some health

outcomes. For example, in the case of maternal health, evidence from studies comparing actual

blood loss to providers’ visual estimates show that providers tend to underestimate the amount of

blood loss by one third (Patel, Goudar et al. 2006).

        Given that we chose to measure health outcomes and health input use through household

surveys, we relied on two general criteria for selecting our specific measures (which we use both

for calculating incentive payments as well as for our empirical analysis). First, we chose questions

previously validated through past research published in the clinical literature (Stewart and Festin

1995, Filippi, Ronsmans et al. 2000, Stanton, Rawlins et al. 2013). Second, prior to our study, we


improvements to the target levels. Note that these calculations do not take into account additional precision gained
by including covariates.
25
   We collected data from household surveys about signs and symptoms for the health outcomes and used algorithms
described in the appendix to establish whether a woman had each adverse health outcome or not.
26
   Some providers conducted fewer than 25 deliveries over the data collection period, resulting in fewer than the
targeted 3,375 mothers (135 providers x 25 mothers). On average, we have data from 21.4 mothers per provider, with
an interquartile range of 17 to 26 mothers per provider.



                                                        19
conducted our own validation exercise. Specifically, we trained nurse enumerators to observe and

code health input use in real-time during labor and delivery for 150 deliveries in rural Karnataka.

Within two weeks after delivery, we then visited these new mothers and administered a set of

survey questions intended to measure the same health input use, as reported by the mother. We

then chose measures that performed well in our validation exercise as additional survey questions

for the project. 27

         Mothers in our sample were classified as having an adverse health outcome based on a

combination of her responses to relevant questions, following previous studies of the sensitivity

and specificity of responses to these questions for clinical evaluation of the incidence of these

outcomes (Stewart and Festin 1995, Filippi, Ronsmans et al. 2000, Stanton, Rawlins et al. 2013).

We evaluate inputs provided by each provider by measuring each provider’s adherence to WHO

guidelines. Given the criteria described above, we generated household survey questions that

women could plausibly answer and that related to the guidelines. The responses to these questions

were assigned a score of 1 if they adhered to the guidelines, and 0 otherwise. 28 A provider’s

performance in a particular domain was then the mean of these scores for all mothers who received

care from the provider, where higher scores reflect greater adherence to the guidelines and better

performance. For analysis of inputs within each domain, we aggregate the multiple measures into

a summary index following Anderson (2008). 29




27 Results from this validation study to be published in a separate manuscript, and available upon request.
28
   For example, if a woman answered affirmatively to the question, “Was your blood pressure checked during labor?”,
the question was assigned a “1”. Details about the specific questions used for each domain and how responses were
coded are included in the Appendix on Calculation of Inputs and Outputs, also available at
https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/179.
29 The Anderson index is calculated as a weighted mean of the standardized values of all inputs within each domain

(with variables re-defined so that higher values imply a better/more desirable outcome). The weights are calculated to
maximize the amount of information captured in the index, with highly correlated variables receiving less weight
(Anderson 2008).

3.4. Analysis

        We use the estimation strategy that we specified in our pre-analysis plan published in the

AEA RCT registry in December 2013 (prior to collecting any household-level data). To estimate

the effect of each type of incentive contract on health outputs and health input use, we regress

outcomes on dummy variables indicating treatment status with the following estimating equation:

                      𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑇𝑇𝑝𝑝 + 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃𝑝𝑝 + 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 + 𝑠𝑠𝑑𝑑 + 𝜆𝜆𝑒𝑒 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , (1)

where 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an outcome of interest (i.e. level of care – inputs – received or health outcomes) for

woman i who received care from provider p, located in district d, and was interviewed by

enumerator e, 𝑇𝑇𝑝𝑝 is a vector of provider-level treatment indicators, 𝑋𝑋𝑝𝑝 is a vector of baseline (pre-

contract) provider characteristics, 𝑍𝑍𝑖𝑖 is a vector of time-invariant household characteristics (such

as mother’s age, education status, religion, and birth history), and 𝑠𝑠𝑑𝑑 and 𝜆𝜆𝑒𝑒 represent district and

enumerator fixed effects (respectively). We also show estimates that do not condition on household

or provider characteristics, but only include enumerator and district fixed effects, as specified in

our pre-analysis plan. In all cases, we cluster standard errors at the provider level.

        Given that we test multiple hypotheses across two treatment arms, we report p-values

adjusted for multiple comparisons within each pre-specified family of hypotheses to control for

the Familywise Error Rate (using the free step-down re-sampling method described in Westfall

and Young (1993)) and across the two types of contracts. Following our pre-analysis plan, we

consider PPH, sepsis, and neonatal death as one family of health outcomes influenced by medical

care provided around the time of delivery (as opposed to care throughout pregnancy for pre-

eclampsia, which we test across two types of contracts). Similarly, for input use, we consider three




                                                          21
domains (childbirth care, postnatal maternal care, and newborn care) to be a family of outcomes

because these are all inputs provided at the time of delivery. 30

           As section 2 indicated, we expect health outcomes to vary according to a provider’s skills

under output incentive contracts, but to be independent of them under an input incentive contract.

To test this hypothesis, we augment regression (1) with an indicator for higher provider

qualification multiplied by each provider contract arm. 31


4. RESULTS

           In this section, we first report how our incentive contracts influenced the production of

health outputs and the provision of health inputs, investigate the mechanisms underlying these

results, and examine the relative costs of the two types of contracts. We then study how providers

with varying levels of qualifications and skills responded differently to each type of contract.

4.1. Health Outputs

           Table 3 reports estimates of how each incentive contract influences maternal and child

health outcomes. Our preferred (pre-specified) estimates from Equation 1, shown in even-

numbered columns, condition on provider and patient characteristics as well as district and

enumerator fixed effects (odd-numbered columns report estimates that condition only on district

and enumerator fixed effects). The levels of statistical significance indicated reflect p-values

adjusted for multiple comparisons within each family of hypotheses to control for the Familywise

30 Our pre-analysis plan also included the evaluation of other potential mechanisms through which incentive
contracts might influence outcomes. In a separate paper (Donato, Miller et al. 2017) we examined
heterogeneity of program impact as a function of personality traits. We focus attention in this paper on the
primary pre-specified analyses (on outputs and inputs).

         In both incentive contract groups, post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) rates declined by nearly

identical (and statistically indistinguishable) amounts relative to the control group. 32 Column 2

shows that input contract providers reduced PPH incidence among their patients by 8.4 percentage

points, while output contract providers reduced PPH incidence by 7.4 percentage points. Compared

to the control group mean (0.365), these reductions correspond to a 23% and 20% decline,

respectively. Both are also statistically significant after correcting for multiple comparisons:

adjusted p-values using the Westfall and Young (1993) step-down resampling method are 0.01 for

the input group and 0.031 for the output group (p-values with and without multiple comparison

corrections are reported in Appendix Table A3).

         We do not find statistically significant changes for other health outcomes after adjusting

for multiple comparisons. 33 This pattern of results is reasonable – in rural India, PPH is most

amenable to improvement through changes in provider behavior at the time of delivery (with the

use of drugs to control post-partum bleeding, for example, for which we find evidence in Section

4.2). Alternatively, among the four domains of health outcome, providers have the least control

over pre-eclampsia because it is a hypertensive disorder developed earlier during pregnancy – and

women generally seek antenatal care from other providers. Furthermore, the biological causes of

pre-eclampsia remain scientifically unclear, essentially making it impossible for providers to

predict and prevent this condition, but it can be better managed if detected earlier in the pregnancy

(Steegers, von Dadelszen et al. 2010, Mol, Roberts et al. 2016, Phipps, Prasanna et al. 2016). For

sepsis, a key preventive strategy (wearing gloves during delivery) was already practiced among

33
  As mentioned earlier, although providers can do little to prevent pre-eclampsia (a hypertensive disorder that occurs
during pregnancy) or neonatal mortality (almost 90% of which is attributed to causes other than childbirth
complications), we included them in output contracts to mitigate concerns of potential multitasking. Among the results
for pre-eclampsia and sepsis for input and output contracts, only the pre-eclampsia result is marginally significant (p
= 0.07) when not adjusting for multiple comparisons.

99% of control group providers, and prophylactic antibiotics are commonly used at high (and

inappropriate) rates in rural India, including Karnataka. 34

4.2. Health Input Use and Underlying Mechanisms

        Table 4 then reports estimates from Equation 1 for provision of health inputs. Because we

only find significant health improvements for PPH, we do not expect substantial improvements in

input use across all five domains of maternal and neonatal care. Column 6 shows that in the output

contract group, the postnatal maternity care index (which primarily reflects postnatal health

counseling to mothers shortly after delivery) rose by 0.0773 index points relative to the control

group; this estimate is statistically significant (unadjusted p-value = 0.033), but not at conventional

levels after correcting for multiple hypotheses testing (p=0.156) – see Appendix Table A4 for full

adjusted and unadjusted p-values. 35 There were no improvements in the five composite domains

of maternal and neonatal care in the input incentive contract group. (In Section 4.5, we discuss the

0.14 point decline in the postnatal newborn care counseling index shown for the output contract

group in Column 10, which we believe reflects a reduction in effort devoted to newborn care (i.e.,

‘multi-tasking’ (Holmstrom and Milgrom 1991, Prendergast 2011)).

        However, other than in postnatal maternity care, we do not observe significant

improvements for indices in other domains of care. This is probably because the indices aggregate

many inputs, only a subset of which directly influence PPH (those included in Active Management

of Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL), for example). 36 Although not pre-specified, we therefore


34
   The other clinical action listed in the guidelines given to providers is handwashing, but provider handwashing
behavior is not reliably observed by mothers or accompanying caregivers. Antibiotics are routinely overused in
clinical settings in India (Ganguly, Arora et al. 2011).
35
   The magnitude of the increase (0.0773) is not directly interpretable because the weights used to compute the index
change the scale (Anderson 2008) .
36
   Active Management of Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL) recommended by WHO guidelines also includes early cord
clamping, controlled traction of the umbilical cord, and trans-abdominal manual massage of the uterus (Urner,
Zimmermann et al. 2014). Abdominal massage was included in the 2009 guidelines from Government of India
(MOHFW 2009) and was also recommended by Am. Coll. of Obs. and Gyn. at the time (ACOG 2011). The 2012



                                                         24
directly examine changes in two inputs most closely related to PPH: parenteral oxytocic drugs

(whose administration is recommended universally for all mothers) and manual removal of

placenta (which reflects complications that could potentially be avoided with better care). 37

        The first two columns of Table 5 show estimates for providers’ stocking of parenteral

oxytocic drugs at their clinics. Consistent with our PPH results in Section 4.1, we find that

providers in both output and input contract groups were approximately 7 percentage points more

likely to maintain stocks of parenteral oxytocic drugs in their clinics (an increase of 25 percent

relative to the control group mean of 0.29). Consistent with this finding, Columns 3 and 4 also

show estimates of patients’ reported use of medicines to prevent bleeding, which are 6 percentage

points higher in both incentive contract groups relative to the control group (estimates are

statistically indistinguishable from each other with and without conditioning on various control

variables, but only statistically different from zero in Column 3). 38

        Additionally, a key corrective clinical action to prevent PPH when the placenta is not

delivered normally is manual placenta removal (Urner, Zimmermann et al. 2014). ATMSL, which

is recommended by WHO guidelines, minimizes the time required for normal delivery of an intact

placenta, so reductions in manual placenta removal can be interpreted as improvements in

maternity care related to PPH (Begley, Gyte et al. 2011). Column 8 of Table 5 shows a statistically

significant 7 percentage point decline in manual placenta removal in the output contract arm (26




revised guidelines from WHO no longer recommend cord traction or abdominal massage as standard practice
(Tunçalp, Souza et al. 2013).
37
   Within the WHO guidelines that our input contracts reward, a clinical action closely related to the prevention of
PPH – and recommended universally for all mothers – is the administration of medicines (parenteral oxytocic drugs),
which are effective in stopping post-delivery bleeding. Clinical actions not universally recommended – ones that are
clinically appropriate conditional on presence of a risk factor or manifestation of an adverse outcome, for example –
are more difficult to interpret if the conditions requiring them are preventable.
38
   This particular input is possibly measured with greater error than others because mothers and those accompanying
them during childbirth are unable to observe the specific types of drugs administered.

percent reduction), suggesting fewer instances in which corrective action was needed. 39 The

corresponding estimate in the input arm is less precise, but comparable in magnitude.

4.3. Relative Costs of Input and Output Contracts

        Given that our input and output incentive contracts produced statistically indistinguishable

improvements in maternal health, we next briefly compare the costs required to produce these

health benefits. Figures 2 and 3 show the distributions of incentive payments made to providers in

treatment arm. Ex post, the average payment was much higher in the output contract group

(INR56,812, or USD 1033) than in the input contract group (INR13,850, or USD 252). 40 In each

figure, we also construct counterfactual distributions that reflect hypothetical input contract

payments to output contract group providers (and vice versa). In general, for the specific contracts

that we study, payments for outputs are nearly four times as expensive as payments for inputs.

Importantly, this potentially reflects a substantial risk premium required by providers accepting

output payment contracts to compensate them for the risk that they are not rewarded for additional

effort exerted (because outputs are not fully under their control).

        In the setting of our study, the input contract was more efficient than the output incentive

contract because it delivered the same health outcomes at much lower cost for the principal.

However, it is important to note that this only applies to the input and output incentive contracts

studied here, and it is not generalizable to comparing other input and output contracts. For instance,

if the elasticity of an output with respect to the reward in the output contract is very low, a much

less generous output contract could have delivered similar health improvements at a smaller cost




39
   Although abdominal massaging is no longer a recommended best practice as per revised WHO guidelines, we also
see in Table 5 that providers in input contract arm were 7 percentage points (18 percent) more likely to massage the
mother’s abdomen relative to control arm, while providers in output contracts arm had no significant change.

to the principal. 41 Although we were unable to the experiment over a range of payment rates for

inputs and outputs, we note that other studies that experimented with different payment rates for

output contracts have found the relevant elasticity to be significant (Luo, Miller et al. 2015).

4.4. The Role of Skills in Provider Responses to Output and Input Incentive Contracts

         As our conceptual framework in section 2 suggests, we expect provider skills to play an

important role in determining the effectiveness (and relative effectiveness) of output and input

incentive contracts. With input incentive contracts, providers are paid to use explicitly-specified

inputs (“follow orders”), hence provider skill may be less relevant. Alternatively, with output

incentive contracts, provider skill may play a much more important role as more skilled providers

are better able to choose the optimal combination of inputs using local/contextual information

(albeit with less control over contracted outcomes – and therefore more uncertainty about incentive

payments).

         We examine differences in providers’ behavioral responses to incentive contracts by level

of skill, measuring skills according to whether or not providers have medical degrees with specific

obstetric training (“MBBS plus” providers) qualifying them to provide maternity care. 42 Table 6

shows that in the output contract group, “MBBS plus” providers (column 1) produced PPH rates

that were 9 percentage points lower on average than providers without obstetric qualifications. In

contrast, “MBBS plus” providers performed no better (or worse) than less qualified providers in

the input contract group. These results are consistent with output incentive contracts leading




41
   We are grateful to Oriana Bandiera and Paul Gertler for helpful discussions on this point.
42
   The basic medical education at the level of MBBS and BAMS includes a few months of training in obstetrics that
gives only introductory level of skills. Such providers are able to conduct normal deliveries but do not have training
in management of complications or the surgical skills that are acquired as part of advanced obstetric training programs
(typically 2 to 3 years of training after completing medical school) (Mahal and Mohanan 2006).



                                                          27
providers to use local/contextual information to improve care beyond simple guideline adherence

– but only when they also have sufficient complementary skills to do so.

        To explore high-skilled provider use of local/contextual information under output incentive

contracts further, we also directly examine providers’ reports of implementing new delivery

strategies since our baseline survey. Table 7 shows that output contracts increased the probability

that “MBBS plus” providers implemented new strategies by 0.364 (0.364 = -0.165+0.529;

se=0.142), which is statistically different from zero. In contrast, the input contract did not increase

the use of new strategies among “MBBS plus” providers (0.143=-0.263+0.406; se = 0.167). The

first two rows also show that neither type of contract increased the probability that less qualified

providers implemented new strategies.

        We also investigate whether or not MBBS plus providers differed in their use of clinical

inputs relevant to the prevention and control of PPH (use of parenteral oxytocic drugs and manual

removal of placenta). As Appendix Table A5 shows, output incentive providers with MBBS plus

degrees performed better than their counterparts with input incentives both in the availability of

medicines to reduce bleeding and in massaging the abdomen, but these differences are imprecise.

        Another explanation for differences in provider performance is that MBBS plus providers

are not only better trained, but that they also work in better health care facilities. Indeed, facilities

in which MBBS plus providers work are better equipped with screening tests for pregnancy

disorders, infrastructure for intrapartum care and supply of drugs. However, Table 6 (Column 2)




                                                   28
shows that controlling for these facility characteristics does not change the estimates for output

contracts among MBBS plus providers. 43, 44

4.5. Expectations and Multi-tasking

          Although our incentive contracts generally cover all domains of maternity care provision,

a natural concern with performance incentives is ‘multi-tasking’ (or the reduction of effort on

unrewarded margins – or those for which expected net benefits are lower) (Holmstrom and

Milgrom 1991, Prendergast 1999). Without knowing the underlying production function and cost

functions, it was not possible to know ex-ante if the contracts rewarded some outcomes more

generously (net of the full cost of providing them) than others. Importantly, this depends on

providers’ expectations about their ability to improve outcomes (in both absolute and relative

terms).

          In Table 4 Column 10, we find a 0.14 point decline in the postnatal newborn care

counseling index among output contract group providers (p<0.01), which may reflect a reduction

in effort devoted towards newborn care. To explore this possibility further, we use measures of

provider beliefs about their ability to improve each of the four major health outcomes (i.e., outputs)

that we collected prior to introducing incentive contracts. About 35% of providers rated neonatal

mortality as the most difficult one to improve among the four outcomes. Instead, providers

generally attributed neonatal mortality to the actions of caregivers at home (driven by traditional

beliefs that colostrum is ‘witch’s milk’, for example) and beyond providers’ control. Moreover,

when asked which of the four major health outcomes was most important to improve based on



43
   Consistent with our pre-analysis plan, we investigate heterogenous incentive effects on PPH given that this is the
primary health outcome that improved. In addition to the role of qualifications, we also examine other provider
characteristics, including gender of provider, time preferences and risk aversion. We do not generally find significant
heterogeneous effects along these dimensions (See Appendix Table A6).
44
   Results from a fully interacted model, that interacts treatment variables with all provider facility controls are
statistically similar to results seen in Table 6 Column 2: coefficient (se) for outputxMBBS-Plus -0.074 (0.099)



                                                          29
patients’ clinical needs, only 9% said neonatal mortality – while 75% said PPH (Figure 4). This

pattern of beliefs is consistent with output contract providers diverting effort away from postnatal

newborn care (and preventing neonatal mortality) and towards preventing and treating PPH. In

contrast, Table 4, Column 10, shows no commensurate reduction in postnatal newborn care

counseling delivered by providers in the input contract group. Because postnatal newborn care

counseling largely comprised of giving information to mothers about how to care for the newborns

and detect birth-related complications at home, it is reasonable that input contract providers

responded to performance incentives to deliver this counseling despite believing that it would have

little effect on mothers’ care for their babies at home.

        Taken together, our results suggest that improvements in PPH under incentive contracts

may have come at the expense of some reduction in newborn care – and did so only under

circumstances in which providers believed that effort on newborn care was particularly unlikely

to be rewarded (i.e., output incentive contracts).

        We also investigate if providers’ beliefs about their ability to reduce the incidence of PPH

are a source of heterogeneity in providers’ responses to incentives. 45 We estimate the effect of

incentive contracts at the 25th, median, and 75th percentile of beliefs. Across both types of

contracts, providers with lower levels of prior beliefs demonstrated larger reductions in PPH with

incentive contracts – approximately 13 percentage point reduction at the 25th percentile (with t-

statistic of 4.4) and 5 percentage points (although not statistically significant) at the 75th percentile

(See Appendix Table A7). This pattern of results is consistent with an interpretation that providers

with high levels of beliefs exert high effort even without incentive contracts with relatively little



45Expectations are reported on provider surveys conducted prior to introduction of contracts. Providers
were asked "In general, do you think doctors can reduce the incidence rates of PPH", with responses ranging
from 1 (least likely) to 10 (most likely).



                                                     30
room for improvement, while providers with low levels of beliefs are able to exert higher effort

with incentives.

4.6. Demand Response and Patient Selection

        An important issue in interpreting our results is the extent to which they reflect changes in

patient composition rather than clinical actions taken by providers. There are two primary ways

that patient composition might change: patient demand could change in response to improvements

in quality of care, or providers could manipulate the composition of patients that they treat (by

selectively referring some patients to other providers, for example). Although we are unable to

distinguish between these two channels directly, we analyze their net effect. We also note that we

deliberately constructed our incentive contracts to minimize provider manipulation of the types of

patients that they treat, explicitly indicating that any evidence of patient selection would nullify

their incentive contract. 46 We also collected data from 75 women who had babies in the past year

in communities around each provider to assess whether the provider had engaged in gaming patient

composition.

        To investigate changes in patient composition, we first use our control group sub-sample

to regress an indicator of whether or not any of the four major adverse health outcomes (PPH, pre-

eclampsia, sepsis, and neonatal mortality) occurred on the individual characteristics that we use as

controls in Equation (1). We then use the resulting parameter estimates to predict the probability

of an adverse health event for each mother in the full sample. Appendix Table A8 reports the

means of these predicted probabilities for each study arm.

        Both input and output contract providers had patients who were 6-9 percentage points more

likely to experience any adverse health event than patients in the control group (a statistically


46The contract documents emphasized the importance of maintaining appropriate patient referral patterns; this was
further reinforced in communication with providers during the visits.



                                                        31
significant difference). 47 Because it seems unlikely that providers in either treatment group would

purposefully select patients with greater risk of health complications (especially those with output

contracts), we propose that this finding may instead reflect a demand response: as providers in

both treatment groups provided higher quality services, patients with greater underlying risk of

adverse health outcomes were more likely to seek care from them. An implication of this finding

is that our main results in Tables 3 and 4 may underestimate the effect of the incentive contracts

on provider performance. We also note that such a demand response could explain the positive

effect of the incentive contracts on the incidence of pre-eclampsia, which women can observe ex

ante during pregnancy, compared to PPH or sepsis.



5. CONCLUSION

         The use of performance incentives in public service delivery has grown rapidly in

developing countries in recent years (Finan, Olken et al. 2015, Wagstaff 2015). The World Bank

alone currently supports more than 40 such large-scale programs in the health sector (World Bank

2016). However, very little empirical research examines key contract design issues that should

guide these programs (Miller and Babiarz 2014). Theory suggests that two central considerations

are (a) the trade-off between rewarding the production of outputs versus the use of inputs and (b)

how this trade-off may vary with worker/agent skill. While performance incentives rewarding

outputs may encourage innovation and efficiency in context-dependent input choices, they also

impose more risk on agents. Moreover, suitable skills may be necessary for agents to innovate or

deviate efficiently from pre-specified input combinations.




47T-statistics for comparing the input vs. control incentive group and the input incentive vs. control group are 3.94
and 5.11, respectively.



                                                          32
       Through a maternity care experiment in India, our paper provides empirical evidence that

output and input incentive contracts produced comparable health gains – a reduction in post-

partum hemorrhage (PPH) exceeding 20%. This result is important given that PPH is the leading

cause of maternal mortality worldwide, and India’s maternal mortality ratio continues to be very

high (174 per 1000 live births in 2015) (World Health Organization 2015). Moreover, agents

(health providers) responded very differently to the incentive contracts according to their

underlying qualifications and skills.    With output incentive contracts, those with advanced

qualifications reduced PPH substantially, implementing new delivery strategies to do so – while

those lacking appropriate qualifications failed to reduce PPH. Alternatively, those with varying

qualifications performed equivalently under input incentive contracts, following guidelines in

similar ways.

       Overall, our findings suggest that the focus on input incentives among many ‘pay-for-

performance’ programs in developing country health sectors may be appropriate despite the lack

of previous empirical evidence on the underlying rationale (Fritsche, Soeters et al. 2014, Das,

Gopalan et al. 2016). In particular, health providers in low-income countries often have relatively

little training, and our results suggest that output incentives may be particularly ineffective in

improving their performance – but that incentives for adherence to established clinical guidelines

may be an appropriate strategy.

         collection and surveys are labeled (in blue) below the timeline. Providers were randomized into treatment arm in early 2014, and contracts signed during January - April 2013.
         Providers were visited again during May – August 2013 to discuss strategies and collect provider data. Household surveys (of mothers who delivered babies at study providers’
         facilities) were conducted between December 2013 - July 2014. The providers were visited again at the end of the study to make the incentive payments as specified in contracts, and
         collect data.

Notes: The distributions show payments made to providers in the input contracts arm. Actual payments
are amounts paid out to providers at the end of the experiment based on levels of inputs provided. The
distribution labeled “counterfactual” show the payments that might have been made to the same
providers if they had been paid based on outcomes instead.

Notes: The distributions show payments made to providers in the output contracts arm. Actual payments

outputs. The distribution labeled “counterfactual” show the payments that might have been made to the
same providers if they had been paid based on inputs provided instead.

Notes: Figure on the left shows providers’ response to question asking them to rank the
four outcomes based on which one was most important to improve among their own
patients. Bars indicate percentage of providers who responded that a given outcome was
most important. The bars in the figure on the right shows providers’ responses indicating
outcomes that they thought were least important to improve among their patients.

Notes: This table reports counts of the universe of providers identified as eligible for the study by randomly assigned
treatment arm. Because providers identified during fieldwork were assigned to study arms based on a randomized list of
sequence numbers (unknown to field enumerators, and the sequence was not predictable) it was not possible to ensure an
equal number of providers across arms. Providers identified as attritors in row C declined to participate in the study during
or after signing the contract. The last row includes the final sample of providers used in the analysis.

Notes: This table reports mean provider characteristics by study group. Provider characteristics are self-reported
and measured through interviews with the provider or with a staff member. Rows 2-4 refer to provider training:
MBBS plus is a Bachelor of Medicine degree with a specialization such as obstetrics, MBBS is a Bachelor of
Medicine degree with no additional specialization, BAMS is a degree in Ayurveda medicine. Standard deviations
are reported in parentheses. P-values in the final column are associated with F-tests of joint equality across the
three study groups.

values less than 0.1, 0.5 and 0.01. All specifications include district and enumerator fixed effects; even columns additionally include household-level controls (mother’s age and education;
household’s caste and house type (houseless, kutcha, semi-pucca, or pucca); head of household’s religion; mother’s history of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, hyper- or hypothyroidism,
and convulsions; whether the mother has had a previous stomach surgery; whether it is the mother’s first pregnancy, number of previous pregnancies, whether the mother has had a
stillbirth or abortion, and number of previous children birthed; whether the household owns land, has no literate adults, and owns a Below Poverty Line card) as well as provider-level
controls (primary provider’s gender, professional qualifications, number of years in practice, and number of years that the facility has been in operation). Dependent variables for columns
1-6 are measured through household surveys fielded between November 2013 and July 2014; see appendix for details of measurement. Dependent variable for columns 7 & 8 measured
through interviews with a member of the hospital personnel and is a binary indicator for whether the provider's facility had any parenteral oxytocic drugs available at the time of the survey
at the end of the study period.

Notes: Estimates from OLS regression on PPH as a function of provider qualification category. The
MBBS plus variable takes value 1 if the provider holds an MBBS degree (Bachelor of Medicine,
Bachelor of Surgery) with advanced medical training in obstetrics and gynecology, 0 otherwise.
Robust standard errors, clustered at the provider level, are reported in parentheses. Each specification
includes district and enumerator fixed effects, household-level controls (mother’s age and education;
household’s caste and house type (houseless, kutcha, semi-pucca, or pucca); head of household’s
religion; mother’s history of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, hyper- or hypothyroidism, and
convulsions; whether the mother has had a previous stomach surgery; whether it is the mother’s first
pregnancy, number of previous pregnancies, whether the mother has had a stillbirth or abortion, and
number of previous children birthed; whether the household owns land, has no literate adults, and
owns a Below Poverty Line card) as well as provider-level controls (primary provider’s gender,
number of years in practice, and number of years that the facility has been in operation). Column 2
includes additional controls for availability of emergency obstetric care, screning tests, intrapatrum
management, human resources and drugs, and their interactions with the treatment arms. The
dependent variable (PPH) is measured through household surveys fielded between November 2013
and July 2014; see appendix for details of measurement.

being in the output group (excluding those in the input group). Provider characteristics are self-
reported and measured through interviews with the provider or with a staff member. The following
variables measure provider training: MBBS plus is a Bachelor of Medicine degree with a
specialization such as obstetrics, MBBS is a Bachelor of Medicine degree with no additional
specialization, BAMS is a degree in Ayurveda medicine. The last two rows report the F-statistic and
associated p-value associated with a test that all coefficients jointly equal zero.

Notes: This table reports counts of the universe of providers identified as eligible for the study by
randomly assigned treatment arm. Because providers identified during fieldwork were assigned to study
arms based on a randomized list of sequence numbers (unknown to field enumerators, and the sequence was
not predictable) it was not possible to ensure an equal number of providers across arms. Providers
identified as attritors declined to participate in the study during or after signing the contract. The P-value in
the final column is associated with F-tests of joint equality from a regression of treatment indicators on a
binary indicator for refusing to participate.

Notes: Each column reports estimates obtained through an OLS regression; robust standard errors, clustered at the provider level, are reported in parentheses
and the associated p-value is reported below. The adjusted p-values are calculated (in italics ) using the free step-down resampling method and implemented
using code from Soledad Giardili and Marcos Vera Hernandez, accounting for the grouping of PPH, Sepsis and NNM into outputs that are primary
influenced by care at the time of delivery across two treatment arms. Each specification includes district and enumerator fixed effects and household-level
controls (mother’s age and education; household’s caste and house type (houseless, kutcha, semi-pucca, or pucca); head of household’s religion; mother’s
history of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, hyper- of hypothyroidism, and convulsions; whether the mother has had a previous stomach surgery; whether it is
the mother’s first pregnancy, number of previous pregnancies, whether the mother has had a stillbirth or abortion, and number of previous children birthed;
whether the household owns land, has no literate adults, and owns a Below Poverty Line card) as well as provider-level controls (primary provider’s gender,
professional qualifications, number of years in practice, and number of years that the facility has been in operation). All dependent variables are measured
through household surveys fielded between November 2013 and July 2014; see appendix for details of measurement.

Notes: Estimates obtained through OLS. Robust standard errors, clustered at the provider level, are reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance based on p-values less than 0.1, 0.5 and 0.01. All specifications include district and
enumerator fixed effects; even columns additionally include household-level controls (mother’s age and education; household’s caste and house type (houseless, kutcha, semi-pucca, or pucca); head of household’s religion; mother’s history of hypertension,
diabetes, asthma, hyper- or hypothyroidism, and convulsions; whether the mother has had a previous stomach surgery; whether it is the mother’s first pregnancy, number of previous pregnancies, whether the mother has had a stillbirth or abortion, and number of
previous children birthed; whether the household owns land, has no literate adults, and owns a Below Poverty Line card) as well as provider-level controls (primary provider’s gender, professional qualifications, number of years in practice, and number of years
that the facility has been in operation). Dependent variables for columns 1-6 are measured through household surveys fielded between November 2013 and July 2014; see appendix for details of measurement. Dependent variable for columns 7 & 8 measured
through interviews with a member of the hospital personnel and is a binary indicator for whether the provider's facility had any parenteral oxytocic drugs available at the time of the survey at the end of the study period.

Notes: Expectations are reported on provider surveys in response to question "In general, do you think doctors
can reduce the incidence rates of PPH", with responses ranging from 1 (least likely) to 10 (most likely). Linear
combination above report estimated incentive effects at 25th percentile, mean, median and 75th percentile of
reported expectations. All specifications includes district and enumerator fixed effects, household-level controls
(mother’s age and education; household’s caste and house type (houseless, kutcha, semi-pucca, or pucca); head of
household’s religion; mother’s history of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, hyper- or hypothyroidism, and
convulsions; whether the mother has had a previous stomach surgery; whether it is the mother’s first pregnancy,
number of previous pregnancies, whether the mother has had a stillbirth or abortion, and number of previous
children birthed; whether the household owns land, has no literate adults, and owns a Below Poverty Line card)
as well as provider-level controls. The dependent variable (PPH) is measured through household surveys fielded
between November 2013 and July 2014; see appendix for details of measurement. Standard errors, clustered at
the level of the provider, reported in parenthesis.

Notes. Mean rates of predicted adverse health events are generated by using the control group sub-sample to regress an indicator for
whether or not any of the four major adverse health outcomes that we study occurred (PPH, pre-eclampsia, sepsis, and neonatal
mortality) on the individual characteristics that we use as individual-level controls as well as district fixed effects. For each woman
in our full sample, we then use the resulting parameter estimates to predict the probability of an adverse health event for each woman.
T-statistics are reported for tests that there is no difference in means.
