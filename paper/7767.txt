           In an earlier article1 we analyzed a method of combining traditional tax financed pay-as-

you-go Social Security benefits with annuities financed by Personal Retirement Accounts. We

showed that such a combination could maintain the level of retirement income projected in

current Social Security law while avoiding a future increase in the payroll tax rate.

           More specifically, we specified that the government would contribute an amount equal to

2 percent of each individual‚Äôs payroll earnings (up to the Social Security earnings limit, now

$76,200) each year to a Personal Retirement Account and that the funds in the those accounts

would be invested in a mixture of stocks and bonds that would have a real after-inflation yield of

5.5 percent net of administrative costs. At retirement age, the assets in each Personal Retirement

Account would be converted to a variable annuity invested in the same mixture of stocks and

bonds. Our analysis showed that with these assumptions and with demographic and economic

assumptions based on the projections of the Social Security actuaries, each individual could

receive his current-law benefits at retirement age plus 25 percent of the value of the Personal

Retirement Account annuity without any need to raise the current 12.4 percent payroll tax

contribution. Benefits identical to those in the current system would be paid to spouses,

dependents, survivors and the disabled. We emphasized that in each case the combination of tax-

financed benefits and Personal Retirement Account annuities would exceed the benefits

projected in current law while the tax rate projected in current law would not be increased.

           In contrast to the effects of this mixed system, the Social Security actuaries project that

because of the aging of the population and the resulting increase in the ratio of retirees to

employees, the current pure pay-as-you-go system can only maintain the benefits specified in

current law by raising the payroll tax rate from 12.4 percent today to more than 17 percent by

2037 (when the Social Security Trust Fund would otherwise be exhausted) and to nearly 19

percent by the end of the actuaries‚Äô 75 year forecast period.

           Several proposals to combine traditional pay-as-you-go benefits and payments from

investment-based Personal Retirement Accounts have now been made by members of Congress

and by private analysts. Some of these proposals, including that of Governor George W. Bush,

would finance the contributions to Personal Retirement Accounts by allocating (or allowing

individuals to allocate) a portion of their payroll tax payments to the Personal Retirement

Accounts. If these shifts of payroll tax payments are not matched by concurrent additional

payments to the Social Security Trust Fund from general revenue (as some have suggested), the

initial effect would be to reduce the flow of funds into the Social Security Trust Fund, causing

the balance in the Trust Fund to be smaller in the early years than it would otherwise be.

           The primary purpose of this article is to analyze the effects of shifting 2 percent of payroll




c:ss.fstn.2000.7                                    -2-
tax payments from the Trust Fund to Personal Retirement Accounts.2 We show that, with a 5.5

percent real rate of return in the Personal Retirement Accounts, such a system is capable of

maintaining the benefits projected in current law without a rise in current or future payroll tax

rates. After presenting our basic analysis, we discuss the implication of the fact that future returns

are uncertain. We also discuss the role of bequests and the cost of permitting individuals to

bequeath their Personal Retirement Account balances.

           The primary advantage of the mixed system of financing future retirement is that it does

not require raising future payroll taxes from the current rate of 12.4 percent. It also has the

ability to permit bequests and to provide a high probability that the combined retirement income

will actually exceed the benefits currently projected in Social Security law.

           A further advantage of the mixed system is that the contributions to Personal Retirement

Accounts increase the level of national saving. This is true regardless of whether the funds come

from the ‚Äúon budget‚Äù surpluses as we assumed in our earlier writing or from the ‚Äúoff budget‚Äù

surpluses that we analyze in the current article. In both cases, the reduction in the government

surpluses reduces the likelihood that future Congresses and administrations would use those

funds to finance additional government spending or additional tax cuts that finance private

spending.3 The Personal Retirement Accounts are additions to personal saving and therefore to


           2
         We would stress that although the plan described here resembles the proposal of
Governor Bush in financing the Personal Retirement Accounts by allowing individuals to
allocate a portion of their payroll taxes to Personal Retirement Accounts, our analysis is not of
‚Äúthe Bush plan‚Äù since Governor Bush did not provide enough information with which to specify
any particular ‚ÄúBush plan.‚Äù
           3
        The tendency for future Congresses and Administrations to spend unified budget
surpluses is consistent with recent budget history. The surpluses in the Social Security Trust
Fund that accumulated as a result of the 1983 Social Security reforms that followed the

c:ss.fstn.2000.7                                  -3-
national saving.4

           As we discussed in our earlier paper, the increase in national saving means greater

investment in business plant and equipment. That in turn means greater profits and therefore

greater corporate tax payments. In the previous paper, we showed how these additional corporate

tax payments could be used to finance the government‚Äôs contribution of two percent of payroll to

Personal Retirement Account after the currently projected on-budget surpluses no longer existed.

In the current paper, we use the additional corporate tax payments to augment the Trust Fund

since the Personal Retirement Accounts are funded directly from a portion of the payroll tax

payments.

            The additional national saving flows largely but not exclusively into corporate

investment since some of the additional saving goes into owner-occupied housing and other non-

corporate investments and some flows abroad. The incremental investments in the corporate

sector earn a return of about 8.5 percent and are subject to an average corporate income tax rate

of about 29 percent, implying that the government receives 2.5 percent of the incremental

corporate capital.5 To recognize that some of the incremental national saving goes into non-

corporate investments, we scale down the return that the government receives on these funds by



Greenspan Commission were more than matched by on-budget deficits, producing overall budget
deficits in spite of the off-budget Social Security surpluses.
           4
        If households expect that the mixed system of pay-as-you-go benefits and Personal
Retirement Account annuities will only maintain the level of benefits projected in current law,
they have no reason to reduce other saving or increase spending from existing assets.

one fifth, from 2.5 percent of the Personal Retirement Account asset balances to 2.0 percent of

those balances.6 With the Trust Fund augmented in this way and with the Personal Retirement

Account annuities permitting smaller pay-as-you-go payouts while maintaining the projected

value of retirement incomes, the Trust Fund remains permanently solvent.7

1. The Social Security Simulation Model8

           Our analysis in this paper uses an accounting model developed as part of our research in a

broader National Bureau of Economic Research project on Social Security reform. This model is

calibrated so that with the current Social Security law it closely approximates the time series of

benefits, revenues and Trust Fund assets predicted in the 2000 Social Security Trustees Report.

           The unit of analysis in these simulations is the individual. Benefits for spouses,

dependents, and survivors, as well as disability benefits, are subsumed in the individual benefit

provision which is scaled so that total OASDI benefits correspond to those projected by the



           6
        This transfer of tax revenue to the Trust Fund is similar to the procedure in current law in
which the extra personal income tax revenue associated with the personal taxation of Social
Security benefits of taxpayers with more than $32,000 in income for married taxpayers and
$25,000 for single taxpayers is transferred from general revenues to the Trust Fund.
           7
        Our analysis of the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund and the ability to maintain
projected retirement income does not depend on this assumption about national saving but only
on the willingness of future Congresses and Administrations to deposit an amount equal to 2
percent of the PRA account balances into the Social Security Trust Fund.
           8
         This section summarizes the technical features of the simulation model. The analysis
here parallels that of the earlier paper and can be skipped by readers who want to get right to the
results of the new analysis. Others who want more details can consult Martin Feldstein and

Social Security actuaries. We use the current actual age structure of the US population and the

Census Bureau‚Äôs projections of future birth and death probabilities to estimate the population in

each future year. We also use projections of the numbers of net new immigrants and scale up the

projected population of every age to coincide with the aggregate population projections of the

Social Security Administration.

           The simulations assume that individuals begin work at age 21 and continue to work until

the year before they reach the normal retirement age legislated for their birth cohort (or die if that

occurs sooner.) The normal retirement age is currently 65 but will soon begin to rise

incrementally to age 67. Since not everyone in the population of working age actually works in

each year, we adjust the labor force participation rate to obtain the number of covered workers in

each future year that is projected by the Social Security actuaries.

           Our calculations embody the historic data for Social Security taxable payroll for the years

before 2000 and then use the forecast of taxable payroll in the intermediate assumptions of 2000

Social Security Trustees Report for subsequent years. According to that forecast, the average

real wage rises at 1.0 percent per year in the long term. Our calculations assume that the

movements of the average real wage reflect changes in the age structure of the labor force and

differences among age groups in the relative level of wages as well as the overall rate of increase

of age-specific wage rates.

           The investments in the Personal Retirement Accounts are assumed to earn a real rate of

return of 5.5 percent after inflation. A portfolio invested 60 percent in the Standard and Poors

500 portfolio of common stock and 40 percent in a portfolio of corporate bonds during the fifty




c:ss.fstn.2000.7                                   -6-
year period through 1995 had a mean real logarithmic return of 5.9 percent.9 We deduct 0.4

percent per year to reflect the administrative costs of PRAs.10 The full rate of return earned on

non-financial corporate capital before all taxes during the same period was about 8.5 percent.11

The difference between this 8.5 percent and the portfolio return reflects the taxes paid by

corporations and therefore not included in the return earned on PRA accounts. We follow the

Social Security Trustees in assuming that the real return on the government bonds in the Social

Security Trust Fund will decline gradually to a 3.0 percent real interest rate in the future.

           Because we are interested in total benefit payments and not in their distribution by

income and family type, we base our calculations on average taxable payroll in each year and do

not distinguish among different income levels and family structures.12 Although we therefore


           9
         The use of the logarithmic rate of return understates the actual level rate of return by
about one percentage point. The mean real rate of return of the portfolio in level form was about
6.9 percent during the 50 year period through 1995. We return to this distinction when we
discuss risk below. For now, the use of 5.9 percent can be regarded as providing a conservative
margin of safety in the mean return. Including the more recent years would of course increase
the rate of return.

Progress‚Äù section of the website of the National Bureau of Economic Research (www.nber.org).
After the conference at which those papers were presented, TIAA-CREF introduced a variable
annuity based on the Russell 3000 stock index with an annual expense charge of only 0.37
percentage points. Our assumption of a cost of 0.40 percentage points may therefore exceed the
amount needed in practice, especially since the TIAA-CREF accounts have to manage the
collection of account deposits at varying intervals; we assume that all such deposits would come
in a single annual payment from the government.

cannot apply the actual Social Security benefit rules, we use the implicit rate of return on the

taxes paid by individuals in each birth cohort to calculate aggregate average benefits for that

cohort13 in a way that produces the same aggregate benefit amounts that the Social Security

actuaries project for future years on the basis of current law.

2. Personal Retirement Accounts: Deposits, Benefits, and Asset Values

           Our analysis assumes that the Personal Retirement Account (PRA) deposits begin with

the year 2000 and that all employees in that year shift 2.0 percent of the 12.4 percent payroll tax

to the new Personal Retirement Accounts. The PRA deposits in that year are projected to be

$79.38 billion (at the year 2000 price level). The deposited amounts increase over time as

earnings rise, reaching $93.15 billion in 2010, $121.45 billion in 2030, $156.59 billion in 2050

and $209.53 in 2075, the final year of our analysis. All of these amounts are in prices of the year

2000. These figures are shown in column 1 of Table 1.

           We assume that individuals begin to receive payments from their PRAs at their normal

retirement ages specified in current law (i.e., 65 now and rising to age 67) in the form of an

annuity that earns the same 5.5 percent real rate of return that we assumed for the accumulation

phase. The first annuities are paid to individuals who become 65 in the year 2001 and total only

$70 million.14 Total annuities grow rapidly, reaching $1.26 billion in 2005, $5.68 billion in

2010, $127.01 billion in 2030 and $937.48 billion in 2075 (all in year 2000 dollars). These

figures and the amounts for selected intervening years are shown in column 2 of Table 1. The

rapid rise in the annuity amounts reflect the increasing number of annuitants and the rapid

increase in the average annuity amount. The rapid increases in the average annuity amounts in

turn reflect the increased number of years of PRA contributions among successive retiree

cohorts.

           The same annuity payments are shown in column 3 of Table 1 as percentages of the

reported taxable payroll of all individuals in each of the selected years. These amounts rise from

0.12 percent of taxable payroll in 2010 to 2.09 percent in 2030, 5.76 percent in 2050, and 8.95

percent in 2075. Since one percent of taxable payroll corresponds to between 0.35 percent of

gross domestic product and 0.39 percent of gross domestic product during this time period, these

annuity payments rise from 0.05 percent of GDP in 2010 to 3.58 percent of GDP in 2075.

           The aggregate value of the funds in all Personal Retirement Accounts grows with the

PRA deposits of 2 percent of each year‚Äôs payroll and with the 5.5 percent rate of return on the

existing assets and is diminished by the annuity payouts. The resulting aggregate PRA value is

shown in column 4 of Table 1 in billions of year 2000 dollars and in column 5 as a percentage of

the corresponding aggregate taxable payroll. The PRA assets rise rapidly, from $1,224.08 billion

in 2010 to $5,754.74 billion in 2030, $12,231.66 billion in 2050 and $20,444.27 billion in 2075.

As a percentage of taxable payroll, these PRA assets rise from 26.28 percent of taxable payroll in

of Table 1.

3. The Path of the Trust Fund

           As we noted in the introduction, our focus in this paper is on the feasibility of

maintaining each individual‚Äôs total retirement income from a combination of the Personal

Retirement Account annuities and the traditional pay-as-you-go benefits. We will show that in

fact the mixed system that combines the two sources of retirement income can actually provide

an increased level of total retirement income without increasing the payroll tax rate from its

current level.

           Column 1 of Table 2 shows the benchmark benefits (i.e., the benefits projected according

to current Social Security rules) as a percentage of taxable payroll, rising from 10.12 percent in

2000 to 18.54 percent in 2075.15 The current payroll tax rate of 12.4 percent will no longer be

sufficient to finance the projected benefits by 2015. By 2040, there is a shortfall of 4.73 percent

of taxable payroll, implying that benefits would have to be cut by 27 percent if the current system

and tax rate is left unchanged. By 2075, the required benefit cut would have to equal 6.14 percent


           15
          These figures are the ‚Äúnet cost‚Äù of providing the benefits. Total payments in each year
are slightly higher, with the difference financed by the personal income tax revenue that is
collected on Social Security benefit payments under existing law and transferred from general
revenue to the Social Security Trust Fund. In 2020, for example, the total payments financed
from the Social Security Trust Fund for all beneficiaries of all cohorts are equal to 14.66 percent
of taxable payroll. This is referred to as the ‚Äúcost rate‚Äù of the system in that year. The projected
personal income tax revenue on these benefits is equal to 0.51 percent of taxable payroll, leaving
a net cost rate of 14.15 percent of taxable payroll to be financed. For 2020, we actually estimate a
net cost rate of 14.18 percent of taxable payroll. Although our simulation model does not match
the Social Security actuaries‚Äô projections exactly, the average absolute deviation of the estimated
net cost rate from the Trustees Report net cost rate is only 0.05 percent of payroll. Throughout
our analysis, we implicitly assume that the total amount of income taxes on benefits remains the
same, regardless of the source of the benefit payment.

c:ss.fstn.2000.7                                   -10-
of taxable payroll, a 33 percent benefit reduction.

           If 2 percent of taxable payroll is allocated to the PRA deposits, the annual net payroll tax

becomes 10.4 percent of taxable payroll. The other source of tax revenue to finance benefits in

the mixed system is the incremental corporate tax revenue that we assume is transferred to the

Trust Fund. This incremental corporate tax revenue is 2 percent of the value of the assets in the

PRA accounts. Multiplying the value of PRA assets as a percentage of taxable payroll (shown in

column 5 of table 1) by 0.02 implies corporate tax revenue that rises from 0.53 percent of payroll

in 2010 to 1.90 percent of payroll in 2030, 3.12 percent in 2050 and 3.90 percent in 2075.

Combining the incremental corporate tax revenue with the 10.4 percent payroll tax gives the ‚Äútax

revenue available to finance benefits‚Äù shown in column 2 of Table 2. This total rises from 10.44

percent in 2000 to 14.30 in 2075.

           Column 3 of Table 2 presents the PRA benefits as a percentage of taxable payroll (as

previously shown in column 3 of Table 1). These rise from zero in the first year to 2.09 percent

of payroll in 2030 and to 8.95 percent in 2075.

           The combination of the available tax finance and the PRA annuities, shown in column 4

of Table 2, is initially more than sufficient to finance the benefits (shown in column 1), then

temporarily are less (requiring net payments from the Trust Fund to make up the difference), and

eventually again become more than enough to finance current benefits, implying that it would be

possible to increase benefits or reduce the payroll tax. We now look at this in more detail.

           In the year 2000, the cost of the benchmark benefit is only 10.12 percent of payroll. The

combined tax revenue of 10.44 percent of payroll therefore implies a surplus of 0.32 percent of

payroll that can augment the existing Trust Fund balance.


c:ss.fstn.2000.7                                   -11-
           By 2020, the benchmark benefit costs 14.18 percent of payroll. The tax finance of 11.56

plus the PRA annuity of 0.74 percent of payroll are sufficient to finance 12.30 percent of payroll,

shown in column 4. The remaining 1.88 percent of payroll needed to reach the benchmark

benefits, as shown in column 5, comes from the Trust Fund.

           As a result, the Trust Fund balance (shown in column 6) declines from 25.33 percent of

payroll in 2019 to 23.78 percent of payroll in 2020. This decline reflects three components: (1)

with no change in the assets of the Trust Fund, the increase in taxable payroll from 2019 to 2020

would cause the assets as a percentage of payroll to decline from 25.33 percent to 24.91 percent;

(2) the interest earned on the Trust Fund assets would cause the Trust Fund to rise by

approximately 0.75 percent of taxable payroll, and (3) the 1.88 percent of payroll needed to

complete the financing of the benchmark benefit would reduce the Trust Fund by that amount.

Thus, 24.91 percent of payroll plus 0.75 percent of payroll minus 1.88 percent of payroll equals

the 23.78 percent of payroll shown in column 6.

           The process continues in this way until 2031 when the Trust Fund is temporarily

exhausted. After that date, we assume that the Social Security system borrows against future

Trust Fund receipts of payroll and corporate taxes, paying the same interest rate on its liability as

the Trust Fund would receive if the balance were positive. For 2031, this is a real interest rate of

3 percent.

           By 2042, the combination of the payroll taxes, the incremental corporate tax revenue, and

the PRA annuities are enough to outweigh the combination of the interest outlays of the Trust

Fund and the Social Security benefit payout needed to maintain retirement income at the level

projected in current Social Security law.


c:ss.fstn.2000.7                                 -12-
           In 2050, for example, the net cost of the benchmark benefits is 17.17 percent of payroll

(column 1 of Table 2), the combination of payroll and corporate tax revenue is 13.52 percent of

payroll (column 2), and the PRA annuities are 5.76 percent of payroll (column 3). The total of tax

revenue and PRA annuities is therefore 19.28 percent of payroll (column 4), causing a surplus of

2.11 percent payroll (column 5). This surplus more than offsets the interest that the Trust Fund is

still paying on its past borrowing and causes the small liability that remained at the end of 2049

to shrink to 2.87 percent of payroll at the end of 2050. By the end of 2052, the Trust Fund has a

positive balance.

           After 2051, the positive balance of the Trust Fund grows rapidly since the combination of

the PRA annuities and the tax receipts is more than enough to finance the benchmark benefits.

Note that by 2075 the operating surplus before Trust Fund interest receipts is 4.71 percent of

payroll and the Trust Fund is 107 percent of payroll and rising rapidly.

           The positive and increasing Trust Fund balance in 2075 is a necessary feature of any

Social Security reform than can claim to be permanently successful. Although the 2000 Trustees

Report refers to a 75-year average shortfall of 1.89 percent of taxable payroll, closing that gap by

a 1.89 percent increase in the payroll tax rate for the next 75 years would leave a zero balance in

the Trust Fund in 2075 and a permanent future financing gap of more than 6 percent of taxable

payroll.16 In contrast, the positive and increasing Trust Fund balance for 2075 shown here

indicates that there is room to reduce payroll or corporate tax contributions or to increase total

retirement income without undermining the financial solvency of the system in years after 2075



           16
       The same is obviously true also for any other reform proposal in which the Trust Fund is
permanently exhausted at any time before 2075.

c:ss.fstn.2000.7                                  -13-
as well.



4. Uncertain Rates of Return

           The 5.5 percent real rate of return that we have assumed in these calculations was the

average real logarithmic rate of return on a portfolio of 60 percent equities (the Standard and

Poors 500) and 40 percent corporate bonds from 1946 through 1995. The average future rate of

return is, of course, both uncertain and subject to year-to-year variation. In earlier work,

Feldstein and Ranguelova17 and Feldstein, Ranguelova and Samwick18 studied the implication of

this uncertainty and variability in the context of models in which the Personal Retirement

Accounts were financed by additional government revenue rather than by allocating a portion of

the payroll tax receipts. The analysis in those papers can however be applied directly to the

current issue.

           The analysis in Feldstein and Ranguelova used the historic year-to-year variation in the

returns on a 60:40 stock-bond portfolio to characterize the uncertainty of the estimated mean

return (the 5.5 percent assumed above) and the future annual variability of returns. They then

developed 10,000 80-year simulations of alternative possible futures that reflect this uncertainty

and the subsequent year-to-year variation from 1998 to 2077. On the basis of these 10,000

simulations, we can say what the probability is that retirees in any future year would receive total

retirement income that is above any given fraction (or multiple) of the benchmark Social Security

benefits projected for that year in current law.

           More specifically, to model the effect of uncertainty on retirees during the transition

period until the Trust Fund returns to a significant positive value (beginning in 2060), we set the

level of the pay-as-you-go benefits so that the combination of these pay-as-you-go benefits and

the PRA annuity based on a 5.5 percent rate of return would equal the benchmark benefit. Any

shortfall or excess of the actual rates of return relative to that 5.5 percent therefore causes total

retirement income to be below or above the benchmark benefits. This assumption maintains the

path of the Trust Fund shown in column 6 of Table 2.

           The relative importance of the PRA annuities, and therefore of the uncertainty of those

annuities, increases with the number of years that a retiree has participated in the PRA program.

To look at the maximum exposure to the PRA benefit uncertainty, we consider individuals who

have contributed to a PRA for their entire working lives. More specifically, we consider first an

individual who begins work in the year 2004 at age 21 and retires in the year 2050 at the age of

67, one of the first cohorts of retirees who can contribute for their full working lives. The

aggregate benchmark benefits for all retirees in that year are projected to have a cost of 17.17

percent of taxable payroll (Table 2, column 1). The aggregate PRA benefits that would be paid

in 2050 if the PRA accounts achieve a 5.5 percent rate of return in each prior year would be 5.76

percent of taxable payroll (Table 2, column 3). This leaves 11.41 percent of taxable payroll to be




c:ss.fstn.2000.7                                   -15-
paid as pay-as-you-go benefits.19 Since 11.41 percent of taxable payroll is only 66 percent of the

benchmark benefits, the average reduction of the pay-as-you-go benefits would be 34 percent.

           The reduction differs, however, by birth cohort. The new retirees have participated in the

PRA program for more years than those who retired several years earlier. As a result, their PRA

benefits are larger relative to the benchmark than the PRA benefits of those who have already

been retired for many years. More specifically, the PRA benefit of the 67 year olds in 2050

would be 45 percent of their benchmark benefit. If we reduce their pay-as-you-go benefit by this

45 percent, they will receive total retirement income equal to or greater than the benchmark

benefit if and only if the PRA benefit for those individuals exceed 45 percent of the benchmark

benefit.

           According to the Feldstein-Ranguelova simulations, a 67 year old who has contributed 2

percent of his earnings each year from age 21 until age 66 has a 71 percent probability that his

PRA annuity will exceed 45 percent of his benchmark benefit. This implies that there is a 71

percent probability that the combination of his PRA annuity and his reduced pay-as-you-go

benefit will exceed his benchmark benefit.20 The Feldstein-Ranguelova simulations also imply

that there is an 81 percent probability that the combined benefit will exceed 90 percent of the

benchmark benefit and a 91 percent probability that the combined benefit will exceed 80 percent


           19
         This is less than the tax revenue available to finance benefits (Column 2 of Table 2)
which is equal in that year to 13.52 percent of taxable payroll. The difference is added to the
Trust Fund.
           20
          Although the Feldstein-Ranguelova simulations assume the same 5.5 percent mean real
logarithmic return as we have assumed in the earlier part of this paper, the corresponding level
return (i.e., the actual average annual return) for the same 50 year period was a full percentage
point higher (i.e., a 6.9 percent total return or 6.4 percent after allowing for the 0.40 percent
administrative costs.)

c:ss.fstn.2000.7                                  -16-
of the benchmark. The risk of a substantial shortfall is thus quite small. There is also a 50:50

chance that the total benefit will exceed 125 percent of the benchmark benefit.

           In the year 2050, the Trust Fund is still in debt. The rule of limiting the pay-as-you-go

benefit to the difference between the benchmark benefit and the PRA annuity that would result

from a 5.5 percent return implies a surplus in that year of 2.11 percent of payroll, almost enough

to pay off the entire remaining Trust Fund debt. A slower return to a positive Trust Fund balance

would permit higher pay-as-you-go benefits and therefore a lower risk that the new retirees

would receive less than their full benchmark benefit from the combination of the pay-as-you-go

benefit and the PRA annuity. For example, if the surplus were reduced from 2.11 percent of

payroll to 1.0 percent of payroll and the other 1.11 percent of payroll were used to increase all

pay-as-you-go benefits, the probability of achieving at least the benchmark level of retirement

income would be 77 percent and the probability of achieving at least 90 percent of the benchmark

benefit would be 87 percent.

           Beginning in 2052, the Trust Fund is again positive. By 2060 the Trust Fund has assets

equal to 28 percent of taxable payroll, higher than they are today. Since the combination of the

tax revenue and PRA annuities (column 4 of Table 2) is more than enough to finance the

benchmark benefits, it is possible, beginning in 2060, to relax the rule that limits the pay-as-you-

go benefits to what they would be if the aggregate PRA annuity is equal to the value that would

result from a 5.5 percent rate of return.

           To see the implication of this, consider a 67 year old retiree in 2060. Since the Trust

Fund is then very large (more than 28 percent of taxable payroll), it would be possible to use all

of the payroll tax revenue plus the incremental corporate tax payments (a total of 13.92 percent


c:ss.fstn.2000.7                                   -17-
of taxable payroll) to pay traditional benefits, leaving the Trust Fund to grow at the rate of

interest earned on its assets. The total benefits projected in 2060 are 17.84 percent of taxable

payroll, implying that the pay-as-you-go benefits would be 78 percent of benchmark benefits.

With this share of the benchmark benefits coming from the pay-as-you-go system, the Feldstein-

Ranguelova simulations imply that there is a 94 percent chance that the combined retirement

income will exceed the benchmark benefit level and a 99 percent chance that the combined

retirement income will exceed 90 percent of the benchmark level.

           Consider finally the situation in 2075. Even if all of the tax revenue beginning in 2060

had been used to finance pay-as-you-go benefits, the Trust Fund in 2075 would be greater than

the 28 percent of payroll in 2060 because the interest received on the Trust Fund balance would

cause it to grow faster than the increase in taxable payroll. It would continue to be possible to

use all of the payroll tax revenue plus the incremental corporate tax payments (a total of 14.30

percent of taxable payroll) to pay traditional benefits, leaving the Trust Fund to continue to grow

at the rate of interest earned on its assets. The total benefits projected in 2075 are 18.54 percent

of taxable payroll, implying that the pay-as-you-go benefits would be 77 percent of benchmark

benefits. With this share of the benchmark benefits coming from the pay-as-you-go system, the

Feldstein-Ranguelova simulations again imply that there is a 93 percent chance that the

combined retirement income will exceed the benchmark benefit level and a 99 percent chance

that the combined retirement income will exceed 90 percent of the benchmark level.

           Even these relatively low levels of risk can be eliminated by a government program that

augments the combined benefit if it falls below the benchmark level. Since an open-ended

guarantee would induce excessive risk-taking, the guarantee would have to be limited to the


c:ss.fstn.2000.7                                  -18-
shortfall that would occur if the individual invested the PRA balances in a ‚Äústandard‚Äù mutual

fund that invested in a pre-specified portfolio like the 60 percent Standard and Poors and 40

percent corporate bonds portfolio used in our simulations. Individuals would be free to invest in

other portfolios, but the guarantee would only be paid relative to the performance of this standard

investment. Calculations reported in earlier research21 show that the risk to future taxpayers of

providing such a guarantee is very small.

5. Bequests

           Although the calculations described in this paper assume that current benefit rules will

continue to provide benefits to spouses, dependents and survivors, there is general interest in the

possibility of allowing individuals to bequeath their PRA assets. The cost of permitting such

bequests depends on the form of the bequest that is allowed. The most obvious form would be to

allow individuals who die before reaching normal retirement age to bequeath the assets in their

Personal Retirement Accounts. Feldstein and Ranguelova22 estimated that the such bequests

could be permitted without changing the probability distributions of PRA annuities at every age

by increasing the PRA deposits from 2 percent of taxable payroll to 2.3 percent of taxable

payroll. This calculation applies to those cohorts that have participated in the PRA system from

age 21.

           It is also possible to permit bequests after retirement, with a cost that depends on the



           21

bequest rule. Feldstein and Ranguelova estimated that replacing a lifetime annuity with a twenty

year certain annuity23 in addition to permitting preretirement bequests raises the required saving

from 2 percent of taxable payroll to 2.8 percent of taxable payroll.

           These same estimates would apply to the current context in which the 2 percent of taxable

payroll is taken from the 12.4 percent payroll tax rather than being financed by additional funds.

6. Conclusion

           This paper has shown that a program of Personal Retirement Accounts (PRAs) funded by

allocating 2 percent of the 12.4 percent payroll tax collections can maintain the retirement

income projected in current law while avoiding any increase in the 12.4 percent payroll tax. The

combination of the higher return on the assets in the Personal Retirement Accounts and the use of

the additional corporate profits taxes that result from the increased national saving in Personal

Retirement Accounts (2 percent of the aggregate value of Personal Retirement Accounts) is

sufficient to maintain the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund even though the tax

payments to the fund are reduced from 12.4 percent of taxable payroll to 10.4 percent of taxable

payroll. Although there is a period of years when the Trust Fund must borrow, it is able to repay

this borrowing with interest out of future tax collections. In the long run, the Trust Fund becomes

very large, implying that it would be possible to reduce the payroll tax further or to increase

retirement incomes above the levels projected in current law.
