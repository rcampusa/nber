                                     ABSTRACT


     This paper outlines an approach to measuring    real interest rates and


testing hypotheses on their behavior.    It then describes what we know about

real interest rates in the aggregate economy and provides estimates of real

interest rates for the agricultural sector.

     The evidence presented in this paper indicates that real interest rates

                                                                l98Ds and that
for the agricultural    economy have been extremely high in the

their behavior seems to be linked to that found for real rates in the

aggregate   economy.   What has been the source of these high real rates?

The answer seems to be that it was a result of a concerted effort by the

aonetary authorities to disinflate the economy.     However,   the brunt of the

Fed's disinflationary    policy has fallen more heavily on the farm sector

which has had to face far higher reel rates than the rest of the economy.

Although breaking the back of inflation was certainly a worthy goal for

the Fed, farmers have had to pay a heavy price.     They have had to suffer

for the sins of an economy that was excessively    inflationary, which then

had to be brought back into line with disinflationary    policy.

     Real interest rates are among the most important economir variables

and have been atudied extensively. They figure prominently in discus-

sions of the trsnsmission mechanisms of monetary policy and also play a

prominent role in explanations of business cycles and particular business

cycle episodes.     Real interest rates are a central element in savings-

consumption decisions and in debates about how to encourage savings, a

topic which has been prominent in recent years because of the rise of

supply—side economics.     Real interest rates are also a critical explana-

tory variable for investment decisions since they repcesent the real cost

of borrowing. They are especially important in the agricultural sector

since farmers must make extensive use of debt markets in order to finance

their production.

        This paper outlines an approach to measuring real interest rates and

testing hypotheses on their behavior. It then describes what we know

about    real interest rates in the aggregate economy and provides estimates

of real interest rates for the agricultural sector.    By examining the

behavior of real interest rates in the agriculture sector, we may develop

a better understanding of some of the woes of the farming industry in

recent years.



                               II.   Methodology



        The real interest rate of concern to economists is more precisely

referred to as the ex ante real interest rate. The ex ante real interest

rate for a one-period bond, that is, its expected real return, is:
                                                 2




(1)
                      rr
                             =
                                 i   -



where,
              = the cx ante real interest rate on the
        rr                                            one—period bond at time
                  t: i.e.,   the ex ante real return from time to t+1.

        i     =   the nominal interest rate on       the one-period bond at time t:

                  i.e.,   the nominal return from time t to t+l.

              = the inflation rate from time t to t+1
        TC                                            experted at time t.
        The problem with measuring the ex ante real interest rates is that

experted inflation,                  is not directly observable and so neither is the
                             7t,
cx ante real interest rate.              In the literature,    several approaches have

been used to measure cx ante real interest rates.                    In one approach, real

interest rates have been calculated by subtracting survey data on infla-

tion expectations, such as the Livingston data, from nominal interest

rates.       The problem with survey-based measures of resl interest rates                    is

that they are only as good as the survey measure of inflation expecta-

tions    and there may be little incentive for the survey respondents to

answer accurately. An even more telling criticism of survey-based

measures, often ignored in the literature,             is that the behavior of market

expectations is driven by economic agents at the margin who are eliminat-

ing unexploited profit opportunities. Market expectations are unlikely,

therefore, to be well measured by the average expectations of survey
                  1
respondents

        Another approach is to use futures market data to examine real

interest rate behavior. Futures market data can be used to directly

construct own—commodity real interest rates --                i.e.   ,   the   ex-ante real

return on a bond in terms of specific commodities —- and then the

own-commodity real rates can be used to make inferences about the real
                                                     3




interest rate for the aggregste economy.                     As pointed out by Nishkin

(1987),   however, this approach also runs into problems because own-

commodity real rates constructed using futures market data contain

information not only about the real interest rate for the aggregate

economy or for a particular sector, but also about ex ante relative price

movements for the particular commodity. Since, as demonstrated in

Mishkin (1987), these ex ante relative price movements                     (which can be

thought of as noise) are far greater in magnitude than movements in the

aggregate real interest rate (the signal), then the noise-to-signal ratio

in own-commodity real rates will be very high.                    Own-commodity real rates

constructed using futures market data will thus contain little informa-

tion about the aggregate real interest rate of primary concern to

economists.2

      Although the ex ante real interest rate is not directly observable,

the ex post real interest rate, which is the actual real return from

holding the one-period bond from t to t+1 is observable.                    It is defined

as,


                                     -
(2)                eprr
                             =              =
                                                rr       -




where,
             = the ex post real interest rate on the one-period bond at
      eprr
                 time   t:   i.e.,       the realized real return from time t to t+1.

             =   the   actual inflation rate from time t to t + 1.

             = the inflation forecast error,
                                             7t
                                                -                 7t.
The approach for measuring ex ante real interest rates                   outlined here

makes use of ex post real interest rate data with the assumption of

rational expectations. Specifically, the assumption of rational
                                                             4




expectations implies that inflation forecast errors are unforecastable
                                                                              =   0,
given any information at time t:                         i.e.,    E(ct)                where E(. ..I4) is

the mathematical expectations operator conditional on all information

available at time

        If the ex ante                cal rate is correlated with observable variables,

       we can describe the cx ante real Interest rate as a linear projection

onto


                                  =         +
(3)                          rr       XtB       Ut


where,
             = a set         of variables in the svailable information set

             =   the     error from projecting                    onto   X,   which by definition is
        Ut                                                   rr
                 uncorrelsted with              X.
Finally, combining equations (1) through (3) we obtsin the following

regression equation,


                                                     -
(4)                          eprrXtB+u                   at

        Since data on                       and      are observable, equation (4) can be
                                  eprr
estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) and hypothesis tests can be

conducted on           13.    Measures of the ex ante real rate can be constructed

from the fitted values obtained from the OLS estimate of this regression

equation: i.e.,


(5)                               =
                             ir       XtJOLS


In a similar fashion, estimates of expected inflation are generated by


                                                         -
(6)                          ftt      i - ?r                  XtiOLS
                                        5



     The question arises:      what are the properties of the estimated B's

and of the measures of the ex ante real interest rate and expected

inflation described above.      The answers to this question are outlined

briefly in the following set of econometric points.       More formal demon-

strations of these points can be found in Mishkin (1981a, 1984a).

1.   The
           60LS estimate is a consistent estimate of the projection

     equation B in (4).      This follows directly from the fact that
                                                                          u   is

     orthogonal to    X   by definition, while    is also orthogonal to

     because      is in the information set      and rational expectations

               that       is orthogonal to any information included in
     implies
                      c
     Another way of thinking about the result is that a regression using

     ex post real rates      will asymptotically yield the same estimates of

     B as a regression using ex ante real rates.       Thus we can make

     inferences about the relationship of the ex ante real interest rate

     with variables known at time t via ex post real rate regressions,

     even though the ex ante real rate is unobservable.

2.   However, we do lose information by using ex post real rates in a

     regression rather than ex ante real rates.      The appearance of the

                      in the ex post real rate regression equation (5) means
     error term   c
     that        will have higher standard errors and will be measured less

     precisely.    Furthermore, as a result, the statistical power of tests

     on the B-coefficients may be quite low.

3.   The B and its consistent estimate           do not imply causation from

     X     to the ex ante real rate for two reasons:    (i) the    variables

     are not necessarily exogenous and (ii) information relevant to real

     rates that is correlated with
                                       X may have been excluded from the
     explanatory variables of the regression equation. Without further
                                             0




     identifying iniormation, the                    can be intecpceted only aa

     reflecting the correlation of cx ante real ratea with the

     variables.

4.   The         and       eetimates wiil be good estimates of real interest

     rates and expected inflation only if the variance of the    error
                                                              Ut
     term is smsil.         This will be the case if no ceievant information is

     excluded from the ex post real rate regression or if the relevsnt

     information left out is highly correlated with
                                                                   X.                         -




5.   An important diagnostic check for a good specification of                          that

                                 involves exsmining the residuals
     produces a small        u                                             from the cx

     post resl rate regression to see if they are white noise.                        Under

     rational expectations,         c   is serially uncorrelated because with the

     holding period matching the observation interval (non-overlapping

     data), all past        Ca   are in the information set             and are thus

     uncorrelated with              On the other hand,
                              s.3                               u may   be autororrelated

     or correlated with past values of                    If this is the case and the
                                                     c.
     varianre nf       u   is large, then the regression residual,
                                                                              u   -        will
     be serially correlated.          However, if the variance of         u   is small,

     then the regression residual,         u     -        is   dominated by
                                                                              c   and is

     necessarily serially uncorrelated. Thus the absence of serial

     correlation in the residuals          of the ex post real rate regression is

     a necessary condition for a small variance of                      and hence for good
                                                                  u,
           and     estimates.
     irt
6.   In order for OLS to yield correct standard errors for the

     13—estimates, the regression residuals must satisfy the Gausa-Flarkov

     conditions that they not be heteroscedaatic or aerially correlated.

     Satisfying the diagnostic check described above is therefore also
                                         7




        important because it helps insure that the OLS standard errors of

        the coefficients are correct.5




 III.     Real Interest Rates for the Aggregate Economy: What Do We Know?



        Using the methodology above, a number of basic facts about the

behavior of the real interest rates have been uncovered. The ioterested

reader is directed to papers by Fama, Nelson and         Schwert, Mishkin

(1981a,    1984a,   1984b) Fama and Gibbons, Summers (1983), Fluizinga and

Mishkin (1984, 1986), and Cumby and Nishkin (1986).         Note that all of

these results involve      the measurement of an ex ante real interest rate

for the aggregate economy in which inflation is measured with a broad—

based price index such as the CPI.

1.      The hypothesis that the real interest rate is constant (i.e., that

        B-coefficients on all variables except the constant term equal zero

        In equation (4) is strongly rejected for most sample periods. Only

        in the unusual sample period from 1953 to 1971 studied by Fama,        In

        which there was very little variation in the data, is the constancy

        of the real rate not rejected.       Even in this sample period, the

        failure to reject constancy of the real rate should not be taken as

        strong evidence that the real interest rate was constant in that

        period; rather it appears to be a reflection of the lack of statis-

        tical power of tests on the B-coefficients.

2.      The real interest rate is negatively correlated with expected

        inflation.    This finding is an extremely robust one, having been

        found for sample periods going back over a hundred years and for

        other countries besides the United States.       Another way of
                                       8




      characterizing this reault is that bonds have been a poor inflation

     hedge even in an ex ante sense.

3.   Iocreaaed money aupply growth is aaaociated with a decline in real

     interest rates.    However, little evidence has been foond that money

     growth affects real interest rates other than through its effect on

     fnflation,   although this result could be due to the low power of the

     atatistical tests.

4.   In the postwar period in the United States, fluctuationa in nominal

     interest ratea have typically reflected changes in expected infla-

     tion rather than in real interest rates.       This so-called Fiaher

     effect in which there is a high correlation between nominal interest

     rates and expected inflation is not a general phenomenon.      There is

     little evidence of a Fisher effect in the U.S. in the period between

     the two world wars and during the
                                       change in Federal Reserve operat-

     ing procedurea from October 1979 to November 1982.

5.   Movements in nominal interest rates are often not a reliable indica-

     tor of movements in real rates.       The correlation of nominal interest

     rates with real rates in the U.S. has been found to be negative in

     most of the postwar period, with the exception of the October 1979

     to October 1982 period.   However, in that period, nominal interest

     rates became highly positively correlated with real interest rates,

     moving one-for-one with them.

6.   Other countries often display a different relationship between

     nominal interest rates with eitber expected inflation or real

     interest rates than is found in the U.S. Even before 1979, several

     other countries had only a very weak Fisher effect with low correla-
                                            9



       tion between nominal interest rates and expected inflation, yet have

       had a strong positive correlation between nominal and real rates.

7.     Real interest rates were extremely high during the contraction phase

       of the Great Depression. From the perspective of real interest

       rates, money was extremely tight         in this period.

8.     Real intorest rate were positive in the 1950a and 60s, turned

       negative in the mid to late 1970s, jumped up dramatically in the

       early 1980a to levels comparable to those during the contraction

       phase of the Great Depression, and although having declined somewhat

       have continued to remain at levels above those in the SOs and 60s.

9.     Real interest rates in other developed countries do tend to move in

       tandem with those in the United States.            Just as in the U.S., real

       interest rates in these countries declined from the 1960s to the

       70s, and then rose to levels unprecedented in the postwar period.

       Although there is a statistically significant link between real

       interest rates in these countries and those in the U.S., real rates

       in these countries do not move one-for-one with those           in the U.S.

       As a result, the equality of real interest rates across countries

       can be strongly rejected.

       An important puzzle in the list of facts above is why real interest

rates became so high in the 1980a.          Politicians and many economiata blame

the high real rates on the dramatic jump in the U.S. budget deficit after

1981, but closer scrutiny of the data does not give strong support             to

this   view.

points to monetary policy as the source of high real interest rates.

years is such an important one, particularly to the agricultural sector,

it is worthwhile describing the evidence for the conclusion that the high

real interest rates in the 1980s are a monetary phenomenon.

     Modern monetary theory {Lucasj suggests that regime changes have an

important impact on the stochastic process of many economic variables.

With the change in monetary regime in October 1979, the Fed changed the

method of conducting monetary policy;      in order to reverse the inflation-

ary monetary policy of the l970s.     The basic question is whether this

disinflationary, monetary regime change is associated with a shift in the

stochastic process of real interest rates which resulted in the high real

rates in the 1980a.

     The answer appesrs to be yes.     When the Fed sltered its behavior in

October 1979, there was s statistically significant shift in the stochas-

tic process of real interest rates.     In addition, if one asks when the

shift in the stochsstic process of real rstes actually occurred, statis-

tical evidence indicates that it corresponded exactly to the October 1979

change in the monetary policy regime.      These results point the finger at

Volcker's change to a disinflationary monetary policy regime as a major

factor causing the high level of real rates.

     The research strategy described above is one in which we look for a

clearly definable historical event such as the October 1979 change in

Federal Reserve operating procedures, and then see if there is a signifi-

cant change in the behavior of a particular economic variable immediately

afterwards.   Suppose that for historical reasons we know the first event

is exogenous, so that it occurs as a result of an independent action that

could not possibly be caused by the other economic variable.      Then when a

significant change in the economic variable follows the exogenous event,

we have strong evidence that the first event is     raus the    change in the
                                      11




behavior of the economic variable.       In a sense then, we are treating the

October 1979 change in the Fed operating procedures as an exogenous event

--   in   other words, a controlled experiment -- and when we see the shift

in the behavior of the real interest rate, we are aacribing causation

from the monetary regime shift to the change in real rate behavior.

      The approach described above actually provides identification using

historical knowledge to rule out such problems as reverae causation.        It

is one method for getting around the identification problem posed by the

rational expectations revolution [see SimsJ.      However, one danger of sucb

a hiatorical-econometric approach is that it runs the danger of fitting

one historical episode with one tailor-made theory.      Truly convincing

evidence that the Fed's monetary policy regime change led to high real

interest ratea must involve examination of similar "controlled experi-

ments" in other time periods.     Examination of another episode of a

monetary regime shift in 1920 that has many similarities to the October

1979 shift provides exactly this kind of evidence.

      At the beginning of 1920, the pursuit of the real bills doctrine by

the Fed led to rapid money supply growth, a sustained high level of

inflation with double digit levels similar to that of the late 1970s, and

a weak dollar.      In January and June of 1920, the Fed decided to reverse
                                                                      --
its inflationary monetary policy by raising the discount rate sharply

by   1 1/4% in January and 1% in June.     In the early years of the Fed,

changing the discount rate was the main tool of monetary policy, and it

was particularly potent at this time because the total amount of member

bank borrowing from the Fed exceeded the amount of nonborrowed reserves.

The result of this policy was a rapid disinflation (in fact, a defla—
                                       12




tion).     This disinflstion was similar to the one we saw in the early

1980a and thus we might expect to find parallels between the two periods.

        The empicical analysis of the period surrounding 1920 reveals a

significant shift in the stochastic process of real interest rates which

has many similarities to the experience of the 1980s.      Not only is the

shift significant, but the dating of the shift is coincident with the

Fed's taking action to raise the discount rate in June 1920.     Further-

more, the 1920 monetary regime change and the subsequent disinflation is

associated with a strengthening of the correlation of nominal interest

rates    and real interest rates and a shift to a sustained higher level of

real interest rates.7     The striking correspondence between the impact of

the monetary regime shifts on real interest rates in 1920 and 1979

provides strong support for the view that the rerent shift in real rate

behsvior is a monetary phenomenon.     Particularly important in this regard

is that high budget deficits were not a feature of the 1920s,8     thus

suggesting that monetary factors are more important than budget deficits

to the recent behavior of real interest rates.9

        Now that we have discussed what we know about real interest rate

behavior for the aggregate economy, we might ask whether the real inter-

est rate that is more applicable to the agricultural sector has behaved

in a similar way.     Tbia is what we turn to now.



         IV.   Real Interest Rate Behavior for the Agricultural Sector



        Clearly, there is no unique real interest rate.   The real rate

depends not only on the risk characteristics of the particular security

being studied, but, more importantly, also on the price index used to
                                            13




calculate real returns.       The real interest rate relevant to production

decisions in the agricultural sector is not the real interest rate

calculated with a broad-based price index such as the CPI, the one

discussed above.     Instead, a real interest rate relevant to the agricul-

tural sector should be measured with a price index that reflects the

prices of agricultural output.

      Using the farm products component of the producer price index and

one-month Treasury bills, ex post real interest rates for the agricultur-

al sector have been constructed for the January 1953 - December 1986

sample period.     Ex post real rate regressions for the pre-October 1979

and post-October 1979 sample periods have been run using the same explan-

atory variables as in }{uizinga and Mishkin (1986), but the only explana-

tory variable with a statistically significant coefficient in either

period is the one-month bill rate (i).'0 Even with just this one

explanatory variable in the regressions, the diagnostic check for serial

correlation of the residuals does not reveal any evidence of serial

correlation.'' Not only are the Durbin-Watson statistics near two, but

Q-statistics cannot reject that the first twelve autocorrelstions of the

residuals    are zero.    Thus there is no evidence that the specification of

the       information set is inadequate.           The regression results with
      X
standard erors of coefficients in parenthesis are as follows:'2

           = .080      Standard Error = 26.48                 Durbin-Watson = 1.73


     The first striking feature of these results ia the very large

standard error of the regression,            whirh is on the order of 30 percentage

points.    Since the absence of serial correlation in the residuals sug-

gests that most of the variation of the regression residuals ran be

attributed to the forerast error of inflation,                    these regressions indirate

that one-month forerast errors for farm products inflation have a stan-

dard deviation of thirty percentage points at an annual rate. On the

other hand, for the same time periods, standard errors of the regression

for ex post real rate regressions using the CPI price index are                   on the

order of 2 to 2.5 percentage points,'3 which is less than one-tenth as

large.    The exceedingly large forecast errors for farm products inflation

is not surprising considering how volatile far prices are, but it does

mean, as the earlier discussion of methodology suggests,                   that ex post

real rate regressions for the agricultural sector will have low statisti-

cal power.   This helps explain why only the T-bill rate is found to be a

significant explanatory variable in the regressions.

     Despite the low statistical power, the ex post real rate regressions

above for farm products yield similar conclusions to ones estimated using

the CPI price index.       They suggest that in the pre-October 1979 period ex

ante real rates for the agricultural sector are negatively correlated

with nominal interest rates, while after the monetary regime shift in

1979 they become positively correlated.               In addition,      an F-test for the

stability of the coefficients in the two sample periods indicates that
                                       15




the stochastic process of real rates for the farm sector also undergoes a

significant shift in October 1979: F(2,404) = 3.57 while the critical

value at the 5% level is 3.00.

     Using the fitted values of the above regressions    to construct

measures of expected farm products inflation, we can run regressions of

ex post real rates on expected inflation. The results are that the

coefficient on expected inflation is — .35 in the pre—October 1979 period

with a standard error of .34, and the coefficient is -1.58 in the post-

October 1979 period, also with a standard error of     3414    Thus,   just as

with results using broader-based price indices such as the CPI, real

rates for farm products are found to be negatively correlated with

expected inflation.

     Figure   1   displays the estimates of the real interest rate for farm

products derived from the above regressions, along with 95% confidence

intervals for these estimates.'5 We see that over the January 1953 to

October 1979 period the estimated real rate is relatively constant but

has a slight downward trend.     The real rate has an average of 1% over the

period, bat has small negative values in the late 1970s.      After October

1979, the behavior of the real rate changes dramatically.      It jumps to

near the 30% level in the 1980-81 period, with even the lower bound of

the 95% confidence interval above ten percent, and it remains     high

afterwards. The real rate estimates for the agricultural sector in

Figure 1 suggest one factor that baa led to the difficulties of the

agricultural sector in the 1980a is that farmers faced a real coat of

borrowing in terms of their production of almoat 30% in 1980-81 and an

average of 10% for the entire November 1979 to December 1986 period.

Real rates of this magnitude certainiy have made life for the American

farmer a difficult one in recent years.

     A natural question to ask is: has the striking behavior of real

interest rates for the agricultural sector been similar to that of real

interest rates for the aggregate economy. This question is answered in

Figure 2 which compares estimated ex ante real rates for farm products

with estimated ex ante real rates using the CPI price index.16 As we can

see in Figure   2,   the general pattern of real rate movements is the same

for the aggregate economy and for the agricultural sector.       The aggregate

real rate also has small positive values in the 1950s and 60s, has small

negative values in the late l970s, then also jumps dramatically to levels

above 8% in the 1980-81 period and remains high thereafter.       Indeed the

real rate for the agricultural sector looks like an amplified movement of

the real rate for the aggregate economy.       This is confirmed by regressing

the estimated real rate for farm products on the CPI estimated real rate.

The estimated coefficient on the CPI real rate is 1.52 with a standard

error of.70,'7 so that there is s statistically significant comovement of

these two series (t =    2.16)    in which the farm products real rate moves

more than one-for-one with the CPI real rate.

     The evidence presented in this paper indicates that real interest

rates for the agricultural economy have been extremely high in the 1980s

and that their behavior seems to be linked to that found for real rates

in the aggregate economy.        What has been the source of these high real

effort by the monetary aothorities to disinflate the economy.      However,

the brunt of the Fed's disinflationary policy has fallen more heavily on

the farm sector which has had to face far higher real rates than the rest

of the economy.   Although breaking the hack of inflation was certainly a

worthy goal for the Fed, farmers have had to pay a heavy price.      They

have had to suffer for the sins of an economy that was excessively

inflationary, which then had to he brought back into line with

disinflationary policy.

      data case of footnote 3 in which           is serially correlated, the OLS
                                             t
      standard errors of the coefficients will be inrorrert.        The standard

      errors rsn be corrected, however, using the techniques outlined by

      Hansen and Hodrick and Cumby, Huiziuga and Obstfeld [see references

      in Huizinga and Hishkin (1986)]

 6.   For example, see Blsnrhard and Summers and Evans.

 7.   The 1920 regime shift is also associated with a weakening of the

      Fisher effect, just as occurred after October 1979.

 8.   Although the federal government ran substantial budget deficits in

      the years 1917-1919 as a result of World War I, there were budget

      surpluses in every year from 1920 to 1929.

 9.   Note that financial deregulation, investment tax credits and oil

      price shocks were also not present in the 1920s.        Thus the rorre-

      spondenre between the l920s and the 1980s of real interest rate

      behavior also weakens the case that these were important fsrtors

      affecting recent real rate behavior.

10.   The list of explanatory variables examined included the one—month

      bill rate, two lags of the inflation rate (calculated using the farm

      products price index) and one lag of a supply shock variable mea-

      sured as the relative price of energy in the PPI.

11.   Goldfeld-Quandt tests also reveal no evidence of heterosredastirity

      in the post-October 1979 sample period, but do reject homosredas-

      ticity in the pre-October 1979 period.        However, when the pre-

      October 1979 regression is rerun with a weighted least squares
                                      20




      correction for heteroscedasticity along the lines of Glesjer, the

      cesults are very similar to those reported in the text; the coeffi-

      cient of the bill rate is still negative and insignificantly differ-

      ent from zero.

12.   The one-month bill rate data was obtained from the Center for

      Security Prices (CRSP) at the University of Chicago.      The bill rate

      and ex post real rate are continuously compounded percentages at an

      annual rate.     The timing of the data is as follows:   A January bill

      rate observation uses the end of December bill rate, while the

      January observation for the one-month inflation rate is calculated

      as the logarithmic change from the December to January values of the

      farm products ppi index (multiplied by 1200 to put it as percent at

      an annual rate).     The January ex post real rate observation equals

      the January bill rate observation minus the January farm products

      inflation observation.

13.   Huizinga and Nishkin (1986) reports the standard errors of these

      regressions on page 247.     Note, however, that the Huizinga-Nishkin

      standard errors have to be multiplied by 1200 to be in percent at an

      annual rate.

14.   The standard errors of the expected inflation coefficient are

      estimated with an instrumental variables procedure described by

      NcCallum and Pagan [see references in Huizinga and Mishkin (1986)].

      This is necessary because OLS estimates of the standard errors will

      be incorrect since OLS estimation involves a two-step procedure in

      which expected inflation is estimated first and then ex post real

      rates are regressed on this measure.

15.   The formula for the confidence interval ia derived under the

      reasonable aasumption that the variance of inflation forecaat errors

      are large relative to the variance of        The formula ia given in

      r1iahkin (1981a).

16.   The estimated rates using the CPI price index are estimated using

      the regression specification of Huizinga and Mishkin (1986)

17.   For reasons similar to those described in footnote 14, correct

      standard errors of this coefficient are obtained with an instrumen-

      tal variables technique.   This procedure is described in Cunhy and

      tlishkin.
