                                            ABSTRACT

This paper takes an historical perspectives approach to the current episode of global imbalances.

I consider four historical episodes which may give some indications as to whether the adjustment

to U.S. current account deficit will lead to a 'benign' or 'gloomy' outlook. The episodes are: the
transfer of capital in the earlier era of globalization the late nineteenth century; the interwar gold

exchange standard; Bretton Woods; and the 1977-79 dollar crisis. I conclude that adjustment in

earlier era of globalization has more resonance for the current imbalance than the other scenarios.

                     Historical Perspectives on Global Imbalances

1. Introduction

         Current concern over the possible unpleasant consequences of unwinding the

global imbalances reflected in a large U.S. current account deficit and comparable current

account surpluses in East Asia has led to a discussion of reform of the international

monetary system. Some have called for a new Bretton Woods system (Uzan 2004) others

for strengthening the mechanisms of policy coordination developed in the 1980’s (King

2005).

         An historical approach may be useful in putting matters in perspective. The

present international monetary regime of managed floating was preceded by three

regimes which had different experiences with imbalances and their adjustment. Under the

classical gold standard with fixed exchange rates, smooth adjustment to imbalances

occurred through the price specie flow mechanism and capital flows with a very limited

role for monetary policy.

         The interwar gold exchange standard which tried to replicate the performance of

the gold standard failed because, opposite to the gold standard, monetary authorities

subsumed external balance to domestic considerations and because the U.S. and France,

key surplus countries, were unwilling to allow the necessary adjustment of rising prices,

thereby imposing the burden of deflation and recession on the U.K., the key deficit

country.

         The Bretton Woods system was established in 1944 to overcome the fatal flaws of

the interwar. Adjustment to imbalances was supposed to be symmetrical between deficit

and surplus countries with international reserves and IMF assistance to serve as buffers to




                                            2
international shocks. It broke down because it evolved into a gold dollar system under

which the central reserve country did not have to adjust to a growing balance of payments

deficit and which required the central reserve country, the United States, to follow stable

monetary policy, which it did until 1965 when it shifted to an inflationary policy; and

because the Bretton Woods system required capital controls, which as time went by,

became ineffective (Bordo 1993).

       The present system of managed floating has gone through several cycles of

perceived misalignment since 1973, which like today, were viewed with alarm. After a

rocky start in the 1970’s adjustment has been relatively smooth working primarily

through the exchange rate, relative prices and domestic expenditure.

       In this paper I first discuss the current set of imbalances, contrasting the views of

those who consider its resolution as benign with those who expect it to be painful. I then

give some historical evidence from each of the four regimes which may have some

resonance for today. I consider the smooth adjustment to the massive international

transfer of capital in the pre 1914 period and then contrast them to three episodes which

were less benign: the late 1920’s and early 1930’s; the breakdown of Bretton Woods

1965 to 1971; and the so called dollar crisis of 1977-79. In conclusion I consider the

questions: how does today’s experience fit in with the historical patterns and is there a

valid case for international monetary reform.




                                            3
2. The Current Situation

The Gloomy view

       Recent concerns over global imbalances associated with the U.S. current account

deficit to GDP ratio in excess of 5 % (see figure 1) and U.S. net foreign liabilities of $2.7

trillion or 25% of GDP (see figure 2) have raised fears of a drastic readjustment involving

a massive depreciation of the dollar (as large as 90% in some scenarios [Blanchard et al

2005]) - - it has already fallen about 30% in nominal trade weighted terms against our

major trading partners (see figure 3) - - with attendant potentially serious effects on the

U.S. and global economies [ See e.g. Obstfeld and Rogoff (2004)]. The adjustment would

involve reallocation of consumption and production in the U.S. from non traded to traded

goods, a possible rise in inflation, leading to greater tightening of monetary policy which

would induce a recession. The decline in income would reduce both the demand for

imports and domestic consumption and encourage domestic saving, simultaneously

improving the two faces of imbalance - - the current account and the savings investment

gap.

       At the same time the adjustment would have opposite effects in Europe and Japan,

areas with current account surpluses and excess savings (see figures 4 and 5). To the

extent that European nominal rigidities prevent it from adjusting to the decline in demand

for its exports to the U.S., its real economy could suffer. China with its currency pegged

to the dollar would not have to adjust much and would gain a competitive advantage in

the U.S. market especially against Europe.

       In addition, it is argued that to the extent that the imbalances have been financed

by foreign, especially East Asian central banks accumulation of U.S. treasury bills (up to




                                             4
65% of their international reserves) that some point will be reached where they will dump

their depreciating dollar assets and shift their portfolios towards the euro, thereby

aggravating the situation.

       The current situation is often attributed to the IT boom of the 1990’s which

induced a massive private capital inflow into U.S. equity markets. The bursting of the

tech boom (bubble) in 2000 followed by 9/11, a U.S. recession and the Afghanistan and

Iraq wars led to a shift of the U.S. budget deficit from surplus to a deficit of close to 4%

of GDP. This twin deficit problem is viewed as a key determinant of the deteriorating

situation (Frankel 2004).



The Benign View

       An alternate view does not regard the outlook in such bleak terms. It posits that

adjustment will be smooth, protracted and benign, very much like what happened in the

late 1980’s when the U.S. current account deficit recorded a peak of about 4% of GDP.

This view (see e.g. Greenspan 2003) stresses the underlying force of financial

globalization - - a burgeoning phenomenon since the 1970’s, which has encouraged

residents of open economies to increase their holdings of foreign assets as a way to

diversify portfolios and smooth out shocks to consumption.

       Global assets and liabilities have mushroomed in the past 3 decades, especially in

the 1990’s [Lane and Milesi-Ferreti (2005)]. Globalization and a decline in home bias - -

a tendency of domestic investors to prefer domestic assets in their portfolios - - have

deepened and broadened financial markets around the world and above all in the U.S,




                                             5
which has seen a disproportionate growth in the demand for its assets because it offers a

higher real rate of return based on the economy’s long-run good performance.

         Moreover according to Bernanke (2005), the imbalances largely reflect a glut in

global savings partially reflecting the aging of populations in Japan and some European

countries but primarily reflecting a reaction by East Asian monetary authorities to the

effects of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990’s. These central banks prefer to hold

dollar assets to protect themselves against similar shocks.

         Thus in this view the current account deficit and the rise in U.S. net foreign

liabilities reflect the demand for U.S. instruments by foreigners. Adjustment, to the extent

it needs occur will be benign because the underlying long-run positive fundamentals will

continue, and for two additional reasons: valuation effects - - that to the extent dollar

depreciation is unexpected, it will reduce the value of U.S. foreign liabilities (Gourinchas

and Rey 2004); and a reduced pass through - - recent empirical evidence shows that only

a very small fraction of dollar depreciation passes through to higher inflation (Greenspan

2005).



3. Globalizing Capital Flows and the adjustment mechanism: a benign outcome a

century ago.

         A different and perhaps enlightening perspective on the issue is to delve into

economic history for earlier episodes of global imbalances which may have some

resonance for today and which may tell us what is in store for the future. An important

precedent for the benign outcome view is the previous era of financial globalization from




                                             6
1870-1914. It was characterized by a rapid global buildup of external assets and liabilities

and also of long-standing current account imbalances comparable to today’s experience.

       The fifty years before World War I saw massive net private flows of capital from

the core countries of Western Europe to the countries of recent settlement overseas

(mainly the rapidly developing Americas and Australasia), financing railroads and other

infrastructure as well as budget deficits (especially in the form of bonds but also in the

form of foreign direct investment). At the peak, the associated current account surpluses

in Britain reached 9 percent of GDP and were almost as big in France, Germany, and the

Netherlands (See figure 6). For the principal capital importers in the late nineteenth

century (Argentina, Australia, and Canada), current account deficits exceeded 5 percent

of GDP on average. Earlier in the century, the U.S. experienced similar flows but by

century’s end it began to run current account surpluses.

       In addition data on ratios of stocks of foreign assets and liabilities to GDP for

selected countries and regions compiled in Obstfeld and Taylor (2003), presents a picture

of a u – shaped pattern. At its pre 1914 peak the share of foreign assets to world GDP was

approximately 20%. It declined from that level to a low point of 5% in 1945 with the

prewar level only being reached by 1985. Since then it has risen to 57% by 1995. A

similar picture emerges from the ratio of liabilities to overall GDP.

       The British held the lion’s share of overseas investments in 1914, 50% followed

by France at 22%, Germany at 17%, Netherlands at 3% and the U.S. at 6.5%. This

compares with the U.S. holding of global assets in 1995 at 25%. These funds in turn

represented up to one half of the capital stock of one of the major debtors (Argentina) and

close to one fifth for Australia and Canada.




                                               7
       A striking feature of the pre 1914 data is the persistence in the current account

imbalances. Bordo, Eichengreen and Kim (1998), using the coefficients of an AR(1)

regression as well as augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test find evidence of significantly

greater persistence in both the deficits of the principal capital recipients and the capital

exporters compared to the recent experience. Similar evidence is seen in variance ratios

calculated by the authors.

       Finally the adjustment mechanism to the massive capital transfer worked very

smoothly. It occurred through the price specie flow mechanism of the classical gold

standard (Bordo 1984). The transfer of long-term capital from Europe to the New World

to finance railroads and other infrastructure was also accompanied by gold flows as the

demand, for example for U.S. railroad bonds by British investors led to a demand for

dollars hence pushing the dollar to the gold import point. The gold inflows in turn tended

to raise the price of U.S. exports relative to imports, i.e. to improve the terms of trade, (as

well as raise the ratio of the prices of traded and non traded goods). It also allowed the

U.S. to import more goods than otherwise – much of these imports consisting of capital

goods e.g. rails from Britain. As relative prices adjusted the gold flows would tend to be

reversed closing the imbalance. Moreover short-term capital movements speeded up

adjustment as gold flows into the U.S. reduced interest rates relative to Britain.

       The smooth adjustment to the capital transfers of the pre 1914 era many believe

reflects the fact that the world was on the gold standard which provided a stable and

credible nominal anchor. The gold standard also served as a signal of fiscal rectitude (“a

good housekeeping seal of approval” which assured investors that their debt would be

repaid and serviced. [Bordo and Rockoff 1996]). Also many of the capital recipients were




                                              8
part of the British Empire. The latter established institutions and safeguards such as

giving colonial (Dominion) government debt trustee status in the UK (i.e. having a de

facto British government guarantee) which virtually eliminated country risk.


       However the adjustment mechanism in the earlier era of globalization was not

always benign. Indeed although current account imbalances were more long-lived in the

pre 1914 era than in the recent period, they were punctuated in some countries by severe

reversals, especially in the crisis ridden 1890’s (Bordo and Eichengreen 1999). The

classic financial crisis of the era was the Barings crisis of 1890 which began with a debt

default in Argentina and spread like wildfire to the rest of the emerging world. Lenders in

London and Paris cut off capital flows to emerging countries like Brazil (Triner and

Wandschneider 2005) with fundamentals similar to those of Argentina, while other

countries deemed sound such as Canada were only marginally effected (Bordo and

Murshid 2000). Thus the emerging market crisis problem had historical precedents. Most

of the countries affected, those of Latin America and Southern Europe, lacked the

fundamentals i.e. institutions and policies, associated with the more successful recipients.


       Although the imbalances of the previous age of globalization has considerable

resonance for today - - especially the fact that both eras were characterized by stable meta

regimes - - the gold standard then and the adherence by many countries today to credible

domestic nominal anchors such as inflation targeting and norms for fiscal balance, there

are also considerable differences. First, under the gold standard, countries of new

settlement—the emerging markets of the time—ran current account deficits while the

major European economies ran surpluses. In the current era, major economies as well as

emerging markets can run both persistent deficits or surpluses.


                                             9
       Second, gross capital flows are much larger today and gross asset and liability

positions were very close to net positions before 1914, in contrast to today where most

major industrial countries are both major creditors and debtors. The earlier pattern

reflects the prevalence of long-term investment by the core countries in the countries of

new settlement. The substantial growth of two-way flows between advanced countries

since 1980 have been associated with both international financial diversification and

intertemporal consumption smoothing.

       Third, the adjustment mechanism is different. The historical record shows that

adjustment to the significant and persistent external imbalances in the pre-1914 era

occurred largely through the Humean price-specie-flow mechanism of the classical gold

standard. In contrast, the global economy is now on a managed floating exchange rate

regime and instead of gold flows, the brunt of the external adjustment occurs through

changes in the exchange rate and international reserves, along with relative price

movements, short-term capital flows, and valuation effects (Obstfeld, 2004).

       Finally in the pre 1914 era, Great Britain was the dominant country. Its currency

the pound, served as the international medium of exchange and as a key reserve asset.

Great Britain ran considerable current account surpluses throughout the period. By

contrast, the U.S. is the dominant economy today and the dollar is the key currency.

However the U.S. has been running persistent current account deficits.

4. Further lessons from history: Some Bad Outcomes

       History also gives three other not so rosy scenarios of global imbalances and how

they were adjusted too: the interwar gold exchange standard, the Bretton Woods system

and the 1977-79 dollar crises.

The Interwar

       World War I ended the classical gold standard as all of the belligerents except the

US abandoned gold convertibility. Private capital flows also ceased. After the war, by

1926, the major countries returned to a variant of the gold standard, the gold exchange

standard in which members held most of their international reserves in dollars, sterling,

and francs and the US, Great Britain and France held gold.

       But the interwar gold standard had serious flaws which prevented smooth

adjustments to the imbalances that built up (Meltzer 2003, Eichengreen 1992). The key

problem was that the major countries returned to gold at misaligned real exchange rates.

All the belligerents had serious inflations during the war and the restoration of the

original gold parities involved deflation and recession. As it turned out Britain restored

parity at $4.86 with an overvalued real exchange rate while France and Germany each

greatly devalued their currencies and restored parities at undervalued real levels (see

figure 7). The U.S. never left the gold standard but U.S. prices did not return to the

prewar level so that its real exchange rate was also undervalued. This misalignment

meant that the U.S., France and Germany tended to run current account surpluses while

Britain, and its empire and countries economically linked to it, ran deficits. Under the

gold standard, this meant that gold tended to flow towards the surplus countries. Also

under the gold standard rules, both creditors and debtors were supposed to adjust to the




                                           11
imbalances: creditors by allowing domestic price levels to rise; debtors by deflation. As it

turned out both the U.S. and France continuously sterilized their gold flows and

prevented adjustment (Meltzer 2003). As a consequence they imposed deflationary

pressure on Britain and on the rest of the world.

       Another important difference between the classical and interwar gold standards

that impaired the adjustment mechanism in the latter, was the lack of credibility in the

member countries’ adherence to gold convertibility. Unlike in the earlier period, markets

had limited confidence that countries would always put external balance considerations

before domestic policy concerns (Eichengreen 1992). This meant that short-term capital

movements could be destabilizing. In the end the system collapsed after 1929 in the face

of the Great Depression. Speculative attacks against countries that used expansionary

monetary policy to alleviate banking panics and to stabilize the real economy, forced

country after country to abandon the gold standard (Eichengreen 1992). This was not the

case for the U.S. however, it had adequate gold reserves to withstand speculative attacks

(Bordo, Choudhri and Schwartz 2002). The U.S. left the gold standard in 1933 as part of

Roosevelt’s policy package to reflate the U.S. economy (Meltzer 2003).



Bretton Woods


       Under the post world war II Bretton Woods system, a distant variant of the gold

standard, the U.S. was the dominant country, with the largest gold reserves (Bordo 1993).

Under Bretton Woods rules, the U.S. had to peg the dollar to gold at $35.00 per ounce

and the rest of the world pegged to the dollar. The rest of the world used dollars as




                                            12
international reserves and the dollar served as the international medium of exchange. The

U.S. was also supposed to follow stable monetary and fiscal policies.


       During the period 1959-1971, when the system fully operated (most members had

current account convertibility), the U.S. ran persistent current account and trade surpluses

and also engaged in considerable foreign investment. The overall balance of payments

was generally in deficit and the rest of the world absorbed dollar claims (see figure 8). At

the same time it is argued that the principal continental European countries and Japan

kept their real exchange rates deliberately undervalued in order to foster export driven

growth in their economies (Dooley et al 2002). This policy meant that they kept

accumulating dollars which as did the U.S. and France in the interwar, they sterilized. It

has been argued that during this period the U.S. acted as financial intermediary to the rest

of the world, importing short-term capital (dollar claims) and exporting long-term capital

(McKinnon 1969).


       From 1961 to 1967, Europe and Japan’s holding of dollar claims convertible into

gold kept increasing relative to gold holdings in the U.S. suggesting the possibility of a

run on the dollar (see figure 9).


       McKinnon (1969), Meltzer (1991) and others have argued that the system could

have continued for an extended period as a de facto dollar standard. However two factors

led to the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. First the French resented the U.S.

‘exorbitant privilege’ of not having to adjust to its payments imbalances because it was

the principal reserve country. They wanted a return to a pure gold standard and to

facilitate this outcome they converted their outstanding dollar claims into gold. Second



                                            13
the U.S. began following inflationary monetary and fiscal policies beginning in 1965 - -

to finance the Vietnam War and the Great Society.


       The expansionary policies increased both the U.S. payments deficit and European

central bank reserves as the U.S. exported its inflation abroad. As a consequence the

Europeans begin converting their dollar claims into gold, threatening U.S. gold reserves.

The system collapsed when Richard Nixon closed the gold window in August 1971.


       It has been argued that a reincarnated Bretton Woods system exists today. China,

possibly India and other countries are seen as deliberately running an undervalued peg

against the dollar to encourage export driven growth the way Europe and Japan did 40

years ago (Dooley et al 2002). The central banks of these countries willingly accumulate

dollar assets consequent upon their current account surpluses. Dooley et al argue that

such a relationship could persist for as long as a decade to allow China to absorb its 200

million surplus agricultural workers into the manufacturing sector.


       Others argue that unlike Bretton Woods, the reincarnated system will not last for

10 years but will collapse much sooner because, unlike the Europeans in the 1960’s

Asian central banks do not have a stable cartel (Eichengreen 2004). Furthermore, in the

Bretton woods era there were no good substitutes for the dollar as the world’s reserve

asset (the pound was a reserve asset but it was weak) but today we have the euro. They

predict the system will collapse quickly.




                                            14
The U.S. 1977-1979


       After the Bretton Woods regime finally collapsed in 1973, the major countries of

the world shifted to managed floating exchange rates. Countries used exchange market

intervention to both smooth disorderly markets, and as a residual from Bretton Woods, to

maintain what were perceived to be equilibrium exchange rates. The 1970’s was also the

decade with the highest peacetime inflation rates in U.S. history. Inflation which began in

the mid 60’s, did not abate. A similar pattern occurred in most other countries with the

principal exception of Germany and Switzerland. Rising inflation (see Figure 10) was

fueled by monetary growth (see figure 11). There is considerable debate over the causes

of the Great Inflation: explanations include a mistaken belief in the Phillips curve

tradeoff; basing policy on the wrong indicators of monetary policy; and errors in the data

central bank used.


       Two oil price shocks in 1973 and 1979 were also said to have contributed heavily

to the upward trend in inflation, although some have argued that the OPEC oil price hikes

were an endogenous response to prior inflation (Barsky and Kilian 2004). The U.S., the

U.K., Canada and others used expansionary monetary policy to prevent the shocks from

reducing output and employment, Germany and Switzerland did not accommodate the oil

shocks, Japan accommodated the first but not the second. These countries had lower

inflation than the U.S. ,U.K. and Canada.


       Between 1975 and 1977, the $/Dm and $/¥ traded in a narrow range (see figure

12), then in the fall of 1977 the dollar began a rapid depreciation which continued into

1978. At the same time the U.S. was running ever larger current account deficits while


                                            15
Germany (also Switzerland) and Japan were running significant surpluses (see figure 13).

According to Solomon (1982) the imbalances triggered capital flight from the U.S. which

made things worse. The flight was triggered by concerns over the effectiveness of the

Carter administration and the belief that the U.S. was following a policy of “benign

neglect.”


       The Europeans blamed the U.S. for encouraging the depreciation of the dollar to

gain competitive advantage and for destabilizing their economies. The U.S. criticized the

Europeans and Japan for not dealing with their surpluses. Intervention by the Federal

Reserve and the Treasury in January 1978 was viewed by Solomon (1982, p. 347) as

ineffective and beginning in the late spring of 1978, the dollar fell “at a disorderly rate.”

The Fed then reacted by raising the discount rate to 8% in late September and the Carter

administration promised to trim the fiscal deficit. The dollar continued to fall.


       Then in a speech given on October 24, 1978 Carter proposed an anti inflation

package with tighter monetary and fiscal policy; voluntary wage, price controls and

regulatory reform to improve competitiveness. According to Solomon, the dollar

strengthened by close to 2% against the DM. Carter’s speech was soon followed by a

rescue package put together by the Treasury and the Fed. It included : $30 billion to

defend the dollar via an IMF drawing; increased swap lines and the issuance of $10

billion in Carter bonds (U.S. securities denominated in foreign currencies); Treasury gold

sales; and the Fed raising the discount rate to 9.5% and establishing a supplementary

reserve requirement of 2% against large time deposits.




                                             16
       In response to this package the dollar appreciated 7% against the DM and 5%

against the yen. According to Solomon (1982, p. 350) the package led to the end of belief

in the ‘benign neglect’ doctrine.


       In the summer of 1979, the dollar resumed its decline, attributed by Solomon to

the trouble the Carter administration was having in handling recession, continued

inflation, the second oil price shock and the Iran hostage crisis. In July Paul Volcker

replaced G. William Miller as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. The inflation rate

kept rising, reaching double digit figures in September 1979. On October 8, Volcker

announced his famous “ shock” involving a rise in the discount rate to 12%, an increase

in reserve requirements, and a change in operating procedure away from targeting the

federal funds rate towards a non borrowed reserves aggregate. Following that

announcement the pressure on the dollar eased.


       Compared to the present period the imbalances of 1977-1979 may seen small, at

less than 2% of GDP, but the underlying problems were far more serious. They reflected

bad monetary policy in the U.S. which created the Great Inflation. The depreciating

dollar just reflected the poor record of inflation and recession and the expectation that

monetary policy would not improve. In that sense the adjustment well reflected the

underlying fundamentals.


5. Conclusion: What will happen?


       We have illustrated four historical episodes of external imbalances and their

adjustment. The first worked remarkably well. Two ended in a collapse of the




                                           17
international monetary regime. The fourth led to a fundamental change in the monetary

regime. Which episode is more relevant to today’s environment ?


       My bet is a benign outcome like that of the pre war gold standard era. In today’s

world the underlying fundamental of globalization and the basic strength of the U.S.

economy which will continue to underpin the dollar as a reserve asset, suggest that

adjustment to the present set of imbalances will be gradual and when all is said and done

the experience will be viewed as similar to what happened in the late 1980’s.


       What is the case for international monetary reform? The interwar and Bretton

Woods debacles both reflected the collapse of regimes with fundamental flaws and the

pursuit of inappropriate policies by the major countries. The 1970’s U.S. experience

reflected a failure in domestic monetary policy and had little to do with problems in the

international monetary framework being followed. The reaction to the 1970s experiences

and to later large swings in the major country’s exchange rates led to a concerted move

by the G-7 countries towards policy coordination of which the most well known

examples were the Plaza (1985) and Louvre (1987) accords. Subsequent research has

concluded that these efforts were not very successful. To the extent that the situation

today is not too dissimilar to the earlier episodes in the 1980’s the case for coordination

does not seem evident. Moreover calls for a reinvented Bretton Woods System given the

inherent flaws the last time and its sorry experience if heeded, will no doubt lead to the

same outcome.
