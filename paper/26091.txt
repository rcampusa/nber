Formative Experiences and the Price of Gasoline

                                          ABSTRACT

An individual's initial experiences with a common good, such as gasoline, can shape their
behavior for decades. We first show that the 1979 oil crisis had a persistent negative effect on the
likelihood that individuals that came of driving age during this time drove to work in the year
2000 (i.e., in their mid 30s). The effect is stronger for those with lower incomes and those in
cities. Combining data on many cohorts, we then show that large increases in gasoline prices
between the ages of 15 and 18 significantly reduce both (i) the likelihood of driving a private
automobile to work and (ii) total annual vehicle miles traveled later in life, while also increasing
public transit use. Differences in driver license age requirements generate additional variation in
the formative window. These effects cannot be explained by contemporaneous income and do not
appear to be only due to increased costs from delayed driving skill acquisition. Instead, they seem
to reflect the formation of preferences for driving or persistent changes in the perceived costs of
driving.

1    Introduction
Behavior is often modeled as an economic choice that depends on preferences and the
current economic environment, yet observable characteristics of agents and of the eco-
nomic environment often fail to explain significant variation in behavior. In many con-
sumer choice models, remaining variation is cast as idiosyncratic preference for particu-
lar goods or outcomes (e.g., Manski and McFadden 1981; Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes
1995). Where do these observably idiosyncratic tastes come from? A growing literature
in economics argues that cumulative and recent experiences exert a significant influence
on preferences (Bronnenberg, Dubé, and Gentzkow 2012; Malmendier and Nagel 2011;
Simonsohn 2006).
    We add to this narrative by suggesting that `formative experiences' with an economic
activity shape individual behavior for decades to come. We document a striking fact:
commuters in the United States who experience a large positive shock to the price of gaso-
line while coming of driving age--and thus having their first experiences with driving--
are less likely to drive to work in a private automobile later in life. Encounters with
gasoline prices when first entering a driving environment have path-dependent effects on
transportation choices decades later. In many economic models, such path dependence
would manifest itself as individual preference heterogeneity.
    We first show that individuals who experienced the 1979 oil crisis during their forma-
tive driving years (around age 16) are 0.2-0.5 percentage points less likely than preceding
cohorts to drive to work 20 years later (at the time of the 2000 census). Because gasoline
prices increased dramatically during the oil crisis, we use an event study (or regression
discontinuity-in-time) framework to identify this effect. The effect is stronger in urban
settings with plausible alternative transportation options, and for lower-income workers.
We also find that the decrease in driving is counteracted by an increase in public transit
usage.
    We then expand the scope of the analysis to carefully identify the effect of gasoline
price movements during formative years on two aspects of driving behavior: mode of
commuting (an extensive margin) and miles traveled (an intensive margin). We study
many cohorts across many cross sections of the U.S. population and exploit variation in
gasoline prices across states and time over a long horizon to flexibly control for time-
invariant differences across locations, life-cycle (age) effects, and contemporaneous fac-
tors that influence transportation choices (e.g., current gasoline prices). Individuals re-
spond to price changes during their formative driving years much more so than to price

                                            2
levels. A doubling of the real price of gasoline between the ages of 15 and 17 leads to a
0.3-0.4 percentage point reduction in the probability of driving to work later in life and a
0.2-0.3 percentage point increase in transit usage; this corresponds well to the estimated
effect of the 1979 oil crisis. This extensive margin effect is large when workers are young
(between 25 and 34), but is also present in older workers. There is some evidence of a
smaller effect on household access to a vehicle, indicating that durable goods consump-
tion may respond to price shocks far in the past. Effects are specific to price movements
during this formative period and cannot be explained by channels such as income, edu-
cational attainment, or marital status, suggesting that preferences are indeed at work.
    Drivers that experience a doubling of real gasoline prices between ages 15 and 17 also
drive 3.4-8.2 percent fewer annual miles as adults. Using a framework similar to the
extensive margin analysis, we combine five waves of national travel survey data to de-
termine whether there is a later-life, intensive-margin effect of gasoline price movements
during formative years. This effect corresponds to roughly 900-1,100 fewer average an-
nual miles traveled for drivers in affected cohorts, conditional on having access to a ve-
hicle. Furthermore, we find that drivers that were exposed to gas price hikes early in life
are somewhat less likely to own fuel-inefficient light-duty trucks.
    Supplementary analysis strengthens these results. First, it is precisely the effect of
gasoline price shocks between ages 15 and 18 that are acting upon later-life behavior--gas
price movements earlier or later do not matter. We also allow the formative window to
vary according to state-specific driving age restrictions. An effect is present from 1 year
before to 2 years after the minimum age at which teenagers can obtain a full-privilege
license, which covers ages 15 to 18 in many states. Variation in these restrictions across
states and over time strengthen identification and lead to slightly larger effects of gasoline
price movements during formative driving years.
    We rule out a primary role for two obvious explanatory mechanisms: income and
costly skill acquisition. Gasoline price movements (and the 1979 oil crisis in particular)
are associated with recessions, and entering the labor market during a recession can de-
crease permanent income and, therefore, change later-life driving behavior. Our results
are robust to including contemporaneous income as a control, and more formal analysis
reveals that income mediates at most 24% of the observed effect, but likely much less. We
also study the effects of changes in minimum driving age to determine whether restric-
tions on learning to drive during formative years discourage take up of driving; it does
not appear to. Nor does the 1979 oil crisis lead to a delay in driver license take up at the


                                              3
national level. Further, delayed skill acquisition is unlikely to lead to the intensive-margin
effect. Together, these results indicate that driving behavior is imprinted by formative ex-
periences with gasoline prices, either through a change in preferences or a change in the
perceived cost of driving and volatility of gas prices.
    Our paper contributes to several literatures in economics. A growing empirical liter-
ature connects cumulative and recent experiences to preference formation and behavior.1
Recent experience of violence or cumulative experience of poor economic conditions can
impact risk attitudes later in life (Callen et al. 2014; Malmendier and Nagel 2011).2 Mal-
mendier and Shen (2018) show that exposure to severe unemployment spells leads to con-
sumption deviations inconsistent with the permanent income hypothesis, and Fujiwara,
Meng, and Vogl (2016) find evidence that rainy election days decrease voter turnout in
future elections. Another strand of the literature links later-life purchasing decisions of
migrants to brand availability or relative prices in places of origin (Bronnenberg, Dubé,
and Gentzkow 2012; Logan and Rhode 2010). Anderson et al. (2015) document an in-
teresting source of brand loyalty by showing that preferences for particular automobile
brands are transmitted across generations.
    Our paper contributes to these findings in several ways. First, we show that expe-
riences during a relatively narrow window in which agents are first interacting with a
good, and thus forming initial impressions and information sets, have long-run conse-
quences for behavior. The lack of an effect of gasoline price shocks after this formative
window suggests initial contact may be more important than cumulative experience for
some behaviors. We also demonstrate that relatively mundane experiences (interactions
with gasoline prices) can be important; formative experiences need not be life-changing
or extreme. Finally, our results show that price volatility (rather than price level) can
imprint later behavior.
    A smaller literature studies the behavioral determinants of location choice, commut-
ing, and vehicle choice.3 One line of research focuses on the short-run impact of recent
   1
      Theoretical foundations for `habit formation' go back to seminal work by Pollak (1970). With `habit-
forming' goods, an individual's current preferences depend on past consumption levels to which s/he has
become accustomed, and thus past prices.
    2
      Related work focuses on the impact of childhood experiences on later-life outcomes. Giuliano and
Spilimbergo (2013) show that growing up during a recession promotes redistributionary preferences, while
Brown, Cookson, and Heimer (2019) find that children growing up in financially underserved Native Amer-
ican reservations later make less use of financial products and have lower credit scores than children grow-
ing up in better-served reservations.
    3
      There is a large literature on path dependence based on the supply of transportation infrastructure--
it influences the location of cities (Davis and Weinstein 2008; Bleakley and Lin 2012; Michaels and Rauch


                                                     4
experiences. Busse et al. (2015) find that weather at the time of purchase influences vehicle
choice, while Simonsohn (2006) and Simonsohn and Loewenstein (2006) show that peo-
ple maintain reference dependence with respect to their former city of residence regarding
housing prices and commuting when moving to a new city. Another set of papers finds
short-run benefits of forced experimentation, studying the effects of incentivizing house-
holds to use public transit shortly after they move to a new location (Bamberg 2006; Yang
and Lim 2017) or of commuting behavior after being forced to travel along new routes
(Larcom, Rauch, and Willems 2017). These papers find some short- or medium-run path
dependence and rely on the experience of recent events. In contrast, our results show
persistence over the life cycle from the price variation in a three-year period.
    We also speak to a literature in urban and environmental economics that seeks to un-
derstand the short-run relationship between gasoline prices and driving behavior. Much
of this literature was spawned by volatile oil prices in the 1970s (Espey 1998). A part of
this literature studies how fleet composition responds to changes in gasoline prices (Puller
and Greening 1999) or efficiency mandates (West et al. 2017), and whether this is consis-
tent with standard models of rational expectations about gasoline prices and consumer
valuation of future fuel costs (Allcott and Wozny 2014; Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer
2013; Gillingham, Houde, and Benthem 2019; Jacobsen and van Benthem 2015; Li, Tim-
mins, and von Haefen 2009). Hughes, Knittel, and Sperling (2008) show that gasoline
usage has become more inelastic in the twenty-first century; Small and van Dender (2007)
attribute this to rising incomes.4 Gillingham, Jenn, and Azevedo (2015) explore hetero-
geneity in fuel price elasticities by geography and the fuel economy and age of the ve-
hicle. However, there is little evidence on how differences in behavior and preferences
arise. Our paper documents a new, long-run response to macroeconomic energy price
shocks which uncovers one channel that gives rise to heterogeneous driving behavior.
    The next section describes relevant information about the research setting and the data
sources that we use. We then analyze how the 1979 oil crisis continues to influence driving
patterns into the twenty-first century in an event-study framework in Section 3. Section 4
uses a more comprehensive empirical strategy to quantify the long-run effects of gasoline
prices across many cohorts of drivers. This section also separately estimates intensive and
2018), urban form (Brooks and Lutz 2019), and regional growth (Donaldson and Hornbeck 2016).

      Recent papers investigate if millennials have different preferences for driving than the previous gen-
eration (Klein and Smart 2017; Knittel and Murphy 2019; Leard, Linn, and Munnings 2019). These papers
find that vehicle ownership and driving patterns are relatively similar once income and demographics are
accounted for. In contrast, our paper documents a source for preference heterogeneity that persists over the
life cycle and does not depend on income.

extensive margin effects. We then examine the effects of changes in the minimum age of
full and provisional licensing of young drivers in Section 5. Section 6 offers conclusions
and implications.


2       Context and Data

2.1     Context: Driving in the United States
The United States is a notably automobile-friendly nation: about 76 percent of workers
commute alone in a private vehicle (85 percent including carpoolers), compared with 56
percent (64 percent) in the United Kingdom. Laws regulating driving tend to provide few
barriers, and people start driving at younger ages than in most other nations. In 30 U.S.
states, it is still possible to obtain an unrestricted (full-privilege) driver's license before
the age of 18, the standard minimum unrestricted age in most of Europe. In 1980, only in
seven states was the minimum full-privilege driving age greater than 16, and in five states
it was less than 16. Learner's permits have traditionally been granted between the ages
of 14 and 16; in 1980, eight states allowed those 14 years old to begin supervised driving.
Since 1970, more than half of states have permitted those under 16 to begin supervised
driving (see Appendix Table A.3 for details).
    Many teenagers begin driving soon after obtaining the minimum legal age. In 1980,
roughly 44 percent of those aged 16, 66 percent of those aged 17, and 77 percent of those
aged 18 had a driver's license. These numbers have been falling as states started imple-
menting graduated licensing programs that delay full-privilege licenses until age 17 or
18. By 2010, only 28 percent of those aged 16, 46 percent of those aged 17, and 61 percent
of those aged 18 were licensed.5
    This age distribution matters: there are several reasons to believe it is substantially
easier to learn to drive when young than when older (at least in the United States). First,
young people often have access to vehicles, as well as training and supervision, while
living at home. It is the norm in most non-urban and many urban communities to learn to
drive during one's teenage years. Further, many high schools have traditionally offered
subsidized driver training programs. Finally, the opportunity cost of time for this age
group is likely lower than for older people.

2.2   Data
We draw our primary data from several sources, and discuss each below. See Appendix
A.1 for additional data details.

Commuting Behavior and Vehicle Ownership. The decennial census asks questions
about commuting mode and time. These `Journey to Work' questions appear in the 1980,
1990, and 2000 censuses, and more recently in the American Community Survey (ACS).
We use data from these three censuses, as well as the 2006/10, 2011/15, 2016, and 2017
ACS. Key variables of interest are: (i) the primary mode of commute for each worker in
the household; (ii) whether a household keeps a vehicle at home for use by members of
the household; and (iii) public transit ridership for each worker in the household. The
census data include rich demographic and economic controls.
   Age plays a central role in our analysis, but interpreting age in census data requires
qualification. Census microdata report both age and birth year for each person in the
household. Age is understood in terms of a particular reference day, which is April 1 of
the enumeration year. Birth year is defined as sample year less age. Thus, someone born
in May reporting 36 years of age in the 2000 census was born in 1963, whereas someone
born in March reporting an age of 36 in 2000 was born in 1964. We use birth year to define
cohorts at age 16, recognizing that there is some spillover across years. The ACS is con-
ducted on a rolling basis, meaning that there is no constant reference day. Although the
sampling year is reported in the multi-year ACS data, it is difficult to precisely recover
the birth year because the sampling date is not reported. However, in both census and
ACS data, errors should be consistent from year to year.

Travel Surveys and Vehicle Data. We draw on five waves of the National Household
Travel Survey (NHTS) and its predecessors from 1990, 1995, 2001, 2009, and 2017. Our
main variable of interest is miles driven in each vehicle, combined with information on
which household member is the main driver of each vehicle. We aggregate vehicles across
primary drivers to develop a person-specific measure of annual miles traveled. There are
fewer demographic details available in these data; we use sex, race, urban/rural status,
and family size. The data also contain vehicle-level information on make, model, and
vintage which allows us to identify a vehicle's type (passenger car or light-duty truck).
We merge make, model, and vintage information with EPA data on fuel economy from
Allcott and Knittel (2019).



                                            7
Gasoline Prices. The Energy Information Administration reports nominal tax-inclusive
state-level gasoline price data starting in 1983. For the years 1966-1982, we use data from
annual Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Statistics publications (Small
and van Dender 2007; Li, Linn, and Muehlegger 2014).6 Appendix Figure A.1 plots these
data.

Driver Licensing. We develop a database of driver licensing requirements by drawing
from several sources, including the FHWA's publication Driver License Administration
Requirements and Fees, records from the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety, records
from several state Departments of Motor Vehicles, and newspapers (see Appendix A.1
for more details). We also use aggregate data on driver licensing published by the FHWA
in Highway Statistics that list the number of driver's licenses held by people of each age
from 16 to 24 in each year. To estimate rates of driver license adoption, we construct
age-specific population estimates from the National Cancer Institute's SEER Population
database.


3       The 1979 Oil Crisis and Later-Life Driving
The price of gasoline in the United States was relatively stable over the 1950s and 1960s.
Beginning in the 1970s, the global oil market entered a phase of increased price volatility.
The United States experienced a shock to gasoline prices in late 1973 and 1974, in response
to oil production limits by OPEC. However, a larger price shock was in store. Iranian oil
production fell 94 percent in late 1978 during the Iranian Revolution, and the United
States began to experience gasoline shortages and rising prices in early 1979. Prices con-
tinued to rise until the early 1980s, at which point they briefly leveled off (in nominal
terms). The Iran-Iraq war and removal of U.S. price controls by the Reagan administra-
tion in late 1980 and early 1981 led to another increase in prices. Nominal prices stayed
at this unprecedented level through 1986, though high inflation devalued the real price.7
Figure 1 highlights the period of dramatically increasing gasoline prices.
    The high gasoline prices of the early 1980s are notable for three reasons. First, the in-
crease was large in magnitude, sudden and well-publicized in the media.8 The nominal

price doubled over the course of a year. This increase was unexpected, and was exac-
erbated by unpredictable demand-side responses.9 In fact, average consumer beliefs are
often best reflected by a no-change forecast, so shocks to prices can be modeled as unex-
pected (Anderson, Kellogg, and Sallee 2013). Second, nominal prices had never been so
high, and real prices had not seen such levels since the 1930s. This was the first time since
the U.S. became an automobile-dependent society that nominal gasoline prices exceeded
$1 per gallon and real gasoline prices were higher than $3 per gallon (in 2015 dollars). The
$1 price level may have been particularly salient. Third, not only was the cost of gasoline
high, queuing at the gasoline pump meant that an additional time expenditure was re-
quired to obtain gasoline. These queues could be quite substantial: Frech and Lee (1987)
and Deacon and Sonstelie (1989) highlight the negative consequences of time wasted by
queuing; Deacon and Sonstelie (1985) use this event to estimate drivers' value of time.
High prices led to a reduction in driving during the early 1980s. Total vehicle miles trav-
eled had been increasing by 4-4.5 percent annually from 1976 to 1979, but then declined
   9
     While the traditional explanation for the 1979 oil crisis was a supply-side shock, a more recent economic
literature mainly attributes the price spike to two types of demand shocks--increased inventory demand
in anticipation of future shortages triggered by widespread panic about the political unrest in Iran, and
`traditional' demand shocks reflecting a strong global economy (Baumeister and Kilian 2016). Such demand
shocks are unpredictable by nature.

over the next two years before slowly recovering.
    The price shock was likely most consequential for those just coming of driving age.
There are two consequences of this price episode that may be related to long-run driving
behavior: (i) the perceptions of the price of driving may have changed10 and (ii) learn-
ing to drive may have become more expensive. Both factors could plausibly lead to a
reduction in driving later in life. If particular cohorts perceive driving as more costly
(even though everyone faces the same contemporaneous prices)--for example, because
gasoline prices are particularly salient when deciding to take driving lessons and learn-
ing how to drive--they will be less likely to drive and, if they drive, travel fewer miles.
Given that most drivers in the U.S. learn to drive before the age of 18, those who fail to
learn to drive early in life may face more difficulties and higher opportunity costs learning
to drive later in life and even forego driving altogether.


3.1    Later-Life Driving
Figure 2 plots driving, public transit use, and household vehicle access more than two
decades after the 1979 oil crisis, as reported in the 2000 census. Commuters are matched
to cohorts at age 16 (displayed along the horizontal axis). For example, the behavior of
those born in 1964 in 2000 (at age 36) is indexed to the year 1980 (when they turned 16),
while the behavior of those born in 1968 in 2000 (at age 32) is indexed to cohort year 1984.
Vertical bars bound the period of most rapid increases in gasoline prices shown in Figure
1 (prices continued to climb for another year afterwards).
    Driving behavior changes for those who came of age after 1980. The probability that
a commuter drives to work decreases and the probability that a commuter takes mass
transit increases. The decrease appears to be slightly less than one-half of a percentage
point, and marks a jump in behavior from cohorts turning 16 after 1980, and those that
came before. Furthermore, the bottom panel illustrates that individuals in these cohorts
are less likely to have access to a vehicle.11
    Treatment is not precise: gasoline prices increased over the course of 1979-80, and then
bumped up further in 1981. We do not have a strong prior for the precise age at which
gasoline prices become salient; in most states, learner's permits could be awarded at 15
  10
     Media coverage of the oil crisis was ubiquitous. Even though some teens may not have paid directly
for gasoline or driving, media coverage and family interactions discussing gasoline price fluctuations likely
meant that prices were salient and played a role shaping perceptions and expectations.
  11
     For vehicle access, the sample is not limited to workers.

in 1980. Nonetheless, it is clear from Figure 2 that a break, if it exists, most likely occurs
between the 1980 and 1981 cohorts.12 We therefore turn to an event study framework to
quantify the size of this break. (The empirical design resembles a `regression disconti-
nuity in time' with birth year as the running variable; we refer to this setup as `RD' for
simplicity). We discuss under what conditions these RD estimates below have a causal
interpretation, and adopt a more comprehensive repeated cross-section approach that lets
us characterize which ages are formative in Section 4.
  12
    Note that the time series are trending upward or downward in `year turned 16', reflecting that later
cohorts are younger during the 2000 census and transportation behavior more generally exhibits life-cycle
trends. The analysis in Section 4 controls for such life-cycle patterns.


                                                   11
       Specifically, we quantify the break by estimating variants of the following equation:

where Yi is an outcome of interest for individual i in the 2000 census, Si is the year that
i turned 16, and Xi are other characteristics of i. Treatment is the binary variable Di ,
which is equal to one if i turned 16 after 1980. The function g (·) captures trends in driving
behavior; we experiment with linear and quadratic functions that are allowed different
slopes before and after 1980.13 Data are limited to a symmetric bandwidth around the
treatment year.14
    Panel A of Table 1 presents RD estimates of  using linear and quadratic trends. Es-
timates with linear trends are shown over a bandwidth of two to ten years, while those
with quadratic trends are shown over a bandwidth of five to ten years. Results indicate a
sharp decrease in the likelihood of driving to work of 0.2 to 0.5 percentage points that per-
sists roughly twenty years after turning 16. The quadratic results are less precise, but less
prone to bias by accommodating more response curvature along the running variable.
Point estimates are relatively similar across both linear and quadratic specifications.
    The relationship between the gasoline price jump in 1979-80 and reduced later-life
driving behavior of cohorts coming of age after 1980 can be assigned a causal interpreta-
tion if no other observable or unobservable confounding factors experience a discontin-
uous break at the same point in time. We demonstrate that the observable covariates are
smooth in Appendix Figures A.2, A.3, and A.4 across a range of demographic, employ-
ment, and housing characteristics. There are no obvious discontinuities in these graphs,
though some display more curvature than those in Figure 2. We also report results from
`donut' regression discontinuity tests that omit the 1980 cohort in Appendix Table A.1
and alleviate measurement error due to the gradual change of prices throughout the years
1979-80. Results are similar in magnitude, though slightly less significant.

      We report heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors throughout this section. Kolesár and Rothe (2018)
caution against clustering standard errors by the running variable, and present simulation evidence that
shows the heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors outperform standard errors clustered by the running
variable with small or moderate window widths. Furthermore, clustering on the annual running variable
here would lead to a few-clusters problem.
   14
      We define the treatment time as just after 1980. Thus, a bandwidth of two includes cohorts that turn 16
in 1979, 1980, 1981, and 1982.

      Regression discontinuity estimates of the effect of turning 16 after 1980 on a binary indicator of whether the respondent drove to work, as reported
     in the 2000 Census. Bandwidth is symmetric around 1980.5. Sample includes all native-born persons actively working in the Census, and excludes
     farm workers and those coded N/A for transportation mode. Demographic controls include sex, race, and educational attainment. Observations
     weighted by person sample weights. Standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity (see text). Sample sizes are 1-2% smaller in panels B through
     D. + p < 0.10,  p < 0.05,  p < 0.01.
    The effect cannot be explained away by controlling for observable, contemporaneous
characteristics. Panels B through D of Table 1 progressively add more controls to the
specification in Equation (1). Panel B adds demographic controls we take as exogenous
(sex and race), as well as educational attainment (which could be endogenous). Panel
C adds state of birth fixed effects to control for differential commuting behavior in dif-
ferent places. We include state of birth, rather than state of residence, because it is ex-
ogenous with respect to later-life commuting decisions. Panel D adds contemporaneous
income, but we recognize this may not be an appropriate control if later-life income is
both influenced by graduating high school into a recession and income influences vehicle
purchasing (see Section 4.1.2 and Appendix A.2 for more discussion).
    These covariates decrease point estimates by about a quarter, but do not completely
explain behavior. State of birth plays an important role, but estimates are still significant
after accounting for differences across locations. Contemporaneous income also influ-
ences estimates, but the effect is still present in many specifications. This suggests that
there are persistent effects of gasoline prices while coming of age that cannot be explained
by earnings.
    It is apparent from the preceding analysis that cohorts turning 16 after 1980 exhibit
different driving behavior later in life. This cannot be due to gasoline prices immediately
leading up to 2000: everyone faced the same price profile in the preceding years. The
analysis centers on adults 36 years old, so life-cycle trends have mostly smoothed out.
Further, there is a logical link between the high gas prices and reduced driving. However,
this research design ultimately confirms a gasoline price effect only for a single cohort. We
therefore approach this question with a different and more comprehensive repeated cross-
section research design in Section 4, but first we examine other, related outcome variables
and the responses of different subgroups to the 1979 oil crisis. The intuitive responses we
find add some credibility to the RD results presented above.


3.2   Transit and Vehicle Accessibility
The negative effect on driving is largely compensated by an increase in transit use, as
shown by Panel A of Table 2. Those coming of age just after 1980 are 0.2-0.4 percentage
points more likely to take transit to work than their counterparts coming of age a bit
earlier. The absolute magnitude of this effect is between 50 and 100 percent of the effect
size in Panel A of Table 1, suggesting that transit is the primary substitute for driving
(relative to working at home, carpooling, or self-powered means).

                                             14
    Consistent with the effects on driving to work and public transit, those coming of age
after 1980 are also less likely to have access to a vehicle. Panel B shows RD estimates of
Equation (1) on vehicle access for all prime-age adults (not just workers). Linear results
are dubious at larger bandwidths, as Panel C of Figure 2 shows greater curvature in ve-
hicle access for cohorts coming of age in the late 1980s. The estimates from the quadratic
specifications, 0.2-0.3pp, are generally in line with the transit results. Those coming of
age after 1980 are less likely to drive to work, more likely to take transit, and less likely to
have access to a private vehicle.

3.3     Variation by Location and Income
Whether or not commuters are able to substitute away from the automobile depends on
the choices available to them. Therefore, we expect effects to be stronger in urban settings
where there are plausible alternatives to driving (public transit, walking, etc.). We first



                                                         15
examine the RD effect for commuters who reside in the `principal city' of an MSA.15 The
choice of location is potentially endogenous, however, so we interpret subgroup analysis
on location as suggestive evidence. Estimates, shown in Appendix Table A.2, are larger
than the effect in the whole population and are largely robust to bandwidth and trend
specification. For urban dwellers, someone 36 or under is -0.6 to -1.9 percentage points
less likely to drive to work than someone 37 or older in 2000. Conversely, there is little
effect on workers who live outside of metropolitan areas, as Panel B reveals. Point es-
timates are small, mostly positive, and insignificant. Taken together with the results in
Tables 1 and 2, these results suggest that the persistent effect of the 1979 oil price shock is
largely concentrated in cities where viable transportation alternatives are available.
    Panels C and D of Table A.2 report RD estimates for two other groups. Panel C limits
the sample to black workers, and shows evidence of significant and negative effects. The
linear specification loses significance at higher bandwidths; this is likely due to greater
curvature in the running variable. Panel D limits the sample to workers without a college
education. Results are smaller in magnitude and significance, and point estimates are
generally smaller than those reported in Table 1.
    Finally, Appendix Figure A.5 examines the effect of being in a post-1980 cohort on
driving across the income distribution. We divide the population of commuters both into
centile and into decile bins, and then run the RD estimator using the linear specification
with a bandwidth of five years within each bin. Estimates for the lowest decile are neg-
ative (about -1.4 percentage points) and significant. The third decile is, unexpectedly,
positive, but otherwise the first eight deciles are negative and significant. There is a pos-
itive or no effect for the two highest deciles. Estimates for each centile are smoothed and
shown with a dotted line, and generally conform to the decile estimates.
    Taken together, these results suggest that the post-1980 cohorts are different in ways
that support a difference in transportation habits: lower-income workers, and workers in
cities, show stronger effects. Further, transit use compensates the loss in driving.


4        Long-Run Driving Effects of Gasoline Prices
To more precisely link long-run behavior with formative exposure to gasoline prices, we
use all available variation in gasoline prices across time and states with a fixed effects
    15
    There are several MSAs for which principal city status may violate disclosure rules and therefore not
reported in the 2000 census. This is why sample sizes are lower than in Table 1.


                                                   16
research design that uses repeated cross sections over nearly four decades. We tie the
price of gasoline that someone likely experiences during their formative driving years to
later-life driving behavior. We show results for different treatment age windows (such
as between ages 15 and 17), and the years around a state's minimum driving age. We
use all available public-use census/ACS microdata since 1980 on commuting mode to
study the extensive margin of driving behavior, and all NHTS data since 1990 to study
the intensive-margin response and vehicle choice.
    Our primary specification models outcome Yicst for person i in cohort c born in state s
observed in sample year t as:

                               Yicst = Tcs + s + t + a + Xit  + icst                                      (2)

where the treatment variable Tcs is either the price of gasoline or change in the price of
gasoline during formative driving years for cohort c in state s.  is the parameter of inter-
est and measures the response in the outcome variable to gasoline price exposure at early
driving ages. Different states may exhibit different behavior on average due to different
provision of infrastructure, social norms, etc.; state fixed effects, s , capture these differ-
ences. Sample year fixed effects, t , control for current gas prices, business-cycle trends
in employment, etc.16 We also add individual age fixed effects a to capture important
life-cycle trends in transportation behavior. We include a vector of individual and house-
hold characteristics, Xit . We limit the sample to prime-age (25- to 54-year-old) native-born
adults, and exclude residents of Alaska and Hawaii as we do not have a complete series of
gasoline prices for these states. We discuss other sample adjustments that are particular
to each dataset below. Standard errors are clustered by state.
    Equation (2) is conceptually similar to a fixed effects difference-in-differences estima-
tor. We observe cohorts, who have different formative experiences in the years around
their initial driving age, at several points in time as they progress throughout the life cy-
cle. Thus we are comparing, e.g., the driving behavior of a 36-year-old person in a state
at particular time with other 36-year-old people in the same state at earlier or later points
in time.
    We experiment with different definitions of treatment based on exposure to gasoline
prices during one's formative driving years. We use a data-driven approach to establish
which ages are most formative, i.e. have the largest effects on later behavior. We consider
  16
    We include state-by-sample year fixed effects in some specifications to flexibly control for local differ-
ences in these contemporaneous factors.

Results (in Tables 3 through 6 below) will reveal that gasoline price shocks over an age
range between 15 to 18 (or between one year before and two years after the minimum
driving age) matter much more than levels.

    Figure 3 plots gasoline price exposure variable (i) for h = 2, showing the price changes
for each calendar year rather than by cohort-age. The boxes and whiskers in Figure 3 in-
dicate the quartiles of variation across states. Appendix Figure A.1 adds plots for price
exposure variables (i) with h = 1 and (ii). These figures showing annual and biennial
gasoline price changes highlight the variation used to identify long-run effects. Our pre-
                             17,15
ferred specification uses Pcs      , as the window from 15 to 17 covers most driver licensing
uptake (see Section 2 and Section 5). It is also the age range over which the treatment ef-
fect is the strongest (see Table 6).
    Ideally, we would observe everyone's residential location in these formative years.
However, census data only provide information on state of birth and current residence.
We therefore define a sample of stayers who currently reside in their state of birth (about 64
percent of the full sample) as our primary population of analysis. However, we provide
robustness analysis showing that our results are not sensitive to using the full sample
(merged either on state of birth or state of current residence). NHTS data do not contain
information about place of birth or prior migration decisions, so we merge on current
state of residence.17


4.1    Extensive Margin
We first explicitly incorporate gasoline prices into the analysis of commuting mode. We
merge data on driving behavior from all public use census/ACS microdata available be-
tween 1980 and 2017 with gasoline prices based on respondent age and birth state. In
most specifications, we only include those who still reside in the state of their birth. Our
state-level gasoline price data begins in 1966, so our sample includes those for whom we
                                                        17,15
can calculate our primary definition of treatment: Pcs        . This corresponds to cohorts
born between 1951 and 1992.
  17
    We are concerned about incorrectly matching people to gasoline prices experienced earlier in life. In our
data, there is no way to track people through time and space. Given the life cycle of migration decisions, we
believe including only those who still reside in their state of birth to be reasonable (Kaplan and Schulhofer-
Wohl 2017). One concern is that those who leave their birth state to attend college may move back, but face
a different gas price environment during early adulthood. While we cannot rule this out, even students
applying to elite universities are significantly more likely to matriculate if they attended high school in the
same state (Griffith and Rothstein 2009; Bostwick 2016), limiting concern about return migration.

4.1.1      Driving to Work

Estimates of Equation (2) on an indicator of driving to work are shown in Table 3. Note
that each regression coefficient is from a separate linear probability model. Rows corre-
spond to different definitions of treatment. We show specifications with gasoline price
                                                                                      17,15
levels vs. changes, where the change is taken over either the ages 15 to 17 (Pcs             ) or
                                                                               (mcs +1),(mcs -1)
the two-year window around the minimum full-privilege driving age (Pcs                           ).
Appendix Table A.4 shows results for various alternative specifications of treatment. Col-
umn (1) uses census year, state, and age fixed effects to capture life-cycle trends in com-
muting for those who reside in their state of birth when observed in the census (stayers).
Columns (2) and (3) alter the sample. In Column (2), all workers are included regardless
of current state of residence; gasoline prices reflect those in the state of birth. In Column
(3), all workers are again included, but gasoline prices reflect current state of residence.
Columns (4) to (7) progressively add more controls, again restricted to the stayers sample.
Column (4) adds demographic controls for sex, marital status, educational attainment,
and race. Column (5) adds log household income, which could influence a number of
transportation and residential location margins. Column (6) adds state-by-sample year
fixed effects to control for contemporaneous differences in driving conditions (current gas
prices, parking restrictions, etc.) Finally, Column (7) includes quadratic birth year trends
to control for smooth, secular time trends in preferences or the driving environment.
    First, note that driving to work responds to changes in gasoline prices, but hardly to
levels. For the specifications using gasoline price changes in Columns (1) to (3), all coef-
ficients are negative and significant, and the effect size varies from -0.3 to -0.4 percentage
points. Estimates are similar both for the 15 to 17 calendar age range and for the window
one year before to one year after the minimum driving age. The results in Column (1) in-
                                                                                     17,15
dicate that a doubling in the price of gasoline between the ages of 15 and 17 (Pcs          = 1)
leads to a 0.38 percentage point or 0.43 percent reduction in driving to work later in life.18
For the two-year window around the minimum driving age, the effect is -0.41 percentage
points (or 0.46 percent). The precise magnitude slightly varies across specifications, but
is always statistically significant.
    Columns (4) through (7) condition on contemporaneous covariates or fixed effects.
These factors, such as income, educational attainment, or current state, could be influ-
enced by economic conditions during formative years (which might be correlated with
gasoline price shocks). If such channels are important, including these controls could lead
  18
       In our sample, 88.2 percent of workers drive to work.

to biased estimates of the effect. However, these controls could also account for other ef-
fects of coming of age during a period of increasing gasoline prices. For completeness,
we include them in Columns (4) to (7). They make little difference, strongly suggesting
that income or education are not a primary mechanism for our results. Furthermore, the
magnitude of these estimates corresponds to the effect measured in Section 3 (reflecting
the doubling of prices in between 1979 and 1981).
    Appendix Table A.4 shows that exposure to gasoline price changes during the 15-17
age range (or the window from one year before to one year after the minimum driving
age) is associated with the strongest impact on later-life driving, but effects remain signif-

icant when using Pcs cs             or Pcs    (for the latter case, significance remains for
only some of the specifications). Together these results suggest that the formative effect


                                                      21
is strongest between the ages of 15 and 17.19


4.1.2   Income Mediation

Gasoline price movements can be associated with recessions, and recessions experienced
when entering labor markets can have long-run effects on earnings (Oreopoulos, von
Wachter, and Heisz 2012; Stuart 2017). If a gasoline price shock during the formative
window impacts income (through cohort effects, labor market entry timing, educational
attainment, etc.), and income influences transportation behavior, then some portion of the
effect shown in Table 3 may be indirectly due to a shift in income rather than directly from
experiencing the price shock. Thus, the negative effects in Columns (1) to (4) in Table 3
could in principle represent effects mediated through income channels.
    Three pieces of evidence argue against income mediation as a main explanation of the
effect we find. (Though we focus on income, this finding holds for other characteristics
highly correlated with income, such as education.) First, Columns (5) to (7) in Table 3
control for contemporaneous income (and Columns (4) through (7) include controls for
educational attainment). The stability of the estimates suggests that income cannot ex-
plain the observed effect. Second, results are similar when we exclude cohorts born in
1963 to 1965 (those that came of driving age during the 1979 oil crisis).20 Finally, we con-
duct mediation analysis to quantify the indirect, income-mediated effect of these gasoline
price shocks on later-life driving.
    We formalize our mediation model in Appendix A.2. The analysis consists of model-
ing later-life driving behavior as a function of formative-year gasoline price shocks and
contemporaneous income, and separately modeling contemporaneous income as a func-
tion of the formative-year gasoline price shocks. Results are reported in Appendix Table
A.10 and show that income is indeed negatively associated with upward gasoline price
shocks. However, the mediation analysis reveals that only between 2% and 24% of the
total effect of the gasoline price shocks can be explained through the income channel (our
average estimate is 13%). Reduced income due to the experience of recessions during
formative years is not the primary component driving the results in Table 3.
  19
      We discuss the use of cohort fixed effects in Appendix A.3. Most gasoline price variation is temporal
rather than cross sectional, and the use of cohort fixed effects absorbs much of this variation. Nonetheless,
extensive-margin results, while less precise, are similar to those presented here. Intensive-margin results
are noisy.
   20
      More precisely, when we estimate the same model as in Column (1) of Table 3, but exclude the 1963
                                            17,15
to 1965 birth cohorts, the coefficient on Pcs      is -0.0042** (s.e. 0.0015), slightly less precise but larger in
magnitude than when these cohorts are included.

4.1.3    Other Extensive Margins (Transit Use, Vehicle Ownership)

We also investigate if those who experience positive gasoline price shocks during forma-
tive years substitute commutes to transit, and if they are less likely to have access to a
vehicle. Table 4 summarizes the results for the same definitions of treatment as in Table
3. In Columns (1) and (2), the outcome variable is transit usage; in Columns (3) to (6)
it is access to a vehicle. We find that about one-half to three-quarters of the extensive-
margin effect is accounted for by a shift to transit. There may also be a small, negative
effect of increases in gas prices on vehicle ownership (about one-quarter to one-half of
the extensive-margin effect). The effect is not extremely robust, although more so in the
sample that includes all household members than in the employed sample.

4.2     Intensive Margin
We next perform a similar exercise to study the intensive margin: miles of driving and the
fuel economy of the vehicles owned. We merge data on vehicle miles traveled (VMT) from
all NHTS waves since 1990 with gasoline prices based on respondent age and current
state. There are five waves in this dataset: 1990, 1995, 2001, 2009, and 2017. The NHTS
also reports the vehicle's make and model, which we use to identify the type of vehicle
(car vs. light-duty truck) and fuel economy. Household income is reported in binned
values; we standardize these to correspond to quintiles of the income distribution and
interact them with sample year dummies to flexibly capture changes in income patterns.

4.2.1   Miles of Driving

One might expect that drivers who were exposed to large gasoline price increases during
their initial driving years perceive driving as more costly throughout their lives and drive
fewer miles. Estimates of Equation (2) on the log of miles traveled are reported in Table
5. Column (1) uses NHTS sample year, state of residence, and age fixed effects. Column
(2) adds demographic controls for race, urban/rural status, and family size. Column (3)
adds the household income bins interacted with observation year. Columns (4) and (5)
add more flexible state-by-year fixed effects to control for contemporaneous differences
in driving conditions (current gas prices, parking restrictions, etc.) Column (5) adds a
quadratic birth year trend.
    These estimates represent the elasticity of long-run driving behavior to formative
gasoline price changes. As with the extensive-margin results, gasoline price changes dur-
ing early driving years matter while levels do not. Coefficients for specifications using
changes are negative and significant whether controls or additional fixed effects are in-
cluded or not. The effect varies from -3.4 to -8.2 percent. A doubling in the price of
gasoline between the ages of 15 and 17 reduces later-life miles traveled by 6.2 to 8.2 per-
cent; for the age window one year before to one year after the minimum driving age, the
effect of doubling gasoline prices on miles traveled is -3.4 to -5.7 percent.21 As with the
extensive-margin analysis, including controls measured contemporaneously in Columns
(2) to (5) could introduce bias in the estimated effect. However, these controls also capture
other important differences between drivers. Regardless, the effect size is not greatly im-
pacted by their inclusion. The specification with a quadratic trend in birth year in Column
  21
    In our sample, respondents drive about 14,080 miles per year on average across the vehicles for which
they are described as the main driver.

(5) shows a slightly attenuated effect on miles traveled.
    Appendix Table A.6 shows the results for a broader range of treatment ages. Results
behave similarly for these other treatment definitions, and effects remain significant for
most alternatives. Compared with the extensive-margin results, the effects are strong for
                                                                      17,16
the entire 15 to 18 age range, with the largest treatment effect for Pcs    . Together, these
effects point to the importance of experiences with gasoline prices between the ages of 15
and 18 on later-life driving habits--both on the intensive and the extensive margin.


4.2.2   Fuel Economy and Vehicle Choice

Besides miles traveled, another margin of response is the fuel efficiency of the type of
vehicle chosen by a driver. Appendix Table A.9 reports two additional outcome vari-
ables: the fuel-consumption rate in gallons-per-mile (GPM), and whether a driver owns
a more fuel-efficient passenger car or a less fuel-efficient light-duty truck (pickup, SUV,

                                                  25
or minivan). As the NHTS reports data at both the person and the vehicle level, we use
the average fuel-consumption rate per driver (across the vehicles to which the person is
assigned as the main driver) as the outcome variable in Columns (1) and (2); Columns (3)
and (4) use GPM at the vehicle level. Columns (5) through (8) have a similar structure,
now looking at the effect of formative gasoline price changes on large-vehicle ownership.
All specifications include a rich set of fixed effects and controls. We also include vehicle
age and quadratic vehicle model-year fixed effects to isolate variation within drivers of a
vehicle of a certain vintage and age.
    We find a zero effect on the fuel-consumption rating. This is not entirely surprising
given that fuel economy is measured with considerable error.22 We do find a negative
effect on the large-vehicle indicator, suggesting that those who experienced a doubling of
gasoline prices during their initial driving years are 1.1-2.7 percentage points less likely
to drive a light-duty truck. The results are statistically significant in half of the specifica-
tions. All in all, we interpret this as modest suggestive evidence that gasoline price shocks
have long-term effects on the types of vehicles that people drive, but more precisely mea-
sured fuel-economy data would be required to estimate the effect with a higher degree of
confidence.


4.3    The Formative Window and Persistence
To show that the timing of gasoline price shocks matters, and to identify at what ages the
formative experiences are most powerful, we merge later-life driving behavior to gasoline
prices from ages 13 to 22. We similarly merge later-life driving behavior to gasoline prices
several years before and after state-level minimum driving ages. For this test, we use
Equation (2) with observation year, state, and age fixed effects, similar to Column (1) in
both Table 3 and Table 5. Results are shown in Table 6.
    Estimates of the long-run extensive-margin effect of driving to work are shown in
                               a,a-1                                           (m + ),(mcs + -1)

with years relative to the state-cohort specific minimum driving age   {-3, -2, . . . , 5, 6}
as the treatment definitions, estimates generally show that gasoline price shocks between
the ages of 15 and 18 are influential for later-life driving, whereas shocks before or af-
                                                                      16,15        (m ),(m -1)
ter play much less of a role. The largest coefficients are on Pcs            and Pcs cs cs .
Estimates of the long-run intensive-margin effect on miles traveled are reported in the
  22
    Fuel-economy ratings vary substantially within make and model, but we are unable to match this given
the coarseness of the NHTS data.

bottom panel; the largest coefficients are about a year later than for the extensive margin.
The most responsive age range is generally between 15 and 18 years, or between one year
before and two or three years after the minimum driving age.23
    We next ask whether these effects only last for a few years (say, for people into their
early 30s), or whether they are persistent throughout the life cycle. Table 7 allows for
heterogeneous treatment effects by 10-year age bins. Results reveal some differences in
persistence across the intensive and extensive margins and specifications of the formative
window. Generally, we conclude that the effects are stronger for younger (age 25 to 34)
and older (age 45 to 54) drivers, with little discernible effect for those age 35 to 44. On the
intensive margin, conclusions are broadly similar, but estimates are less precise.


5        Interpretation and Mechanisms
Empirical results presented so far demonstrate that gasoline price shocks have an effect on
driving behavior in the long run. Specifications including income rule out one confound-
ing explanation: gasoline price increases are often associated with recessions, which have
path-dependent effects on earnings and potentially transportation behavior.
    23
   Table A.8 shows the same effects but now using a two-year treatment window. The same conclusions
apply.

                                             28
    We now discuss if costly skill acquisition is a potential mechanism that can explain
our results. If learning to drive has high time, vehicle and/or fuel costs, increases in these
costs may have long-run impacts on driving adoption. Given that most drivers in the U.S.
have historically learned to drive before they turn 18, parental inputs are also important.
With a binding constraint on gas expenses, households may delay or completely avoid
teenage driver training in favor of other necessary commuting expenses. Do high gasoline
prices keep people from learning to drive in the long run?
    We provide several pieces of evidence showing that costly skill acquisition is unlikely
to wholly explain the results in Sections 3 and 4. First, it is difficult to assert that the
intensive-margin effect for those who own a vehicle is due to a high cost of learning
to drive. Hence, the presence of an intensive-margin effect on miles driven is highly
suggestive that delayed skill acquisition cannot be the sole or dominant explanation for
the long-run effects on driving behavior. Second, there does not appear to be a reduction
in the take up of teen driver's licenses in response to the 1979 oil crisis. Finally, we show
that regulations that explicitly restrict teenage driving through minimum driver licensing
age requirements do not have negative effects on later-life driving rates.
    Together, these null results suggest a role for formative experiences that shape pref-
erences for the long run. Teen's preferences for driving or perceptions of the costs of
driving are impacted by gasoline price shocks, and these differences persist. We cannot
distinguish between a shift in a deep preference parameter, or how preferences are filtered
by updated perceptions of the cost of driving.


5.1   Evidence from Driver Licensing Counts
We return to the gasoline price shock induced by the 1979 oil crisis and examine the re-
sponse in driver licensing. We compute the percentage of each cohort that has a license
by a certain age. This statistic is not directly observable in the data, but the Federal High-
way Administration (FWHA) publishes annual data on the number of drivers at each age
from 15 to 24. We combine this data with supplemental estimates of the age distribution
of the population to generate percentage licensed by age. In general, other factors (such
as changes in minimum driver licensing age) were mostly constant during the late 1970s
and early 1980s.
    There is not a noticeable change in driver licensing following the 1979 oil crisis, al-
though the data are somewhat noisy. Figure 4 shows the percentage of each age (16, 17,

18, 20, and 22) that has a license in each year.24 Timing for ages is based on calendar years
rather than individual birthdays, so the lines should be read as "the percentage of those
aged 16 at the end of the year who received a license by the end of the year." Driver
saturation is generally smooth and slightly decreasing, though there may be a slight de-
pression in some of the series in 1981 and 1982 but a slight uptick for others. All things
considered, we do not find clear evidence for a delay in driver license uptake.


5.2     Evidence from Driver License Minimum Age Requirements
Legislative restrictions provide another avenue that potentially limit driver training. If
high gas prices delay driving skill acquisition and reduce later-life driving because of
this delay, it is likely that directly delaying driver skill acquisition through driving age
restrictions will also reduce later-life driving. We combine data from several sources to
develop a panel of teenage driver's license requirements covering 1967 to 2017 to test this
channel.25
  24
      Figure 4 omits 1983 and 1985 because the driver's license counts by age in those years was extrapolated
from prior years. These data are noisy, but show a marked increase in driver's licenses of 18 year olds in
1983.
   25
      Our two primary sources are the FHWA's Driver License Administration Requirements and Fees report
and a database of graduated driver license (GDL) adoptions from the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety.

    We test for extensive- and intensive-margin effects of changing minimum driving age
restrictions in Table 8. We first construct two measures of minimum driving age. The first
measure, minimum full privilege age, gives the minimum age at which a suitably trained
teenager can obtain an unrestricted license (i.e., with no restrictions on time of use, pur-
pose, destination, or passengers). This is very similar to the age used to merge gas price
relative to driver license age in Section 4.26 The other measure, minimum intermedi-
ate license age, captures the minimum age at which drivers can make unaccompanied
trips, but with some restrictions.27 Summary information on these measures is shown in
Appendix Table A.3. We include both measures of restrictiveness in each specification.
  26
      We use minimum age in years and months to define treatment here, whereas in Section 4 this variable
is rounded to the nearest year to facilitate matching with coarser age data.
   27
      That is, they need not be accompanied by a parent or older driver (as for a learner's permit).


                                                      31
Columns (1) and (2) show the effects from models with sample year, state, and age fixed
effects. Column (2) includes the full sample for the census data, which is otherwise re-
stricted to the stayers sample. Column (3) adds the respective demographic controls as in
Table 3 and 5. Column (4) adds income controls, while Column (5) adds state-by-sample
year fixed effects and Column (6) includes a quadratic trend in birth year. We find little
evidence of a long-run effect of these regulations on later-life driving behavior. Estimates
in Table 8 show the effect of a one-year increase in either measure of minimum age, and
are never significant in the expected direction.
    We suggest some caution in interpretation: magnitudes cannot be directly compared
to results from analysis in the prior sections because the treatments are fundamentally
different (and measured in incompatible units). Our primary analysis studies the effects
of gasoline price changes, while the analysis here studies the long-run impacts of driving
age restrictions. However, with these caveats in mind, this analysis suggests that age
restrictions for teenagers on learning to drive do not inhibit the long-run adoption of
driving. As high gasoline prices are less extreme than legal restrictions on driving, it is
reasonable to conjecture that gasoline price shocks do not impact driver license uptake
either.


6    Conclusion
Early experiences frame how people perceive different goods and activities. These for-
mative periods can drive later-life behaviors, expectations, and norms. In the case of
driving, we find that individuals who experience large price increases during their for-
mative driving years behave differently than those who did not experience such shocks:
they drive to work less often, take transit more, are less likely to have access to a vehicle,
and drive fewer miles if they own a vehicle. Early-life experiences are thus one source of
path dependence in transportation demand.
   These results highlight that macroeconomic price shocks can give rise to long-lived
preference heterogeneity. Combining the intensive-margin (miles traveled) and extensive-
margin (vehicle ownership) effects of a doubling of gasoline prices, we find a combined
long-run, path-dependent driving reduction of 3.6-8.7 percent. The literature has reported
short- and medium-run estimates that are generally in the range of -5 to -39 percent and
decreasing in magnitude over time (Small and van Dender 2007; Li, Linn, and Muehleg-
ger 2014). Our long-run effect is smaller but in the same order of magnitude of the more


                                             32
recent short-run miles-traveled elasticities in the literature, although it operates only on
cohorts that are exposed to large gasoline price movements during teenage driving years.
    We show that these long-run effects are most likely due to the formation of preferences
for the driving experience and its perceived associated costs, rather than through long-run
income effects or a reduction in the number of people who end up learning to drive. These
results show that formative experiences that determine later-in-life behavior need not
be `extreme'; everyday mundane experiences with market prices can have long-lasting
impacts on preferences and behavior.

Appendix
A.1    Data Notes
Census Data
We draw data on individual commuting behavior in part for the United States Census
and American Community Survey (ACS). In particular, we collect the 5% state samples
for 1980 and 1990, the 5% sample for 2000, the 2006-10 5-year ACS, the 2011-15 5-year
ACS, and the 2016 and 2017 1-year ACS data abstracts from the IPUMS website. We focus
on `Journey to Work' variables, but also draw on a variety of demographic and economic
characteristics. These variables have generally been harmonized by IPUMS.
    The primary outcome variables from the Census/ACS that we use are derived from
the following variables (along with IPUMS descriptions):

      TRANWORK is asked similarly from 1980 on, and "reports the respondent's pri-
      mary means of transportation to work . . . over the course of the previous week
      . . . The primary means of transportation was that used on the most days or to cover
      the greatest distance." This variable varies by person, and is only available for em-
      ployed persons who are currently working.

      VEHICLES is available from 1990 on, and "reports the number of cars, vans, and
      trucks of one-ton capacity or less kept at home for use by household members,"
      including "company cars regularly kept at home and used for non-business pur-
      poses." This variable is available for households.

      AUTOS is available in 1980, and "reports the number of automobiles owned or used
      regularly by any household member. It includes company cars kept at home and
      available for personal use." This variable is available for households.

      TRUCKS is available in 1980, and "reports the number of trucks and vans regularly
      kept at home for use by members of the household, including company vehicles. It
      excludes trucks with more than one-ton capacity, those permanently out of working
      order, and those used only for business purposes." This variable is available for
      households.

We then define our primary outcome variables from these as follows:



                                            38
     1[drive] is equal to 1 if TRANWORK takes codes 10-15 (for auto, truck, or van con-
     veyance), and 0 otherwise.

     1[transit] is equal to 1 if TRANWORK takes codes 30-34 or 36 (public transit con-
     veyance excluding taxis), and 0 otherwise.

     1[vehicle] is equal to 1 if VEHICLES is greater than or equal to 1 (1990 on) or the
     sum of AUTOS and TRUCKS is greater than or equal to 1 (1980), and 0 otherwise.

  A couple of other variables play key roles in our analysis, as we use them to merge
Census/ACS data with measures of gasoline price variation (i.e., treatment).

     AGE is asked in all years, and is used to create a variable BIRTHYR by subtraction
     from the survey year. Ostensibly, AGE is meant to be relative to Census day (in early
     April) for Census samples, and relative to the day of survey for ACS samples. Thus,
     BIRTHYR is not necessarily an accurate measure of the year of birth. For example,
     someone born on March 15, 1964, would respond to the 2000 Census that their AGE
     is 36, and BIRTHYR would be recorded as 1964. However, someone born on April
     15, 1964, would respond that their AGE is 35, and BIRTHYR would be recorded as
     1965. Hence, there is some measurement error in birth year, and results should be
     interpreted with this caveat in mind. Respondents from ACS years also suffer from
     some measurement error, but it should be zero on average.

     BPL reports the respondent's state or country of birth, and STATEFIP gives a respon-
     dent's current state of residence. We use these variables to merge a respondent to
     gasoline prices in their formative years in their likely state of residence at that time.
     We merge on BPL, on STATEFIP, and on both if a respondent currently resides in
     their state of birth. 63.8% of the whole sample and 63.3% of the commuting sample
     currently reside in their state of birth.

    We also use a variety of other variables as controls, for sample selection, or in robust-
ness exercises. These include sex, marital status, educational attainment (separate indi-
cators for high school and college completion), race and ethnicity (indicators for African
American and Hispanic), household income (inflation adjusted using CPI), employment
and labor force participation, wage, housing tenure, rent and house value, and measures
of travel time for commuting.



                                             39
NHTS Data
We use five waves of the National Household Travel Survey and its predecessor, the Na-
tionwide Personal Transportation Survey, (collectively NHTS) from 1990, 1995, 2001, 2009,
and 2017. These data document details at the household, person, vehicle, and trip level.
Our analysis focuses on the person level. We use the following variables to generate our
primary outcomes:

     ANNMILES is a self-reported annualized miles estimate given per vehicle.

     WHOMAIN describes which person in the household drives each vehicle the most.

We then use these to create a person-specific measure of total vehicle miles traveled (VMT)
by adding together all ANNMILES across vehicles for which WHOMAIN is the primary
driver. We top code this value at 115,000 miles annually (alternative top codes at 50,000
or 200,000 miles make little difference).
    We use the variable R_AGE to determine a respondent's birth year and to perform
merges to gasoline prices. Information on when (generally the month) the interview was
conducted is also used. The variable HHSTATE captures the household's current state of
residence; no historical detail on location of nativity or migration is provided.
    For some specifications, we use other details associated with particular vehicles. MAKE,
MODEL, VEHYEAR, HYBRID, and FUELTYPE (or near variants) give make, model, ve-
hicle year, hybrid status, and gas/diesel/electric information about vehicles. The make
and model information is relatively coarse, and codes roughly align with those used by
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
    We also derive a number of other control variables including race (an indicator for
white), urbanization (an indicator for urban residential environment), family size, and
bins of household income (we harmonize bins measures across years and adjust for infla-
tion, resulting in five bins which are then interacted with year).

Gasoline Price Data
The Energy Information Administration reports nominal tax-inclusive state-level gaso-
line price data starting in 1983. For the years 1966-1982, we use the Highway Statistics
Annuals (Li, Linn, and Muehlegger 2014; Small and van Dender 2007).

Driver License Regulation Data
We develop a data set of driver licensing requirements from several sources. Our primary

                                            40
sources are (i) the FHWA Driver License Administration Requirements and Fees booklet and
(ii) the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) database on graduated driver license
(GDL) programs. We supplement these materials with various newspaper articles, legal
database queries, and inquiries to reference desks at state libraries.
     The FHWA booklet has been published roughly biannually since the 1960s. We found
and use years 1967, 1972, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1994, and 1996. IIHS data cover 1995
to 2017, and report some information starting in 1990. In general, if we do not observe a
change between two periods, we assume no legislative change. If we do observe a change,
we perform additional inquiries to determine the date of change.
     We define two measures of driver license minimum age. Our primary measure is the
minimum age at which a teenager can obtain a full-privilege driver license. Our defini-
tion allows for teenagers to have taken driver education classes and be enrolled in school
(often requirements for receiving a license before the age of 17 or 18). We exclude hard-
ship rules, farm licenses, and other types of specialty licenses (e.g., motorcycle). The
second measure captures the minimum age at which a teenager can obtain an intermedi-
ate license. These licenses permit unaccompanied driving, but place some restrictions on
when a license holder may drive alone (e.g., daytime only), or who they may drive with
(e.g., one non-family member).

Driver Licensing Counts
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) publishes data on driver licensing. We
use Table DL-220 "Licensed Drivers, by Sex and Age Group, 1963-2016" from Highway
Statistics (2016), which lists the number of driver licenses held by people of each age from
16 to 24 in each year. The FHWA did not require states to report counts by age in 1983
and 1985, and instead extrapolated these data. We exclude these years.
    To estimate rates of driver license adoption, we require age-specific estimates of popu-
lation. We construct this data from the National Cancer Institute's SEER Population data,
which provides population estimates by age from 1969 to 2017. We sum county-level
population estimates across all counties for each age and year.

Fuel-Efficiency Data
We use EPA fuel-economy data from Allcott and Knittel (2019). These data report fuel-
economy data by make, model, year, trim, fuel type, and engine size. In the NHTS data,
we only observe make, model, year, and fuel type. We therefore create an average fuel


                                            41
efficiency by make, model, year, and fuel type class, measured in gallons per mile (GPM),
and use this as our measure of vehicle efficiency.


A.2     Mediation Analysis
We perform mediation analysis to explicitly account for the indirect effect gasoline price
shocks experienced during formative years could have on later-life driving through an
income effect. If a gasoline price shock during this formative window impacts wages
(through cohort effects, labor market entry timing, educational attainment, etc.), and
wages influence transportation behavior, the indirect portion of the effect is not due to
a shift in preferences.
    We build a simple mediation model (Baron and Kenny 1986; MacKinnon 2012).28 We
mostly retain notation from Section 4: Later-life driving, Y , is modeled as a function of
the gasoline price shock experienced during formative driving years, T , and contempora-
neous income, M . However, the gasoline price shock may also have an effect on income,
and so mediate later-life driving indirectly through income. The mediation model can be
expressed by the stacked equation (suppressing subscripts for exposition):

                          Y           Y                          Y              Y
                                =           T+        M+               X+            .                  (A.1)
                          M           M             0            M              M



In Equation (A.1), Y is the effect of T on Y , while  is the effect of M on Y . T is permitted
to have its own effect on M via M . The direct effect of formative gasoline price shocks
on later-life driving is captured by Y , the indirect effect mediated through income is the
product M , and the total effect sums these two together: Y + M .
    We implement Equation (A.1) in a similar manner to Equation (2), and include in  age,
state of birth, sample year fixed effects, and exogenous demographics (sex and race). The
fixed effects and demographic covariates are allowed to vary across outcomes, (hence  Y
and  M ). We cluster standard errors by state of birth across outcomes. Finally, we assume
that T and M are exogenous conditional on the fixed effects and covariates we include
as well as autonomy (that is,  does not vary with T ).29 Alternatively, mediation analysis
  28
     Mediators are a class of what are denoted as `bad controls' by (Angrist and Pischke 2008). They are
`bad' in the sense that they can confound estimation of average treatment effects. Recent literature has
begun to explicitly explore these estimators (e.g., Dippel et al. 2017; Heckman and Pinto 2015). In particular,
Heckman and Pinto (2015) reviews early econometric mediation analysis.
  29
     One set of assumptions under which this model is identified is labeled sequential exogeneity: (i)



                                                      42
could proceed using estimates of  and M drawn from the literature (e.g., the literature
on graduating during a recession provides proxies for M ).
    Appendix Table A.10 presents several specifications for different combinations of treat-
ment and income. Columns (1), (3) and (5) report effects using the absolute calendar
                             17,15
age measure of treatment Pcs       , while Columns (2), (4), and (6) use the measure based
                                                  (m +1),(mcs -1)
on minimum full-privilege driver license age Pcs cs               . Columns (1) and (2) use
household income, Columns (3) and (4) use wage income, and Columns (5) and (6) use
personal income.
    Estimates of Y are similar to those in the main text. Income has a positive relationship
with driving a private vehicle to work (driving is a normal good); estimates of  indicate
that a 10% increase in income is associated with roughly a 0.2 percentage point increase
in driving to work. Finally, the various definitions of gasoline price shocks have a neg-
ative relationship with income, though the strength of this relationship varies with the
definition of income used. Estimates of M indicate that experiencing a doubling of gaso-
line prices during formative years may be associated with up to a -4.9 percent decrease in
income.30
    These results show that most the vast majority of the gasoline price shock effect does
not come through the indirect income channel. The ratio of the direct effect to the total
effect indicates that between 76 and 98 percent of the total effect cannot be explained by
income. This analysis suggests that income-based explanations are, for the most part,
unimportant in understanding the long-run relationship between gasoline price shocks
during formative years and later-life driving.


A.3     Additional Specifications
We have also run models with cohort fixed effects. The use of cohort fixed effects absorbs
most of the variation in gasoline prices, as gasoline prices vary much more over time than
space (see Appendix Figure A.1). This should signal caution to taking estimates from
models with cohort fixed effects too seriously. Though  in Equation (2) is still identified
when we control for cohort (birth year) fixed effects, the source of identifying variation
(Y, M )    T |X , (ii) Y   M |T, X and (iii) common support (Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto 2010; Imai et
al. 2011). Heckman and Pinto (2015) argues that such conditions may be strong, and Dippel et al. (2017)
provide an approach to identification with endogenous variation.
   30
      This suggests, for example, that the 1979 Oil Crisis is associated with income loss of about 2.5 percent
later in life. This measure is smaller than in Kahn (2010) and Stuart (2017), reflecting the fact that gasoline
price shocks and recessions are not always correlated.


                                                      43
changes. The variation that remains after conditioning on cohort fixed effects (in addition
to the state fixed effects) are differential changes in Tcs across states, e.g., a larger increase
in Georgia than in Alabama in a given year. These movements are only a small piece of
the observable variation facing agents.
    We present results with cohort fixed effects in Appendix Table A.5 (outcome: driving)
and Appendix Table A.7 (outcome: miles traveled). In general, estimates from these mod-
els are statistically significant only for a subset of specifications because of a loss of power
                                         (m +2,mcs )
due to much less variation. Using Pcs cs              as the treatment definition, we find that
estimates of the extensive-margin effect are very similar in magnitude to the results in
Table 3. Additional identifying variation in this case is coming from within state changes
in driver license age requirements over time. The estimated effect is now concentrated in
the 16 to 18 age range. Intensive-margin results on miles traveled are noisy and almost
always lack significance when cohort fixed effects are included.

Frequency of states (and DC) with minimum driver age in each bin for the years listed.
Provisional licenses allow unaccompanied driving, but limit time of use or number of
passengers. Average minimum age is weighted by state population. Learner's Permit
Minimum Age is less accurately recorded and reported in FHWA data, and states vary
widely in the privileges it accords. Source: see description in text and Appendix.

 Each row and column represents the results from a different regression, for thirty-two total. Dependent variable
in Columns (1) to (4) is a measure of fuel economy in gallons per mile, and in Columns (5) to (8) is an indicator for
a large vehicle (larger than a station wagon). Columns (1), (2), (5) and (6) treat people as the level of observation;
other columns treat vehicles as the level of observation. Demographics include race, urbanization, and family size.
Observations weighted by person sample weights. Standard errors clustered by state. + p<0.10, * p<0.05, ** p<0.01,
