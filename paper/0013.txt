 The economics of information have
                                     been established by now as an integral
 part of economic analysis. The effect of the scarcity o information

 on the dispersion of prices and wages, the quality of goods,

 frictional unemployment and the microeconomics of inflation have been

 widely discussed in the literature.1
                                         However, surprisingly little has
 been written on the implications of
                                        search (and in particular, job
search) for the estimation of the wage function and its

ramifications in such cases as the estimation of the determinants of

labor force participation,
                             age-earning profiles, rates of return and
rates of depreciation of human
                                 capita]., degree of discrimation, etc.2
     Given a wage offer distribution,
                                         the parameters of the observed
wage distribution depend on the intensity of search. The lower a

person's wage demands the greater the chance of his finding an

acceptable job, but the lower the wage he expects to receive and the

wider the dispersion of acceptable
                                     wages around their mean. On the
other hand, the job seeker may opt for a more ambitious search

strategy, raising his minimum wage demand and
                                                  consequently increasing
the risk of remaining
                        unemployed, but also increasing the expected
                                  -2-

wage and decreasing the dispersion of the acceptable offers.

     Much of the discussion in labor economics concerning labor force

participation, wages, and earnings centers on the wage offer

distribution. However, the empirical validation of the theory is based

on the observed wage distribution. The implicit identification of wage

offers with observed wages is particularly suspect when those employed

constitute only a fraction of the total population. In this case, the

observed distribution represents only one part of the wage offer

distribution, the other part being rejected by the job seekers as

unacceptable. Thus, the traditional estimation procedures may involve

certain biases when applied to the secondary labor groups-- married

women, teenagers, and the aged.

     This paper attempts to point out some of these biases and suggests

a method for their correction. In the next section we outline a

simplified search model. The implicationsof this model for the

investigation of labor force participation, discrimination, and the

rates of return and rates of depreciation of hunan capital are discussed

in the third section. In the fourth section I describe an estimation

procedure for the wage_offer distribution using a simplified set of

assumptions. The paper closes with a discussion of some results

obtained using the new method.

    Correcting for what I call the selectivity bias I show that

traditional measures underestimate the rate of return to human capital

and its rate of depreciation when they are applied to married women.

These measures tend to overstate the white/non-white wage

differential, but to understate the wage offer differentials between
                                      -3-

  males and females and between women with and without young children.

  The use of data on the
                           average wage of working women yields upward
  biased estimates of the effect of wages on the labor force participation

  of married women, as well
                               as overestimates (in absolute terms) of the
  age and education effects.

  The Search Model

 Economic literature contains a large variety of search models. These

 models vary in their description of the search behavior and their

 assumptions about the job seeker's time horizon and his prior

 knowledge of market conditions. Some authors assume that the job

 seeker decides ahead of time on the number of searches he will

 undertake while others adopt a
                                   sequential search model. Some assume
 that the wage-offer distribution
                                     is well known, while others postulate
 that the job seeker revises his assumptions about the distribution

 as a consequence of the search. Some allow for an infinite time

 horizon while others restrict the time horizon.

     For simplicity let us assume that the job seeker is unemployed,

that he adopts a sequential search
                                      strategy, that he has perfect
knowledge on the job-offer distribution
                                            (but that he does not know
what is the wage associated with
                                    any specific vacancy), that he has
an infinite time horizon, and that
                                      job-hopping is prohibitively
expensive.3 The job seeker is faced by a stream of job offers.
                                                                      Let
it be assumed, for simplicity, that these offers arrive at
                                                           a uniform
rate, and let us define the time interval
                                             in such a way that the job
seeker samples one offer per period. Firms differ in their search

costs (e.g. the cost of ascertaining the worker's marginal productivity)
                                   -4-


 and consequently may offer different wages W to the same job seeker,

 where W consists of non-pecuniary as well as pecuniary returns. Let

 f(W) denote the density function of W.

      The job hunter decides on a wage W to distinguish between those

 wage offers which he deems acceptable and those which he rejects. The

 search process ends as soon as the job seeker receives an offer that

 exceeds W. Let W0 denote the job seeker's price of time at home; then

 he accepts no wage offer that falls short of W0, i.e. W'       W0. In
 general, the job seeker determines W so that any acceptable job offer

 will assure him of an income stream not inferior to the one he expects

 if he continues his search. Let
                                   R denote the present value of a one
 dollar wage offer accepted in Deriod n


                -t    -n
      R (l+r)
         t=n+l
               =(l+r) /r,

where it is assumed that the rate of discount r is constant. Let

I be the present value of the income stream the job seeker expects

to receive if he continues his search
                                        beyond period n (both R and

                                    nfl- In       i.e. Wn-> In/Rn
are discounted to period 0); then R W >       ,



     Assuming decisions are made at the end of the period [i.e. offers

accepted in period n start yielding returns only in period (n +
                                                                    1)],
the job seeker enjoys in period n an income of W0 - C, where C denotes

the costs of search which include both direct
                                                  costs (e.g. advertisement,

employment-agency fees, transportation) and indirect ones (e.g. the

value of leisure forgone owing to the search).

    Given the wage offer distribution f(W) and
                                                    the asking wage W*,there
                                              -5-

 exists a probability of          that the job seeker will accept a job in

period n, where


     P =
      n      Prob(Wn    W) =
                        n
                                  f
                                  n
                                      f(W)dW.                                       (2)




An acceptable job will yield on the average a wage of E, where


     E =           > W*) = _1                                                       (3)

                              n


If the offer received in period n is found to be unacceptable [an event

whose assigned probability is             -         the job seeker can still look

forward to an expected income stream of I. A job seeker embarking on

search in period n can, therefore, expect an income stream of


     'n-i = (1 +      r)(W0   -   C) +   PRE    +    (1   -   P)I,                  (4)



where r is the rate of discount. Given the infinite time horizon, the

constant rate of discount, constant costs of search (C), constant current

earnings (WO) and a constant wage-offer distribution [f(W)], the job

seeker in period n + 1 is faced by the same conditions facing the job

seeker in period n. Hence, the same optimum strategy that was employed

in period n will be adopted in period (n +            1), i.e. W = WÃ·        =

Consequently, the present value of the returns to search in period n

(discounted to period n) should equal the present value of the returns

to search in period (n + 1) [discounted to period (n +
                                                                     1)].   Put

differently,

    'n-i =
             (R1/R)I        = (1 +    r)I.                                        (5)

   Moreover,          the probability of acceptance (P) and the average
                                                                                       acceptable
   wage (E) remain constant over time.

            Inserting equations (5) and (1) in equation (4) and
                                                                                   given   that
        =   W,   P         P, and E =      E
                                               for every n, the asking wage equals5


                           {r(W0 - C) +
                                               PE].

  In other words, the minimum
                                               acceptable wage will be such as to equate
  the   cost of search plus forgone earnings with the net returns from
  search

        C   +   (J*     W0) =
                                      E-

         The lower boundary of W                   is W0.    Let   p0 be the probability that
 the    wage offer exceeds W0 and E0, the
                                                             average acceptable wage when the
 job seeker's wage demands are confined to WO. The job seeker
                                                                                      quits
 his search when W0 >             Infl
                                    /R , i.e.        when


                  E0       wO
                       r                                                                          (8)

 For example, in the case of
                                           married women, when their price of time in
home activities is
                                sufficiently high relative to their market
productivity (i.e. if W0 > E0                  -
                                                   rC/PÂ°),    the woman will decide to stay
out of the labor force altogether.

       Other things being equal, an increase in the job seeker's
                                                                                      price
of time (W0) reduces the
                                       forgone earnings associated with the rejection
of any wage offer (W*             -
                                      W0) and thus increases the
                                                                 job seeker's wage
demands, though at a lower rate than
                                                        the increase in the price of time
                                                 -7-


     dW* =
             r       dW0     dW0.                                                        (9)


 The increase in wage demands reduces the probability of employment


     dP =   .f(W*)dW* = -     r      f(W*)dwO <        0       ,                       (10)


 but increases the average acceptable wage


     dE =   f(W*)   (E - W*)dW* =
                                             r    f(W*) (E -
                                         r                   W*)dWO > 0   ,            (11)


Moreover, since the returns to entry into the labor force [i.e.

P0(E0 -    W0)/r]   are a diminishing function of W0, and since the cost of

search (C) may increase with WÂ°, this change increases the tendency to

abstain from entering the labor market.

     Given W0, an upward shift in the wage offer distribution, i.e.

an increase in the mean wage offer distribution
                                                                   [other parameters

of f(W) remaining constant], increases the returns to search and hence

the probability of labor force participation and wage demands. However,

the adjustment in wage demands lags behind the shift in f(W)


    dW* =
             r      dTiw
                                                                                       (12)



resulting in an increase in the probability of employment

                                         r
    dP =
            f(w*)Cdpw
                        -

The increase in the wage demands intensifies the effect of the shift of

f(W) on the expected acceptable wage offer. The average acceptable

wage increases, though at a slower rate than the shift in

 increase in the price of time the tendency to enter the labor force

 increases as long as        dl.!w >   dW0.       Both the shift in f(W) and the increase
 in W0, tend to increase wage demands. Assuming dW0 <

 both an increase in the probability of

The Wage Offer Distribution versus The Observed Wage Distribution:

The Selectivity Bias


The model described in the previous section analyzes the job seeker's

search strategy. One can design a somewhat similar model to describe

the employer's search policy. There are still some unresolved

problems: how do the two strategies interact and what is the process

that determines simultaneously the rate of unemployment, the vacancy

rate, and the distribution of wages. The formulation of such a model

is clearly beyond the scope of this paper. At the risk of being

unrigorous I shall therefore adopt a partial-equilibrium
                                                                               approach.    I


assume that the wage-offer distribution is given and is not affected by

the job seeker's strategy.6 Under this strong assumption, the observed

wage distribution is a subset of the wage-offer distribution, i.e. that

part of the distribution which is acceptable to the job seeker.

     Wage data constitute a prime source of information for the estimation
                                  -9-


 of labor supply and demand, the determinants and the effects of the

 investment in human capital (e.g. schooling, on-the-job training,

 health, migration) and the analysis of occupational choice. Objections

have been raised to the indiscriminate use of such data which usually

reflect only the average pecuniary returns to a person's labor before

the deduction of taxes. hence they do not allow a distinction between

the marginal wage and the average wage, do not account for non-pecuniary

returns (i.e. psychic income) and the value of on-the-job training, and

are overstated to the extent that work involves direct costs (e.g.

commuting) and that the supply of labor is affected by after-tax wages.

Several ingenious methods haVe been devised to overcome these

shortcomings.

     One bias that seems to have escaped economists' attention is

that introduced by the search process. Given the wage-offer

distribution, the bolder a person's search strategy (i.e. the higher

one's asking wage W*) the higher the wage he expects to accept. Thus, the

observed wage distribution has to be adjusted for differences in the

search policy.

     Nowhere is this bias more serious than in the case of the secondary

labor-force groups. These groups are characterized by partial

participation in the labor force, indicating that portions of the wage

offer distribution faced by these groups are considered too low to be

acceptable. The observed wage distribution is a truncated section of

the wage-offer distribution and its parameters depend on the parameters

of f(W) as well as on the truncation point W. Unless variations in     W
are corrected for one is bound to obtain biased estimates of the
                                          - 10 -


 parameters of f(W).

         Let us consider two groups of women who face the same wage-offer

 distribution, f(W), have the same costs of search, C, and the same

 discount rate. Let it also be assumed that both groups have the same

price-of-time distribution except that the mean price of time (IIWO) of

 one group is higher than that of the second [let these distributions be

denoted      by g(W0 - K), where K1 >    K2 > 0    and dPo =     dKJ.   Since both
groups face the same opportunities f(W) and have the same costs of
search, they      have the same critical price of time, i.e. the price that

distinguishes      between women who participate and those who do not
participate      in the labor force [i0 =          - (rC/P0)].    Their labor force

participation rate 0 equals


    0 = Prob(W0 <             =
                                  JWOg(wO - K)dW0    .
                                                                                     (15)


This rate is inversely related to the mean price of time (and to K)



    do =
              _(WÂ°)d0.                                                               (16)



        Given the wage-offer distribution, the price of time w9 determines

the asking wage W, which in turn determines the average acceptable wage

E1. Given a sufficiently long period of search (a large enough n), the

average wage of the labor force participants in a certain group equals


    F        E(EIWÂ° < W0) =       fWEg(wO   -   K)dW0    .
                                                                                     (17)


        It   can be shown that when g(W0) is log-convex (a property which
                                           â 11   â




  holds for most functions which we have in mind) a leftward shift in the

  price-of-time distribution (i.e. a decline in K) results in a reduction

  of the wage demands and the average wage,7 d/dPwo >         0.
       For example, let us assume two groups of married women, say whites

  and non-whites, with the same market characteristics (e.g. education

  and work experience), If there were no discrimination, and ignoring

  differences in psychic incomes, both groups should face the same wage

  offer distribution f(W) (Figure 1).         But, if an average white woman

 places on her time at home a higher value (W0)' than an average non-

 white because of her husband's higher earnings and the existence of

 other sources of income, her wage demands (W*) will be higher, and

 her realized average wage CE) will be higher, though the probability

 that she participates in the labor force may be lower. A comparison

 of the average wages of working women belonging to the two groups

     and         may lead to the conclusion that non-white women are

 discriminated against, while in effect discrimination is non-

 existent.

      On the other hand, if the two groups have the same price-of-

 time distribution, the same C and r, and the same wage-offer

 distribution except for a shift factor, then by (11) and (14) the

 difference in the critical price of time (W0) between the two groups

 is equal to the difference between their mean wage offers. We shall

 expect the group with the higher mean wage offer to have the higher

â¢ participation rate [d0/dp = dO/dW0 = g(W0) >        0].   The increase in the

 average wage however falls short of the increase in the mean wage offer,

 dE = [1   -                    <
               (dE/dPwo)IdIJw       dPw.

      Thus, if it is assumed that education affects market productivity

 (and hence the wage-offer distribution) but does not affect non-market

 productivity and the price of time, women with higher education are

 expected to have a higher participation rate. The average wage of these

 women however increases more slowly than their mean wage offers. These

 conclusions will hold even if we remove the assumption that education

 does not affect non-niarket productivity as long as it is assumed that

 its effect on market productivity exceeds that of non-market productivity

 (see Figure 2).

     wage comparisons of whites and non-whites and of women with

different levels of education are two of the cases that may be affected

by what may be called the "selectivity bias." In the remaining part of

this section I shall discussafew other cases where this kind of bias

may be prevalent.

I'lale-female wage differentials: Over 95 percent of males in the prime

age groups (25-55) participate in the labor force (U.S. Statistical

Abstract. 1971, p. 21), while the rate of participation of females, and

in particular married women, almost never exceeds 55 percent (ibid., p. 24).

The difference in participation can be explained by the lower wage-offer

distribution facing women, and probably by their higher value of time in

the absence of market opportunities. Both factors tend to increase the

difference between the average acceptable wage and the mean wage offer.

     It has been estimated (Fuchs, 1971) that female average hourly

earnings adjusted for color, schooling, age, city size, marital status,

class of worker, and length of work-trip constituted in 1959 only two

thirds of the hourly earnings of non-farm males. Given the "selectivity

 bias"   it seems that this figure underestimates the "true" male-female wage

 differentials.

 Age-wage profiles:        Labor force participation rates of males vary

 very little in the 25-54 age-groups, decline somewhat (to a level of

 about 80 percent) in the 55-64 group and fall very steeply (to 25

 percent) thereafter. Female participation rates have a bimodal

 distribution with peaks in the 20-24 and 45-54 age groups (iJ.

 Statistical Abstract 1971, p. 24). These variations in the

participation rates may bias the estimates of the age-wage profiles.

     Age-wage profiles (or age-earning profiles) are used frequently to

estimate the rate of depreciation of human capital (Rosen, 1972) and the

rates of return to education and on-the-job training. Retirement
                                                                     may
introduce a bias in the estimate of the rate of depreciation and

obsolescence of human capital. The direction of the bias is however

indeterminate.    it depends on who is the first to retire, those with the

high wage offers or those with the low wage offers. The increase in

non-human capital with age may increase the shadow price of time, which

will rise more for those who benefited over time from the
                                                             higher wage

offers, so that they will be the first to retire. On the other hand,

the margin between the market wage and the home wage is smallest for

those at the lower tail of the wage distribution.   Any deterjorjatjonin
wage offers may therefore make them leave the labor force.

     Likewise, as argued above, inter-educational variations in the

participation rates may bias the estimated rate of return on

investment in human capital of women. It is well established that

women's labor force participation increases with education.    Put
                                   -16-


 differently, an increase in education shifts the wage-offer distribution

 by more than it increases the woman's price of time at home (the latter

 increases either because of the effect education may have on her home

 productivity and/or because of the increased, probability that she is

 married to a man with higher earnings).   Ignoring the effect education

 may have on the dispersion of the wage-offer distribution, the

 difference between the observed average wage rate (E) and the mean

wage-offer distribution shrinks with education.8 The difference between

the observed wages of working women in two education groups therefore

tends to understate the difference between their mean wage offers and

the estimated rate of return to education.

     It has been argued (Michael and Lazear, 1971) that the woman's wage

rate may be affected by the number and age composition of her children.

The existence of young children increases the demand for the wife's time

at home and her price of time and reduces her tendency to participate

in the labor force. Leaving the labor market may accelerate the

depreciation of the woman's market-oriented skills and shift her wage-

offer distribution downward. However, the decline in the wage-offer

distribution does not necessarily result in a decline in the observed

wage of working mothers. If the increase in these women's wage demands

is sufficiently large it will offset the decline in the wage offers

and result in an increase in the observed average wage.9

The determinants of ].abor force participation:      Labor force

participation increases with the mean of the wage-offer distribution

and declines with W0. A prerequisite for the estimation of the

determinants of participation is knowledge of the distribution of the
                                    - 17   -




price   of time at home (Ben-Porath, 1973; Gronau, 1973b; Lewis, 1971).

However, this information is insufficient unless supplemented by

knowledge of the mean wage offer. Replacing the latter by the average

observed wage yields only imperfect estimates of the parameters of the

labor force participation function, unless dne knows the relationship

between the average wage and the mean wage offer (dE/dpw).

        It was shown that an increase in the mean wage offer     leads to

an increase in the observed wage (E), but that this increase is smaller

than the original shift in p. Differences ii% the observed wages of

different, say, education groups therefore tend to understate the

difference between the mean wage offers and to overstate the

sensitivity of participation rates of changes in wages. Furthermore,

since the correlation between      and E is not perfect, the

misspecification of the wage variable introduces errors of measurement

into the equation which may also bias the other estimates of the

determinants of labor force participation.

The Estimation of the Wage Offer Distribution

The observed wage distribution is only one section of the wage-offer

distribution, namely those wages that exceed the asking wage W* where

the price of time of the job seeker falls short of W0. To prevent the

kind of selectivity bias discussed in the preceding section the original

wage-offer distribution must be generated. The derivation of the wage-

offer distribution from the truncated observed distribution is a

difficult task even if the point of truncation (i.e. W*) is known, and it

verges on the impossible when W* and its determinants, i.e. the price of

time, the costs of search, and the rate of discount are not known. In the

following    section I adopt an oversimplified version of the search model.

This   section       is therefore merely illustrative, serving, it is hoped, as

a base point for future research.

       Let it be assumed that the job seeker is aware of the best offer

he can attain10 W and let his policy be to stay out the labor force if

his price of time W0 exceeds his best offer W and otherwise to accept the

wage offer W. Given these oversimplified assumptions the participation

rate is


    U = Prob(W > W0) =           Prob(w      = W -          > 0)   =     g(w)dw,                    (18)



where g(w) is the density function of the differential w =                            W -     W0.   The

average wage of working women is


    E = E(WW > W0) =             -e-!        f       Wh(W,WÂ°)dWdwÂ°,                                 (19)

the value satisfying Prob(Z > -p/a) = O,can be generated from the normal

The Data and the Results

To estimate the wage-offer distribution I used the 1960 Census 1/1000

sample.   I focused on married women, the sample consisting of 26,530

women belonging to urban primary families, spouse present. Assuming that

the mean of the wage-offer distribution is a function of race, age,

education, and number of children, the data were subclassified by these

characteristics: 2 race groups (white, negro) x 4 age groups (below

30, 30-39, 40-49, 50+) x 4 education groups (elementary school, high

school, college, and graduate studies)x 3 groups for number of children

below the age of 6 (0,1,2+). Since it was assumed that the wife's

price of time in the absence of market opportunities is, in addition to

these factors, a function of income, the data were further divided by

income excluding wife's earnings (12 groups: less than $2,000, 2,000-

2,999, 3,000-3,999,...,9,000-g,999, 10,000-14,999, 15,000-19,999, and

20,000-f).14 This subclassification yielded 1,152 cells which are the

basic observations of my sample.

     For each cell I computed two statistics: (a) the labor force

participation rate of women belonging to the cell (i.e. the percentage

of women working or looking for work during the week preceding the

census), and (b) the average hourly wage rate of working women

belonging to the cell. The 1960 census did not contain any direct

evidence on the hourly wage rate and I had to do with an imperfect

substitute, defining the hourly wage as the ratio of the woman's 1959

earnings divided by the product of the number of weeks she worked in
                                  - 21   -




 1959 and the number of hours she worked during the week preceding the

census. Finally, to rule out the possibility of negative mean wage

offers, the assumption of bivariate normality was replaced by the

assumption of bivariate log-normality. Thus, instead of computing the

usual arithmetic mean wage rate I computed the arithmetic mean of the

natural logarithm of the wage rates. The dependent variable E in

equation (25) therefore denotes the natural logarithm of the geometric

mean of the hourly wage rates.

     Equation (25) was estimated for 4 groups: whites with no children

under 6 years old, whites with one child under 6, whites with two or

more children under 6 and non-whites with no children under 6 (the other

two groups are too small to allow estimation). The results are presented

in Table i.15 All the regressions are significant and all the

coefficients of X are positive as expected (they are significant in

three out of the four cases, the exception being the regression for

non-whites).

     Given the estimates of a0 one can compute the median of the log-

normal best-wage-offer distribution          =                These estimates

are presented in Table 2 and Figure 3 for the group of white women with

no young children, together with the original data of the geometric

means of the hourly wage rates.

     Figure 3 demonstrates two of the salient features of the age-wage

profiles of married women. The first of these, often discussed in the

literature, is their flatness. Thus, except for the wages of women

graduates, there is very little change in the average wage of working

married women over their life cycle.16 The second feature, one rarely

 commented on, is the fact that the profiles show no tendency to slope

 downward as a result of negative net investment in human capital. 17

      The replacement of the average wage of working women by the imputed

 median wage offers has very little effect on the slope of the early

 parts of the age profiles, but reverses the slope of the later segment

 (the exception again being the graduate group). It seems that a

 married woman faces her peak wage offer at the age of 30-40 when she has

 elementary or high school education, and at the age of 40-50 when she

 is a graduate.18

      Sixteen observations are too small a sample to derive any strong

 conclusions. Still, at the risk of seeming foolhardy,         i could not

 resist the temptation to apply to the observations in Table 2 some of

 the techniques devised and applied with such success by Jacob Mincer

 (1972) to earnings of prime-age males. Assuming that schooling and

on-the-job training involve no direct costs, and that the ratio of

"time-equivalent" investment in on-the-job training declines linearly

with age (Mincer, 1972, Ch. 3) I estimated the function


    E = b0 + b1S + b2T + b3T2,
                                                                         '(26)


where S denotes the number of
                                   years of schooling (it was assumed that
these are 8, 12, 15 and 18 for the four education
                                                       groups, respectively),
and T denotes the number of
                                 years of working experience (defined19 as
T = age   -   S - 8).   To correct for heteroscedasticity each of the

observations was weighted by the number of working women belonging to

that age-education group.2Â° The results of equation (26) are compared

with the estimates of a similar regression equation in which the
                                    - 26   -




 estimated   median wage offer is the dependent variable (see Table 3).

      The strong multico].linearity between the variable T and its

 square (the simple correlation coefficient is 0.97) undermines the

 reliability of the estimated effect of market experience.21    Keeping the
 shakiness of the evidence in mind, it is still iDteresting to compare

 the coefficients of T and T2. Thus, while the coefficients of both I

 and T2 in the regression of the average wage rate are positive, implying

 an upward sloping age-wage profile, the coefficient of 12 is negative

 when the dependent variable is the imputed wage offers, as one would

 expect. The wage offers increase at an ever diminishing rate,

 reflecting the decline in investment in human capital over the life

 cycle. An absolute decline in wage offers sets in after 25-30 years of

experience (-b2/b3 =   27).

     Assuming that education has the same effect on the productivity of

time in all its uses- (e.g. work in the market, work at home, education

and leisure) the coefficient of years of schooling in equation (26)

measures the rate of return to formal education (Mince; 1972, Ch.
                                                                     3).

The comparison of the coefficient of S in the regression of the wage

rate with that of the mean wage offer confirms our prior expectations.

The use of the observed wage rather than the imputed wage offer tends

to bias downward the estimated rate of return to schooling. The extent

of the bias increases when the experience variables (T and 12) are

omitted from the regression.

     The data on the average wage rates in the other three groups (white

women with young children and non-whites with no young children) ,and

consequently the other three regressions ,show no clear systematic pattern

 of   behavior, and I have not attempted to apply equation (26) to these
           22
 groups,        but have made do with a comparison of the average wage and

 wage offers of the women belonging to these groups. This comparison

 is contained in Table 4.

       The first line of Table 4 describes the (geometric) average wage

 of working women belonging to the four groups investigated in our

 study. There are only slight differences in average wages between the

 three groups of white women, regardless of the number of young

 children, and there exists a substantial gap between the wage enjoyed

by white women and that of non-whites, the latter being less than two

thirds of the former. As the second line of this table indicates, this

pattern is little affected by using as weights the total number of

women belonging to a cell rather than the number of the working women

belonging to the cell.

       The average wage of each group naturally depends on its age and

educational composition. To standardize for differences in composition

one has to use a uniform weighting scheme. The weights used to compute

the "standardized potential wage rate" (line 3) are the number of white

women without young children belonging to the age and education group.

The isolation of the age and education effect only slightly reduces the

white non-white differential (from 0.61 to 0.65) but changes the wage

hierarchy of the white women. Thus, while the unstandardized figures

give an edge to women without young children (the wage of women with

2 young children being 87 percent of the wage of women without young

children) this relationship is reversed when one accounts for age and

education differences between the groups (the ratio becoming 1.07).

 These figures thus appear to contradict the hypothesis that
                                                             children

 result in accelerated depreciation of the mother's market skills.23

      The replacement of the average wage by the standardized imputed

 median wage offer (line 4) leads to significant changes in the

 observed wage pattern. The effect of children on the mother's wage

 offers turns out to be a prominent feature of the wage structure. The

 wage a white mother with two young children can expect to get in the

 market is only two thirds of that of a woman belonging to the same

 age-education group who does not have young children.   (On the other

 hand, one young child does not seem to affect his mother's
                                                              wage offers.)
 Furthermore, the removal of the selectivity bias seems to remove over

one half of the white/non-white differential (non-whites'
                                                            wage offers
being 85 percent of those of whites), calling for major revisions in the

evaluation of the importance of discrimination as a factor affecting

the wage structure of non-white women.

     On the other hand, it seems that the estimate of the male-female

differential must be revised upwards. The median wage offer of

married women is only about 70 percent of the standardized average wage.

Since the male labor-force participation rate is close to 100 percent,

the data on their wages is hardly affected by the selectivity bias (X

being very close to zero). The comparison of wage offers of males and

females would therefore show a substantially larger differential than

the 3:2 ratio quoted earlier in this paper.

     Finally, it has been argued (Lewis, 1971) that using the average

wage of working women rather than their mean wage offer results in an

upward bias in the estimated effect of wages on labor force
                                                              participation.

 I have elsewhere (Gronau, l973a) used the results presented in Table 2

to estimate the price-of-time distribution and the implicit participation

function of American married women. Employing probit analysis I examined

the effect of the woman's and her husband's age and education, family

income, and the number and age composition of the children on her

price of time, i.e. her labor force participation (I allowed the

effect of children to differ according to their mother's education).

The results of this analysis are reproduced in Table 5, where one

regression contains the (geometric) average wage rate of working women

as an explanatory variable, and the other regression uses our estimate

of

     These results clearly confirm our expectations. The introduction

of the wage offers as an explanatory variable considerably reduces the

estimated wage effect. The misspecification of the wage variable also

affects the estimated effects of other variables, notably the wife's

age and education.24 We have seen earlier that the observed wage of

working women belonging to the 50+ age group considerably overstates

the wage offers faced by their non-working counterparts. The decline

in labor force participation witnessed in that group is therefore

attributed to age, while essentially it is merely a wage effect.

Likewise, changes in the observed wage tend to understate the changes

in the wage offers associated with an increase in education.   Using the

average wage of working women tends to overplay the direct effect of

education on labor force participation.25

     The data on the hourly wage rate used in our estimates are far from

perfect. One might prefer a long term measure of participation, say,

 annual rather than weekly participation. Data problems are enhanced by

a set of admittedly very strong assumptions, notably the assumption of

homoscedasticity of the price of time and the wage-offer distribution.

Finally, the estimation model is based on a search model that is

clearly sub-optimal. Thus one should regard the results of this

section as no more than an empirical
                                       exercise. One should strive to

overcome these shortcomings by using a better suited body of data, by

assuming a different joint distribution of W and W0 that calls for

weaker assumptions, or by focusing on a different statistic (e.g. the

standard deviation of the
                            wage of working women).26 Nevertheless, it
seems, at least to me, that the evidence collected here is a strong

enough warning that comparisons of wage data should take selectivity

bias into account.

          This study is part of the NBER's project on Economic and Social

 Measurement funded by National Science Foundation. The paper has not

 undergone the full critical review accorded the National Bureau's

 studies.     I am greatly indebted to Gregg H. Lewis and Robert T. Michael

 for their extensive notes.        I benefited from the suggestions of Gary

 Becker, Stanley Diller, Victor Fuchs, James Hckman, Thomas Juster and

 Esther Samuel. Finally, I would like to thank Margo Faier for her

 devoted research assistance.


      'The economics of information date back to Stigler's seminal

papers (1961, 1962) in the early 1960's. The theory gained renewed

popularity in the early 1970's in the context of the microeconomic

analysis of the Phillips curve (Gronau 1971, McCall 1970, MortÃ©nsen 1970,

Phelps 1970). For other applicatjonsand a survey of the theory see

 Nelson, 1970 and Rothschild, 1971.

     2One    of   the few exceptions is Lewis (1971).

     3Thus, I rule out a search strategy that calls for the job seeker to

accept the first job offered, continue his search while on the job,and

switch to a better job as soon as it becomes available. This kind of

strategy is inconsistent with voluntary unemployment.

     Admittedly, this model, first proposed in the literature by McCall

(1970) and Mortensen (1970), is based on somewhat simplified assumptions.

The use of a more sophisticated approach would              not have affected

our major conclusion that there is a positive correlation between the

initial wage demands and     the   accepted wage.

        4For a more rigorous proof of this statement see McCall (1970) and

 Mortensen (1970). This conclusion does not hold if the ob seeker's

 time horizon is finite, if imperfections in the capital market result

 in an increase in r as the search proceeds, if there are increasing

 costs of search, if current earnings (e.g. marginal utility of leisure)

 diminish, or if the job seeker changes his evaluation of f(W) as the

 result of the search (see Gronau, 1971).

Rearranging terms, one obtains equation (6).

    6Thus, I rule out the possibility that the employer is aware of the

job seeker's search strategy and adapts his wage offer accordingly.

    7Let us define the density function

                                    g(W0 -                           where W0
                                              K)/OK
    hK(WÂ°) =

                                    0                                whereW0 >W0
where         =
                   Prob(W0             W0). The likelihood ratio of hK(WÂ°) depends solely

on the likelihood ratio of g(W0 -                         K):
                                   =                            - K1)/g(W0          -
    hK(WO)/hK(wO)                       (e/e){g(wO                                      K2)],
                                                           - 40    -




 since (0 /0 ) is                a constant which is independent of W0 (it depends on
               K2 K1
 W0, K1 and K2). Thus hK(WO) has a monotone likelihood ratio if

 g(W0 - K) has one, a necessary and sufficient condition for which is

 that -log g is convex (Lehman 1959, p. 330).

      Since E has been shown to be a nondecreasing function of W0, and if

 hK(WO) has a monotone likelihood ratio in W0

           =       f    EhK(WO)dWO


 is a nondecreasing function of K (ibid., p. 74).

      8An increase in the standard deviation of the wage-offer

distribution leads to an increase in wage demands

                                        0                 where        X = (E -

Its   effect on the probility of acceptance and                             the   average acceptable wage

      dE =             - f(W*)    (X* -
                                                r        X)(E -

where      X =         (W*   -

      10                 .
        Note that from this point on W denotes the best wage offer and

f(W) denotes the best_wage-offer distribution rather than the wage-

offer distribution.

 the wife's wage offers which may arise because of the positive

 correlation in their natural ability.

 o = 0.84        >   -u/a = -1.

        14This classification is very similar but not identical to the one

 I used before (Gronau, 1973b).

where the basic group (i.e. the subscript 00) is the group of women

 30-39 years old with high school education. To derive the estimators

of the mean wage offers [a0 in equation (25)] one has to compute

                             These estimates are presented in Table 1.

      However, I have not recalculated the t coefficients. Thus, the t.

coefficients (j =            1,... ,l5)   presented in Table 1 reflect the significance

of the differential between the mean wage offers of the j-th group and

the base group (i.e. they serve to test the hypotheses H0 :                               =

while   the t coefficient for the base group measures how significantly

different is the mean wage offer of this group from zero (i.e.

H. : p =0).

                 flatness may be partly due to a cohort effect, and does not

necessarily imply that women entering the labor force now can expect no

increase in their wage rates.

     170f course, this may be merely due to the crude aggregation of

 the wage data. The expected downward sloping portion of the age-wage

 profilemjghthave emerged had I used a more refined age classification.

 However, it is noteworthy that Arleen Leibowitz, who fitted a quadratic

 function to data of weekly wages of married women who are full time

 workers, found that the wage rates tend to decrease only after 43

 years of experience when the woman is a high school graduate, and after

60 years of experience when she has 13 years of schooling or more

 (Leibowitz 1972, p. 43). This would imply that the peak of the age-wage

profile is reached at the age of 61 if the woman is a high school

graduate and at the age of 83 if she finished college (the regression

coefficients in the case of elementary school are insignificant).


    18The negatively sloping portion of the wage-offer profiles may, of

course, be due purely to inter-cohort differences.

    19Age is assumed to be 26, 35, 45 and 55 in the four age groups,

respectively.

    20The major conclusions of this analysis would not have changed had

I used a different weighting scheme, e.g. estimating an unweighted

regression or weighting each observation by the total number of women

belonging to that group.

    210ne should   not conclude from the low t-values associated with T
and T2   that length of work experience does not play any role in the

determination of wage rates of married women. The omission of T2 from

equation (26) results in the coefficient of T becoming significantly

different from zero (see also Leibowitz 1972, p. 43).

        22Any attempt of this kind in the case of white women with
                                                                                young
  children would have proved futile in the face of the large number of

  empty cells in these groups.

        23This statement has to be qualified since the results
                                                               presented in

                                                      number of children older than six.

       24i owe this point to Robert E. Hall. Note that the effect of
                                                                     the
 misspecifjcatjon of the wage wariable on the estimated effect of any
 variable     on the housewife's price of time is indeterminate.             This effect
 is measured as the ratio of the probit coefficÂ±ents of that variable

 and the coefficient of the wage variable. The effect of the

 misspecificatjon in this case therefore depends on the direction and

 magnitude of the bias in both probit coefficients.
                                                                    For example, though
 the education coefficient is biased (in absolute terms) upward, the

effect of education on the woman's price of time remains unchanged when

E is replaced by

    26A set of data that seems very alluring in this context is the

National Longitudinal Survey: Survey of Work Experience of Females

30-44       (the "Ohio Survey") which contains information on the asking

wage of non-working women.

    Analysis of the variance of the observed wage distribution (S) may

yield further insights into the problems discussed above, since it can

be shown that if W and W0 are                         normally distributed

        =   a   [1 -    )2(a2/a2)( + Z)X].
Assuming a, and        Â°WO
                             are constant one can   regress   S on X(X + Z) to

obtain independent estimates of these parameters.
