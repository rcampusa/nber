                The Social Security Student Benefit
                    Program and Family Decisions


                                ABSTRACT



     In 1965 Congress established the Social Security Student Benefit Program

which provided benefits for children of deceased, disabled or retired workers,

who were enrolled in college full—time and were not married, up until the

semester they turned age 22. The program grew to be a major financial aid

program; at its peak in FY 81 it represented about 20% of all federal outlays

on student assistance for higher education. The program was terminated for

students newly entering college as of May 1, 1982.

     Somewhat surprisingly, in contrast to the debate that accompanies most

social programs, debate over the student benefit program focused on its

costs and almost totally ignored the possible effects of the program.

Virtually nothing is known about how the program influenced potential

recipients decisions to attend college, the quality of the education they

received, the amount that recipients' families contributed to the

student's education, or recipients' in—school and summer employment.

This paper seeks to shed insights into some of these effects, using data

from the Social Security Administration's 1973 Survey of Student Beneficiaries.

I. Introduction

     In 1965 Congress amended the Social Security Program in a number of

ways, including the establishment of the Social Security Student Benefit

Program. This program provided benefits for children of deceased, disabled

or retired workers, who were enrolled in college full—time and were not

married, through the semester including their 22nd birthday. As Table

indicates, the program grew to be a major financial aid program for college

students. In December of 1977 over 860,000 students, about one—eighth of

all full—time enrolled 18 to 21 year olds received such benefits, and by

December of 1981, the benefits averaged about $3,000 per year per student.

Indeed, at its peak in fiscal year 1981, about 20 percent of all federal

outlays on student assistance for higher education were channeled through

the program.1

     By the mid—1970s the program had fallen into disfavor in Washington.

Critics of the program argued that it was no longer required because of

the growth of "needs—based" financial aid programs administered by the

Department of Education, that it had unfavorable income—distribution conse-

quences because it was not "needs—based" and because payments were not

limited to college costs nor contingent on satisfactory academic progress,

and that the growth of program costs contributed to the financial problems

of the Social Security trust fund.2 Ultimately the critics prevailed and

the program was terminated by Congress as part of the general budget

cutting actions of the Reagan Administration under the omnibus Budget

Reconciliation Act of 1981. This Act reduced benefits for existing

recipients and, eliminated benefits for all students who entered college

after May 1, 1982.
                                                                               2




     Somewhat surprisingly, in contrast to the debate that accompanies

most social programs, debate over the student benefit program focused on

its costs and almost totally ignored the possible effects of the program.3

Virtually nothing is known about how the program influenced potential

recipients' decisions to attend college, the quality of the education the

recipients received, the amount that recipients' families contributed to

the student's education, or recipients' in—school and summer employment.

     This paper seeks to shed insights into some of these effects, using

data from the Social Security Administration's 1973 Survey of Student

Beneficiaries, the only national survey of participants in the program.

Although the program has been ended, such information is essential for

informed debate on the methods by which the federal government should sub-

sidize higher education.

    The next section presents a simple conceptual model of family

decision—making that serves as the basis for our empirical research.

Section III describes the data we use and discusses some econometric

issues. Section IV presents our empirical results; it is followed by

some brief concluding remarks.



II. A Family Utility Maximization Model

     Suppose that the utility function of a family with a college—age

child is given by the quasi—concave function


          (1)   U =   U[C,Q,t]   U,U2,U3
                                               0


where C represents the parents' consumption, Q         represents   the quality

of the college that the child attends and t        the time that the student

is not employed, while in college. Presumably the family derives positive
                                                                           3




marginal utility from increased consumption, from having the child attend

a higher quality institution (both for current consumption and investment

reasons), and from having the student work fewer hours while in college

(which would free up more time for study and participation in extra-

curricular activities).

       The family seeks to maximize this utility function subject to a number

of constraints. First, parents' consumption is equal to their total income

(Y) minus their contribution to the student's college expenses (Xe).


            (2)
                  c=Y—x
Second, the total cost of the student's attending college, which is assuired
to   be an incr€asing function of the quality of the college, (E(Q)), is

equal to the sum of the parental contribution, the student's own financial

contribution to his education (X5) and the total (S) of the scholarship

from the college and other subsidies, such as the social security payment,

that he receies.

            (3)   E(Q) =    + x + S

Finally, the student's own contribution is determined by his wage rate (w)

multiplied by the number of hours he works during the summer and academic

year (t); the latter plus his rionwork time just exhausts the total time

available.4


            (4)   X=   wt

            (5) T=tw +tn
      The solution to this maximization problem can be written, in general,

as
                                                                           4



     (6)             = x(SYw)
             Q = Q(S,Y,w)

             t
                 n
                     =   tn (S,Y,w).
That is, the parental contribution to the child's education, the quality

of the college chosen, and the student's nonwork time (and hence part—time

employment) simultaneously depend upon the parents' income, the student's

wage rate and the total subsidy the student receives for attending college.

     At this level of generality, one can unfortunately not obtain

unambiguous qualitative predictions from the model. However, if one assumes

that the utility function is Cobb—Douglas and that the total costs of

attending college function is linear in college quality, it is straight-

forward to show that an increase in the subsidy, S, should lead to a

decrease in parental contributions, an increase in the quality of the

college attended and a decrease in student employment (an increase in t).

Similarly,   an increase in family income, Y, should increase parental

contributions, increase college quality and decrease a student's work-

effort. Finally, an increase in the wage rate should decrease parental

contributions and increase college quality; its effect on student employment

is still ambiguous and depends on the strength of income and substitution

effects.

III. Data and Econometric Issues

     Data from the 1973 Survey of Student Beneficiaries, the only national

survey of participants in the program, is used below along with our

analytic framework, to analyze what some of the effects of the program

were. This survey contained data for 2,932 student beneficiaries, o.
                                                                             5




which approximately 72 percent were enrolled in 2 or 4 year colleges.

The remainder were 19 year olds still enrolled in high school or were

enrolled in vocational or trade schools. The 2,077 individuals enrolled

in two or four year colleges from the sample used in our analyses.5

       The survey contains explicit information on the family's annual con-

tribution to the cost of the studentts education 2' as well as three

measures of the student's work—effort, total annual labor earnings (Y3),

total hours worked during the academic year (Y4) and total hours worked

during the summer (Y5). In the absence of information on the quality of

the college attended, we use as a proxy the net cost of the student's edu-

cation (Y1) ——the total annual cost of the student's education (tuition,

room and board, books, travel, etc.) less all forms of scholarship aid

the student received except social security.6

       Explanatory variables contained in the empirical model are a vector

of family—specific variables that are meant to control for the family's

"ability to pay" for the student's education (family income, value of th€

family home, family receipt of welfare benefits, number of siblings,

presence of less than two parents in the household), family taste for

education (student race, sex, and age, and parents' education), the

student's academic ability (high school grade point average and whether

the student was 16 or younger when graduated from high school), and area—

specific variables to control for lirriitationson the student's employment

opportunities (state unemployment rate) and his or her access to both public

and private educational opportunities (public and private college tuition

levels and enrollment in the state). A complete list of explanatory variables

and   their   sources is found in Table 2.
                                                                            6



     The variable of prime importance, however, is the student's social

security benefit level. Now the reported student social security benefit

level varies across recipients, creating a form of natural experiment,

because of differences in the lifetime earnings in covered employment of

the parent and/or because families with more than one child receiving

benefits often had their total benefits constrained by the program's
                         8
"family—maximum" rule.       In the latter case, the marginal social security

benefit payment that the family received when the student beneficiary

enrolled in college is not equal to the reported (by the Social Security

Administration or the family) benefit that he or she received; the latter

is simply the average benefit received by each child recipient in the

family including the student. Indeed, in the case where a family is

already at the maximum because of benefits being paid to a number of child

beneficiaries under age 18, the marginal family social security benefits

that accrue when a 19 to 22 year old child enrolls in school is zero.

     As a result, in our empirical work we experiment with several different

measures of the net social security benefits received by the family from

the student benefit program. The first two are our estimates of the

marginal social security benefits the family actually receives from

having the student enrolled in college (S1), or from having the student

and some of his other siblings aged 18 to 21 enrolled in college (S2).

These measures were calculated using an algorithm we developed based upon
                                                                        9
program rules and knowledge of various characteristics of the family.

The third is the family's estimate of the difference in total family

income due to the student's social security benefit payment (S3).

Finally, we use Social Security Administration administTative data on the
                                                                           7




maximum benefit level the student is eligible for (S4); this would be

the benefit level actually received in the absence of a family maximum

limit. While in "theory" the true marginal measures (S1 and S2)

should perform best, the measure(s) families actually base decisions on

is an open question.

     Before turning to the empirical results, it is worth stressing that

all of the individuals in the sample are potential social security student

beneficiaries who have chosen to be actually beneficiaries by attending

colleges. There is no information in the sample on individuals who were

eligible for the program but chose not to attend college. Thus, without

further assumptions, one cannot directly estimate what the effect of the

program was on students' decisions to attend college. Our estimates of

the various outcome equations may also be subject to a form of selection

bias; we may confound the effect of the social security benefit level on

parental contributions, the cost of the college attended, and students'

part—time employment, with the effect of the potential benefit level on

the college enrollment decision.'0

     In the absence of any data on eligible individuals who choose not to

enroll in college, it is difficult to control for this form of selection

bias. However, if one is willing to specify a set of variables and a func—

tional form for a "decision to enroll" equation, as well as a statistical

distribution for the joint distribution of the error terms across this

and the other equations in (6), then a recently developed maximum likeli-

hood procedure can be used to get consistent estimates of the effect of

social security student benefit levels on both the decision to enroll in

college and the outcomes in (6)h1 Estimates derived front this method are
                                                                      8



very sensitive to the specific assumptions made and in the absence of any

strong theory which would permit us to exclude any explanatory variables

from either the "decision to enroll" or other equations, it proved impossible

for us to obtain stable parameter estimates when we applied it.



IV, Empirical Results

     Table 2 presents OLS estimates of the net expenditure on education

(Y1) and family contribution to education (Y2) equations, as well as

Tobit estimates of the student recipients' annual earnings (Y3). in—school

employment hours (Y4) and summer employment hours (Y5) equations, for

the entire sample, when S1 is used as the social security program vari-

able. Tobit is used in the latter three cases because of the large number

of students with zero work experience and earnings.

     Although the control variables (theX') are not of primary interest

to us, those coefficients that are statistically significant often (but

not always) accord with out prior expectations. For example, white

recipients tend to work more than nonwhite recipients, and male recipients

work more than female recipients. Higher parent education levels lead to

greater parental contributions to their children's education and, in the

case of mother's education, to greater expenditures on college and less

student employment. The greater the number of siblings, the smaller the

family contribution and the more the student works while in school.

Finally, the distribution of public and private college enrollment oppor-

tunities in the state in which the student's family resides clearly

matters. Other things equal, an increase in public (private) enrollment

opportunities leads to lower (higher) expenditures on education and

parental contributions and lower (higher) student academic year employmont.'2
                                                                           9



     Turning to the marginal social security benefit variable, Si,

Table 1 suggests that it significantly influences only recipient students'

in—school employment, with higher benefit levels leading to a reduction in

work—effort. The mean monthly marginal benefit level in this sample was

$53, which implies given the   Tobit   coefficient of —.238, that in the absence

of any benefits, the typical recipient would have worked a total of 7.5 hours

more during the school year. This is clearly not a substantial effect.

     Substituting the other measures of social security benefits does not

provide any evidence of other substantial program effects. The top panel

of Table 3 shows the coefficients of the four different social security

variables from equations identical to those reported in Table 2, save

that the alternative measures were used. This table suggests that both

the family's estimate of the increase in its income due to the student's

program benefits (S3) and the maximum benefit amount the student could

have received (S4) are positively associated with the net cost of educa-

tion and the family's contribution to the student's educational expenses;

the latter a seemingly perverse result (but see below).

     But here, again the magnitudes are small. For example, given a mean

value for S3 of $110 per month in the sample, the estimates suggest that in

the absence of the program, the net cost of the student's education would

decline by roughly $9.50 a month and the family's contribution by $9.02
       13
a month. Statistical significance obviously does not imply policy

significance; the net effect of the student benefits appears to be pri-

marily an income transfer to the student and his or her family.

     We should note, however, that when the sample is stratified by

whether the student attended a public or private college, a slightly

different picture emerges.14 The second and third panels of Table 3
                                                                          10


present   the coefficients of the various social security benefit measures

from these equations. For recipients, who attend public colleges, roughly

70 percent of the sample, the various measures of social security benefits

appear to be totally unrelated to the students' net cost of education,

their parents' contribution to their education and their work—effort.

In contrast, for the smaller sample of recipients who attend private

institutions, the evidence seems to suggest that higher student benefits

lead to higher net expenditures on education, higher parental contribu-

tions to recipients' education and lower student in—school employment.

Moreover, the magnitudes of these effects are often double the ones ob-

served in the overall sample.


IV, Concluding Remarks

     Our study suggests the following tentaLive conclusions: The Social

Security Student Benefit Program did not appear in our sample to influence

students' decisions as to whether to attend public or private colleges ('see

footnote 14). Within the group that attended public institutions, benefLt

levels did not affect the net costs of education, primarily we expect,

because tuition levels in public institutions do not vary much within a

state and most students who attend public institutions stay in their "home."

state.'5 Surprisingly, the benefits also appear not to influence parental

contributions or student employment levels.

     In contrast, for the students who attend private institutions, the

program appears to have had more effects (although in a quantitative sense

these effects are still quite small). In this sector, there is a wide

variety of colleges offering a range of tuition—quality combinations. Higher

benefit   levels permit families to "stretch" to afford higher quality—higher
                                                                          11




cost institutions; as a result both net expenditures on education and

parents' contribution to college costs increase. Moreover, because students'

nonwork time is valued, higher benefit levels do lead to a reduction in

their in—school and/or summer hours of employment. Viewed in this way, the

positive association observed between parental contributions and student

social security benefit level appears to be less of an anomaly.

     Of course, all of the above results were obtained for data from a

sample of recipients who, by definition, must attend college. The absence

of data on potential recipients who choose not to attend college has pre-

vented us from analyzing whether the program influences the decision to

enroll in any college (potentially the most important effect) and leaves

open the possibility, as noted above, that our estimates are subject to

selectivity bias. Nonetheless, given the growth of needs—based financial

aid programs, the evidence presented here at least provisionally supports

the view that the decision to eliminate the program made sense.

      3. The only analyses of program effects are descriptive tabulations

relating to the characteristics of recipients. See, for example, Robert

Hastings (1978) and Hastings and Phillip Springer (1976).

      4. Although we do not pursue it here, the model can be extended to make

the scholarship the student receives from institutional sources endogenously

determined by factors like a student's ability, family income, the costs of

the institution, and federal aid policies. On this, see Winship Fuller,

Charles Manski and David Wise (1982), Appendix A.

      5. Actual sample sizes are somewhat smaller due to missing data.

      6. This proxy is obviously subject to considerable measurement errcr.

If one knew the name of the college the student attended, one could use the

average SAT scores of entering freshman or the Cass and Birnbaum (1981) rating

of the college as a measure of college quality. Sadly, however, this infcrma—

tion is not available in the data. An alternative is to use tuition or gross

costs of education as a proxy. While more selective private colleges do tend

to charge higher tuitions than less selective private colleges (results

available from the authors upon request), this relationship breaks down once

one considers only public colleges, or all colleges together. Our use of net

cost is meant to capture the notion that families will increase their net

expenditures only if they perceive they are buying a "better" product. In

any case, when tuition was used as a measure of quality for the students who

attended private colleges, results similar to those reported below were

obtained.
                                                                            F2



      7. Wage rate data was reported only by a subset of the   recipients    who

worked. Rather than imputing market wages to nonreporters and those who did

not work using a sample selection bias approach (see James Heck.man (1979)),

we follow the strategy of simply omitting the wage variable from the model.

Including it, along with a dummy variable for nonreporting of wages, never

substantially altered any of the other coefficients that we report below.

      8. The family maximum is approximately 175% of the primary insurance

amount of the retired, deceased, or disabled worker (the latter's "normal"

benefit amount). It is estimated that over 40% of student beneficiaries

received reduced benefits due to this rule (Congressional Budget Office

(1977)).

description of the algorithm.

are grateful to William Green for his attempts to generalize and implement

this method for us.

      12. The coefficients of these X variables were virtually unchanged

when different specifications of the social security variable were used and/or

the students' wage rates were included in the model (see footnote 7). In the

latter case, higher student wages led to lower parental contributions, and

student work—effort, but higher student earnings; results which are all
