The Powerful Antitakeover Force of Staggered Boards:

                                             ABSTRACT

        Staggered boards, which a majority of public companies now have, provide a powerful
antitakeover defense, stronger than is commonly recognized. They provide antitakeover protection both
by (i) forcing any hostile bidder, no matter when it emerges, to wait at least one year to gain control of
the board and (ii) requiring such a bidder to win two elections far apart in time rather than a one-time
referendum on its offer. Using a new data set of hostile bids in the five-year period 1996-2000, we find
that not a single hostile bid won a ballot box victory against an "effective" staggered board (ESB). We
also find that an ESB nearly doubled the odds of remaining independent for an average target in our data
set, from 34% to 61%, halved the odds that a first bidder would be successful, from 34% to 14%, and
reduced the odds of a sale to a white knight, from 32% to 25%. Furthermore, we find that the
shareholders of targets that remained independent were made worse off compared with accepting the bid
and that ESBs did not provide sufficient countervailing benefits in terms of increased premiums to offset
the costs of remaining independent. Overall, we estimate that, in the period studied, ESBs reduced the
returns of shareholders of hostile bid targets on the order of 8-10%. Finally, we show that most staggered
boards were adopted before the developments in takeover doctrine that made ESBs such a potent defense.

                                  I.      INTRODUCTION

   Staggered boards (SBs) are an important part of the modern U.S.
corporate landscape. In a large sample of major U.S. public companies, 59%
had a staggered board in 1998.1 Among firms going public in the 1990s, the
incidence of staggered boards increased from 34% in 1990 to over 70% in
2001.2 Despite this large and growing importance in practice, the impact of
staggered boards on the market for corporate control has not been
adequately recognized by courts, academics, or practitioners.
    This Paper analyzes the key role that staggered boards play in the
antitakeover protection that U.S. public companies now enjoy. A staggered
board, we argue, offers a more powerful antitakeover defense than has
previously been recognized. Whereas conventional wisdom holds that a
company that becomes a takeover target is unlikely to remain independent,
the managers of targets with staggered boards can—and most of the time
do—maintain the target’s independence.
    Our work analyzes how staggered boards make it extremely difficult for
a hostile bidder to gain control over the incumbents’ objections. Using a new
database of hostile bids against U.S. targets in the five-year period from 1996
to 2000, we provide evidence that staggered boards indeed have the
powerful antitakeover force suggested by our theory. Finally, we show that
the effectiveness of staggered boards reduces returns to target shareholders.
The theory and evidence that we put forward have important implications
for takeover regulation, and we examine the changes in takeover doctrine
that they warrant.
    Staggered boards have increased in importance with the appearance and
proliferation of poison pills. Takeover law allows managers to maintain a
pill and thereby impede a hostile bid, as long as they are in office. As a
result, when managers maintain their opposition to a hostile bid, the bidder

can obtain control only if it replaces the directors with ones that will redeem
the pill. This route of winning control of the board via a ballot box victory
provides the safety valve on which takeover law has relied to protect
shareholder interests. However, we show that when a target has an effective
staggered board (ESB)—a staggered board that is appropriately designed to
prevent circumvention—this safety valve is illusory.
    There are two reasons why an ESB presents such a serious impediment to
a hostile bidder seeking to gain control over the incumbents’ objections.
First, an ESB substantially increases the delay involved in gaining control of
the board and, importantly, establishes a large minimum delay. No matter
when a hostile bidder emerges, gaining control of the board would take at
least one year, a very long time indeed in the dynamic world of corporate
acquisitions. Second, beyond the costs imposed by delay, to overcome an
ESB a bidder must win two elections, far apart in time, rather than one up-or-
down referendum conducted at a single point in time. We show that the
two-election problem is a serious one that, combined with the delay problem,
makes an ESB a powerful, even if not insurmountable, antitakeover device.
Indeed, we show that an ESB provides managers with stronger protection
from a hostile takeover than would an arrangement (not currently permitted
under Delaware law) providing directors with guaranteed three-year terms.
    After developing our theory of staggered boards, we test it against a new
database of hostile bids made against U.S. targets in the five-year period
from 1996 to 2000. We find that during this period not a single hostile bidder
gained control of the board of an ESB target board through a ballot box
victory. The great difficulty that hostile bidders would have in gaining
control of the board of a target with an ESB significantly reduces the
credibility of the threat to do so, which in turn increases incumbents’ power
to insist on remaining independent. Specifically, we find that an ESB nearly
doubles the likelihood that the average target in our data set will remain
independent, from 34% to 61%; halves the likelihood that the first bidder will
be successful, from 34% to 14%; and reduces the likelihood that a target will
be forced to sell to a white knight or other subsequent bidder, from 32% to
25%.
    We also find that the substantial increase in the likelihood of remaining
independent produced by ESBs is rather costly for target shareholders.
Remaining independent makes shareholders worse off compared with the
scenario in which the hostile bid is accepted. Furthermore, we find that ESBs
do not provide sufficient countervailing benefits in terms of increased
premiums and may even provide no such benefits at all. Overall, we find
that ESBs reduced returns on the order of 8-10% for shareholders of hostile
bid targets in the latter half of the 1990s. Some of the statistical tests whose
results we report here are presented in greater detail in a more technical

    These findings lend new significance to shareholder proposals
demanding de-staggering of SBs, proposals that have become far more
numerous and popular (with shareholders) in recent years.4 More generally,
these findings have important implications in the U.S. market for corporate
control and the broader business landscape. Staggered boards play a key
role in determining the extent to which managers of U.S. companies are
vulnerable to a takeover threat. The theoretical arguments and empirical
evidence presented here suggest that ESBs substantially increase the
insulation of incumbents from takeovers and have the potential to reduce
shareholder wealth.
    After analyzing the antitakeover consequences of staggered boards, we
examine how we have arrived at this state of affairs. We compare the
evolution of takeover law with the timing of staggered board incidence. We
show that most companies that now have staggered boards adopted them
before shareholders could have been fully aware of the powerful
antitakeover force that was accorded to them by subsequent developments in
takeover law. Specifically, shareholders that had approved staggered boards
prior to 1990 found themselves in the 1990s stuck with an arrangement
whose full antitakeover power they could not have earlier anticipated. In the
1990s, shareholders began to comprehend the full antitakeover force of
staggered boards and, led by activist institutional investors, began voting
against proposals to adopt new staggered boards and for precatory (non-
binding) proposals to rescind existing ones.5 For most companies, however,
this shareholder activism amounted to “too little, too late,” because the
majority of large companies had already adopted staggered boards, which
shareholders do not have the power to undo.
    Our conclusions concerning the special antitakeover power of staggered
boards call for a reconsideration of existing takeover law. Courts have
sought to strike a balance between the goals of protecting shareholders from

     5. New staggered boards emerged throughout the 1990s, however, in IPOs. See
Coates, supra note 2, at 1377; Daines & Klausner, supra note 2, at 96 tbl. 2. Shareholders
have been willing to buy shares from companies that have staggered boards in their
initial charter. In those cases, the initial price could reflect the costs to shareholders of
staggered boards, although it is also possible that investors in IPOs are still not fully
aware of the antitakeover potential of staggered boards. See infra Part II.D.

threats that some hostile offers might present and preventing managers from
entrenching themselves. Under the well-known Unocal test, managers can
use defensive tactics but only to an extent that is “reasonable in relation to
the threat posed.”6 Allowing managers to maintain a pill as long as they are
in office, courts have believed, is a proportionate measure because of the
availability of the proxy contest safety valve. Our analysis shows, however,
that this safety valve on which courts have relied is largely illusory against
companies with an ESB.
    Accordingly, when a target has an ESB (which is approximately half the
time), courts applying the proportionality test should not permit managers to
maintain a pill after they lose one election conducted over an acquisition
offer. Allowing managers to maintain a pill after what was essentially a
referendum on the offer would be a disproportionate and substantially
entrenching measure. Therefore, we argue, preventing the use of a pill-ESB
combination following defeat in one election would be consistent with the
proportionality test put forward by Unocal and subsequently by Moran. In
addition, our approach would preserve the nontakeover benefits that are
often cited to justify staggered boards—board stability and board
independence—while ensuring that staggered boards are not unduly used to
defeat offers that enjoy shareholder support.
    The remainder of this Paper proceeds as follows. Part II provides the
necessary background: an account of the widespread use of staggered
boards, the justifications offered for them, and the rising shareholder
resistance to them. Part III offers our theory of staggered boards and
demonstrates why, at a theoretical level, ESBs are very powerful against
hostile takeover bids, more powerful than has been recognized. Part IV
provides empirical evidence that supports this theory. Part V examines how
this state of affairs came about and documents that the large majority of ESBs
had been adopted before shareholders could have recognized the
antitakeover significance that ESBs would obtain as a result of subsequent
judicial and legislative developments.        Part VI discusses the policy
implications of our analysis and makes recommendations that would
improve the efficiency and legitimacy of takeover doctrine. Part VII
concludes.

                                A. The Law of Staggered Boards

    The default law in all states requires that all directors stand for election at
each annual shareholder meeting.7            However, all states provide an
exemption from this requirement if the board is staggered.8 In a company
with a staggered board, directors are grouped into classes (typically three),
with each class elected at successive annual meetings. For example, a board
with twelve directors might be grouped into three classes, with four directors
standing at the 2001 annual meeting, four more directors standing for
reelection in 2002, and the remaining four directors standing for reelection in
2003.9 With three classes, directors in each class would be elected to three-
year terms.
    Thirty-nine jurisdictions, including Delaware and California, permit a
maximum of three classes.10 New York permits as many as four classes of
directors,11 and Arizona allows three “or to the extent not inconsistent with
cumulative voting rights, more.”12 Ten other states have not addressed this
issue.13



     7. See, e.g., DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 8, § 211(b) (2000); MODEL BUS. CORP. ACT § 8.03(d)
(1999). Moreover, if the corporation does not hold an annual shareholder meeting
within thirteen months (in Delaware) or fifteen months (under the Revised Model
Business Corporation Act, or the RMBCA) of the last meeting, a court may order an
annual meeting on the petition of any stockholder or director. See DEL. CODE ANN. tit.
8, § 211(c) (2000); MODEL BUS. CORP. ACT § 7.03(a)(1) (1999).

CENTER, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATE BY STATE: A GUIDE TO SELECTED STATUTES
(1998).
     9. While Delaware does not require the classes to be roughly equal in number, the
RMBCA does. Compare DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 8, § 141(d) (2000), with MODEL BUS. CORP.
ACT § 8.06 (1999). However, regardless of whether required or not by statute, most
companies that install a staggered board impose this requirement on themselves,
perhaps because by doing so they maximize the antitakeover protection of the SB. See,
e.g., Bestfoods Restated Certificate of Incorporation § 11(8) (requiring the same number
of directors in each class, “as nearly as may be possible”). But see ARV Assisted Living
Bylaws § 3.3 (allowing the board to determine without restriction the number of
directors in each class).

                                           5
   Delaware allows an SB to be specified either in the charter or in the
bylaws,14 while the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA) only
provides for an SB to be specified in the charter.15 In all states, installing an
SB through charter amendment requires both shareholder approval and
board approval,16 while installing an SB in the bylaws requires either
shareholder approval or board approval.17 Conversely, dismantling an SB
that is in the charter requires both a shareholder vote and a board vote, while
dismantling an SB in the bylaws can be done either through shareholder vote
or through board vote. Thus, while SBs have the same (direct) effect whether
installed through the charter or through the bylaws, SBs in the bylaws are
generally much easier to dismantle.18
    If an SB is installed in the charter, directors may only be removed for
cause, and shareholders may not “pack the board” by increasing the number
of directors and filling the vacancies created, then we characterize the SB as
an “effective staggered board” (ESB)—one that cannot be dismantled by a
hostile bidder without first winning control of the board.19 As we shall see
below, the distinction between an SB and an ESB is irrelevant for two of the
arguments put forward to explain SBs—board stability and board


     14. See DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 8, § 141(d) (2000).
     15. See MODEL BUS. CORP. ACT § 8.06 (1999).
     16. See, e.g., DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 8, § 242(b)(1)-(2); MODEL BUS. CORP. ACT § 10.03
(1999) (requiring board approval and shareholder approval for all but minor changes to
the charter).
     17. Delaware requires that the charter expressly provide for board authority to
amend the bylaws, while the RMBCA reverses this default rule, allowing the board to
amend the bylaws unless otherwise specified in the charter. Compare DEL. CODE ANN.
tit. 8, § 109(a) (2000), with MODEL BUS. CORP. ACT § 10.20 (1999). Both corporate codes
and all states allow shareholders to amend the bylaws. See DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 8, §
109(a) (2000); MODEL BUS. CORP. ACT § 10.20(b) (1999).
     18. A staggered board specified in the bylaws might be as difficult to dismantle as a
staggered board specified in the charter if the charter specifies that the board must
approve any modifications to board structure, effectively making the staggered board
provision in the bylaws equivalent to a charter provision. See, e.g., Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws of Quality Dining, Inc. (requiring board approval for “any
elimination or modification of the groups or terms of office of the Directors as the By-
Laws then in effect may provide”). In addition, a supermajority voting requirement for
shareholder bylaw amendments may make a staggered board in the bylaws equivalent
to a charter provision, which can be such a hurdle to dismantling as to be practically
akin to an outright ban. See, e.g., Circon By-Laws (requiring a two-thirds vote for any
shareholder amendments to the bylaws); see also infra note 99 (discussing the effect of a
supermajority amendment requirement in preserving a staggered board installed in the
bylaws of the takeover bid for Circon).

independence—but becomes highly relevant for the third (and we believe
most important) reason for SBs, to make hostile takeovers more difficult. We
therefore make this distinction between SBs and ESBs throughout the
remainder of this Paper.

                                                                 B.              The Proliferation of Staggered Boards

   Though staggered boards have been a part of the corporate law landscape
for decades,20 they gained popularity during the 1980s takeover wave.
Today, among a sample of 2,421 large public U.S. companies, 59% have
staggered boards.21 In addition, there was a dramatic increase in staggered
board incidence among companies going public in 1991-92 (34%) versus
1999-2000 (82%).22 The IPO statistics suggest that, barring any major shifts in
the legal or political environment, staggered board incidence will only
increase further among major U.S. corporations in the years to come.
   Figure 1 shows that SBs are represented broadly across industries:23

     20. Among the approximately 2500 companies in the Investor Responsibility
Research Center (IRRC) database, the first staggered board appeared in the company
now known as Equifax in 1920. See sources cites supra note 1.
     21. The sample comes from the 1993 and 1998 volumes of the IRRC Corporate
Takeover Defenses databooks, which include all firms in the S&P 1500 plus additional
firms “selected primarily on the basis of market capitalization and high institutional
ownership.” ROSENBAUM, supra note 1, at ix.

Guhan Subramanian, The Global Market for Corporate Control (unpublished data, on

    Figure 1 shows no pronounced industry effect for staggered board
incidence. In all industries except Transportation and Communications,
staggered boards appear in the majority of firms, and in two industries—
Construction and Electric, Gas, and Sanitary Services—staggered board
incidence is 70% and higher.
    Figure 2 shows staggered board incidence by firm size:

    Figure 2 shows that staggered boards are well represented across
companies of varying sizes. The only statistically significant difference
occurs at the low-end of the spectrum, where staggered boards are slightly
under-represented. This finding is consistent with evidence from one of us
that staggered boards were less common at smaller IPO firms in the 1990s,
controlling for insider ownership.24 One possible explanation is that smaller
firms may be advised by lawyers with less takeover experience, who are less
likely to install staggered boards.25

                                                         C.      Justifications for Staggered Boards

1.   Nontakeover justifications.

   Two nontakeover-related justifications have been put forward to justify
staggered boards.      First, they facilitate the independence of outside
directors.26 Independent directors, goes this argument, will be less influenced
by executives if they have a term of three years rather than one year. Second,
they reduce annual turnover on the board, thereby promoting board

takeover defenses).

                                                                                       8
stability.27 It is generally good, goes the argument, to always have some
experienced and seasoned directors, who have the perspective that only time
on the board can provide. If the board were not staggered, there is in theory
some chance that all board members in a given year will be rookies. A
staggered board prevents this outcome by ensuring that at most one-third of
the board members will be new.28
   However, a staggered board imposed through the charter is an
unnecessarily blunt instrument to achieve these two benefits. On board
independence, a bylaw establishing a staggered board would be sufficient to
provide independent directors autonomy from management so that they
could effectively monitor. Because officers cannot amend the bylaws
without approval of a majority of the whole board, a majority-independent
board would not be de-staggered against the will of the independent
directors.29 A bylaw would thus accomplish the independence goal without,
as will be made clear below, in any way impeding a hostile bidder.30


     27. See id. at 1051-52.
     28. See, e.g., Avant Corporation Proxy Statement, Proposal No. 2 (April 7, 1998)
(advocating a staggered board because classification “will help lend continuity and
stability to the management of the Company”); Cornell Corrections Proxy Statement
(March 9, 1998) (advocating staggered board “to promote continuity and stability”);
Rental Service Corp. Proxy Statement, Proposal No. 2 (March 30, 1998) (same).
     29. Even at the minority of public companies that lack a majority of independent
directors, it would be controversial and reputationally costly for officers to de-stagger
the board against the will of the independent directors. An independent director would
not expect that, if he or she were to display independence, insiders would amend the
bylaws to cut short the term of the independent director.
     30. Although the RMBCA requires a staggered board to be in the charter, most
states do not seem to follow the RMBCA on this point. In addition, Delaware permits a
staggered board to be specified in either the charter or the bylaws, and 50% of all public
companies are incorporated in Delaware. See Guhan Subramanian, The Influence of
Antitakeover Statutes on Incorporation Choice in the 1990s: Evidence on the “Race” Debate and
Antitakeover Overreaching, U. PA. L. REV. (forthcoming 2002) (manuscript at 17, fig. 2, on
file with authors); Lucian Arye Bebchuk & Alma Cohen, Firms’ Decisions Where to
Incorporate, (Harvard Olin Discussion Paper No. 352, 2002), available at
http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=296492; Lucian Arye Bebchuk, Alma Cohen, and
Allen Ferrell, Does the Evidence favor State Competition in Corporate Law? CAL. L. REV.
(forthcoming 2002) (manuscript at Table 2). In the small number of states which require
a staggered board to be specified in the charter, we believe that both board stability and
board independence could be achieved through a convention or policy (e.g., that the
slate should be two-thirds incumbent directors), which would avoid the antitakeover
consequences of a staggered board specified in the charter. Alternatively, a staggered
board could be installed in the charter but shareholders could specifically be given the
power to remove directors without cause, as suggested by Koppes, Ganske & Haag,
supra note 10. See infra Part III.C (discussing ways to avoid the antitakeover power of


                                             9
    Similarly, on board stability, a staggered board bylaw would achieve the
goal of preventing excessive turnover, and even a company without a
staggered board could have a convention or policy requiring that annual
slates include at least two-thirds incumbent directors in the ordinary course
of business. Such a policy or bylaw would be followed in the normal course
of events.31 As an empirical matter, even in companies that do not have any
policy or rule against replacing more than one third of the board in any
given year, such high turnover rarely, if ever, happens outside the change of
control context.32 In the normal course of business, most of the candidates
running on the insiders’ slate are usually those who are already serving on
the board. Thus a convention, policy, or bylaw should provide the desired
board independence and board stability in the normal course of events in a
more focused way than a staggered board.
   Of course, in one situation a convention, policy, or bylaw would be
insufficient—in the case of a hostile change of control. When a buyer
acquires a controlling interest, it would be natural for it to replace the
directors with a new slate of directors, assuming that it were not stopped by
the charter. Thus, alternatives that stop short of a charter amendment would
not likely prevail in the case of a hostile takeover.
   But a desire for board stability no longer makes sense in the case of a
hostile change of control. The argument for continuity presupposes that
there is some team working largely in harmony, and that such a team would
benefit from retaining a majority of experienced members from whom new
members could and would be willing to learn. But in the case of a hostile
takeover, old and new directors are not going to form a harmonious team.33
In such a case, board stability indeed might be quite harmful. In fact,
arguments for board stability, through “dead hand” and “no hand” pills,


SBs).
     31. Observe, for example, that many companies (such as Boeing and GE) follow
policies mandating a certain retirement age for the CEO, even in companies with
successful and powerful CEOs. It would seem that to retire a CEO at 65 would require a
stronger commitment device than is needed to retire only part of the directors, yet we
know of no such policies that are written in to the bylaws or charter.
     32. See, e.g., Rental Services Corp. Proxy Statement, Proposal No. 2 (March 30, 1998)
(acknowledging that “the Company has not yet experienced problems with respect to
continuity,” but nevertheless advocating a staggered board “to provide continuity and
stability to the Company’s management”).
     33. For a somewhat humorous illustration of this point, see Brian Hall, Christopher
J. Rose & Guhan Subramanian, Circon (A) (Harvard Business School Case Study N9-
801-403) (describing how dissident director General Victor Krulak reportedly asks
fellow dissident Charles Elson to call him by his nickname, Brute, but then introduces
himself to the incumbent directors with: “This is General Krulak.”).

have already been rejected by the Delaware Chancery Court34 and the
Delaware Supreme Court.35 Thus charter-based staggered boards are over-
encompassing because they provide board stability when business
justification and support in the Delaware case law are both at their weakest.36

2.   Antitakeover justifications.

    The third reason often given to explain staggered boards is that they
make hostile takeovers more difficult.37 For reasons we discuss in Part V,
this justification may have been unintended when staggered boards first
appeared, but the key point is that the interaction between a staggered board
and a poison pill puts up a potent defense against a hostile bidder. A pill
provides relatively weak takeover protection if the target is vulnerable to a
rapid proxy fight, because the target’s board can redeem the pill at any time;
a staggered board without a pill is likewise ineffective against a bid, given
the unlikelihood that target directors will continue to resist if a bidder has
acquired a majority of the target’s stock. In combination with an effective
staggered board, however, a pill provides significant antitakeover protection:
the pill blocks any stock acquisition beyond the trigger level, and the

(invalidating slow hand pill); see also Bank of New York v. Irving Bank, 528 N.Y.S.2d
482, 485-86 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1988) (invalidating dead hand pill under New York law).
    36. See, e.g., Topps Co. Proxy Statement, Proposal No. 4 (May 28, 1998) (shareholder
proposal to remove a staggered board because “in the unlikely event that stockholders
vote to replace all directors, this decision would express stockholder dissatisfaction with
the incumbent directors and reflect the need for change”); Bausch & Lomb Proxy
Statement, Shareholder Proposal No. 2 (Mar. 19, 1998) (same).
    37. See, e.g., Eastman Kodak Proxy Statement (Mar. 19, 1998) (arguing, in the fifth of
five points in favor of a staggered board, that it “inhibits unfriendly take-over
attempts”); Rental Service Corp. Proxy Statement, Proposal No. 2 (Mar. 30, 1998)
(acknowledging that the installation of a staggered board “may have potential
antitakeover effects”).      Many management statements against staggered board
rescission, or in favor of new staggered boards, argue that this antitakeover effect gives
management greater bargaining power. See, e.g., Bausch & Lomb Proxy Statement,
Shareholder Proposal No. 2 (Mar. 19, 1998) (“The classified board does not preclude
unsolicited acquisition proposals but, by eliminating the threat of imminent removal,
puts the incumbent Board in a position to act to maximize value to all shareholders.”);
Bristol Myers Squibb Proxy Statement, Proposal No. 3 (Mar. 16, 1998) (“One benefit
derived from that situation is an enhancement of management’s ability to negotiate in
the best interest of all stockholders with a person seeking to gain control of the
corporation.”).

staggered board forces the bidder to go through two proxy contests in order
to gain control of the board and redeem the pill.38
    Statistics on staggered board incidence are consistent with the view that
staggered boards are at least partly motivated by antitakeover
considerations. As noted in Part II.B, staggered boards are relatively less
common among smaller firms, where ownership is typically more
concentrated and hostile takeovers may be more difficult or impossible (if
insiders own a controlling stake). Furthermore, staggered boards were far
less common before the 1980s takeover wave,39 even though the board
stability and board independence arguments (presumably) applied with
equal force before 1980 as after.40

                  D. The Growing Opposition to Staggered Boards

    While SBs are commonplace among all types of U.S. public companies,
very few SBs have been proposed by management and approved by
shareholders since 1990. The reason is simple: Shareholders have stopped
voting in favor of new staggered boards. The emergence of shareholder
activism in the early 1990s, combined with important changes in the
Delaware case law around the same time,41 made institutional investors
acutely aware of the potential for managerial entrenchment behind an
SB/pill combination. As a result, their support for staggered boards largely
vanished, and companies that did not already have their staggered boards in
place by 1990 had missed the party. Among companies covered by the
IRRC, management proposals to classify boards dropped from 88 proposals
in 1986 to just ten proposals in 2000.42 Of these ten, only four involved
companies in which management did not own a controlling stake; among


    38. See, e.g., Federated Department Stores Proxy Statement, Proposal No. 3 (Apr. 16,
1998) (“The Company’s outside advisors have informed the Company that they
continue to believe that classified directorate terms are important to ensure the efficacy
of stockholder rights plans.”).
    39. See infra Figure 5.
    40. Note also that staggered boards are much less common in the United Kingdom,
where they are less useful as antitakeover devices without the accompanying
jurisprudence in support of the poison pill. Again, the board stability and board
independence arguments would seem to apply with equal force in the United Kingdom
as in the United States, yet staggered board incidence in the United Kingdom is much
lower.

these four, only one was successful.43
    In fact, activist shareholders began trying to turn back the tide by
proposing resolutions to de-stagger boards. These proposals, along with
proposals to redeem pills, were increasingly popular with shareholders
during the 1990s,44 although they have no binding effect and therefore have
been routinely ignored by managers. The average shareholder vote in favor
of proposals to de-stagger the board increased from 16.4% in 1987 to 52.7% in
2000.45 One of us in other work has speculated that these proposals would
garner even greater support were they binding on boards.46
    The experience at Bausch & Lomb is typical. In 1997, shareholder activist
William Steiner from the Investor Rights Association of America sponsored a
proposal urging the board to de-stagger itself:
    [T]he Company’s classified Board of Directors maintains the
    incumbency of the current Board and therefore of current
    management, which in turn limits management’s accountability to
    stockholders. . . . I believe that [de-staggering the board] is one of the
    best methods available to the stockholder to insure that the Company
    will be managed in a manner that is in the best interests of the
    stockholders.47
    The Bausch & Lomb board of directors argued against the proposal:
    The Board stated in the proxy statement relating to that meeting
    [approving the staggered board] its belief that the amendment would
    reduce the vulnerability of the Company to certain potentially abusive
    takeover tactics and encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with
    the Board. The Board also stated its belief that the amendment
    assures continuity and stability of the Company's management and
    policies, since a majority of the directors at any given time have prior
    experience as directors of the Company.
    In the opinion of the Board, the above reasons continue to be valid
    and the staggered Board remains in the best interests of the
    shareholders. . . . The staggered board does not preclude unsolicited
    acquisition proposals but, by eliminating the threat of imminent

   removal, puts the incumbent Board in a position to act to maximize
   value to all shareholders. In addition, the Board does not believe that
   directors elected for staggered terms are any less accountable to
   shareholders than they would be if elected annually, since the same
   standards of performance apply regardless of the term of service.48
   The Steiner proposal received 62% approval from Bausch & Lomb
shareholders, yet the company continued to maintain a staggered board.49

                    E.    Conventional Wisdom on Staggered Boards

    Thus far in this Part we have argued that the motivation for installing
staggered boards, as well as the motivation for shareholder activism against
them, comes from their potential antitakeover consequences.               These
antitakeover consequences are the focus of this Paper; our thesis is that they
are greater than has previously been recognized. Although most scholars
and practitioners recognize that staggered boards have some antitakeover
effect, the conventional wisdom is that the magnitude of this effect is not
very large.
    We interviewed fifteen senior partners from major law firms in New York
City and Wilmington, Delaware and found consensus around the view that
targets, once in play, will generally trade to either the initial bidder or to a
white knight.50 When presenting drafts of this Paper, we also surveyed
M&A practitioners and corporate law academics to get their quantitative
assessment of the impact of staggered boards on bid outcomes.51 Among


     48. See Written Statement of Bausch & Lomb Board of Directors, Bausch & Lomb
Proxy Statement, Shareholder Proposal No. 2 (Dec. 28, 1996).
     49. See Bausch & Lomb Votes by Shareholders Go Against Management, WALL ST. J.
(April 30, 1997) at B7 (reporting 28 million shares voted in favor of one-year terms, 17
million shares voted opposed, and 0.3 million abstentions).
     50. Selected comments are illustrative: “Once somebody starts, and commits to the
deal, the ego of the CEO, etc., generally drive it to completion. . . . Like everything else,
it’s the price that determines whether or not the deal is successful.” “Given that the
target is put into play, it’s likely to go. If a bidder is willing to pay, it will succeed. If it
is not willing to pay, someone else will come along.” This conventional wisdom seems
to hold among bankers (“Bankers will come to you and say, ‘Life will now change for
you—either you will be bought by [the hostile bidder] or you will be bought by
someone else.’”) and gets transmitted to clients (“Our investment bankers and
everybody told us that once a hostile bid is made, 80% are successful. So we
assumed . . . that we were going to be taken over one way or another.”).
     51. Before the presentation, each participant was asked to answer two questions:
(1) what is the overall likelihood of a target remaining independent once a hostile bid
has been made; and (2) what is the likelihood of a target remaining independent once a
hostile bid has been made if the target has an effective (non-evadable) staggered board?


                                               14
M&A lawyers, the mean estimate for likelihood of remaining independent
increased by only 5% when the target had an effective staggered board.52
Among corporate law academics, the mean estimate for the likelihood of
remaining independent increased by 9%.53 As we will show in Part IV, the
actual effect is several times larger than these estimates. The business press
also holds the view that the presence or absence of a staggered board is
relatively unimportant.54
    However, it is important to note that our main thesis in this Paper does
not depend on the above account of the conventional view. We plan to study
more rigorously in other work the extent to which this view exists, and, if
widespread, what are the sources of the misperception that sophisticated
parties seem to have adopted. In this Paper, however, we focus on showing
that staggered boards have a powerful antitakeover effect and on identifying
the sources of this effect. This analysis and its conclusions do not depend on
whether market participants have or have not fully recognized the
significance of staggered boards.

         III.    THE SPECIAL ANTITAKEOVER POWER OF STAGGERED BOARDS

    In Part II we showed that staggered boards are an important part of the
corporate landscape today. We also argued that the standard non-takeover
related justifications for staggered boards (board independence and board
stability) are relatively weak, and that the empirical evidence on staggered
board incidence is most consistent with the view that staggered boards are
motivated primarily by antitakeover reasons. In this Part we develop a
theory demonstrating that staggered boards are in fact extremely potent as
an antitakeover device. In the next Part we provide large-sample empirical
evidence in support of this theory.


Each respondent individually wrote his or her response on a note card without
discussion. Respondents only identified whether they were an academic or a
practitioner. Responses were tabulated anonymously and reported back to the group.
Respondents did not know they would be asked to answer these questions when they
arrived at the seminar.
    52. The mean estimate among practitioners increased from 12% (independence rate
against bids for targets overall) to 17%.
    53. The mean estimate among corporate law academics increased from 38% to 47%.
    54. See, e.g., Avrum D. Lank, Hostile Takeover Attempts Force Investors to Make Tough
Decisions, MILWAUKEE J. SENTINEL, Jan. 11, 1998, at Business 2 (“Only infrequently does
a company put in play by a hostile takeover offer emerge intact.”); Anita Raghavan, In
Europe, a New Storm over Takeover Rules, WALL ST. J., Dec. 5, 2000, at A21 (“In the case of
unsolicited, hostile offers, most boards ultimately cave in to shareholder pressure and
dismantle their antitakeover defenses.”).


                                            15
   Parts III.A and III.B provide a brief chronology of the important Delaware
case law, noting the dramatic changes brought about by the arrival of the
poison pill in 1984. Part III.C summarizes the existing regime and identifies
the three types of targets that now exist. Part III.D analyzes the “delay
problem” and demonstrates that ESBs impose even more delay on bidders
than alternative regimes, currently not permitted, which would allow
biennial or triennial election of a single class of directors. Part III.E focuses
on the “two-election problem” to show that the potency of an ESB against a
hostile bid goes beyond delay. We conclude from this analysis that the ballot
box safety valve, which Delaware courts relied on so heavily in the
development of their takeover jurisprudence over the past two decades, is
rendered virtually ineffective against an ESB target.

                                  A.    Before the Pill

   Even before the pill, a staggered board was considered to be a defense,
though a rather weak one.55 Basically a staggered board would delay a
bidder’s ability to take control of the board until two annual elections were
over, even if the bidder owned a majority of the shares through a successful
tender offer. This outcome would make the hostile acquisition of a control
block less desirable, because capturing the benefits of control would be
delayed for as long as two years.
    The pre-pill staggered board was nevertheless weak, for several reasons.
First, a staggered board did not prevent a bidder from acquiring a
controlling block and creating a situation in which, albeit with some delay, it
would definitely gain control. Thus the staggered board did not impede the
acquisition of a controlling block; it only delayed the ability of the buyer to
exercise its voting power. Put differently, a bidder who needed to know
(say, for strategic planning purposes) whether it would be able to gain
control of Company X could find out the answer without delay. At most, the
realization of that control would be delayed, but it would be inevitable.
    Second, it was generally believed that, if a bidder were to acquire a
majority of the shares of a company with a staggered board, it would not in
fact take the buyer two elections to gain control of the board because the
board could be expected to resign.56 There were two reasons for this


    55. See ROBERT CHARLES CLARK, CORPORATE LAW 576 (1986) (listing SBs as takeover
defenses but characterizing them as fairly weak); Ronald J. Gilson, A Structural Approach
to Corporations: The Case Against Defensive Tactics in Tender Offers, 33 STAN. L. REV. 819
(1981).
    56. See CLARK, supra note 55, at 576 (“In practice, of course, the incumbent directors
would often find it in their interest to come to terms with the new controlling
shareholder.”); Gilson, supra note 55.

prediction. First, the board would have little legitimacy continuing to serve
when the majority shareholder clearly did not wish it to stay. Staying would
likely hurt the personal reputations of the board members. Second, this
reputational cost would come with little benefit because eventually losing
independence was a certainty and because an incumbent board could
accomplish little against the will of a controlling shareholder. At best,
incumbent directors could hang on for a bit longer, delaying the ability of a
majority shareholder to use freely its impending control position. All of this
made mass resignation a highly likely scenario.

                                    B.     Enter the Pill

   The pill dramatically changed how quickly a board could be replaced by
shareholders. In the era of the pill, a potential buyer would need an election
not to use the voting power of the block it had already acquired, but rather to
buy the block in the first place. Pills made staggered boards important.

1.    The pill and the power to keep it.

    Poison pills57 consist of stock warrants or rights that allow the holder to
buy an acquirer’s stock (a so-called “flip over” provision), the target’s stock
(a “flip in” provision), or both at a substantial discount from the market
price. These rights only become exercisable in the event that a shareholder
(the “acquiring person”) buys more than a certain percentage of the target’s
stock (typically 10 or 15%) without the target board’s approval.58 These
rights are explicitly not exercisable by the acquiring person, so the resulting
dilution in his voting power and economic stake may make the acquisition of
the target through market purchases too expensive to pursue. Although in
theory a hostile bidder could “break through” a poison pill by triggering it,
suffering the resulting dilution, and continuing to buy shares, no bidder has
ever done so in our fifteen-plus years of experience with the pill.59 In


     57. Throughout, “pill” or “poison pill” means a standard poison pill, which permits
redemption by the target board, however constituted, at any time. We treat separately
pills that attempt to interfere with proxy fights and/or a target board’s ability to redeem
the pill (so-called “dead hand” or “slow hand” pills).

practice, then, the pill provides an impenetrable barrier to control
acquisitions. As long as the pill remains in place, no other defensive
measures are necessary because the bid is completely blocked. Defensive
measures might be needed, at most, to protect the pill itself.
    Protecting the pill, however, is not as easy as it might seem because at
any time a pill can be redeemed by the target’s board. This provision allows
the target board to permit a friendly bidder to proceed, but it also allows a
hostile bidder to redeem the pill and proceed with its own bid if it can gain
control of the target’s board. Efforts to cut off this line of attack by making
pills nonredeemable (“no hand” provisions), allowing only continuing
directors to redeem the pill (“dead hand” provisions), or delaying
redemption for a specified time after a change in board composition (“slow
hand” provisions) were invalidated by a New York court in the 1980s and by
the Delaware courts in the late 1990s,60 although these pills have been
legalized in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Georgia.61 Thus, at the turn of the
millennium, the pill remains vulnerable to a successful proxy attack at the
vast majority of public companies.
    Moran v. Household International, decided in 1985,62 was the seminal case
upholding the poison pill. The Delaware Supreme Court ruled that the
business judgment rule applied to Household’s decision to adopt a poison
pill but was careful to state that the right to use a pill was not “absolute”:
“When the Household Board of Directors is faced with a tender offer and a
request to redeem the Rights, they will not be able to arbitrarily reject the
offer.”63 The court went on to explain that managerial decisions to redeem
the pill when faced with a tender offer would be subject to judicial scrutiny
under Unocal.64


bid for that company. The threat was sufficiently credible that Crown Zellerbach
negotiated a friendly deal with Goldsmith. See Mike Tharp, Goldsmith Wins Fight for
Crown Zellerbach Corp., WALL ST. J., July 26, 1985, at 3. This bid was cited in Moran as
evidence that the pill was not impermeable. However, both the Crown Zellerbach pill
and the Moran pill only had “flip over” triggers, not the more potent “flip in” triggers
that soon became commonplace.

    Three years later, in City Capital Associates v. Interco Inc.,65 Chancellor
William Allen held that a pill being used by the incumbent board to resist a
noncoercive tender offer had to be redeemed. The use of the pill to defeat
the offer, Chancellor Allen concluded, was not proportionate to any
legitimate threat posed by the tender offer. A year later, in Paramount
Communications v. Time,66 the Delaware Supreme Court explicitly rejected
Chancellor Allen’s approach in Interco and seemed to suggest instead that
the right to reject a hostile bid was close to absolute, at least in some
circumstances: “Directors are not obliged to abandon a deliberately
conceived corporate plan for a short-term shareholder profit unless there is
clearly no basis to sustain the corporate strategy.”67
    The Court found that Time’s characterization of Paramount’s all-cash,
100% tender offer as “inadequate” was sufficient basis for Time to pursue its
acquisition of Warner and thus (given Paramount’s unwillingness or
inability to bid for a combined Time-Warner) to deny Time shareholders the
opportunity to decide for themselves whether Paramount’s bid was
inadequate. While Delaware jurisprudence does not say that courts will
never order the redemption of a poison pill, there has not been since Time a
single case in which redemption of a pill was ordered by a Delaware court.
Thus, as a practical matter, a bidder has had to assume in planning a bid that
a target could “Just Say No” and retain a pill unless and until the bidder
obtained majority control of the target’s board.
    Moore v. Wallace Computer68 illustrates how far the “Just Say No” defense
can go under current Delaware law. Here, the federal district court for
Delaware, applying Unocal in the wake of Unitrin,69 held that the Wallace
Computer board would receive the protection of the business judgment rule
in its “Just Say No” defense against Moore’s hostile bid. Applying the two-
pronged enhanced scrutiny test set out in Unocal, the court first found that
the Moore offer posed a threat to Wallace because Wallace shareholders
“might tender their shares in ignorance or mistaken belief as to

    66. 571 A.2d. 1140 (Del. 1989).
    67. 571 A.2d at 1154 (emphasis added). As some commentators have observed,
however, the Court in Paramount v. Time expressly noted that Paramount (the bidder)
had not raised, and the court was thus not addressing, the question of whether Time
(the target) could be required to redeem its poison pill in the face of Paramount’s offer.

management’s representations of intrinsic value and future expectations.”70
Applying the second prong of the enhanced scrutiny test, the court went on
to approve Wallace’s refusal to redeem its poison pill, on the grounds that
such defensive tactics were reasonable because they were proportionate to
the threat from Moore and “not draconian.”71
    The district court’s decision in Wallace Computer represents a logical
extension of Time—one would be hard-pressed to find a meaningful
distinction in the abstract between a corporate strategy that involves a
strategic merger (Time) and a corporate strategy that involves internal
growth (Wallace). Yet the court’s willingness to accept the “shareholder
ignorance” argument seems to represent an important extension of “Just Say
No.”72 While there may be alternative policy grounds to uphold the “Just
Say No” defense, the Wallace court passed on the opportunity to set fiduciary
duty constraints on how a target board deploys a pill. If these limits exist,
Wallace suggests that they have moved well beyond their cautious origins in
Moran.73

2.    The ballot box safety valve.

    In developing the jurisprudence that today allows a target board to
maintain the pill indefinitely, the Delaware courts relied explicitly on there
being a safety valve against managerial abuse through the shareholder
franchise. Because shareholders can replace the board, if the board were to
sacrifice shareholder interests by maintaining the pill, the bidder or someone
else (e.g., an arbitrageur) could run a proxy contest promising to elect a
board that would redeem the pill and clear the way for the acquisition
desired by shareholders. Indeed, the Delaware courts, at the same time that
they seemed to be giving license to boards to maintain the pill indefinitely
and otherwise block a bid, also indicated that they would protect against
managerial moves to impede voting by shareholders to remove them.74

    The seminal case on this point is Blasius Industries, Inc. v. Atlas Corp.75 In
Blasius, the hostile bidder, Atlas, solicited written consents to increase the
size of the Blasius board from seven to fifteen members, as well as to elect
eight new members nominated by Atlas. In response, the Blasius board met
through conference call and voted to increase the size of the board by two
(thus making seven directors no longer sufficient for control). While
refusing to adopt a per se rule against such conduct, Chancellor Allen
invalidated the Blasius board-packing action on the ground that it violated
the shareholders’ fundamental right to elect directors: “The shareholder
franchise is the ideological underpinning upon which the legitimacy of
directorial power rests.”76 Blasius illustrates how the Delaware courts will
protect the proxy contest route, because this route provides the basis for the
courts’ deference to target managers in their use of structural defenses.
    In the current legal regime, then, if the board wants to maintain the pill
and not sell to a hostile bidder, the only way to gain control passes through
the ballot box. The bidder will have to replace the board with one willing to
redeem the pill. Such a ballot box victory is required for a bidder whose
offer is attractive to shareholders to overcome incumbents’ opposition.

3.   The need for a ballot box safety valve.

   Before analyzing the viability of the ballot box safety valve, we pause to
determine whether this safety valve is even necessary. It might be argued
that having the formal power to “Just Say No” does not mean that the board
will use this power to prevent acquisitions that shareholders would like to
have. Instead, if market forces and compensation schemes sufficiently align
the interests of managers and shareholders, managers might have sufficient
incentives to avoid such results. In particular, it might be argued that the
carrot stemming from executive compensation schemes provides such
incentives to managers.77 Most stock option packages vest immediately in
the event of takeover, which may provide substantial gains to executives in
the event of a premium acquisition; golden parachutes, too, can provide

option compensation in the 1990s); Marcel Kahan and Edward Rock, How I Learned to
Stop Worrying and Love the Pill, forthcoming U. CHI. L. REV. (2002) (arguing that the
increased use of stock options have reduced incumbents’ tendency to favor remaining
independent).


                                           21
extremely large side-payments to managers in the event of takeover.78 If
stock options and parachutes are sufficiently large, managers would use
defenses to gain bargaining power but in the end would prefer to sell rather
than remain independent.
    Another reason that a safety valve might not be necessary is the presence
of independent directors. Even if the executives on the board wish to remain
independent, goes the argument, other directors will not let them do so if
accepting the bid would maximize shareholder value. The independent
directors will be willing to go along with saying no in order to get a higher
price or to seek out a competitive alternative, but they will not agree to cause
substantial harm to shareholders because that would hurt their reputation or
would subject them to social or professional adverse consequences.79
    We agree that the carrot of stock options and golden parachutes and the
potential stick supplied by independent directors may sometimes sufficiently
align directors and managers with shareholders. When this happens, we do
not need a safety valve, because even absolute power to block bids would
not be abused. But our premise, as is the premise of Delaware law, is that it
would be unwise to rely solely on these incentives to align the interests of
managers and shareholders.80 Indeed, any inquiry that seeks to evaluate
alternative takeover arrangements (short of an outright ban on takeovers)
implicitly assumes that these arrangements matter, which is the case only if
managers’ interests are not always aligned with those of shareholders. While
such coincidence might happen occasionally, or perhaps often, it is unlikely
to happen always. The takeover context in particular is one in which there is
potential divergence between managers’ and shareholders’ interests.
Furthermore, how often managers will do the right thing will depend on the
consequences they face when they do not do the right thing. A safety valve
that operates well is important not only in cases in which it is actually used,
but also in cases in which its presence influences managers to do the right
thing on their own.
    We therefore proceed under the premise that a safety valve is necessary.

In the remainder of this Part, however, we argue that the safety valve is
illusory when the target has an ESB. In the next Part we present empirical
evidence in support of this view. This theory and evidence is particularly
troubling because courts have relied on the ballot box safety valve as if it
were viable. In Part V we discuss how the Delaware takeover jurisprudence
should develop to bridge this gap between the theoretical role for the ballot
box and its actual functioning.

                             C.    Three Types of Targets

    We now begin addressing the question of whether and to what extent the
ballot box is a viable safety valve. The answer to this question, as we will
show below, depends on the speed with which the bidder can gain access to
the election mechanism. Targets can be classified into three categories with
respect to their vulnerability to a proxy contest: no minimum term (NMT);
effective annual term (EAT); and effective staggered board (ESB). In this Part
we describe each of these three categories in more detail. In the next Part we
examine the delay imposed on the proxy route for a hostile bidder facing
targets in each of these categories.

1.   No minimum term.

    Consider the scenario in which the target has a pill, but does not have any
other structural defenses that would prevent the bidder from marshaling
support from shareholders to replace the board immediately. We classify
these targets as no minimum term (NMT) targets. To fit into this category,
the target’s shareholders must have the ability to act by written consent81 or
act through special meeting.82 In addition, the target’s shareholders must
have the ability either (1) to remove directors without cause (and then
petition the court to order a new election of directors);83 or (2) to “pack the


    81. Delaware firms may act through written consent unless prohibited in the firm’s
charter or bylaws. See DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 8, § 228(a) (2000). Forty-two states that
follow the RMBCA reverse this rule, allowing shareholders to act only through
unanimous written consent (which effectively bars action through written consent). See
MODEL BUS. CORP. ACT § 7.04 (1999).
    82. Delaware firms are prohibited from calling a special meeting unless otherwise
specified in their charter or bylaws. See DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 8, § 211(d) (2000). Forty-
one states that follow the RMBCA reverse this rule, allowing shareholders to call a
special meeting on the call of 10% of the shareholders, unless prohibited at the firm
level. See MODEL BUS. CORP. ACT § 7.02 (1999).
    83. See DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 8, § 141(k) (2000) (allowing removal of directors without
cause unless there is a staggered board); MODEL BUS. CORP. ACT § 8.08 (1999) (allowing


                                           23
board” by increasing the number of directors and filling the vacancies
created.84
    Against an NMT target, the bidder will announce its offer and run a
proxy contest to replace the board, either through special meeting or through
shareholder written consent. If elected, the slate offered by the bidder will
commit to withdrawing the pill and accepting the bidder’s offer. The proxy
contest, therefore, will essentially be a referendum on the offer. Shareholders
will vote in favor of the bidder’s team if and only if they view the bidder’s
offer as superior to remaining independent.
    An NMT target produces a regime that can be referred to as one of
“shareholder voting and no board veto.”85 The need to win a proxy contest
eliminates the pressure to tender and thus ensures that no bidder whose
offer does not enjoy genuine shareholder support can gain control. Without
the requirement of winning a vote, shareholders may tender to the hostile
bidder, even if they do not judge the offer to be value maximizing, for fear of
ending up with minority shares in the taken over target.86 The proxy contest
eliminates this collective action problem, because shareholders will not be
penalized if they vote against the bid and the bid is still approved.
Therefore, shareholders will not vote in favor of the bid unless they want the
bid to succeed. The bidder will win the referendum only if a majority of the
shareholders view the offered acquisition price as exceeding the target’s
independent value, an “undistorted choice” that yields the socially optimal
outcome.87
    In short, a proxy contest provides a viable safety valve in the specific
context of an unstaggered board that can be removed immediately. IBM’s

hostile bid for Lotus illustrates how this mechanism can work. In June 1995,
after months of friendly overtures, IBM launched a $60-per-share all-cash
hostile bid for Lotus, representing more than a 100% premium over Lotus’s
pre-bid share price (though only a slight premium to its 52-week high of
$59.50). IBM also solicited written consents from shareholders, as permitted
by Delaware law,88 seeking to replace all six Lotus directors. Lotus,
meanwhile, declared the offer inadequate and searched for a white knight,
reportedly approaching AT&T, Hewlett-Packard, and Intel.89
    On June 12, less than a week after IBM announced its offer, Lotus
capitulated and agreed to a sweetened $64-per-share friendly deal. The
breathtaking pace of the deal, “one of the fastest capitulations ever in a
hostile takeover,”90 occurred because IBM was able to force a shareholder
referendum that it almost certainly would have won. Thus, without any
provisions that delay or complicate the election process, the pill does not
enable managers to impede for very long an offer that shareholders find
attractive. As IBM/Lotus illustrates, the proxy contest safety valve works
effectively when the board is not staggered and immediate removal is
possible.

2.   Effective annual term.

    Now consider a scenario in which the bidder cannot replace the target
board immediately, but can do so at the next annual meeting of shareholders.
We classify these targets as effective annual term (EAT) targets. To fit into
this category, the target must have eliminated the ability for shareholders to
act by written consent and the ability to act at a special meeting or,
alternatively, have both eliminated the power of shareholders to remove
directors without cause and eliminated the ability of shareholders to “pack
the board.” In addition, if the board is staggered, the hostile bidder must be
able to dismantle the staggered board at the annual meeting in one of the
ways specified above.91
    As with NMT targets, in this scenario the bidder will announce its offer
and run a proxy contest to replace the board. If elected, the slate offered by
the bidder will commit to withdrawing the pill and accepting the bidder’s

offer. The only difference between EAT and NMT targets is that here the
bidder will have to wait until the next annual meeting of shareholders,
which could be as long as thirteen months away,92 before it can get an up-or-
down verdict from shareholders.
    In many cases, the bidder might be unable to wait—the bidder may need
to plan, may need to know where it stands, etc. Furthermore, the benefits
might dissipate if the bidder has to wait—for example, if the bidder needs
certain assets now, not a year from now. Therefore, because a significant
delay might be required before a proxy contest can be launched, the ballot
box route may not provide a sufficient safety valve against disloyal
incumbents of EAT targets in some cases. Thus, incumbents of EAT targets
sometimes have significant power to block offers that shareholders would
support.
    As assessment of the antitakeover consequences of EAT arrangements is
beyond the scope of our project. The above discussion, however, indicates
that EATs do not generally foreclose the ballot box route, for two reasons.
First, bidders can always win control of the board by winning a one-time
proxy contest. Second, although some bidders would have to wait as long as
thirteen months before being able to run such a contest, bidders that emerge
not far from the next annual meeting would not have to wait that long.
However, there is a third class of targets—those with “effective staggered
boards”—for which the ballot box route is hardly viable.

3.   Effective staggered board.

    The third scenario—and the one on which we focus for the remainder of
this Paper—is the scenario in which the bidder must go through two annual
meetings in order to gain majority control of the target’s board. We classify
these targets as effective staggered board (ESB) targets. To fit into this
category, the target must have a staggered board, with at least three classes
of directors,93 which cannot be dismantled in any of the three ways specified
above.94


    92. See Koppes, Ganske & Haag, supra note 10.
    93. A hostile bidder could gain 50% control of the board in just one proxy contest
against a target with two classes of directors. (A particularly lucky hostile bidder might
even win control of the board in one election if the target had an odd number of
directors and the proxy contest were brought in the “right” year.) This qualification is
technically necessary, though few staggered boards have only two classes of directors.
For ease of exposition we assume a three-class staggered board throughout the
remainder of our analysis (which is by far the modal staggered board). Our arguments
on the potency of ESBs take on even more force if the staggered board has four classes.
    94. See supra text accompanying notes 83-84. Note that shareholders’ ability to call a


                                           26
  In this scenario, the bidder has no choice but to wait through two annual
meetings in order to gain control of the board.95 As with NMT and EAT
targets, the bidder will announce its offer and run a first proxy contest to
gain one-third of the target’s board seats. Unlike NMT and EAT targets,
however, the bidder’s candidates will not be able to commit to withdrawing
the pill if elected, because they will be in the minority. Instead, they will
bide their time for a year, until a second annual election of directors will
(hopefully) give the bidder a majority of board seats. At that time the board
will vote to redeem the pill, paving the way for the target to accept the
bidder’s offer.
   U.S. Surgical’s hostile bid for Circon illustrates the difficulty of this
route.96 In August 1996, Surgical launched a 100% cash tender offer for
Circon at $18.00 per share, representing almost a 70% premium over the pre-
announcement share price. On the advice of Circon’s outside counsel Wilson
Sonsini, Circon installed a “morning after” poison pill with a 15% trigger
immediately after the Surgical bid was launched. Circon’s staggered board
was provided in the charter, but Circon’s bylaws specified that the number
of directors would be set by a majority vote of the board.97 While this
configuration of defenses suggested at least the potential for board packing,
Circon’s bylaws also specified a two-thirds vote requirement (of outstanding
shares)98 that effectively eliminated this route.99 Taken together, these


special meeting and shareholder ability to act by written consent are irrelevant in
determining whether the target has an ESB. The reason is that even if shareholders can
act early, if they cannot dismantle the staggered board then there is no action that they
can take.
    95. If the target has cumulative voting, and if insiders own a sufficiently large stake,
then it may take three elections for the bidder to gain control of the board because the
insiders may be able to preserve one seat in each election. For example, if there are three
classes of three directors each, and insiders own 34% of the shares, insiders can elect one
director in each election. See CLARK, supra note 55, at 363 (defining minimum number of
shares required to elect one director under a cumulative voting system). After two
elections, the bidder would have won four seats (not six) and still would not control a
majority of the board. For our analysis we make the simplifying assumption that the
target does not have a cumulative voting system. In fact, cumulative voting is relatively
uncommon—in our IRRC sample, for example, approximately 10% of firms with
staggered boards also had cumulative voting, yielding 6% of the total sample that had
both a staggered board and cumulative voting. As above, see supra note 93, our
arguments on the potency of ESBs take on even more force if the target has cumulative
voting and insiders have a significant stake.

provisions blocked removal and board packing and gave Circon an ESB.
Surgical therefore began the prolonged process of going through two annual
meetings to gain control of Circon.
    In October 1997, more than a year after the bid had been launched,
Surgical put up a dissident slate of directors and won two seats on Circon’s
board. Plans to put up a second slate of directors in October 1998, which
would have almost certainly led to gaining control of the Circon board, were
cut short when Surgical sold itself to Tyco in June of that year. Because Tyco
had a policy of not making hostile acquisitions, Surgical withdrew its bid for
Circon. In September 1998, under pressure from arbitrageurs (who
threatened to run their own slate of directors), Circon sold itself in a friendly
deal to Maxxim Medical Inc. for 17% less than the original Surgical bid, two
years earlier.
    Surgical’s bid for Circon illustrates the difficulty of the proxy route. In
fact, to our knowledge, no bidder has successfully fought through two proxy
contests to win control of an ESB target.100 This fact suggests that the ballot
box is not a viable safety valve against an ESB target. The next Part provides
a theoretical explanation for why this is true.

                                D. The Delay Problem

   This Part examines how quickly a hostile bidder can gain control of a
target through the proxy contest route. To assess the delay problem, we
compare the three types of targets that we defined earlier —NMT targets,
EAT targets, and ESB targets. In addition, we analyze the delay that would
be imposed against hostile bidders in two hypothetical regimes—targets


(employees and directors) held another 13%. See Hall, Rose & Subramanian, supra note
33, at 4. Thus Surgical would have had to win 89% of the remaining shares in order to
successfully amend the bylaws. While this would have been at least mathematically
possible, it was made even more difficult by the fact that 10-15% of the shares typically
do not vote, for miscellaneous reasons, in proxy contests (e.g., they are out of the
country, or they do not know they own the stock). Surgical could afford, at most, 8%
shareholder nonparticipation, and 100% voting in favor among the remaining
shareholders, in order to successfully pack the board. That Surgical did not even
attempt this route—and chose instead the “easier” path of waiting through two annual
elections—suggests its difficulty.
    100. See infra Part IV.B.2. When this Article was presented at a “bridge group” of
academics and practitioners at New York University Law School in April 2001, some
practitioners claimed to recall situations in which a bidder had in fact won two elections
against an ESB, but no one could provide a specific example of such an event. If such
examples exist, they occurred before 1996—in Part IV we examine all proxy contests
against ESBs between 1996 and 2000 and find no contests in which a bidder had won
two elections against an ESB.

with effective biennial terms, in which a single class of directors is elected
every other year (and midterm removal is not possible), and targets with
effective triennial terms, in which a single class of directors is elected every
third year. We first consider the average delay that is imposed against
hostile bidders, and then we turn to the minimum delay that is imposed.

1.   Average delay.

    We make some simplifying assumptions without loss of generality. First,
we assume that once a hostile bidder emerges, it has infinite patience and
determination and will continue to pursue the deal to completion.101 Second,
we assume that the target’s shareholders are unanimously in favor of the bid
and will vote for the bidder in any elections that take place. Third, we
assume the target’s incumbent board (which by assumption does not own
any shares) is unanimously against the bid and will take all possible actions
(to the extent permitted by the law) to prevent the bid from succeeding.
    Comparison of existing regimes. With these assumptions in place, we now
calculate how long it will take for the bidder to acquire control after initiating
a hostile bid that shareholders would like to accept. The simplest case is
NMT targets. Here, the hostile bidder can gain control within a matter of
months, regardless of when the bid is launched relative to the annual
shareholders meeting. IBM’s hostile bid for Lotus, described in Part III.C.1.
above, provides the clearest example of this case. For simplicity, we describe
the delay imposed against NMT targets as zero.102
    Next we consider EAT targets. Within this category, when the incumbent
board loses a single proxy contest, it is out of office and the hostile bidder
wins. Accordingly, the longest delay that would be imposed against an EAT
target would be a full year, if the bidder appeared immediately after the
target’s shareholder meeting. The shortest delay against an EAT target
would be zero, if the bidder appeared immediately before the target’s
shareholder meeting. If we assume that hostile bids are distributed
uniformly throughout the year and are uncorrelated with annual meeting


     101. Later we explore the implications of relaxing this assumption. See infra Part
III.D.2.
     102. For completeness, we note that even bids for NMT targets are subject to some
legal delay, due to SEC filing requirements and notice requirements under state law and
target charters and bylaws. Targets vulnerable to written consent solicitations will be
more vulnerable than those vulnerable to special meeting calls, because a consent
solicitation takes effect when filed with a target, whereas a special meeting typically
requires a solicitation to call the meeting and another solicitation to obtain proxies for
use at the meeting. Still, the general point is that NMT targets are vulnerable to much
more rapid proxy fights (and hence, bids) than EAT and ESB targets.


                                           29
dates,103 then the average delay imposed against EAT targets is six months.
    Now consider the case of ESB targets. With an ESB, unlike an EAT,
losing the first battle does not mean losing the war for the target’s board.
Against an ESB, a hostile bidder will have to win two proxy contests in order
to gain majority control of the board. If the hostile bidder appears
immediately after the target’s annual meeting, it will wait one year, win a
first election, wait another year, and finally have majority control of the
board after two years. If the hostile bidder appears just before the target’s
annual meeting, it will win one-third immediately, but will have to wait
another year to gain control, resulting in a total wait of one year. On
average, and assuming the same uniform distribution of bids as described
above, a hostile bidder against an ESB will face a delay of one-and-a-half
years.
    Recall the argument that Clark, Gilson and others made,104 and with
which we agreed,105 that, before the pill, directors would not hide behind
their staggered board but would resign if a bidder bought a majority of the
shares. Couldn’t one similarly expect that, even after the pill, if the board
loses one election, it would in fact resign even though it could stay in power
for another year? The answer is no. The reason is that the incumbents still
have a reason to fight with an ESB. Before the pill, when a bidder acquired a
majority of the shares, further resistance would be futile. It would simply be
a matter of time before the target would be required to hold the perfunctory
annual meeting that would displace an additional one-third of the board,
thus giving the bidder control. Furthermore, it would seem illegitimate or at
least hardly respectful to cling to power for another year when the majority
shareholder wishes you to leave. Far better to exit gracefully, in this
scenario, than be forced out one year later.
    In contrast, with an ESB, when a bidder wins the first election, the fight
against the bidder is not doomed, because it is far from certain that the



     103. This assumption is valid if bidders make bids immediately after identifying
targets that they would like to purchase and if such findings and the business needs of
bidders are in no way correlated with the election calendars of targets. Admittedly, this
assumption is not completely valid—in a preliminary analysis we find that more than
half of all annual meetings occur in April and May and that there is a slight increase in
hostile bid activity in the preceding two to three months. This sensitivity to annual
meeting date is slightly greater against targets with ESBs. These findings suggest that
the observable delay against the various types of targets, and particularly against ESBs,
is slightly less than we estimate in our theoretical analysis. Still, as we show in Part IV,
the impact of ESBs on bid outcomes is substantial.

bidder will win the next election or even stay in the game until then.106 In
the context of U.S. Surgical’s hostile bid for Circon, for example, Circon
board member George Cloutier provided this advice to his CEO, friend, and
Harvard Business School sectionmate Richard Auhll:
   I told Richard “Let’s just wait it out.” You never know what is going
   to happen. We’re not going to give up here. We’re staying until the
   last gun is fired. . . . That was my position: we fight until the last
   minute, last day, last hour, and something will happen. And I was
   actually right.107
   Indeed, with an ESB in place, a target board can reasonably attempt to
wait it out. The target’s share price may increase through the bid price (as
was the case with Wallace Computer), a white knight may appear
(Younkers), the bidder may lose interest or its ability to pursue the bid
(Circon), or other unforeseeable circumstances may intervene (For example,
accounting fraud at Cendant forced it to abandon its bid for American
Bankers.108). Furthermore, with the shares held by others than the bidder,
the board would be able to assert that it is serving the legitimate goal of
protecting its shareholders. Thus, with the pill, the board will no longer exit
gracefully after losing the first proxy contest. Dissident directors may be
uncomfortable or a nuisance to the incumbent board members, but with an
ESB dissidents have little to no real power after a single election.109
   Comparison to alternative regimes. For comparison purposes, we now
examine the average delay under two hypothetical regimes. First, consider
biennial elections of a single class of directors, without any possibility for

1997) (“[K]eep in mind that even if U.S. Surgical wins two seats on our Board, they will
not have a majority and cannot force a sale of the Company. So although they may
make a big deal about the results of the election, the reality is, little actually changes.”),
quoted in Brian Hall, Christopher J. Rose & Guhan Subramanian, Circon (B) (Harvard

consider the comments of Charles Elson, dissident director on the Circon board: “We
were surrounded. Brute [Krulak, the other dissident director,] and I were on opposite
sides of the table, and the rest of them were all around us.” Hall, Rose & Subramanian,

removal in between elections. As noted earlier, all states, including
Delaware, are generally thought to require an election each year.110 Under
this hypothetical regime, if the bidder emerged just before an election, it
would not have to wait at all, and if it emerged immediately after an election
(and thus two years away from the next election), it would have to wait two
years. Assuming (as above) a uniform distribution of bids uncorrelated with
annual meeting dates, the average delay under a biennial election
arrangement would be one year. Thus a target with biennial elections would
lead to longer delay, on average, relative to an EAT target (one year versus
six months), but shorter delay relative to an ESB target (one year versus
eighteen months).
    As a second alternative regime, consider a triennial election of a single
class of directors. If a bidder emerged immediately before an election, it
would not wait at all; if it emerged immediately after an election it would
have to wait three years. The average wait would be one-and-a-half years,
which is the same delay as against an ESB target. This fact suggests that
ESBs provide the same average delay against a hostile bidder as a triennial
election of a single class of directors. We now show, however, that other
considerations might make ESBs even more powerful against hostile bids
than a three-year single-class arrangement.

2.   Minimum delay.

    So far we have limited our comparison to the average delay. Of course,
any given bidder is influenced not by the average delay but by the delay in
its particular case. We therefore now consider the distribution of potential
lengths of delay. Table 1 summarizes the analysis from the previous section:

AT&T BroadBand Protect Board, WALL ST. J. (Feb. 13, 2002) at C16 (noting that Comcast-
AT&T Broadband charter does not allow an election of directors until 2005, and stating
that “merger attorneys say they know of no other cases where an entire board was
locked up for two years or more”). This provision of the Comcast charter is currently
being challenged under Pennsylvania corporate law. See Jaret Seiberg, Investors Sue in
$42B Comcast Deal, THE DAILY DEAL (Feb. 20, 2002).

    Table 1 shows that, under a three-year arrangement, delay ranges from
zero years to three years. Thus the possibility remains open that a bidder
lucky enough (or astute enough112) to emerge close to the next election
would have to bear only a small delay in the event that the incumbent board
rejects its offer. In contrast, with an ESB, delay ranges from one year to two
years—under no circumstances can a bidder get a referendum on its offer
without a delay of at least a year.
    This difference is critical. At the outset of this Part we assumed that
bidders have infinite patience and determination. However, there are many
potential bidders whose patience is more limited. Buyers often need to have
resolution, and cannot allow the question to remain unresolved for more
than a year. Consider a buyer that needs a certain type of asset. If it does not
ultimately buy target T, then the buyer should acquire another company
instead (or build the asset in-house). If T has an ESB and T’s board is
unwilling to sell, the buyer would be foolhardy to wait for a year (or longer)
to determine whether its hostile bid against T will succeed. Instead the
buyer should look elsewhere. Therefore an ESB should provide incumbents
virtually complete protection from hostile bids, with all of the potential
drawbacks in terms of managerial agency costs that are associated with such
insulation. In contrast, a three-year arrangement may or may not provide
such protection, depending on when the bidder happens to emerge in
relation to the time of the scheduled election.
    Putting the same point slightly differently, an ESB condenses the
distribution of delays toward the middle when compared to a triennial


   111. This calculation assumes that bids are distributed uniformly throughout the
year and are uncorrelated with shareholder meeting dates.
   112. See supra note 103.


                                        33
election of directors. It eliminates those cases in which the delay will be less
than a year, but also eliminates those cases in which the delay will be more
than two years. The first effect buys incumbents more protection than the
possible reduction in protection caused by the latter effect. Having a
significant possibility that a hostile bidder will face only a short delay will
make the incumbent vulnerable. In contrast, shortening delay from two-and-
a-half years to one-and-a-half years does not create large incremental
exposure for the target board, because one-and-a-half years is still a long
time in a dynamic business environment. In short, the elimination of any
possibility of delay below one year closes an important window of
vulnerability, whereas the reduction of delay to the still long delay of one or
two years is unlikely to have a significant impact.

                         E.   The Two-Election Problem

    So far we have seen why an ESB would impose a heavier burden on a
hostile bidder than even a triennial election of directors, in terms of the delay
in taking over the board. But there is another dimension, beyond mere
delay. When all directors can be removed together, a bidder would have to
win only one election. In contrast, an ESB requires such a bidder to win two
elections, one year apart. This two-election requirement imposes an
additional significant hurdle.
    To see why, consider two situations, both with the same delay. In one
scenario the bidder needs to win only one election, and in the other scenario
the bidder needs to win two elections. To be concrete, compare (i) a situation
in which all directors are elected to two-year terms, and in which a bidder
emerges fifteen months before the next election; with (ii) a situation in which
there is an ESB and a bidder emerges three months before an election. In
both situations, delay would be fifteen months before the bidder could gain
control of the board. But, as explained below, situation (ii) is more difficult
for the bidder to gain control because, even though the total wait would be
the same, the bidder would have to win two elections one year apart.
    The problem is this: In the case of one election, once it comes, however
distant in the future, the buyer will know how much it is willing to pay for
the company, and will put an offer on the table. In example (i) above, the
hostile bidder will wait until the election and then run a proxy contest. The
bidder will announce its acquisition price concurrently with the proxy fight,
which it will set on the basis of its own and general market conditions.
    In situation (ii), with two votes a year apart, the bidder faces a problem.
In the first election, if the bidder does not make a firm offer for the target,
target shareholders will be reluctant to vote for the bidder’s slate, and the
bidder’s chances of success will be diminished. If the bidder makes a firm



                                       34
offer, however, the bidder will expose itself to risk—essentially the bidder
will be providing the target shareholders with a year-long put option for
their shares. For this reason two elections are far more difficult than one. In
the discussion below we start with the general problem of winning the proxy
contest without a firm offer on the table, and then turn to additional
difficulties presented by an ESB.

1.   The importance of a firm offer for winning a proxy contest.

    There are strong reasons to believe that when a bidder in a proxy contest
for control does not make an acquisition offer, it will be difficult for the
bidder to win.113 Shareholders will be reluctant to vote for a bidder that does
not put an acquisition offer on the table. The bidder might be interested in
pursuing its own interests rather than increasing shareholder value. Because
winning would provide the bidder with private benefits of control,
shareholders cannot infer from the mere mounting of a fight that they will be
better off if the bidder wins. Their welfare will depend on how the bidder
and the incumbents compare, an assessment that shareholders may not be
well-positioned to make. Being imperfectly informed about the quality of
the bidders, the shareholders might vote on the basis of the average quality
of bidders, which might lead them to vote generally against bidders in proxy
contests not backed by a firm acquisition offer. This argument is consistent
with empirical evidence suggesting that proxy contests for control, without
an accompanying tender offer, are seldom successful.114
    By making a firm offer for the target’s shares in conjunction with its
proxy fight, a bidder eliminates the need for shareholders to make an
assessment of how well the bidder would run the firm. Instead, to determine



    113. For a fuller analysis of this point, using a formal model of voting with and
without an acquisition offer on the table, see Lucian Arye Bebchuk & Oliver Hart,
Takeover Bids vs. Proxy Fights in Contests for Corporate Control, (Working Paper No. 336,
John M. Olin Center, Harvard Law School, October 2001).
    114. While we argue that it is difficult to win a first election without having a firm
offer on the table, we do not claim that it is impossible. There have been situations in
which shareholders are so dissatisfied with existing managers that, notwithstanding the
considerations discussed here, they have voted for a challenger. In our hostile bid
sample, described in more detail in Part IV below, only one bidder was successful in
winning the target by bringing a proxy contest without an accompanying tender offer—
this was Huntsman’s July 1996 offer to acquire Rexene Corp. Note that even in this bid
there was a specific offer on the table ($15 cash per share, eventually increased to $16
cash), though the bidder did not make a formal tender offer. The proxy route on its
own may have been more effective than usual in this case because it was initiated by
Guy Wyser-Pratte, a 10% holder of Rexene and a noted shareholder activist.


                                           35
whether they would be better off, shareholders simply need to compare the
offer price (which is much less speculative than the expected monetary value
of the company under the bidder’s management) with their assessment of
the target’s value.

2.   The importance of a firm offer against an ESB.

    We now turn to the specific case of a first proxy contest against an ESB to
elect one-third of the board. Here, the contest is not over full board control
but rather over a rival team putting its foot in the door. For the reasons
described above, the bidder would find it difficult to win the proxy contest
unless it put a firm offer on the table. In the specific context of an ESB, there
are two additional reasons that a firm offer is necessary. First, shareholders
may not want to let the bidder infiltrate their board with a minority of
directors, who could then conduct due diligence from the inside and report
back to the bidder, unless there was a firm commitment on the offer. Second,
it may be costly to have a hostile, dissenting group on the board.115 Thus, if
the bidder is not going to make an offer in a year (as happened in the end in
Circon), putting the bidder’s team on the board for now is costly. Circon
Chairman and CEO Richard Auhll described the enormous difficulty in
running his company with a hostile takeover bid pending and two dissident
directors on his board:
    We were terrified that we would lose our employees and that would
    destroy our ability to operate the company. That was a major, major
    issue, trying to hold our team together. . . . So I was a major
    cheerleader out there for the employees, trying to keep up morale and
    keep the esprit de corps up. . . . We spent a lot of money on incentives
    for the sales force to stay in place, because the sales force was vital to
    the whole issue. And it turns out, those efforts were not successful.
    No matter how much money we threw at it, it was not enough to keep
    the sales force in place. . . . Over the full 26 month period [of the
    hostile bid], our sales remained basically level.116
   Electing a minority dissident slate can be thought of as an investment by
shareholders in the bidder’s program. If the bidder does not complete its
takeover a year later, then shareholders do not get their “payoff” from this
investment, and would have been better off not putting a disruptive group
on the board in the first place.


    115. See, e.g., Topps Co. Proxy Statement, Proposal No. 4 (May 28, 1998) (“A proxy
fight, regardless of whether successful, can seriously distract a company’s management
and board of directors and impose substantial costs on the company.”).
    116. See Hall, Rose & Subramanian, supra note 33.


                                         36
3.   The cost of committing to a price.

    What is so difficult in having to make a bid (or some strong commitment
to a price) in the first election? Why would this deter or make difficult some
potential acquisitions? The problem is that in a dynamic world the value of
the target can change over time; thus making an irreversible or even strong
commitment to a price for a considerable period exposes a bidder to
substantial risk.
    To illustrate, consider a bidder that emerges when the independent value
of the ESB target is $100. Assume the best case—the next annual meeting is
imminent, and the following annual election is a year after that. Assume
further that the target will have either positive developments or negative
developments over the next year, and as a result the value of the target as an
independent entity will be either $130 or $70, each with a 50% probability.
Finally, assume that the bidder can manage the assets more efficiently, or can
produce gains from synergy, which makes the value of the assets to the
bidder 120% of the independent value of the target. This final assumption
means that if the bidder were able to wait until a year from now and then
make an offer, the bidder would always be able to make an offer that
shareholders would find attractive.117
    Now let us turn to the bidder’s predicament if the bidder needs to win
two elections, one now and one in one year. We have argued in the previous
section that the bidder needs to commit to a price now that it will keep open
until the next election. What price (P) should the bidder offer now, just
before the first election? If the bidder makes a firm offer of P and binds itself
to it for a year, shareholders will be free to accept or reject it later on, and the
target board will be free to bring in rivals with competing offers.
    For example, consider what would happen if the bidder were to offer a
price of $110, open for one year. This offer would be enough to win now, if
there could be a decisive referendum now. In a year, if the target has
positive developments, the independent value of the target would go up to
$130, and shareholders would reject the offer. If the target has negative
developments, the independent value of the target would decline to $70, and
shareholders would accept the offer. Of course, in the event of negative
developments getting the target for $110 will be a losing proposition for the
bidder, who would value it only at $84 ($70 x 120%).
    The problem is that making a firm offer at $110—or at any other price—
effectively gives target shareholders a put option for their shares. In a single-

    117. Note that the bidder cannot commit now to bid 120% (or something between
100% and 120%) of the market price one year later because as the commitment date
approached the target’s share price would be bid up without any clear limit, stopping
only at the point at which the bidder’s commitment to the offer were no longer credible.


                                          37
election regime, the option is not worth a great deal because it expires
relatively quickly. In a two-election regime, giving the option is costly
because it will extend for one year or longer.118 In the simple numerical
example provided above, the bidder will win only when the target
experiences negative developments, but of course in this scenario the bidder
does not want to win. The only solution to this manifestation of the classic
“lemons problem” is for the bidder not to bid. Thus, in this example, even
though the value of the target’s assets would be higher in the hands of the
bidder, there is no firm offer that would enable the bidder to win the first
round yet would be profitable for the bidder to make.119 The bidder will be
unwilling to make a firm offer or will reduce the amount that it would be
willing to offer, either of which would make it more difficult to win the
requisite two elections.
    We do not claim that it is impossible for a bidder to win two elections. If
the shareholders are sufficiently desperate about their existing situation they
might be willing to vote for the bidder even without a firm offer. And if the
bidder values the target sufficiently highly, it might be worthwhile to bear
the cost of making a firm offer. Our point is only that the two-election
problem imposes an additional and substantial cost that makes the ballot box
route extremely difficult.

4.   Comparison to the one-election case.

   To close this Part, it is worth highlighting the difficulty of having to win
twice by noting how the volatility of the assets of the target over time would
not be an impediment in a case in which the bidder faced delay but did not
need to win two separate elections. Using the bidder in the above numerical
example, assume an election arrangement in which the bidder would have to
wait a year and then could run one proxy contest for the board as a whole.
   In this case, assuming that the bidder is willing to bear the cost of delay,
the volatility of the assets over the interim year would not be a problem,
because the bidder could simply observe the target’s asset value just before


     118. In theory the bidder could adopt a hedging strategy that would provide
insurance against the value of the target going down, but this strategy would simply
replace the implicit cost of the free put with an explicit cost of the premium needed to
purchase such insurance. Basic option theory predicts that these two costs should be
equal.
     119. For simplicity we have presented an example with two discrete outcomes ($70
or $130), but the argument continues to hold if we allow a continuous distribution of
outcomes. As long as the value of the target could fall below $92 as a stand-alone entity
(which means that the value to the bidder would fall below $110), the put option at $110
is costly for the bidder to give.


                                           38
making its bid. If the target had positive developments and its value
increased to $130, the bidder would bid somewhere between $130 and $156
(120% of $130). If the target had negative developments and its independent
value went down to $70, the bidder would bid somewhere between $70 and
$84 (120% of $70). This example illustrates the point that the existence of one
definitive election enables the bidder to makes its final commitment to price
just before the outcome is resolved through the proxy contest. Unlike the
ESB scenario, in this scenario bids are not deterred.
    The analysis in this Part demonstrates that even in those cases in which
an ESB and a two-year (or three-year) arrangement would present the bidder
with the same delay, the former would constitute a much more formidable
takeover defense. Under the latter, if the bidder is sufficiently patient (a big
“if” to be sure), the bidder will be able to eventually reach an up-or-down
referendum on an offer it will be able to determine at the time of the
referendum. With an ESB, however, this possibility does not exist.

                                F.   Conclusion

    In closing this Part, we return to our initial objective, which is to assess
the viability of the ballot box safety valve against disloyal target boards. In
Part III.C we argued that it is necessary to distinguish among three types of
targets in order to answer this question: (1) targets with no minimum term
for board members (“NMT targets”); (2) targets which have an effective
annual term (“EAT targets”); and (3) targets with effective staggered boards
(“ESB targets”). The ballot box is a meaningful safety valve against NMT
targets, because a bidder can relatively quickly take its case directly to the
shareholders of a disloyal target board. The ballot box is less effective
against EAT targets, but still there is a meaningful path to success,
particularly in the (approximately) three months before the target’s annual
meeting. The ballot box, however, does not seem to be an effective safety
valve against ESB targets.
    We have presented theoretical reasons for predicting ESBs to have a
strong antitakeover effect. This effect is likely to be of a different order of
magnitude than other types of antitakeover charter and bylaw provisions.
Not only does an ESB provide more delay and longer guaranteed tenure for
an incumbent board, but, more importantly, it creates additional
impediments by (i) eliminating any possibility that a buyer might emerge at
a point in time that would not require delay, and (ii) requiring victories in
two elections rather than one. Indeed, our analysis has shown that the
antitakeover effects of an ESB are stronger not only than other existing
antitakeover arrangements, but of hypothetical arrangements (currently not
permissible) under which elections would be held only every two or three



                                      39
years. We now turn to test these theoretical arguments against the available
empirical evidence.

                                IV.     EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE

    The analysis of the preceding Part predicts that (1) ESBs make it more
difficult for a hostile bidder to win control of the target’s board through the
ballot box mechanism; and (2) because the ballot box safety valve is rendered
less effective when the target has an ESB, an ESB increases the likelihood that
a target can remain independent when faced with a hostile takeover bid. We
test these two hypotheses against the empirical evidence in Parts B, C, and D
below and find strong support for both. In Parts E and F we examine
whether ESBs provide countervailing benefits to takeover targets and find no
evidence that they do. Part G concludes by estimating the aggregate losses
caused to target shareholders by ESBs.

                                  A. Data Description

    Prior empirical studies of takeover defenses have found that these
defenses have little or no effect on bid outcomes.120 These results are
consistent with practitioner wisdom that takeover defenses matter only at
the margin.121 However, these studies are problematic because they focus
exclusively on the pill and fail to consider staggered boards and how they
interact with the pill.122 As described in Part III.B, the pill by itself is not a
potent defense, but the pill/staggered board combination has a substantial
effect on bids. Furthermore, whether a target has a pill in place prior to a bid
is also unimportant, given the ability of targets to adopt pills rapidly in



     120. See, e.g., JAMIL ABOUMERI, POISON PILLS AND SHAREHOLDER VALUE, 1992-96
(1997) (finding that firms with pills are less likely to defeat hostile takeover bids than
firms without pills); James A. Brickley, Jeffrey L. Coles & Rory L. Terry, Outside Directors
and the Adoption of Poison Pills, 35 J. FIN. ECON. 371 (1994) (finding that the proportion of
outside directors does not influence the success rate of bids against firms with pills, but
it does increase the likelihood that the target will be auctioned once a bid has been
brought); Coates, supra note 58 (finding that pre-bid poison pills have no impact on bid
outcomes); Michael Ryngaert, The Effect of Poison Pill Securities on Shareholder Wealth, 20 J.
FIN. ECON. 377, 407-08 (1988) (finding that 31% of firms with pills remained
independent, compared to 16% of firms without pills).

response to a bid.123
    To correct these deficiencies, we constructed a new data set of hostile bids
made against U.S. targets that were initiated and resolved between January
1996 and December 2000. The data set includes all the bids, 92 in number,
for which there was data in the Thompson Financial Securities Data
(formerly Securities Data Corporation) (SDC) database in November 1999 for
the 1996-98 bids and in March 2001 for the 1999-2000 bids. Altogether our
data set includes 92 bids. Specific charter and bylaw terms of each target
were taken from the targets’ filings with the SEC,124 to determine whether
staggered boards are effective or can be evaded as described in Part III.C.
Bidder and target SEC filings, as well as newspaper accounts, were used to
verify bid outcomes and to classify bids as bust-up or stand-alone.125 Stock
prices were obtained from the Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP)
database. Summary data on target and bid characteristics and overall
outcomes for this data set are presented in Table 2.




     123. See Coates, supra note 58.
     124. Specifically, each target’s filings were found by searching for the target in the
SEC’s online EDGAR database, available at http://www.sec.gov/edaux/formlynx.htm.
An exhibit list to the latest Form 10-K was reviewed to determine where to find the
target’s charter and bylaws, and relevant filings were obtained either from the target’s
online filings or, where they were unavailable, from Compact Disclosure (a private SEC
filing service in CD-ROM and paper formats). Once obtained, charters and bylaws were
analyzed as described in Coates, supra note 106.
     125. Specifically, the target’s filings were found, as described in the preceding note,
and Schedules 14D-1 (or Schedules TO) were searched to see if the bidder made a tender
offer as part of the hostile bid. If so, the “Background” section of the related offer to
purchase (filed as an exhibit to the Schedule 14D-1) was read to determine if the bid was
a bust-up bid and to confirm bidder identity, premium, deal size, and other data, and
outcomes were determined by reviewing subsequent amendments to the Schedule 14D-
1. If no Schedule 14D-1 was filed, Schedules 14A were reviewed to see if the bidder
conducted a proxy fight or consent solicitation as part of the bid; if so, similar
procedures were followed. If not, Forms 8-K and 10-Q, as well as news stories in
Lexis/News, available at http://www.lexis.com, were reviewed to confirm SDC data on
the bid, its characteristic, and outcomes.

    Table 2 shows that 61% of bids (56 bids) were brought against targets

defenses in the sense discussed above. Thus, of the ninety-two bids, 49%
were brought against targets with ESBs. Pre-bid poison pills are present at
nearly 70% of targets; moreover, all targets in our sample that did not have
pills at the time of the bid announcement put in “morning after” pills as the
first step toward resistance or at least to gain time and bargaining power
against the bidder.126

                        B.   Viability of the Ballot Box Mechanism

    In Part III we argued that the ballot box mechanism is not an effective
route against ESB targets. In this Part we test this prediction empirically by
examining the outcomes of the proxy contests in our data set. Note that the
mere existence of proxy solicitations against ESB targets does not necessarily
mean that proxy contests are a viable route against such targets. Proxy
contests could be launched for several reasons independent of their
effectiveness as a way of taking over the target–for example, to complement
a concurrent public relations campaign intended to put market pressure on
the board or to show the bidder’s seriousness. The best test to assess the
effectiveness of the proxy contest route is to examine whether there are cases
in which a target is taken over against the wishes of the incumbent board
due to the presence of this route.
    Note that we define these “ballot box victories” broadly, to include not
only situations in which the bidder actually wins control over the board but
also situations in which target management capitulates and agree to an
acquisition a short time before the shareholder vote. The reason is that once
a bidder is fairly certain to gain control of the board in an imminent vote,
managers might well choose to make a graceful exit, possibly extracting
some benefit for themselves, which would not be possible after the vote has
occurred. A bidder’s gaining control over the board can become fairly
certain only close in time to the relevant vote, because until then there is still
some chance that a change in circumstances will make the bidder’s offer less
attractive or that the bidder will withdraw its bid (as happened in Circon).

1.   Against ESB targets.

   Applying our test, we find not a single ballot box victory against the ESB
targets in our sample. In fact, only one proxy fight against an ESB (Circon)
went to a shareholder vote for the first time. In the Circon situation, the
hostile bidder (U.S. Surgical) was itself taken over and withdrew five months
before the second shareholder vote. Thus, Circon illustrates why target
managers faced with an attractive acquisition proposal do not have to
assume that the bidder will gain control ultimately—the ESB gives the target

substantial time, and during that time unforeseen events may intervene to
allow the target to remain independent. Thus, in our sample period, no
bidder has come closer than five months to running the second proxy contest
necessary for a ballot box victory.
    It might be argued that we should include instances where a bidder wins
a single proxy contest—such as the Circon situation—as “ballot box
victories,” because the election of a single slate of insurgent directors may
put sufficient pressure on the target’s incumbent board members so that they
concede. Looking outside of our sample period, Weyerhaeuser’s recent and
well-publicized hostile bid for Willamette provides a good illustration of this
point: After Weyerhaeuser won one-third of the seats on Willamette’s board
in July 2001, the two companies negotiated a friendly sale in January 2002.127
However, in three other instances in which a hostile bidder won a first proxy
contest against an ESB—Moore’s hostile bid for Wallace Computer, Carson
Pirie Scott’s bid for Younkers, and Boston Bank of Commerce’s bid for
Carver Bancorp—the initial bidder did not eventually win control of the
target. Thus out of the five instances in recent memory in which the bidder
won a first proxy contest against an ESB, only in one case (Weyerhaeuser)
was the initial bidder eventually successful.
    In any particular contest, various factors will determine how much
“market” pressure is brought to bear on incumbents, for example: the
presence of precatory shareholder resolutions opposing defenses or
proposing sale; the number and fraction of independent directors on the
target’s board; the percentage of shareholders who have tendered into the
bidder’s offer; the effectiveness of the bidder’s public relation campaign; the
presence of activist institutional investors. A bidder’s winning one proxy
contest against an ESB—which would be a clear indication of shareholders’
support for the offer—is certainly a factor that would add to the pressure on
incumbents. However, the critical point is that, as a legal matter, a victory in
one election, or the manifestation of shareholder support for the offer in
other ways, does not preclude the target’s board from holding firm until the
second election if it chooses to—and thus does not in any way guarantee
success for the bidder. The examples noted above of bidders winning one
election but not ultimately gaining control provide a vivid illustration of this
point.
    In sum, we are unaware of any instance, either during the sample period
or outside it, in which a bidder successfully gained control of the target using
the ballot box. This has not been the case, however, with respect to non-ESB
targets.

2.    Against non-ESB targets.

    In contrast, the ballot box mechanism seems to be a viable mechanism
against non-ESB targets. In March 1999, for example, Philips launched a
proxy contest against VLSI after VLSI rejected its unsolicited $17-per-share
tender offer. VLSI was an NMT target, so Philips immediately began
soliciting proxies to act by written consent.128 In May 1999, Philips withdrew
its proxy solicitation when VLSI agreed to a negotiated sale for $21 per share.
    Similarly, noted shareholder activist Guy Wyser-Pratte launched a proxy
contest against Rexene in April 1997, in order to replace the incumbent board
with directors who would accept Huntsman’s hostile bid. The special
shareholders’ meeting was scheduled for May twenty-second; on May
twentieth, Rexene entered into talks with Huntsman and negotiated the sale.
    A third example of a ballot box victory against a target without an ESB is
the Fant Industries bid for HEI. In this case, Fant actually went through with
its proxy contest and won four seats on the target’s board in August 1998.
Fant then replaced the CEO and consummated its hostile bid.
    Taken together, these findings support the theoretical arguments put
forward in Part III, that the ballot box route is an ineffective route against an
ESB but an effective route against a non-ESB. In fact, winning through the
ballot box mechanism against an ESB seems very difficult indeed. As
emphasized earlier, the argument does not imply that hostile bidders will
never be successful against ESBs. But the important point is that, if the
incumbents decide to resist, the ability of the bidder to oust them remains
extremely limited.

                    C.    Remaining Independent in the Short-run

   If the ballot box route is not an effective safety valve against an ESB, we
would expect that targets will have greater ability to remain independent
with an ESB.129 This Part examines bid outcomes in the short-run, defined as
the first nine months after the hostile bid announcement. In the next Part, we
examine target independence in the longer run, defined as the thirty-month
period after bid announcement.



    128. See Steven Lipin, Philips Electronics Readies Proxy Fight if VLSI Refuses to
Negotiate on Offer, WALL ST. J., Mar. 3, 1999, at B6 (“The biggest chink [in VLSI’s takeover
defenses] is that any entity that owns VLSI shares can effectively remove the board by
canvassing shareholders via a so-called consent solicitation at any time.”).

Law: The Case of Divorce, 88 YALE L. J. 950, 951 (1979) (demonstrating how the “shadow
of the law” provides endowments that influence outcomes).

1.   General findings.

   Figure 3 shows the short-run outcomes of all bids against ESBs (n=45)
and non-ESBs (n=47) between 1996 and 2000. For purposes of the analysis
the short-run is defined as nine months after the hostile bid is brought,
though in Part IV.C.4 we show that the results do not change in any
significant way if we use six months or twelve months after bid
announcement as the timeframe for analysis.

    Figure 3 reveals a striking difference in success rates depending on the
target’s defenses: 60% of ESB targets remained independent against a hostile
bid, compared to 34% of non-ESB targets. The difference is made up of fewer
sales to initial bidders (16% of ESB targets versus 32% of non-ESB targets)
and fewer sales to white knights (24% of ESB targets versus 34% of non-ESB
targets). These results are consistent with our findings from Part IV.B, which
show that proxy contests are an ineffective route against ESBs. These results
also call into question the findings from prior studies that purport to show
that takeover defenses generally have no impact on bid outcomes.

2.   Controlling for other parameters.

   To control for factors other than ESBs that could plausibly influence the
outcome of takeover contests, we have used multivariate regression analysis.
The control factors used in this analysis include the target’s other takeover
defenses (dual class stock, fair price provision, pre-bid poison pill,
supermajority voting provision), bid features (proxy fight, bear hug bid,
tender offer, bust-up bid), and control variables (natural log of deal size, bid
premium, and whether target is a Delaware firm).
   This analysis shows that ESBs continue to have the predicted impact on
outcomes and target independence rates when we control for these other


                                                   46
factors.130 Using the method of recycled predictions, the results indicate that
ESBs nearly double the average target’s odds of remaining independent, from
34% to 61%, cut the odds of a bidder completing its bid from 34% to 14%,
and cut the odds that the average target in our sample will be forced into
selling to a white knight, from 32% to 25%.131 These results are consistent
with the basic findings presented in Figure 3.

3.   Selection problems.

    It might be suggested that ESBs have another effect on remaining
independent that is not captured by the analysis thus far. So far we have
taken as given that a bid has been made. But whether a bid is made might
depend on defenses—specifically, the presence of an ESB might discourage
some bids. Thus, the bids that are made for ESBs might be a subset of bids
that would have been made otherwise; indeed, this subset might be skewed
toward buyers that are relatively more determined and motivated.
    We agree that such a selection might be taking place.132 However, its
presence would imply that the effect of an ESB on the likelihood of
remaining independent is even larger than suggested by our already strong
results. Here we show that an ESB increases the odds of independence by
defeating bids that occur; a selection effect would imply that ESBs also
increase the odds of independence by discouraging offers from being made
in the first place.
    In addition to this bidder-side selection effect, there is a potential target-
side selection effect: It might be the case that targets with ESBs are different
in some underlying features that lead to the adoption of the ESB in the first
place. According to this view, it would be these underlying features, and not
the presence of the ESB, that are responsible for the increased likelihood of
independence. However, this potential target-side endogeneity problem is
mitigated considerably by the fact that that most of the targets in our data set
existed prior to 1990. For such mature companies, ESB installation could
have occurred only before 1990, because (for reasons discussed in Part II.D) a
charter amendment to install a staggered board became extremely difficult
after 1990. So whether these targets had ESBs in the mid to late 1990s

    131. The method of recycled predictions compares the likelihood of each outcome
in two hypothetical scenarios: one in which all targets have ESBs and one in which all
targets do not have ESBs.
    132. But cf. supra notes 50-54 and accompanying text (finding that practitioners
seem to underestimate the antitakeover power of staggered boards, which in turn
suggests that bid deterrence might be minimal).

depended on actions taken in the 1980s or even earlier. Different decisions in
this earlier era are unlikely to translate into large enough differences between
the ESB and non-ESB targets in the 1990s to account for the results we get.133

4.   Defining the short-run.

    While the difference in target independence rates documented in Figure 3
also appears when we examine a six-month window after bid announcement
(73% independence rate among ESB targets compared to a 47%
independence rate among non-ESB targets), we find that many bid outcomes
in our sample are still uncertain after six months. By nine months, however,
we find that virtually all of the dust has settled on the initial hostile bids. In
fact we find that only two bid outcomes in our data set changed in the nine
to twelve month window: ITT fended off Hilton and sold itself to Starwood
in November 1997 (bid was announced in January 1997), and Healthdyne
fended off Invacare and sold it sold itself to Respironics, also in November
1997 (original bid also announced in January 1997). Both of these targets did
not have staggered boards, so the results are more pronounced in favor of
ESB target independence when we use twelve months for our short-run
window: 30% independence rate for non-ESB targets (14 out of 47),
compared to the same 60% independence rate for ESB targets (27 out of 45).
    Nevertheless, we use a nine-month window instead of a twelve-month
window for our short-run analysis because wealth effects, which we examine
in Parts IV.E through IV.G, become increasingly problematic to calculate as
the time frame for analysis gets longer.134 Still, to alleviate concerns that we
are missing part of the story by looking only at short-run outcomes, we
examine long-run bid outcomes in the next Part.



    133. In prior work one of us has argued that selection effects may be the cause for
Robert Daines’ finding that Delaware firms have higher Tobin’s Q than non-Delaware
firms. See Bebchuk & Ferrell, supra note 46; Robert Daines, Does Delaware Law Improve
Firm Value?, 62 J. FIN. ECON. 525 (2001). The critical difference between the
reincorporation decision and the staggered board decision is that reincorporations
continued to be a viable option for managers throughout the 1990s, see Subramanian,
supra note 30 (manuscript at 23 tbl. 1) (reporting 373 midstream reincorporations among
U.S. public companies in the 1990s), while the ability to adopt a staggered board was
effectively unavailable to managers after 1990. See Klausner, supra note 42, at 3-4 (“This
decline [in staggered board proposals] reflects management realization that there is no
point in even asking shareholders to support a classified board.”). In short, the
staggered board decision, unlike the reincorporation decision, was effectively frozen as
of 1990; therefore it seems reasonable to take ESB incidence as exogenous to events that
occurred in our 1996-2000 sample period.

                                  D. Remaining Independent in the Longer-run

    In Part II.E we described the conventional wisdom among M&A
practitioners that a target, once put into play by a hostile bidder, will be sold
either to the hostile bidder or to a white knight. The empirical evidence
presented in Part IV.C suggests that this conventional wisdom is incorrect, at
least in the short run, if the target has an ESB. Nevertheless, it might still be
argued that ESB targets are eventually sold once a bid is made, but the
outcome takes longer to play out because of the delay imposed on the initial
bidder by the ESB. In this Part we examine whether targets remain
independent in the longer run, defined as the thirty-month window after bid
announcement.
    Figure 4 presents basic statistics on the status of the targets in our sample
thirty months after the initial hostile bid is announced, again divided
between ESB targets (n=45) and non-ESB targets (n=47).135

    Not surprisingly, the independence rate has decreased for all targets
relative to Figure 3: The number of independent ESB targets has declined
from 27 to 21, and the number of independent non-ESB targets has declined
from 16 to 11 in this longer timeframe. The basic finding that ESB targets are
much more likely to remain independent remains, and in fact becomes even
more pronounced relative to the short-run analysis: 47% of ESB targets
remain independent thirty months after the initial hostile bid is launched,
compared to only 23% of non-ESB targets. As in the short run, the difference
is made up of fewer sales to initial bidders (16% of ESB targets versus 34% of
non-ESB targets) and fewer sales to other bidders (38% of ESB targets versus


    135. While it is conceivable that a target could have changed from a non-ESB target
to an ESB target (or vice versa) between the announcement of the hostile bid and thirty
months later, none of the targets in our sample did so.


                                                      49
43% of non-ESB targets). These results continue to hold in a multivariate
regression that controls for other relevant factors in the same way that has
been used for testing with respect to remaining independent in the short
run.136

                       E.   The Cost of Remaining Independent

    In the prior two parts we showed that a target can remain independent
far more often when it has an ESB, both in the short run and in the longer
term. In this section we show that target shareholders generally suffer when
the target remains independent—that is, remaining independent makes the
shareholders of hostile bid targets worse off compared with the scenario in
which the bid would have been successful. It might be argued that
incumbents retain independence in those instances in which they would be
able to achieve the same or higher value-creating gains on their own, either
by achieving stand-alone operational improvements or by providing
information to the marketplace that corrects an underpricing of their firm.
The remainder of this section demonstrates that this hypothesis is, on
average, not correct.
    As a starting point, Table 3 provides aggregate statistics on average
(mean) shareholder returns by bid outcome.137 These calculations include
the premiums achieved through subsequent completed bids against targets
that remain independent, in order to give full credit for management plans to
sell to a “better” bidder than the initial hostile bidder. The calculations also
assume that cash received at any time (for example, at the completion of a
bid) is reinvested at the risk-free rate, assumed to be 6%.138




    136. See Bebchuk, Coates & Subramanian, supra note 3.
    137. We plan to estimate in subsequent work abnormal returns rather than absolute
returns, though we do not believe that this adjustment will change our overall
conclusions. The bids in our sample are distributed uniformly over the sample period,
and the market overall moved fairly consistently in an upward direction during this
time.
    138. Note that using the risk-free rate rather than a market return biases our results
in favor of ESBs: shareholders in non-ESB targets generally receive cash sooner than
shareholders in ESB targets; presumably these non-ESB shareholders have opportunities
to re-invest this cash at higher than the risk-free rate. We nevertheless use a risk-free
reinvestment rate assumption as a conservative estimate.

    Table 3 shows large statistical differences in shareholder returns across
outcomes. In the short run, targets that are sold to an initial bidder achieve
nine-month returns that are 29% higher than targets that remain
independent, and targets that are sold to a white knight achieve an
additional 14% beyond that. Combining these two sale outcomes, nine-
month returns in the case of a sale are 55%. Compared against the 18%
returns from remaining independent, this result suggests a 36% cost of
remaining independent in the short run.
    In the long run, targets that are sold to an initial bidder achieve thirty-
month returns that are 43% higher than targets that remain independent; and
targets that are sold to another bidder achieve an additional 20%.
Combining the two sale outcomes, thirty-month returns in the case of a sale
are 80% on average, compared to 25% returns for targets that remain
independent, yielding a 55% cost of remaining independent in the longer
term.
    In short, the large and statistically significant differences between
outcome categories indicate that the shareholders of targets that remained
independent were made substantially worse off by the defeat of the hostile
bid compared with the scenario in which the bid would have been accepted.
This result continues to hold when we control for other factors that might
influence shareholder returns, in both the short run (9 months) and the long
run (30 months).139

        F.   Do ESBs Produce Offsetting Benefits by Increasing Premiums?

    So far we have demonstrated that an ESB allows a target to remain
independent more often against a hostile bid and that remaining
independent is generally rather bad for target shareholders. Against these
costs, however, ESBs might provide countervailing benefits for target
shareholders. One such benefit might be increased bargaining power for
target managers, which in turn would raise the premium in the event of an
acquisition. If true, this theory would be consistent with some poison pill
studies showing that higher premiums are correlated with whether the target
has adopted a poison pill prior to a hostile bid or friendly merger.140
    In this Part we consider the theory that ESBs might create value for target
shareholders by providing target managers with greater bargaining power
(“bargaining power hypothesis”). As a starting point, Table 2 shows that the
average final bid that a hostile bidder makes for an ESB target is 44.1% over
the pre-bid market price, compared with 42.4% average final bid premium
for non-ESB targets. Focusing only on successful bids, we find that the final
acquisition premium is 54.4% for targets with ESBs and 49.6% for targets
without ESBs. While this 5% difference in favor of ESBs provides some
marginal evidence in favor of the bargaining power hypothesis, a statistical
test indicates that it is not statistically significant (t=0.76). An ordinary least
squares regression, with final bid premium as the dependent variable, and
controlling for the other relevant factors, similarly indicates that the
coefficient for ESB is not statistically significant in predicting bid premium
(t=0.74).141
    Given the lack of any significant differences in premiums, it is
unsurprising that shareholder returns are not statistically different between
ESB and non-ESB targets that are sold. Examining the columns of Table 3,
we find that short-run returns for targets that are sold are 56.0% when there
is an ESB, and 53.6% when there is not. In the long-run, returns for ESB
targets that are sold are 80.1%, compared to 79.3% for non-ESB targets.
Neither of these differences is statistically significant. While these results do
not rule out the possibility that premiums and returns against ESB targets
might be higher (and statistically significant) if we were to examine a larger



    140. See ABOUMERI, supra note 120; J.P. MORGAN & CO., POISON PILLS AND
ACQUISITION PREMIUMS (1995) (on file with authors). But see Coates, supra note 58
(arguing that pre-bid pills should be irrelevant due to the “shadow pill”).
    141. For more details on this regression, which uses the same independent variables
as the regressions whose results were reported earlier, see Bebchuk, Coates &
Subramanian, supra note 3. Alternative specifications (including using the log of deal
premium as the dependent variable) yield similar results.


                                          52
sample, the data do suggest that the differences are not of the order of
magnitude that would be necessary to offset the large differences in the
likelihood of achieving these premiums.
    In short, ESBs do not seem to provide sufficiently large countervailing
benefits for shareholders of hostile bid targets, in the form of higher deal
premiums, to offset the substantially lower likelihood of being acquired. In
fact, the evidence is not sufficient even to conclude that there is any positive
effect at all of ESBs on deal premiums, though we cannot reject this
possibility with our small-sample analysis. However, even if future research
were to conclude that ESBs do yield higher premiums for target shareholders
in deals that are successful, ESBs do not seem to have a major impact on
premiums of the kind that would be necessary to outweigh their negative
effects on bid outcomes.

                 G. Overall Effect on Target Shareholder Value

    To summarize the argument thus far, we have shown that (1) ESBs
substantially increase the likelihood of remaining independent; (2) remaining
independent is quite costly compared with accepting the bid; and (3) ESBs do
not provide sufficient countervailing benefits (and may produce no benefits
at all) in terms of increasing the premium in the event of an acquisition. We
now aggregate these various elements and quantify them in order to
calculate the overall effect of ESBs on target shareholder value.

1.   General findings.

    The effect of ESBs on shareholder wealth can be disaggregated into two
pieces: first, the increased likelihood of remaining independent that an ESB
provides; and second, the cost associated with remaining independent. We
have shown so far that both pieces are substantial: Figure 3 shows that the
likelihood of remaining independent is 26% higher for ESB targets; Table 3
shows that the short-run cost of remaining independent is 36%. This Part
quantifies this effect more carefully.
    As a starting point we examine total shareholder returns, irrespective of
bid outcome, for ESB and non-ESB targets. Shareholders in the ESB targets
in our sample achieved 31.8% returns in the nine months after a hostile bid
was announced, compared to 43.4% returns for the shareholders in non-ESB
targets, representing an 11.6% difference. As noted above, this difference is
driven entirely by the difference in success rates for the hostile bidders
between the two samples.




                                      53
2.    Controlling for other parameters.

    Of course, to make a more accurate assessment of the overall effect of
having an ESB, it is necessary to control for other factors that might have an
independent impact on bid outcomes. Our samples of ESB targets and non-
ESB targets may have different characteristics that may lead us to mis-
estimate the wealth effects of ESBs when we look only at simple averages.
To take an extreme example, if all ESB targets also had fair price provisions
and all non-ESB targets did not, and if fair price provisions had an
independent impact on either bid outcomes or bid returns, then some of the
effect that we attribute to ESBs should in fact be attributed to the fair price
provisions.
    If a bid is made, expected returns to shareholders equal:

     Prob (Acquisition by Initial Bidder) * E [Return STIB]

     + Prob (Acquisition by White Knight) * E [Return STWK]

     + Prob (Independence) * E [ Return conditional on no acquisition]

   Table 4 synthesizes the results reported earlier to display the differences
between ESBs and non-ESBs in the various elements that make up expected
returns:

 Notes: Event window is one month prior to bid announcement to nine
 months after bid announcement, and includes returns from subsequent
 acquisitions by other bidders.
 Probabilities and returns are calculated using the method of recycled
 predictions, and control for other factors, as described in Part IV.C.2, that
 may influence bid outcomes. Using simple means instead yields similar
 results.
 Model assumes that cash received at any time (e.g., at the completion of a
 bid) is reinvested at the risk-free rate (assumed to be 6%).

   Table 4 shows no statistically significant differences in the returns to
target shareholders by type of defense, conditional on a particular outcome


                                      55
being realized. However, the dramatic differences in likelihood of outcomes
yield substantial differences in the expected returns to target shareholders.
Using the window from one month prior to bid announcement to nine
months after bid announcement, the expected returns to target shareholders
when an ESB is not present are 41.6%, compared to 32.4% when an ESB is
present, a 9.2% difference in returns.
    We also estimated the difference in returns using the method of recycled
predictions. We ran a robust regression to predict nine-month returns,
including ESB as a dummy variable in the model and controlling for
variables that also might influence bid outcomes and bid returns.142 We then
predicted returns in two scenarios: one in which all ninety-two targets have
ESBs and one in which none of the ninety-two targets have ESBs. The results
of this analysis indicate that nine-month returns are 32.2% for our set of ESB
targets and 40.4% for our set of non-ESB targets, an 8.2% difference.
    Taken together, our calculations suggest that an ESB reduces target
shareholder returns on the order of 8-10% in the nine months after a hostile
bid is launched. This finding is consistent with studies showing that the
Massachusetts staggered board statute reduced the value of companies
incorporated in Massachusetts.143
    It is worth noting that the losses to shareholders we have estimated in
this Part are only those that are produced when bids are made. Because
ESBs greatly enhance the power of incumbents to resist hostile bids, they

negative (-0.08), consistent with our theory, but the standard error is sufficiently large
(0.10) that the variable is not statistically significant at 95% confidence. At least part of
the difficulty arises from the high variability of returns that arises from our relatively
long event window. Other commentators have noted the difficulties in examining stock
returns over long event windows. See, e.g., Brad M. Barber & John D. Lyon, Detecting

result, ESBs might also produce additional costs in terms of adverse ex ante
effects on managers’ behavior and performance. Studying and estimating
these ex ante effects is an important issue left for future empirical research.

                        V. DID SHAREHOLDERS CONSENT?

    We have thus far shown that ESBs are by far the most important takeover
defense mechanism in the market for corporate control and that they have a
substantial negative impact on the wealth of target shareholders. Defenders
of ESBs might nevertheless suggest that, whether ESBs are good or bad for
shareholders, ESBs received shareholder approval. An SB must be specified
in the charter in order to become an ESB, and a charter provision must be
specified either at the IPO stage (at which time shareholders would have
implicitly accepted the provision by purchasing the IPO shares) or through
midstream charter amendment (which requires a shareholder vote). In either
case, goes the argument, shareholders would have consented to the ESB.
    In this Part, however, we argue that even though all ESBs received formal
approval from shareholders, the potency of ESBs as an antitakeover device
was never genuinely consented to by the shareholders of the large majority
of companies that now have ESBs. Thus, the effects of ESBs that we
document were largely unintended by target shareholders when provisions
establishing staggered boards were included in corporate charters. To put it
more starkly, our argument is that, in most ESB companies, shareholders
could not have reasonably expected, when provisions establishing staggered
boards were adopted, that these provisions would subsequently gain the
powerful antitakeover significance that we have documented.144

                A. A Brief History of Takeovers and Staggered Boards:
                           From Inco to Moran to Time

   Before the invention of the poison pill, the staggered board was fairly
innocuous as a takeover defense. As described in Part III.A, a staggered

    144. The “mid-stream problem” resulting from the adoption of charter provisions
prior to the developments in takeover law that gave them substantial antitakeover
significance was highlighted in Bebchuk & Ferrell, supra note 46. We provide below
empirical evidence of the very substantial magnitude of the problem as far as charter
provisions establishing staggered boards are concerned. We believe the picture is
similar with respect to other kinds of antitakeover charter provisions. See also Lucian
Bebchuk & Assaf Hamdani, Optimal Defaults for Corporate Law Evolution, NW. U. L. REV.
(forthcoming 2002) (discussing the problem of mid-stream changes in takeover law);

board could not block a bidder from acquiring a control block and creating a
situation in which a board control shift would be inevitable. Given this
inevitability, a lame-duck incumbent board would resign rather than wait
through two elections. As a result, target boards were unable to use
staggered boards to block beneficial acquisitions of a controlling block.145
    The pre-pill era can itself be divided into two distinct periods. Before
Inco’s successful tender offer for ESB in 1974, hostile tender offers were
uncommon, particularly for large, established targets.146 Thus it is unlikely
that the staggered boards that were adopted prior to 1974 were adopted for
takeover defense reasons.147 Even after hostile bids became part of the
acceptable toolkit in 1974, neither shareholders nor managers could foresee
the advent of the pill, which would cut off the tender offer route and force
shareholders to depend on the ballot box as a safety valve against disloyal
managers. As a result, although true motives are difficult to discern,
managers typically proposed staggered boards before 1984 primarily for
board stability reasons and shareholders approved staggered boards in that
period primarily for board independence reasons, as described in Part II.C.1.
    From our sample of Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC)
companies,148 Figure 5 below shows that 6% of staggered boards were
installed pre-Inco, and another 17% were installed before Moran validated the
poison pill. Thus, roughly one-quarter of staggered boards in place today
were approved in a dramatically different takeover environment than
presently exists.149




    145. In fact, during this period, even deals that were not beneficial might have
succeeded. During the era before the poison pill, target shareholders ran the risk that if
they did not tender, they would be squeezed out in a back-end squeeze-out (at a lower
price) if the bidder won. See supra text accompanying notes 84-87. In fact, acquirers
during this era exploited this possibility through two-tier tender offers, cascading
tender offers, and other coercive tender offer structures. See Guhan Subramanian, A
New Takeover Defense Mechanism: Using an Equal Treatment Agreement as an Alternative to
the Poison Pill, 23 DEL. J. CORP. L. 375, 387-389 (1998).
    146. See BRUCE WASSERSTEIN, BIG DEAL 73 (1998). Morgan Stanley’s willingness to
represent Inco in its bid gave hostile bids a new respectability. See id.
    147. It is possible that some pre-Inco SBs were adopted to defend against pure
proxy fights, of the sort that were not uncommon in the 1950s. But proxy fights in that
era were rarely coupled with hostile takeover bids, such that the dynamics and likely
effects of those fights on target shareholder returns were vastly different than proxy
fights designed to facilitate takeover bids.
    148. Described in Part II.B, supra.
    149. Weighting by sales or net assets yields virtually the same breakdown of SB
timing.

    Moreover, while Moran changed the landscape, it initially appeared to
change it only slightly. After Moran, a bidder would have to use the ballot
box to gain control of the board, but an alternative, viable route to bid
success appeared to remain over and beyond the proxy mechanism because
of the qualified right for target boards to resist a hostile offer. The line of
cases beginning with Moran and proceeding through AC Acquisitions Corp.,150
Revlon,151 Interco,152 and Macmillan,153 all demonstrated that the right to resist
a hostile bid was not absolute, and suggested that Delaware courts would
continue to interpret a target board’s fiduciary duties so as to enable hostile
bids to succeed even without a proxy fight.
    Figure 5 shows that 53% of staggered boards were installed after Moran
but before Time. During this period, managers were no doubt motivated by
the threat of hostile takeover in proposing staggered boards. Shareholders,
meanwhile, generally approved staggered boards during this period because
a hostile bidder still had a viable route against a disloyal target board. When
a bidder made an offer that shareholders wanted, the case law suggested that
the Delaware courts would force a redemption of the pill if the target board
did not redeem the pill on its own.
    Time, of course, seemed to change all that. To many observers, Time
transformed what was a highly qualified right to use the pill into a
seemingly absolute right to “Just Say No.” Cases such as Wallace Computer
have shown that courts will allow incumbents to retain a pill and resist a

hostile bid indefinitely.154 Figure 5 shows that only a quarter of staggered
boards appeared post-Time, in the modern pill era. Even this figure
overstates the number of truly new staggered boards that appeared in the
1990s. Many staggered boards came from IPOs, where shareholder approval
was not necessary (for example, OfficeMax, Bed Bath & Beyond, Adobe).155
Many others came from spin-offs, a type of IPO where market discipline is
weakened by the fact that the pre-IPO “owner” is itself a public company
(for example, Aviall, spun off from Ryder).156 Finally, many others in the
sample came from mergers, in which the surviving company adopted the
staggered board in conjunction with the merger (for example, MCA, Morgan
Stanley/Dean Witter, Alumax). In these deals, the staggered board vote is
bundled with the merger vote, and shareholders do not have the ability to
vote in favor of the deal without also approving the staggered board.

                 B.   Assessing the Degree of Shareholder Consent

    The analysis in the previous Part suggests that shareholders in companies
that adopted ESBs before 1990—which is the vast majority of ESB companies
today—could not have reasonably contemplated when the ESBs were
adopted that subsequent legal developments would make them such a
strong antitakeover device. Indeed, although such predictions are inherently
speculative, we believe that if these shareholders had been asked to ratify the
ESBs of their companies after 1990, when the antitakeover significance of
ESBs became known, they would have most likely refused to do so.
    The reason for this prediction is that, as documented in Part II.D,
midstream companies have been largely unable to obtain shareholder
approval for staggered boards since 1990. In fact, quite the opposite,
institutional investors have been increasingly proposing, and shareholders
have been increasingly voting for, precatory resolutions calling for de-
staggering the board. This evidence suggests that shareholders of companies
that adopted ESBs pre-1990 would generally vote against having staggered
boards if the issue were presented to them post-Time.
    It might be argued that the preferences of the shareholders of companies
with pre-1990 ESBs can be inferred not from their opposition to midstream
adoption of staggered boards in the 1990s, but rather from the fact that many
shareholders continue to buy shares in companies that went public in the
1990s with a staggered board. One of us, in other work, documents the


   154. See supra text accompanying notes 68-73.
   155. See Coates, supra note 2 (documenting the increase in staggered boards among
IPO companies).
   156. See Daines & Klausner, supra note 2.


                                        60
growing trend in staggered board incidence in IPO companies during the
1990s.157 However, in the case of these 1990s IPOs, the IPO price might have
at least partly reflected the presence of strong antitakeover defenses, and the
IPO price thus might have at least partly compensated public shareholders
for the adverse effects of an ESB on their interests.158 In the case of pre-1990
ESBs, shareholders presumably could not have been compensated at the time
the ESBs were adopted for the current, then unanticipated, antitakeover
significance of the ESB-pill combination.
     Thus, if shareholders of companies that adopted ESBs prior to 1990 were
asked post-1990 to ratify the antitakeover use of their ESB, the choices that
they would have been confronted with would have been most similar to
those of shareholders that would have been asked in the 1990s to approve
amending the charter to establish an ESB. This comparison, if correct,
strongly suggests that shareholders of most ESB companies today have never
given genuine consent to the powerful antitakeover device currently
provided by ESBs—and would not have given such consent if provided an
opportunity to express their views on the matter.
     To summarize, in the vast majority of companies that have staggered
boards today, the presence of strong antitakeover protections cannot be
grounded in genuine shareholder consent. Rather, it is largely the
unintended consequence of two unrelated sets of events: uninformed
approval of staggered boards by shareholders when staggered boards had
little impact on hostile bids, and a series of fact-specific court decisions that
increasingly channeled hostile bids into the ballot box route. For lawmakers,
this state of affairs should seem unsatisfying, to say the least. This concern,
however, would be addressed by the approach to takeover law that we put
forward in the next Part.


    157. See Coates, supra note 2, at 1353, 1376; sources cited supra note 2.
    158. Of course, a question remains as to why pre-IPO owners have chosen in the
1990s to include ESBs in IPO charters. One of us, in the same work cited above, argues
that law firm characteristics play a key role in determining the antitakeover provisions
that are installed at the IPO stage. See Coates, supra note 2, at 1370-75. Another possible
(not mutually exclusive) explanation is that takeover defenses may not be adequately
priced in the secondary market. See Lucian Bebchuk, Freedom of Contract and the
Corporation: An Essay on the Mandatory Role of Corporate Law, Discussion Paper No.
46, Program in Law and Economics, Harvard Law School (1988); Daines & Klausner,
supra note 2. Yet another explanatory factor is that, when private benefits of control are
correlated with firm value and firm value is better known to owners than to public
investors, owners will have incentives to choose excessive levels of protection for
private benefits in order to avoid an inference by public investors that their firm is of
low value. See Lucian Bebchuk, Asymmetric Information and Corporate Governance
(2002) (unpublished manuscript, on file with authors). An analysis of the imperfections
of the IPO process is, of course, beyond the scope of the current project.

                     VI. IMPLICATIONS FOR TAKEOVER LAW

    In view of the powerful antitakeover impact and negative wealth effects
of ESBs, and the common absence of genuine shareholder approval for these
arrangements, we now turn to discuss how takeover law should approach
them. We focus on the corporate law of Delaware, the most important law
domicile for U.S. corporations, and on solutions that can be implemented
taking as given the existing structure of Delaware case law. In Part VI.A we
describe our recommended approach in the absence of a genuine opt-out by
shareholders. We then address the question of whether shareholders should
be allowed to opt-out of such a regime.

             A. Redeeming Pills Following Defeat in One Election

    The basic approach we propose can be stated simply: Courts should not
allow managers to continue blocking a takeover bid after they lose one
election conducted over an acquisition offer. Note that without an ESB, no
court intervention is necessary in order to achieve this outcome. If managers
of a non-ESB target are defeated in one election, the bidder will gain control
of the board and will be able to redeem the pill and consummate the bid.
However, with an ESB, in the absence of a court order to redeem the pill,
incumbents will be able to retain independence even after losing one election
over one third of the directors. Under our proposal, after the loss of one
election that is effectively a referendum on the offer, incumbents should be
required to redeem the pill and allow the bidder (whose offer has received
shareholder support) to proceed with its bid.
    Compared to other ways of reducing the power of ESBs that we have
considered, our recommended approach has several advantages. First, our
approach sits well with the basic principles of existing Delaware case law. In
fact, we argue that our approach is called for by these principles once the
special antitakeover power of ESBs is recognized. Second, and following
from the first point, our approach requires no legislative intervention and
can be easily implemented by the courts. Third, our approach involves
minimal disruption to the existing corporate governance regime, because it
prevents ESBs from having adverse and unwarranted antitakeover effects
without undermining the other, non-takeover reasons for board
classification. In the remainder of this Part we discuss each of these points in
turn.




                                      62
1.   Consistency with fundamental principles of Delaware case law.

    First, even if our approach represents a departure from current trends, we
believe that it better reflects the fundamental principles of the Delaware case
law. An important factual assumption of current takeover jurisprudence has
been the existence of a ballot box safety valve against incumbents who abuse
the power to maintain the pill. However, as we have shown theoretically
and confirmed empirically, this assumption is incorrect in the case of targets
with ESBs. Because of the illusory nature of the ballot box safety valve
against ESB targets, the fundamental principles of takeover law justify (if not
require) courts’ intervention to order managers to redeem the pill following
one proxy contest’s defeat.
    To see why, begin with Unocal, which allows managers to engage in
defensive action only as long as they maintain balance and “proportionality”
in relation to the perceived threat from the hostile bidder.159 Once it is
understood that the ballot box route is hardly viable against an ESB target,
maintaining a pill after a shareholder referendum in favor of the bidder can
be readily construed as disproportionate to the threat posed. Thus, once the
consequences of an ESB are fully recognized, our approach could be viewed
as an application of the “intermediate” standard of review announced in
Unocal.
    Our approach is also consistent with Moran, which states that directors
should not use a pill to “arbitrarily reject” an offer made by a hostile
bidder.160 Refusing to concede after losing an informed shareholder
referendum on a bid could fairly be considered “arbitrary,” and thus within
this intent. More generally, while Moran reserves for the court the right to
order the redemption of the pill when appropriate circumstances arise,
courts have historically declined to use this power, in large part due to their
belief that the ballot box safety valve is a viable check against excessive
abuse. Once it is recognized that the ballot box route may not be a viable
check against disloyal directors of ESB targets, a court-ordered redemption
of the pill after the loss of one proxy contest over the bid would be a sensible
use of Moran’s mandate.
    Our approach is also consistent with Unitrin. Even though this case is
known for giving especially strong support to defensive tactics, it still
maintains that such tactics cannot be “preclusive” and must fall within a



    159. Under Unocal, the Delaware Supreme Court outlined a two-prong analysis:
First, the target board must have some basis for concluding that the hostile bid poses a
threat to the company; and second, the defensive measure “must be reasonable in
relation to the threat posed.” Unocal, 493 A.2d at 955.
    160. See Moran, 500 A.2d at 1354.


                                          63
“range of reasonableness.”161 Given our finding that not a single bidder in
the second half of the 1990s won two elections against incumbents protected
by an ESB,162 our proposed approach flows directly from Unitrin’s
requirement that a target’s defensive response not “preclude” hostile bids.
Our analysis suggests that, unless managers are allowed to use a pill-ESB
combination to force only one election rather than two, the pill-ESB
combination becomes preclusive. Our approach is also consistent with
Unitrin’s requirement that a target’s defensive response fall within a “range
of reasonableness”: For a target board to continue to maintain a poison pill
in place after losing an election fought over a given bid—with the full
opportunity that such a vote provides for target directors to articulate why
the bid is not in the interest of shareholders generally—can readily be
characterized as unreasonable.
    In short, by focusing on the fact that a target has already lost an initial
proxy contest in the context of a given bid, our approach provides a way for
Delaware courts to create boundaries on the scope of “Just Say No” in a way
that is consistent with existing jurisprudence on the issue.163 It is helpful to
note that our approach would not differ in terms of the actual holding,
though it would differ in reasoning, from Wallace Computer. Recall that in
that case a federal district court, applying Delaware corporate law, refused to
order managers armed with an ESB and a pill to redeem the pill even though
more than 70% of the shareholders had tendered into the offer. Although we
would not be inclined (unlike the Wallace court) to allow managers to retain
the pill indefinitely, our approach would not call for judicial intervention at
the point at which such intervention was requested in Wallace. Under our
approach attracting enough tenders would not be sufficient to require
redemption of the pill—there needs to be a shareholder vote as well.164 Only
after incumbents have lost an election fought over a bid should they be
required to redeem the pill.




    161. The second prong of the Unocal test was elaborated in Unitrin to mean that a
defense could be neither preclusive nor coercive, and must otherwise fall in a “range of
reasonableness.” Unitrin, 651 A.2d at 1387-88.

only through tender decisions is necessary for a hostile takeover, see Bebchuk, supra
note 80; Bebchuk & Hart, supra note 86.


                                           64
2.   Legislative intervention not required.

    Because our approach is consistent with the basic principles of existing
jurisprudence, it could be implemented by the Delaware courts without the
need for legislative intervention. We believe that this feature makes it more
attainable at a practical level. In other work, two of us have independently
shown that the passage of antitakeover legislation helps states attract and
retain incorporations.165 To the extent that the Delaware courts are less
influenced by the desire to attract incorporations than are state legislatures,
courts may be more likely to take steps that, although highly warranted,
would have the effect of reducing the level of protection from takeovers.
    In addition to this practical benefit, a judicial solution would also have a
substantive benefit over a legislative approach. A legislative solution would
most likely involve the elimination of SBs from the menu of options. As
discussed in Part II.C.1, however, there may be legitimate, non-takeover
related reasons to have SBs. A judicial approach would preserve these
benefits by requiring redemption of the pill only after the incumbent board
has lost one election to a hostile bidder. Outside the context of a hostile
takeover, SBs would continue to function as they do at present. Therefore, a
judicial solution would address the problems we have identified in a more
targeted way than a legislative solution.

3.   Substantial consequences with minimal disruption.

    At first sight, this targeted solution may seem so minimalist as to have
limited practical significance. After all, only one hostile bidder in our sample
period, and to the best of our knowledge only five hostile bidders ever, have
won a first proxy contest conducted over their bid against an ESB: Moore
against Wallace Computer, Carson Pirie Scott against Younkers, U.S. Surgical
against Circon; Boston Bank of Commerce against Carver Bancorp; and
Weyerhaeuser against Willamette.166 Among these five bids, one was
eventually sold to the initial bidder (Willamette), two were sold to another
bidder within a few months after the hostile bidder withdrew (Circon and
Younkers), and two (Wallace Computer and Carver Bancorp) remained
independent after losing a first proxy contest. Therefore, it might be argued
that our approach would have practical significance for only a small number
of cases.
    However, this argument misses the point that all the actions of bidders

    165. See sources cited supra note 30
    166. Circon occurred during the period we study, Wallace Computer and Younkers
occurred before it, and Willamette and Carver Bancorp occurred since the end of this
period.


                                         65
and targets in all takeover contests occur against the background of the
ultimate powers and threats available to the parties. With a non-ESB target,
the viability of the ballot box route influences outcomes not only in those
cases in which the bidder actually wins a ballot box victory but also in those
cases in which incumbents proceed to a negotiated sale because they know
that they would not be able to block an offer that would enjoy shareholder
support. Similarly, with an ESB target, the outcome is not only affected in
the few instances in which the bidder wins the first election and then gives
up. It is also affected in the larger number of cases in which bidders give up
earlier against an ESB knowing how difficult and costly a ballot box victory
would have to be.
    In our sample, the “shadow of the law” has influenced the outcome of
hostile bids against all forty-five ESB targets.167 In particular, it has allowed
twenty-seven of those targets to remain independent in the short run and
twenty-one to remain independent in the longer-term—a much larger
fraction than in the case of non-ESB targets. Thus, while our approach
would call for judicial intervention only when a bidder wins a proxy contest,
it would influence the outcomes of bids against all ESB targets.
    In effect, our approach would convert ESB targets into EAT targets for
takeover purposes—targets for which the board could be fully ousted but
only at the next annual meeting. By doing so, our approach would revitalize
the ballot box safety valve against ESB targets. This safety valve would
ensure that managers are unable to pursue a course of action that does not
ultimately have shareholder support. Our approach targets precisely the
antitakeover feature of ESBs while leaving intact other features of SBs that
may be desirable for non-takeover-related reasons.168 Thus our proposal is
both significant (by influencing the “shadow” negotiation that occurs in
every hostile bid contest) and minimally disruptive (by preserving existing
board structures and allowing staggered boards when they are justified by
other business considerations).

                       B.   The Permissibility of Opt-Out

   The question arises, as is often the case in corporate law policy
discussions, whether and to what extent opting out should be allowed.
Should companies be permitted to opt out of our approach by adopting a
charter provision that explicitly authorizes boards to maintain a pill even
when they lose one proxy contest fought over an acquisition offer?
   The question of contractual freedom has been extensively debated

elsewhere169 and is beyond the scope of our project. For those who believe in
completely unfettered contractual freedom, the answer is necessarily that
companies should be allowed to opt into any arrangement that receives
shareholder approval. This is not our view, nor has it been the view of
corporate law in general or of takeover jurisprudence in particular.
Corporate law does not offer companies an unlimited choice. Rather, it
offers a certain menu of options from which companies may choose.170 Thus,
the question is whether the arrangement currently offered by an ESB-poison
pill combination is one that should be part of the menu from which
companies may choose.
    Our analysis suggests that the ESB antitakeover device is one that might
not be worth including in a limited optimal menu of choices—even if one
wants to include in this menu some options that provide managers with a
greater veto power than an EAT provides. We say “if” because the question
of board veto power is one on which there are different views.171 However,
even someone who wishes to include in the menu options that provide
greater, even far greater, veto power than provided by an EAT would be
well advised to do it through arrangements other than the two-election
staggered board device.
    One way to expand veto power would be to expand the duration of terms
to which directors may be elected—an arrangement allowing directors to be
elected for a period of X years, where X is greater than one, the current
maximum level. Another way to expand veto power would be to enable
votes on the election of directors to take place only after Y months have
elapsed since the making of the bid. The first type of arrangement would
provide directors with a certain guaranteed time after they are elected. The
second type of arrangement would provide directors with a certain
guaranteed period of Y months after a bid is made to prepare and

    170. To take just one of many examples, companies may choose whether
shareholders can act before the annual election or only at the annual election, but
companies must hold an election every year and may not opt-out from this requirement.
Similarly, companies may have elections each year for fewer than all of the directors,
but most states limit the number of classes in which the board may be staggered. See
supra text accompanying notes 10-13.

communicate alternatives to shareholders. But both arrangements, however
much time they provide, would enable a hostile bidder to have at some point
a one-time, up-or-down referendum on its acquisition offer.
    In contrast, such a one-time, up-or-down referendum on acquisition
offers is never possible, as we have shown, under the current ESB
arrangement. While reasons can be given for providing mangers with a
certain amount of guaranteed time under one of the two types of
arrangements above, there is, in our view, no good reason to prevent bidders
from ever getting a one-time referendum on an offer. Even if providing
incumbents with greater veto power is desired, there are better ways to do so
than through the frictional, ill-functioning arrangement of two votes, one
year apart. For this reason, the menu of offered options should not include
an arrangement under which a hostile bidder would have to win two
elections, one year apart, in order to gain control.

                              VII. CONCLUSION

    Effective staggered boards are the most powerful antitakeover device in
the current arsenal of takeover defense weapons. An ESB prevents a hostile
bidder, no matter when it emerges, from gaining control of the target unless
it can wait at least fourteen months and win two elections that are far apart
in time. Because of these impediments, the ballot box route becomes illusory
against an ESB target.
    We find strong empirical support for this view of ESBs.                ESBs
substantially increase the likelihood that a target receiving a hostile bid will
remain independent. We find that the increased odds of remaining
independent are quite costly for target shareholders, without providing
sufficient countervailing benefits in terms of higher acquisition premiums.
We estimate that an ESB reduces the expected return of target shareholders
in the nine months after a hostile bid is launched on the order of 8-10%. The
negative wealth effect associated with ESBs is particularly problematic from
a policy perspective because the majority of staggered boards were
established before the judicial developments that gave them their
antitakeover potency.
    We put forward an approach that courts could follow to address these
problems. Specifically, we propose that target managers should not be
permitted to maintain a pill after losing a first proxy contest against a hostile
bidder. Although our proposal seems to go against the current trend in
Delaware case law that is solidifying and expanding the “Just Say No”
defense, it would in fact best serve the principles and concerns underlying
proportionality review under Unocal. Essentially, our proposal would
revitalize the ballot box route, which the Delaware courts have relied on so

heavily in developing takeover jurisprudence, but whose existence is
currently illusory for companies with ESBs.
   Our approach would eliminate the entrenching effects of ESBs by
addressing both the minimum delay problem and the two-election problem.
Furthermore, our approach could be implemented easily by courts, without
requiring legislative change or forgoing the non-antitakeover benefits that
staggered boards might provide. This approach could, with little cost and
judicial intervention, contribute significantly to shareholder welfare and to a
healthier and more efficient acquisition market.
