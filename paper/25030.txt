Understanding Joint Retirement

                                          ABSTRACT

Evidence from different sources shows that spouses' retirement decisions are correlated.
Retirement policies affecting individuals in couples are therefore also likely to affect behavior of
their spouses. It is therefore important to account for joint features in modeling retirement. This
paper studies a structural collective model of labor supply and retirement of both partners in a
couple with interdependent preferences, imperfect knowledge of preferences of the spouse, and
subjective expectations about the future. We propose a novel method to estimate preferences and
the intra-household bargaining process, which relies on stated preferences data collected in the
Health and Retirement Study. Respondents were asked to choose between hypothetical retirement
trajectories describing the retirement ages and replacement rates of both spouses from three
perspectives: considering their own preferences only, the preferences of their spouse only, or the
most likely decision for the household. With these data, all model parameters are identified and
potential sources of joint retirement can be disentangled. We find that males misperceive their
wives' preferences, overestimating their disutility of work. Our estimates correct for this bias.
They suggest that correlation in unobserved heterogeneity components of the partners' marginal
utility of leisure explains a large share of joint retirement decisions. We also find significant
positive complementarities in leisure, but this explains a much smaller part of joint retirement.

1 Introduction
Population aging has led to a debate on the labor force participation of older workers, increas-


ing the need for understanding retirement decisions and their sensitivity for policy measures.


Earlier studies often only focus on the retirement behavior of males, due to the fact that


women often left the labor market long before reaching retirement age. Since the labor force


participation rate of women has grown substantially over the last decades, understanding


their retirement decisions has gained importance.      Moreover, there is clear evidence that


the retirement decisions within couples are interdependent, with a signicant proportion of


spouses retiring at approximately the same time, irrespective of their age dierence (joint


retirement). Hurd (1989) already pointed out that between 20 and 30 percent of all couples


retire within one year of each other. Since then, a new line of research has emerged aimed


at analyzing and understanding the retirement behavior of couples.       Empirical evidence of


joint retirement decisions has been documented for several cohorts and countries, including


Blau (1998) (Retirement History Study), Gustman and Steinmeier (2000) (National Longitu-


dinal Survey of Mature Women), Gustman and Steinmeier (2004) and Casanova Rivas (2010)


(Health and Retirement Study), Banks et al. (2007) (English Longitudinal Study of Ageing),


and Hospido and Zamarro (2014) (Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe).


   There are several potential links between spouses' retirement decisions that may explain


joint retirement. The rst one operates through the household budget constraint (see Blau


(1998); Casanova Rivas (2010)). Casanova Rivas (2010) shows that under certain conditions,


the fact that resources are shared can increase the probability of joint retirement. In addi-


tion, the spouse allowance in the US old age social security benet system creates nancial


incentives that explain coordination in retirement dates (see McCarty (1990)). The second


channel originates from preferences: It is plausible that spouses enjoy spending leisure time


together so that the marginal utility of retirement increases when the partner is also retired




                                               2
(complementarities in leisure, leading to a causal eect of the retirement of one spouse on


retirement of the other spouse; see Gustman and Steinmeier (2000, 2004, 2009), Stancanelli


and van Soest (2016) or Michaud and Vermeulen (2011)). The third channel is the correlation


in spouses' (unobserved) tastes for leisure (See Gustman and Steinmeier (2000, 2004)) that


can be due to assortative matching. The literature has not come to a clear conclusion on the


relative importance of these three channels, but does conclude that ignoring joint retirement


may severely underestimate the overall impact of reforms in retirement policy. For example,


Coile (2004) nds that neglecting the spill-over eect on the behavior of the spouse may


underestimate the overall impact of a typical policy by 13% to 20%.


      To model joint behavior, the collective model empirically outperforms the neo-classical


unitary model assuming that each household behaves as a single decision maker, both for con-


sumption and labor supply behavior (Fortin and Lacroix (1997), Bourguignon et al. (1993),


Cherchye et al. (2009)). The collective model (Chiappori (1988)) starts from the basic assump-


tion that in a multi-person household, household members have their own utility functions


but cooperate in some bargaining process that results in a Pareto-ecient allocation. The as-


sumption of cooperation seems quite natural, given that spouses interact very often.
                                                                                              1 Several


studies found support for the collective model in the sense that its theoretical implications


cannot be rejected when tested on multi-person household data (Chiappori et al. (2002),


Cherchye et al. (2009)). Yet, some assumptions of that model remain untested. In particular,


it is assumed that each spouse knows the preferences of the other spouse and therefore can


correctly pick a Pareto optimal outcome. To the best of our knowledge, no study has tested


this assumption.


      A major challenge of the collective model is the identication of parameters in a realistic


context with externalities and public goods. Additional identifying assumptions are usually

  1
    Gustman and Steinmeier (2000) and several follow-up studies estimate a structural retirement model of
joint retirement assuming noncooperative behavior and Nash bargaining.



                                                   3
needed in order to estimate the model and test its validity.     Chiappori (1988, 1992) shows


that if preferences are egoistic, the usual data on actual household choices are enough to


identify the sharing rule up to a constant. The assumption of egoistic preference, however,


is rather restrictive in the context of retirement, since it means that the marginal rate of


substitution (MRS) between own leisure and consumption remains the same regardless of


the spouse's labor supply and therefore does not allow for complementarities (externalities)


of leisure activities - one of the possible explanations for joint retirement.   Many activities


such as taking meals or traveling on holidays will usually be more enjoyable when they can


be done together with the spouse. A natural assumption for older couples is therefore that


the marginal utility of own leisure depends on leisure of the spouse, that is, preferences are


interdependent (See Gustman and Steinmeier (2000, 2004, 2009); Michaud and Vermeulen


(2011)).   Michaud and Vermeulen (2011) allow for complementarities in leisure, identifying


the model by making use of panel data with couples and individuals who became a widow(er)


in the observation period, along with the assumption that an individual's preferences can only


change after the death of the spouse.


    Models of joint retirement behavior also typically assume that expectations regarding


the future are rational (Blau, 1998; Gustman and Steinmeier, 2000). A large literature has


studied how expectations regarding mortality, health and other risks deviate from rational


expectations in the general population and these deviations are predictive of behavior (Hurd,


2009). Manski (2004) argues that direct measurement of expectations and their inclusion in


behavioral models is desirable in order to make inferences about preferences. Yet, we know


of no application of collective models which uses subjective expectations on risks (longevity,


disability, etc).


    The main contribution of the current paper is to provide a novel approach to obtain identi-


cation of a general version of the collective model for labor supply and retirement in a context


that allows for subjective (and not necessarily rational) expectations and imperfect knowledge



                                               4
of preferences of the spouse. Specic to this model is that it avoids imposing restrictions on


individual preferences such as egoistic preferences: externalities and public goods are both


allowed to enter the individual utility functions. The paper solves the identication problem


by using stated preferences (SP) data, aimed at directly identifying the main components of


the model. Survey respondents were oered several pairs of simplied retirement trajectories.


They were asked to choose between two trajectories three times: rst only accounting for


their own preferences, then using only their spouse's preferences, and nally they were asked


what would be the most likely choice of their household, accounting for both individuals'


preferences as well as the decision-making process in their household.      As in Kapteyn and


Kooreman (1992), the rich SP data directly helps to estimate the individual utility functions


and demand for leisure equations that can be used to identify all preference parameters. The


answers to the question on the most likely choice in the household then identies the house-


hold decision process and, in particular, the weights of both partner's utility functions for the


household choice.


   The method of Stated Preferences has been commonly used in marketing and transporta-


tion sciences for many years (see, e.g., Louviere et al. (2000)), and is gaining ground in


economics since Barsky et al. (1997) and Revelt and Train (1998). Elsayed et al. (2018) and


Van Soest and Vonkova (2014) apply stated preferences to labor supply and retirement de-


cisions of individuals. The latter motivate the use of SP data from the fact that they want


to analyze preferences for plans that do not yet exist (e.g., retirement after the mandatory


retirement age). Moreover, it is often not clear which alternative retirement scenarios workers


can choose in real life, when not only the rules of their pension plan but also limited exibil-


ity of their employer may restrict their actual choice set in ways that remain unobserved in


the data. Moreover, the actual choice set depends on labor market history and is therefore


potentially endogenous to the individual's labor supply preferences. Stated preference data


allow for a design where choice opportunities are exactly known, and variation in choices is



                                               5
substantial and by construction exogenous to preferences. In the current study, an additional


strong argument for using SP data is that, as discussed above, with revealed preferences only,


not all the parameters of interest can be identied.


   The SP data are collected for a subsample of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).


They are used to estimate a stylized structural model of labor supply and retirement of both


partners.   Our main ndings are the following.      We nd that males have a biased view of


their wives' labour supply preferences, overestimating their disutility of work.       We correct


for this bias in the model. We nd signicant complementarities in leisure and unobserved


heterogeneity in determining joint retirement. The dierence between the male and female's


wage rate signicantly aects the bargaining weights, conrming that the unitary model is


rejected against the collective model. Simulations based upon the estimates (that corrects for


the biased perception of partner preferences) suggest that correlation in unobserved hetero-


geneity components of the two partner's marginal utility of leisure can explain a large share


(almost half ) of joint retirement decisions. We also nd signicant positive complementarities


in leisure, but this explains a much smaller part of joint retirement.


   The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 uses a simple example to


illustrate the idea of identication in a stylized collective model. Section 3 describes the sample


and our SP data. The empirical specication of the structural collective model is discussed


in Section 4. The estimation results are discussed in Section 5. Section 6 presents the results


of some simulation exercises, validating the SP data by comparing simulated retirement ages


with data on expected retirement ages of the same individuals, and then using counterfactual


simulations to indicate how complementarities in leisure and correlation between preferences


of the two partners contribute to joint retirement outcomes. Section 7 concludes.

2 Identication: A Simple Illustration
We consider a simple example of a static (one time period) collective labor supply model


for couples consisting of a man (m) and a woman (f ). For                           j = m, f , lj   denotes individual


j 's   leisure. We work with one aggregate consumption good with price normalized to 1; its


amount is denoted by          c.   Consumption is assumed to be public, in the sense that it gives


utility to both spouses. The time endowment for each individual is denoted by                             T.    The wage


rates are    wm   and   wf   and   y   is the household's non-labor income.              Y   represents full household


income given by      Y = (wm + wf )T + y .             In the general framework, individual             j 's   preferences


are represented by a utility function            Uj (lm , lf , c; z)   where   z   is a vector of taste shifters.


       Under the assumption of the collective model that the couple reaches a Pareto-ecient


equilibrium (Chiappori (1988)), there exists a weighting factor                        λ   such that   (lm , lf , c)   solves


the following maximization problem:




                                              max λUm + (1 − λ)Uf                                                        (1)
                                             (lm ,lf ,c)


       subject to the budget constraint




                                              c + wm lm + wf lf ≤ Y                                                      (2)




       The weight   λ can be a function of wm , wf , y           and other variables         d (called the distribution

factors).


       This general collective model cannot be identied from the usual data on labor supply of


both partners and consumption. Identication relies on additional assumptions such as some


type of separability restrictions (see Chiappori (1988, 1992)). For example, identication can


be achieved if preferences are assumed to depend on consumption and own leisure only, and


not on leisure of the partner. As we discussed before, such egoistic preferences are restrictive,




                                                             7
especially for older couples. In this paper, we will therefore not impose such an assumption


and allow for interdependent preferences instead of imposing egoistic preferences.


   More generally, we avoid any additional assumptions but instead collect additional data


to identify the model. To illustrate this idea, we will use a simple example. The arguments of


each utility function are   q = (lm , lf , c)   and we normalize   T   to 1. We assume that preferences


can be represented by a Stone-Geary type direct utility function, with constant returns to


scale and zero subsistence levels:




                       um (q) = αm ln lm + αf ln lf + (1 − αm − αf )lnc                             (3)



                        uf (q) = βm ln lm + βf ln lf + (1 − βm − βf )lnc                            (4)



   The collective model implies that the household bargaining process results in a Pareto


ecient allocation, solving




                                 max uj (q) = λum (q) + (1 − λ)uf (q)                               (5)
                                   q



   subject to the budget constraint




                                          c + wm lm + wf lf ≤ Y                                     (6)




   It is straightforward to show that this gives the following demands for leisure:




                                       wm lm = (λαm + (1 − λ)βm )Y                                  (7)




                                       wf lf = (λαf + (1 − λ)βf )Y                                  (8)



   Let us consider the case where the bargaining weights do not depend on wage rates or




                                                      8
non-labor income      y,   and the weight of the husband is given by




                                              λ = γ0 + d0 γ                                       (9)




   The equations for male and female leisure can then be written as:




                                 wm lm = (d0 γ(αm − βm ) + γ0 + βm )Y                            (10)



                                   wf lf = (d0 γ(αf − βf ) + γ0 + βf )Y                          (11)



   It is easy to see that the parameters in these equations are not identied if only actual


behavior (c, lm , lf , wm , wf , z ) is observed  It is necessary to x (for example)   γ0   and the


scale of the vector   γ.   Kapteyn and Kooreman (1992) emphasize the same problem in a static


labor supply model. They propose to use stated preferences on desired working hours by each


individual to identify all the parameters. Our approach will be similar in spirit  we collect


and use stated preference data that help identication. In our example, suppose respondents


report how many hours respondents would like to work themselves and how many hours they


would like their partner to work, accounting for their own preferences only and not for those


of their spouse. For males, this would be the outcome of the collective model in the case of


male dictatorship (    λ = 1);    for females, it would correspond to female dictatorship (   λ = 0).

The information provided by male respondents can be used to estimate the parameters               αm

and   αf   of the male utility function, using the two leisure demand equations




                                             wm lm = αm Y                                        (12)



                                              wf lf = αf Y                                       (13)



   Similarly, he information for female respondents can be used to estimate the parameters




                                                    9
βm   and   βf   of the female utility function, using the equations




                                            wm lm = βm Y                                        (14)



                                             wf lf = βf Y                                       (15)



     Finally, if we have data on actual labor supply (as in Kooreman and Kapteyn (1990)) or


ask the respondents to also report the most likely actual outcome for the household, it is easy


to see from (10) and (11) that the bargaining the parameters (γ0 ,        γ)   are also identied. In


particular, this also identies the intercept   γ0   which is not identied in the collective models


of Chiappori (1988, 1992); Chiappori et al. (2002). This intercept is needed to interpret the


estimation results in terms of the bargaining power of each partner.


     The example shows that stated preferences on what individuals in couples would do if


they were the only decision makers, that is, in case of male or female dictatorship, lead to


information to identify parameters in the collective model that cannot be identied by revealed


preferences alone.      In this paper, we exploit this idea in the context of an inter-temporal


(multiple time periods) model explaining retirement decisions.         We will use information on


survey respondents' stated choices among dierent hypothetical joint retirement trajectories


(retirement ages and corresponding earnings and pension income for both partners) based on


their own preferences and based upon their spouses' preferences. To identify the bargaining


weight, we will then also use the answers to the question on the most likely outcome for the


couple.

3 Data
Our module of SP questions was included in the 2011 Internet Survey (2011-IS)
                                                                                     2 of the Health


and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS is an ongoing longitudinal biennial socio-economic


survey of the U.S. population aged 50 years and older and their spouses, conducted by the


Institute for Survey Research at the University of Michigan. The 2011-IS is developed jointly


by the HRS, the Survey Research Center (SRC) and the Institute for Social Research (ISR)


at the University of Michigan, and the RAND Corporation.               It is the fth in a series of


surveys administrated over the Internet to a sub-sample of HRS respondents with Internet


access in years where the HRS respondents do not get the regular HRS interviews.               Over


the years, the HRS Internet has had many experimental question modules covering a large


variety of topics including, for example, subjective probabilities (Delavande and Rohwedder,


2008), early childhood health histories (Smith, 2011), health literacy (Levy et al., 2015), and


household nancial assets (Couper et al., 2013).


      In the subsample selected for the questions on joint retirement, we only selected respon-


dents in couples who were doing paid work themselves or whose partner did paid work. The


number of respondents participating was 779, but we only use the observations where both


respondent and spouse were younger than 62. This is because scenarios were phrased dier-


ently in other cases and because we want to use expected work limiting health problems as a


covariate. Moreover, we removed some observations with missing information on important


variables (subjective survival probabilities, whether the respondent or their partner has a


work limiting health problem, the probability that they will have such a problem at age 62,


job satisfaction; missing wage rates were imputed). This leaves a nal sample of 604 couples,


with 280 male and 324 female respondents.

      Summary statistics of the explanatory variables for the male and female partners in the


households of the 604 survey respondents in our nal sample are given in Table 1. The average


ages of males and females are 56.4 and 54.5 years, respectively. The age dierence between


spouses has a standard deviation of 4.72 and an interquartile range of 4 years. Almost the


same fraction of males and females have a college degree (44% of men and 42% of women).


Satisfaction with the current job is included in the model since it may aect the marginal


utility of leisure (as opposed to working). The fraction of men and women who are satised


(or very satised) with their job is almost the same (75%). Males somewhat less often report


to have a work limiting health problem (7% versus 9%).             On the other hand, the average


subjective probability of a work limitation at age 62 is very similar for both genders (40%


and 39%). Since subjective survival probabilities until age 75 depend on current age, Table 1


does not present the reported probabilities themselves, but their ratio to the (gender specic)


objective survival probabilities according to Human Mortality Database (www.mortality.org).


      Males earn higher hourly wages than females.         Accordingly, the log of the wage ratio


(male's wage rate divided by female's wage rate), which is used in the model as a determinant


of within household bargaining power, has a positive mean of 0.242 and substantial variation


around this mean, with a standard deviation 0.753 and an interquartile range of 0.908.


      We designed six hypothetical and stylized retirement trajectories. All the scenarios are


in terms of income-hours combinations for both partners over the remaining part of the life


cycle after the respondent has reached a given age. All scenarios are designed to be realistic,


in the sense that they are broadly similar to the choice opportunities individuals and couples


can encounter in real life. Respondents were explicitly asked to assume that their employers


will cooperate with each scenario.

   Figure 1 gives a screen shot of an example of a retirement trajectory of the couple, i.e., both


for the respondent (top panel) and the respondent's partner (bottom panel). The respondent's


remaining life time from age 62 was divided into three periods: 62-65, 65-68, and beyond 68.


This remains the same for all scenarios; these ages were chosen since transition rates into


retirement tend to peak at these ages. For the partner, we use the same division in calendar


time. In Figure 1, the partner is two years younger than the respondent, so if the respondent


is, for example, in the age bracket 6568, then the partner is (roughly) in the age bracket


6366.


   Initial hours of work were always set to the respondent's and partner's actual working hours


before (partial) retirement (40 hours per week for both respondent and partner in Figure 1).


Once they are fully retired, individuals get a pension corresponding to a proportion of their


last earnings (Replacement Rate (RR). During partial retirement, their disposable income is


a combination of earnings and pension. On the screen, we present the corresponding total


replacement rate (disposable income during partial or full retirement as a fraction of pre-


retirement disposable income). In the example of Figure 1, the respondent retires partially


at age 65, reducing working hours from 40 to 24 per week, with a total replacement rate of


100% (earnings plus partial pension). The respondent fully retires at age 68, after which the


replacement rate is 75%.     The respondent's partner reties at age 63 (when the respondent


turns 65), with a replacement rate of 75%. There is no partial retirement for the partner.


   Variation in replacement rates was created by randomly varying them across the sample.


More precisely, respondents are divided into ve groups indicated by      G1 , G2 , G3 , G4   and   G5 .

Group    G5   got the highest RRs in all scenarios, group   G4   got the second highest RRs, etc.


Since the design of the scenarios takes account of the respondent's actual age as well as the


age dierence, couples with dierent actual ages and a dierent age dierence will receive


dierent retirement with adjusted replacement rates. In Table 2, we illustrate the dierent


scenarios, using the example of a male respondent and his spouse who are both 55 years old



                                               13
and who both work 40 hours per week. The table shows the retirement plans presented to


the respondent in the survey, with its (partial and full) retirement ages and the replacement


rates for the ve dierent groups.   Scenarios 1, 2, 3 and 6 have abrupt retirement of both


partners. In Scenario 1, the male respondent retires earlier (age 65) than the wife (age 68),


in scenario 2 it is the other way around (ages 62 and 68). Scenario 4 has partial retirement of


the respondent, who works part-time from age 62 until 65. Working part-time always means


working 60% of preretirement hours.     In scenario 5, the partner works part-time from age


65 until age 68.   During partial retirement, the replacement rate is always 100%; after full


retirement, replacement rates are randomly assigned through the group assignment G1G5,


as shown in the table. If, unlike in the example of Table 2, the age dierence is not zero, the


(partial) retirement ages and RRs for the partner change accordingly.



                                           Table 2

   In order to stimulate respondents to think of the pros and cons of each scenario before


asking them to make choices, respondents were rst asked to rate every scenario separately on


an ordinal scale. These ratings will not be used in the empirical analysis; they merely serve


to familiarize the respondents with all the scenarios. The reason is that in a similar SP exper-


iment for individual retirement trajectories, Van Soest and Vonkova (2014) used both rating


and choice data but found that stated ratings were very noisy, giving much less information


than the stated choices. Choice questions come after these ratings. Respondents were asked


to indicate a preference between the two scenarios in each of three pairs: scenario 2 versus


scenario 4, scenario 5 versus scenario 2, and scenario 3 versus scenario 6. For each of these


three choice sets comparing two scenarios, three questions were asked:




   I:     Considering your own preferences and not those of your partner, which would you
prefer?
                                              14
     II :
        Considering your partner's preferences and not those of yourself, what do you think
your partner would prefer?
   III : If, as a couple, you would have to decide jointly on choosing between these scenarios,

what would be the most likely outcome?

     In total, we have three pairs with three choices each. As we previously mentioned, the three


dierent types of questions are important for identication of the collective model. Questions


I   and   II   allow us to elicit the preference parameters of males' and females' individual utility


functions, while question      III   is informative on the parameters driving the bargaining weights


of husband and wife.



                                                 Table 3

     Table 3 presents descriptive statistics for the nine stated choice questions.         Each row


represents one question; each of the three blocks has the three questions for a given choice


set. In the rst block where the choice is between scenarios S2 and S4, both husbands and


wives tend to prefer S4 over S2 from all three perspectives. S2 was chosen more often by female


than by male respondents. From Table 2 we know that S4 focuses on gradual retirement of


the respondent while S2 has early retirement, while there is no dierence for the partner.


Female respondents more often than male respondents to stop working completely at age 62


than to continue working part-time, even if not working at all leads to less income.            This


is in line with the notion that women have a lower preference to do paid work. The same


explanation can be given for the dierence between rows 1 and 2: A larger preference is given


to early retirement when respondents answer the question using the wife's preferences than


when using the husband's preferences. As expected, the choice fractions from the perspective


of the household as a whole are generally in between the fractions from the male's and female's


perspective.



                                                    15
    For the second choice situation, both male and female respondents tend to choose S5


over S2.        Again, females tend to prefer S2 more often than males, in line with the notion


that females tend to have lower labour supply than men.                     Note that both S4 and S5 have


partial retirement for either the respondent (S4) or the spouse (S5).                    A preference for S4


or S5 therefore also implies a preference for partial retirement, in line with what Van Soest


and Vonkova (2014) and Elsayed et al. (2018) found using Dutch SP data and analyzing


individual preferences. For example, Van Soest and Vonkova (2014) analyzed four types of


hypothetical retirement scenarios - standard retirement, late retirement, early retirement and


partial retirement and found that if more exibility is added in the form of gradual retirement


with an actuarially fair partial pension, almost two thirds would opt for gradual retirement.


    For the last SP question, females and particularly males tend to choose S6 (standard


retirement for both) over S3 (late retirement for both) from all three perspectives. As expected


given the previous results, late retirement is particularly unpopular among female respondents.


Looking at the table as a whole, we can conclude that both male and female respondents tend


to make similar choices regardless of the perspectives they are supposed to choose from  the


dierences across choice situations are much larger than the dierences across perspectives


for a given choice situation.




4 Empirical specication
As described in Section 3, the respondents need to choose between dierent retirement tra-


jectories for the couple. We assume that for a respondent                 j = m, f   in couple   i,   total lifetime

           j
utility   Uiq   of the joint retirement trajectory      q    has the following additively separable form:



                                          1          100
                                   j                                       j
                                          X          X
                                  Uiq =         pd          ρt−62 Pr(t|62)Uiqt,d                               (16)
                                          d=0        t=62




                                                            16
          j
Here     Uiqt,d   is the utility at age    t   with work limitation status         d ∈ {0, 1}, Pr(t|62)   is the


probability of survival till age       t   given survival until age 62,       pd   is the probability of having


work limitations after age 62,
                                      4 and     ρ   is the discount factor.   Both health and survival risk


are taken from respondents' responses. The survival probabilities are constructed adjusting


general life tables for men and women upward or downward, using subjective probabilities of


living until age 75 reported in the HRS for the respondent and the spouse.
                                                                                               5 The summation


is from age 62 for the respondent since all of our SP scenarios start from respondent age 62.


For the spouse, we use the same intertemporally additive specication, but the summation is


adjusted for the age dierence between respondent and spouse, in line with how we designed


the scenarios.       For example, if the partner is two years younger than the respondent, the


summation for the partner is from partner's age 60.


       Since scenarios are presented in terms of income rather than expenditures, we also work


within period utility functions in terms of income rather than expenditure. In other words, we


abstract from saving and consumption smoothing, as in Van Soest and Vonkova (2014). The

                                       j
within period utility functions       Uiqt     are assumed to have the following modied Cobb-Douglas


specications:

                                                                                  ln liqt                  (17)

                                                                                 m       f
                                                                                     ln liqt               (18)

                                                        i ψ + ηi                                           (19)



                                                    βif = xfi ψ β + νif                                    (20)

   4
    Ideally, this probability should depend on t but the data only contain the probability at age 62.
   5
    Let the objective life table survival rate to age t be so (t) = exp(−Λo (t)) where Λo (t) is the integrated
hazard and we assume the subjective survival rate to age t, ss (t) = exp(−ψΛo (t)). We use both subjective
and objective point estimates to nd ψ for each respondent. We then reconstruct the subjective survival curve
using the integrated hazard of the life-table survival curve.



                                                            17
              j
        Here liqt and   ciqt   denote partner      j 's   leisure and household (public) consumption, respec-


tively. Utility depends on own leisure, the spouse's leisure, consumption and the interaction


of the two leisure terms.           xji   are vectors of taste shifters, capturing observed heterogeneity


(age, health indicators, education, etc).                 αim    and   βif   are linear combinations of observed and


unobserved heterogeneity terms;              ηim    and    νif   are the unobserved heterogeneity terms, which


vary across households but are xed over time. We use a bivariate normal distribution of (ηi ,
                                                                                                                      m


νif )   with parameters to be estimated, allowing the two random coecients to be correlated.


A positive correlation would capture the fact that men and women with similar preferences


for leisure are more likely to become partners (assortative matching on the marriage mar-


ket). All other preference parameters (αc , βc , αmf , βmf , ρ) are assumed to be the same for all


couples in the sample.


        It is clear that this specication allows for externalities in leisure: utility depends upon


leisure of the partner. In particular, the interaction terms imply that marginal utility of own


leisure varies with leisure of the partner. If there are complementarities in leisure,                         αmf   and


β mf     will be positive  implying that the marginal utility of leisure increases with leisure of


spouse.


        The bargaining weight of males is given by                 λ(p; δ).    We use the following logistic transfor-


mation to guarantee that the weight is bounded between 0 and 1:




                                                                   exp(p0 δ)
                                               λ(p; δ) =                                                             (21)
                                                                 1 + exp(p0 δ)

        For simplicity, we assume that          p    only includes the log wage ratio (ln(wm /wf ) and an


intercept.        We expect a positive eect of             ln(wm /wf )        on   λ   since this implies that a higher


relative wage of the husband compared to the wife gives the husband a better bargaining


position.      The intercept is also of interest, since it reects the bargaining position if both


partners have the same wage rate.




                                                                 18
        To account for optimization errors, general extreme value Type 1 (GEV(1)) iid error terms

       f
m
 iq , iq   and   jiq   are added. For questions of type              I   for males and type   II   for females in every


choice question, the scenario             q   is chosen that maximizes:




                                                        Viqm = Uiq
                                                                m
                                                                   + m
                                                                      iq                                                 (22)



        Similarly, for questions of type           I   for females and of type        II   for males, the scenario       q   is


chosen that maximizes:




                                                         Viqf = Uiq
                                                                 f
                                                                    + fiq                                               (23)



        For questions of type      III ,      respondents choose the retirement scenario              q   that maximizes:




                                               Viqj = λUiq
                                                        m            f
                                                           + (1 − λ)Uiq + jiq                                           (24)



        Given the specication of         αim   and    βif ,   our model can be estimated as a random coecient


model. Because optimization errors are independent of each other, the conditional likelihood


contribution of respondent            i    given unobserved (and observed) heterogeneity terms can be


written as a product of the probabilities                  Pis   of the observed choices in questions        s = 1, . . . , S .

Each of these probabilities is a simple binary logit probability.


        The parameters determining the distribution of the unobserved heterogeneity terms (the

5 Estimation Results
Table 4 gives the estimates of our benchmark collective retirement model.                        The rst part


presents the inuence of taste shifters on the marginal utility of an individual's leisure. The


marginal utility of leisure increases with age, in line with the idea that keeping taste shifters


and nancial incentives constant, individuals prefer to reduce work eort when they get older.


This is consistent with existing ndings, such as Michaud and Vermeulen (2011).



                                                       Table 4

      We tried several health indicators (cf. Table 1), and the best t was obtained with the


dummy for health limitations. The signicantly positive estimates indicate that individuals


with health problems have a higher disutility of paid work than those without health problems,


as we would expect. We do not nd signicant dierences in the marginal disutility of work


with education or satisfaction with the current job. The positive (but insignicant) estimates


for men are somewhat surprising, since they would imply a higher disutility of work for men


who are satised with their job.

  7
    following standard practice, these draws are transformed standard normal draws, using the Cholesky
decomposition of Σ. We use Halton draws to reduce simulation variance and use R = 50; see, e.g., Train
(2009).



                                                           20
    The nal taste shifter we included is denoted as spouse responded. For men, it is equal


to 1 if the respondent is the wife; for women it is equal to 1 if the husband responded to


the survey. If the respondent was perfectly aware of the partner's preferences, the parameter


on this covariate would be zero.            Point estimates are positive, insignicant for men, but


signicant for women.         This provides evidence that on average, men have a biased view of


the preferences of their wives.          They overestimate their wives' marginal utility of leisure,


and will therefore more often choose scenarios with earlier retirement of the wife than their


wives themselves choose.           In the simulations we perform in the next sections, we will take


out this information bias. This is all based on the assumption that individuals know their


own preferences perfectly well, so that inconsistencies between their own and their partner's


reported preferences must be due to a biased perception of partner preferences.


    One of the main features of this model is that preference are not egoistic and we allow


externalities in leisure, reected in the parameters       αmf   and   β mf   in equations 17 and 18, the


parameters on leisure spouse in Table 4. Both           αmf    and   β mf   are positive and signicant,


conrming the notion that joint leisure activities imply that the marginal utility of own leisure


increases if the spouse also has more leisure. Similar evidence can be found in, for example,


Gustman and Steinmeier (2000) and Michaud and Vermeulen (2011). This result also suggests


that the assumption of egoistic preferences, ignoring possible externalities in leisure, may lead


to incorrect results. This problem may of course be specic to the context of retirement and


older couples, it is not necessarily an issue for labour supply of prime age men and women.


In the next section, we will use simulations based upon our estimates to illustrate how much


of joint retirement in the data is explained by the estimated importance of complementarity


of leisure.


    The marginal utility of consumption is positive and signicant for men as well as women


(parameters   αc   and   β c ).   The marginal utility of leisure (also accounting for the unobserved


heterogeneity term) is positive in the majority of cases for both males and females, but not



                                                     21
always. Particularly at younger ages, a substantial fraction of men and women have negative


marginal utility of leisure, reecting the fact that there is a group of respondents who never


choose early retirement.


    The parameter       δ2   for the log wage ratio in the bargaining weight    λ (equation 21 in Section

4) is marginally signicant (t-value 1.67), implying that a higher wage rate relative to the


wage rate of the partner increases the individual's Pareto weight and bargaining power. This


also implies that the standard unitary model (implying that the household utility function


in equation 24 should be independent of the wage rates) is (marginally) rejected against the


more general collective alternative. This is in line with most ndings in the collective model


literature. In our setting, we can also identity the constant         δ1 .   The estimate is positive but


very small and not signicant. This means that if both spouses earn equal wages, they tend


to have almost the same bargaining power (0.503 for the husband, 0.497 for the wife). If the


wage rate of the husband is twice that of the wife, the estimates of            δ1   and   δ2   imply that the


husband's Pareto bargaining weight is approximately 0.592.


    Both discount factors are estimated to be larger than 1. This is much larger than what


is found in studies that do not explicitly incorporate survival probabilities, but similar to the


discount rates found by French (2005). Like we do, he separately incorporates mortality risk


and nds discount rate estimates varying from 0.981 to 1.04, suggesting much more patience


than typically assumed or found when ignoring mortality.


    The model has two unobserved heterogeneity terms, the random components of the coef-


cients   αm   and   βf .    Both are signicant, and they are almost perfectly correlated, with an


estimated correlation coecient of 0.995, not signicantly dierent from 1.
                                                                                           8 This implies a


strong positive correlation between husband's and wife's preferences for leisure. One plausible

   8
     The covariance matrix is estimated as a function of three auxiliary parameters using a Cholesky decom-
position, modelling νif in 20 as a linear combination of ηim in 19 and a component independent of ηim . The
parameter σ(ηim ) and the parameter determining how much νif is related to ηim are both strongly signicant,
but the parameter driving the independent component of νif is small and insignicant (t-value 0.5).



                                                     22
explanation is assortative matching on the marriage market (men and women who get married


tend to have similar preferences), another possibility is that the preferences of husbands and


wives in these older couples (one of the two is at least age 50) have converged over time. In


the simulation exercises of the next section, we analyze to which extent this correlation can


explain joint retirement.


   We estimated several alternative specications that are less general than the baseline


model presented in Table 4. Table 5 shows how these alternative specications compare to


the baseline in terms of log likelihood. Since each of the alternative models is nested in the


baseline model, they can also be compared to the baseline model using a formal likelihood


ratio test on one or two parameter restrictions.     The LR test statistic is presented in the


second column of the table. This shows that all the alternatives are rejected against the more


general baseline. Even the unitary model is clearly rejected against the baseline model, with


a p-value of 0.018; for the other models, the p-values are much smaller still.



                                           Table 5

   Detailed results for the other models can be found in the appendix. In general we nd


that, even if the restrictions imposed in the alternative models are clearly rejected by the


tests, imposing these restrictions does not have large eects on the estimates of the other


parameters. For example, the correlation between unobserved heterogeneity terms is always


close to one (except when restricted to zero) and the discount factors are always above 1


(except when set to 0.95). The coecient on the log wage rate ratio varies somewhat more,


from 0.391 to 0.533, with t-value between 1.33 and 1.84.

6 Simulations: Validation, explaining joint retirement, and -
       nancial incentives
The parameter estimates provide strong evidence of both complementarity of leisure and


correlation between labour supply preferences of husband and wife.              The main purpose of


this section is to perform some simulations to illustrate how much complementarity of leisure


and correlated preferences contribute to explaining joint retirement. The simulation setup is


similar to the policy simulations in Van Soest and Vonkova (2014), but for couples instead


of individuals, and focusing on explaining joint retirement rather than gradual retirement or


measuring the eects of nancial incentives. The simulations let households choose among


stylized retirement scenarios similar to the ones presented in our stated preference questions.


This implies that we do not consider a third possible explanation of joint retirement: joint


features in the system of taxes and benets.            In our simulation set up, household income


in each time period is simply the sum of the husband's and the wife's earnings and old age


pensions, without any joint feature like the spouse allowance or health insurance through the


partner's employment.


      In the simulations, we do not consider gradual or partial retirement and thus allow for


abrupt retirement only.     Moreover, retirement is treated as an absorbing state, there is no


reverse retirement.    We assume males and females can both retire at any age from 60 to


70.    This gives 121 potential outcomes for the household.          In the baseline simulation, the


replacement rate for each individual is set to 60% if the individual retires at age 65.             It is


adjusted upward with 8%per year if the individual retires later (a delayed retirement credit


of 8% per year) and reduced by 6% per year if the individual retires earlier (an actuarial


reduction factor of 0.94).
                              9

  9
    These adjustments make the reward for later retirement and the penalty for earlier retirement roughly
actuarially fair.




                                                   24
   Our model implies that the probability of choosing a given cell depends on observed taste


shifters, wage rates, estimated parameters, and the unobserved heterogeneity terms. Taste


shifters and wage rates are taken from the data and parameter estimates are taken from


Table 4. Each couples unobserved heterogeneity components      ηim   and   νif   are estimated as the


posterior means, updating the estimated bivariate prior distribution with the observed choices


in the data. For each couple, we then use these posterior means and all the other information


to compute expected retirement ages of both partners.



                                           Figure 2

   A contour plot of the resulting distribution of retirement ages is sketched in Figure 2. The


modal cell is approximately age 62 for both, but the distribution is spread out and strongly


right skewed, particularly for males (whose marginal utility of leisure is, according to the


estimates, characterized by substantially more unobserved heterogeneity than the marginal


utility of leisure for women). The contour plot also shows a positive correlation between the


retirement ages of both spouses.




External validation
According to the baseline simulation with the given, stylized, choice opportunities, the average


retirement age is 65.73 for men and 63.83 for women. It is hard to compare these numbers


with average retirement ages in actual data, since real life choice opportunities will almost


certainly deviate from the 121 points stylized choice sets used in the simulations. To validate


our stated preference data, we can, however, compare our expected retirement ages for each


couple to the expected retirement ages reported by the same individuals in the HRS (wave


2010; the answer to the question when do you think you will stop working?).


   Figure 3 presents the results We nd a clear positive and signicant relation between the


simulated retirement ages according to our model and the expected retirement ages in the



                                              25
HRS data. This is what we expect if our SP data are valid: individuals with a preference for


early retirement retire earlier according to our SP data and the model based upon these data,


and also indicate a lower expected retirement age.          The R-squared of the linear regression


is 0.21 for men and 0.25 for women. This indicates that the correlation is far from perfect,


due to, among other things, the fact that the choice sets respondents use may very well


dier from the stylized choice sets in the simulations, and noise in both the simulated and


the reported expected retirement ages. Still, the fact that our SP data help to predict the


expected retirement ages reported in the HRS shows the usefulness of the SP data in addition


to revealed preferences, particularly in the context of serious identication issues that we have


in the collective model (cf. Section 2).




Explaining joint retirement
Figure 2 does not say much about joint retirement yet, since the two spouses may have dierent


ages  Joint retirement means retirement at (approximately) the same calendar time, not at


the same age. Accounting for the age dierence between partners, however, can easily compute


the dierence in calendar time between the expected time of retirement of husband and wife.


We refer to this as the retirement      distance.   We will consider the distribution of       distance,

but if we want a percentage of couple who retire jointly, we have to be more specic. We will


dene joint retirement as the event that      distance   is at most one in absolute value. This is a


rather broad denition, allowing one year of dierence between the two retirement ages.


       The top row of Table 6 shows that with the given choice sets, the model predicts that


33.6% of couples retire jointly according to this denition.
                                                                    10 . Figure 4 illustrates the joint


retirement decisions further, presenting a contour plot in terms of the simulated distance to


retirement for husbands and wives at the time of the survey. The shaded green area reects

  10
    Gustman and Steinmeier (2000), who assumed couples attain a noncooperative Nash equilibrium and
predicted that over 11% of couples retire at the same time. Our number cannot be compared to theirs, since
they use a completely dierent framework and denition


                                                    26
joint retirement outcomes, and the gure clearly shows that this area covers a range where


the density of simulated retirement ages is relatively high (the distribution is unimodal with


the largest density at approximately (10,6); lighter contour lines indicate higher density).


   The remaining rows of Table 6 show how the percentage of joint retirement changes in


a counterfactual simulation where one of the potential explanations for joint retirement is


taken out. The row Shuing wages shows what happens if randomly reassign the males'


and females' wage rates in the sample to the couples in the sample.         This takes out one


source of correlation due to observed heterogeneity: males' and females' wage rates are now


independent of each other (but also independent of all the taste shifters).        As expected,


average simulated retirement ages of men and women hardly change compared to the baseline


simulation.   The simulated probability of joint retirement is, somewhat surprisingly, even


larger than according to the baseline simulation. This suggests that the positive correlation


in husbands' and wives' wage rates (0.056 in the data) does not explain joint retirement. This


is also illustrated in Figure 5. The blue line in this gure gives the baseline simulation of the


distribution of   distance   The orange line is the distribution according to the counterfactual


simulation with wages reshued, giving somewhat more joint retirement       −1 ≤ distance ≤ 1)

than the baseline.


   The third row in Table 6 eliminates the correlation between the two unobserved hetero-


geneity terms.    Here we use unobserved heterogeneity terms with the same variances as in


the baseline simulation, but with zero correlation coecient. This makes quite a dierence,


since the estimated correlation used in the baseline simulation is 0.995. Joint retirement drops


dramatically, from 33.6% to 17.7% according to our broad denition.        In other words, cor-


related labour supply preferences, due to assortative matching or convergence in preferences


over time, can explain almost half of all joint retirement decisions. This is much higher than


what is found in Gustman and Steinmeier (2000, 2004).


   The nal counter-factual simulation in Table 6 focuses on the role of complementarities



                                                 27
in leisure.   In this simulation, we xed the spouse's leisure in the individual utility func-


tion to the average level in the sample, so that the individual's marginal utility of leisure


no longer depends on the partner's leisure. This simulation gives a somewhat smaller prob-


ability of joint retirement: 30.4% instead of 33.6% in Table 7 (broad denition). It implies


that complementarity in leisure can explain almost 10% ((33.6-30.2)/33.6)100%) of all joint


retirement decisions. See also the red curve in Figure 5, which has less density around 0 than


the blue baseline curve. This result is similar to that of Casanova Rivas (2010), who, using


a stochastic dynamic optimization model, found that leisure complementarities account for


13% of observed joint retirement.          Our simulations results therefore lead to the conclusion


that unobserved heterogeneity plays an much more important role than complementarities in


leisure. Stancanelli and van Soest (2016) use a double regression discontinuity approach to


investigate joint leisure before and after retirement.           Their results also suggest that leisure


complementarities are not the main driver of joint retirement.




Joint retirement and nancial incentives
Table 7 illustrates how sensitive individual and joint retirement decisions are for the nancial


incentives, even if these incentives do not directly create joint features in the budget restric-


tions. The top row reproduces the baseline simulation already discussed above. The second


row shows what happens if there is no actuarial penalty on retiring earlier and no reward


for retiring later. This reduces incentives to work and therefore lead to earlier retirement for


both partners. Retirement ages will be much more concentrated in the range 60-65, implying


that more couples retire in the same year or adjacent years.
                                                                         11 Accordingly, joint retirement


(according to our broad denition) increases from 33.6% in the baseline simulation to 43.5%


in the no penalty simulation. The high penalty simulation is essentially the opposite of

  11
     Not everyone retires at the earliest possible age, since wages are higher than pensions and because,
according to our estimates, a substantial group of individuals has negative marginal utility of leisure at early
retirement ages (partly due to the large unobserved heterogeneity component).


                                                      28
the no penalty case. Rewards for later retirement are higher than in the baseline situation


(see notes to the table for details), and individuals are stimulated to retire later. The average


retirement ages of men and women increases, but the distribution of retirement ages is also


more spread out, so that fewer couples retire at approximately the same time. Accordingly,


the percentage retiring at most one year from each other drops from 33.6% to 27.6%.


   The nal two rows concern what is sometimes called the income or pension wealth eect


on retirement (cf. Van Soest and Vonkova (2014)). Without changing rewards for earlier or


later retirement compared to the baseline, pensions are made less (low generosity) or more


(high generosity), irrespective of the chosen retirement rate, so that total pension wealth


and life-cycle income are lower or higher than in the baseline simulation. If leisure is a normal


good, lowering life-cycle income (low generosity) leads to more labour supply, i.e., later


retirement. This is indeed what the table shows for both spouses, although the eects are not


very large, considering the substantial reduction in replacement rates (from 60% to 40% when


retiring at age 65. Accordingly, like in the high penalty simulation, retirement ages are more


spread out and joint retirement becomes less likely. The nal row (high generosity) gives


essentially the opposite eect: higher pensions lead to earlier retirement, more concentrated


around the early ages. Joint retirement increases from 33.6% to 36.2%.


   All in all, the bottom panel of the table shows that apart from complementarities in leisure


and correlation in preferences, the characteristics of the choice set (the budget opportunities)


are an important determinant of the fraction of couples retiring jointly, even if pension income


is not explicitly linked to the retirement age of the partner.




7 Conclusion
The collective model is valuable tool to describe the behaviour of multi-person households,


outperforming the unitary model which assumes that the household acts as a single utility-




                                               29
maximizing agent. On the other hand, estimating a collective model requires a lot from the


data, and revealed preference data alone are typically insucient without additional assump-


tions. Furthermore, it typically involves making strong assumptions regarding expectations


and knowledge of preferences within the couple. In this paper, we consider a collective model


of labour supply and retirement of couples that allows for subjective expectations and mis-


perceptions of spouse preferences. We show that additional assumptions can be avoided when


stated preference data are used instead of revealed preference data.       Asking survey ques-


tions on choices between dierent hypothetical retirement scenarios made from three dierent


perspectives, own preferences, partner preferences, and most likely outcome for the couple,


leads to a natural way of identifying preference parameters as well as parameters driving the


household decision.


   Stated preferences have been successfully applied to study individual retirement decisions.


We acknowledge that the stated preference questions for couples are more challenging than


those for individuals, particularly since we also ask respondents to make decisions using the


preferences of their spouse.   Indeed we nd that male respondents have a systematically


biased view of their wives' labour supply preferences, overestimating their disutility of doing


paid work. We incorporate this bias in our model and correct for it when explaining joint


retirement.   We then validate our SP data and the structural model by comparing model


predictions with expected retirement ages directly reported by the same individuals. We nd


that the SP data have substantial predictive power: individuals who prefer later retirement


according to the stated preference model, also tend to report a later expected age of retirement.


   Our estimates of the structural model give plausible results. In line with the literature,


the neo-classical unitary model is rejected and a higher relative wage rate increase bargaining


power within the couple. If wage rates of husband and wife are equal, we do not nd evidence


of dierences in bargaining power. We nd signicant evidence of (positive) complementari-


ties in both partners' leisure and we nd very strong evidence of a positive correlation between



                                               30
partners' labour supply preferences. Our simulations suggest that correlation between prefer-


ences explain a much larger part of joint retirement than complementarities in leisure. On the


other hand, the percentage of couples retiring jointly also strongly depends on budget oppor-


tunities (pension levels and accruals), even if there is no explicit link between an individual's


pension and the partner's labour supply or retirement decision. Our simulation results should


therefore interpreted as a qualitative illustration only, the magnitudes of the eects will be


dierent if we use people's actual choice sets instead of the stylized scenarios in our current


analysis. Yet, this papers shows that the collective model is perfectly suited to allow for a


realistic representation of household behavior in a context with subjective expectations and


imperfect knowledge of preferences.

       Description of Retirement Scenarios in SP Questions by Randomized
Table 2:
Group using an Example: In Scenario 4 and 5, P refers to partial retirement. If the
respondents or the spouses partially retire, their disposable incomes do not change.               Their
working hours reduce by 40 percent. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the ve
groups    G1 , G2 , G3 , G4 , G5 ,   with dierent replacement rates in all scenarios. The rst element
in each group column gives the RR of the respondent while the second gives the RR of the
spouse.
