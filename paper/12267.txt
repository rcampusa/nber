Understanding whether the gradient in children's health becomes steeper with age is an important
first step in uncovering the mechanisms that connect economic and health status, and in
recommending sensible interventions to protect children's health. To that end, this paper examines
why two sets of authors, Chen et al (2006) and Case et al (2002), using data from the same source,
reach markedly different conclusions about income-health gradients in childhood. We find that
differences can be explained primarily by the inclusion (exclusion) of a handful of younger adults
living independently.

Introduction

The relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and health in childhood is an active

and important area of research, one that may improve our understanding of the origins of

socioeconomic gradients in adult health, and mechanisms through which the

intergenerational transmission of poverty takes place. For these reasons, we read with

interest the recent article “Socioeconomic status and health: Do gradients differ within

childhood and adolescence?” (Chen, Martin and Matthews, 2006). These authors find

that, although assessments of child health differ significantly between richer and poorer

households, these differences do not increase as children age. This result stands in sharp

contrast to recent findings that the relationship between household income and children’s

health becomes more pronounced as children age, with no diminution of the gradient in

adolescence (Case, Lubotsky and Paxson, 2003). The difference in findings between

Chen, Martin and Matthews (CMM) and Case, Lubotsky and Paxson (CLP) are

surprising, given that the two sets of authors rely on the same data source – the National

Health Interview Survey (NHIS) – and choose the same socioeconomic and health

variables for their analyses.

       Understanding whether the gradient in children’s health becomes steeper with age

is an important first step in uncovering the mechanisms that connect economic and health

status, and in recommending sensible interventions to protect children’s health. To that

end, this paper examines why these authors reach such different conclusions about the

income-health gradient in childhood. We find these differences can be explained

primarily by the inclusion, as if they were dependent children, of younger adults living

independently.



                                             2
Methods

Sample choice

CLP analyzed 10 years of NHIS data for approximately 230,000 children aged 0 to 17,

surveyed between 1986 and 1995. CMM analyzed data from the 1994 round of the NHIS,

for approximately 29,000 children aged 0 to 18. CMM note that, in most cases, a proxy

adult respondent (typically the child’s mother) reported on the health of persons under

age 19. For simplicity, they refer to these responses as ‘parental reports.’

       From this description, it is clear that the samples analyzed varied in two important

ways. CLP worked with a data set that was an order of magnitude larger. In addition,

CLP excluded 18 year olds from their analysis, while CMM did not. CLP noted that they

chose not to include 18 year olds because they were concerned about the living

arrangements of college-aged individuals, and whether these respondents would report

their current incomes or the incomes of the families in which they were raised.

       Data from the 1994 NHIS suggest it may be problematic to include 18 year olds

in such analyses. In the NHIS, all relationships are recorded relative to a reference

person, who is the person who rents or owns the housing unit surveyed. While, overall,

less than one percent of children in 1994 reported themselves to be the household

reference person, two percent of 17 year olds and 17 percent of 18 year olds did so. (In

what follows, we will refer to a young adult who is not the household reference person as

‘dependent’ and one who is the household reference person as ‘independent.’) Nearly 80

percent of independent 18 year olds have completed at least 12 years of schooling (in

contrast to 50 percent of the dependent 18 year olds), suggesting that a non-trivial




                                              3
fraction of 18 year olds living away from their families of origin may be enrolled in

college. The current household income of such 18 year olds will be a poor guide to the

socioeconomic status of the households in which they were raised, and may be an

inaccurate estimate of their access to resources. Indeed, only 2 percent of dependent 18

year olds reported household incomes of less than $5,000, while fully 70 percent of

independent 18 year olds did so. Moreover, if the healthiest and highest SES 18 year olds

were more likely to have left for college, their systematic absence in their households of

origin and their presence in newly formed (apparently low income) households will bias

estimates of the impact of household socioeconomic status on health outcomes, at least to

some degree.



Variable construction

CLP and CMM also differ in their construction of the household income variable. For all

years from 1986 to 1995, the NHIS reports information on total household income for 27

income categories, coded from 0 to 26—corresponding to $1000 intervals for incomes

between $0 and $20,000, and to $5,000 intervals for incomes between $20,000 and

$50,000. The highest income category is “$50,000 or more,” so all household incomes

above $50,000 are top coded.

       CLP assigned incomes to these income categories using data from the 1986-1995

March Current Population Surveys (CPS). Specifically, they calculated, for each income

category in each year, the mean total household income in the CPS for households whose

head’s education matched that of the reference person in the household and whose

income fell into that income category. (See the Appendix to CLP for details.) CLP’s




                                             4
specifications generally used the logarithm of household income as an explanatory

variable. Implicit in this specification is the assumption that, in wealthy and poor

households alike, a one-percent increase in household income has the same marginal

effect on the health of children of a given age. However, CLP note that their results are

robust to changes in functional form. In particular, their finding that the gradient in

children’s health becomes steeper with each year of age continues to hold when

household income is used in place of the logarithm of household income.

       CMM chose to measure household income as the categorical income variable

published in the NHIS. That is, their income variable consists of integer values from 0 to

26. Implicit in this choice is an assumption that a $1000 increase in income in poorer

households (i.e., a one-unit change in the NHIS’s categorical income variable for

households with incomes below $20,000) has the same marginal effect on children’s

health as does a $5,000 increase in income in wealthier households (i.e., a one-unit

change for households with incomes above $20,000 annually). This specification has the

very odd implication that the effect of an additional dollar is five times as large for

households with incomes of $19,999 than it is for households with incomes of $20,000.



Data analysis

We re-analyzed the NHIS data using STATA/SE 9.2. Following CMM, we first ran

logistic regressions using 1994 data only, in which an indicator that a child is reported in

fair or poor health is regressed on the income measure used by CMM, age, an income-age

interaction, and controls for race (white, black, other) and sex. The analysis is repeated,

restricting the sample to dependent children (that is, removing 232 children – primarily




                                              5
17 and 18 year olds – reported to be the household reference person). We then estimate

this model using 10 years of NHIS data from 1986-95. Finally, we repeat these analyses

using the logarithm of income in place of the CMM measure. All results were weighted

using sampling weights. In all cases, we report odds ratios (ORs) so that our results can

be directly compared to those of CMM.



Results

Table 1 presents the results of logistic regressions using the CMM categorical income

measure in columns 1 to 4, and using the CLP log income measure in columns 5 to 7.

Column 1 reproduces CMM’s estimate of the impact of household income on the log

odds of reporting a child in fair or poor health, and column 2 produces results reported in

CMM that they find no significant age-income interaction term. The lack of a significant

age-income interaction term is also seen in column 5, where the categorical income

measure has been replaced by log income. However, once the 232 independent young

adults are removed from the sample (column 6), the age-income interaction using log

income becomes statistically significant (P<.05). For both income specifications using 10

years of NHIS data (columns 4 and 7), once young adults living independently are

removed from the sample, we find age-income interactions that are statistically

significant (P’s<.001). Furthermore, the estimates imply substantial changes in the

relationship between income and health as children become older. The results in column

7 suggest that a change in household income from the 75th to the 25th percentile of the

1986-95 income distribution (from about $37,000 to about $13,000) at age 3 increases the

probability of being in fair or poor health from 1.7 percent to 2.7 percent. The same




                                             6
change in household income at age 15 increases the probability from 1.8 percent to 3.3

percent.

       Table 1 suggests that the inclusion of a small number of young adults living on

their own changes the estimated age-income interaction term dramatically. This can also

be seen in Figure 1, which plots the coefficients on log income from logistic regressions

run separately for each age, from 0 to 18, for all children observed in the NHIS from

1986 to 1995. The lightly shaded diamonds represent the odds ratios for log income from

age-specific regressions run for all children, while the darkly shaded circles correspond to

the odds ratios for dependent children only. These show convincingly that income is

increasingly protective with age when the newly-independent children are excluded. Note

that, from age 0 to age 13, there are no differences in the estimated coefficients for the

two samples—dependents only and all children—because no children below age 14 are

reported to be living on their own. The low incomes of college-aged young adults living

independently have a very large effect on the estimated relationship between income and

health status in the NHIS for 17 and 18 year olds. Similar results are found using ordered

probits of health status, measured on a five-point scale.



Discussion

The differences in the age patterns observed for income-health gradients between CMM

and CLP are not driven by CMM’s use of a categorical income variable. Both the CLP

and the CMM age-income interactions terms are insignificant when young adults living

independently are included in the analysis. Both become highly significant and imply




                                              7
large changes in the gradient with age when the analysis is restricted to dependent

children and 10 years of NHIS data are used.

       Neither are the differences between the CLP and CMM results due to the much

larger sample size used by CLP. The age-income interaction term becomes significant

using CMM’s income measure, but restricting the analysis to dependent children, if one

combines only two years of NHIS data – 1994 and 1995, for example (P<.001). Rather,

the differences between the CLP and CMM results are driven largely by CMM’s

inclusion of independent 18 year olds. We believe it is inappropriate to include these

young adults in an analysis of the impact of socioeconomic status on health in childhood

and adolescence, as the “socioeconomic status” markers available for these independent

college-aged individuals are very possibly a poor reflection of the socioeconomic status

they enjoyed for much (or most) of their lives.

       Alternative measures of socioeconomic status in a child’s household of origin

face the same problem. CMM construct and use a variable measuring the years of

education of a parent (or responsible adult) in each child’s household. However, creation

of this variable is made problematic by the 17 and 18 year olds who report themselves as

the household reference person. For these young adults, the education of the “responsible

adult” defaults to their own education (in most cases, 12 years of completed schooling).

This adds measurement error to a variable intended to capture long-term effects of

parents’ education, and may bias all estimated coefficients.

       Young adults are an important group, deserving of attention. However, we will

learn more by following them longitudinally (out of their households of origin and into




                                             8
adulthood – see, for example, Case, Fertig and Paxson, 2005) than we will learn looking

at them in cross-sectional studies, such as the NHIS.
