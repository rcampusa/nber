                                            ABSTRACT

The global crisis highlights the continued vulnerability of developing countries to shocks from advanced
economies. Just a few years after the global crisis, the eurozone sovereign debt crisis has emerged
as the single biggest threat to the global outlook. In this paper, we apply the event study methodology
to gauge the scope for financial contagion from the EU to developing countries. More specifically,
we estimate the responsiveness of equity and bond markets in developing countries to global crisis
news and euro crisis news. Overall, we find that whereas global crisis news had a consistently negative
effect on returns of equity and bond markets in developing countries, the effect of euro crisis news
was more mixed and limited.

1 Introduction

 Well before the onset of the global financial and economic crisis of 2008-2009, the world

economy has been experiencing a tectonic shift of global economic power from the advanced

economies to the developing countries. Developing Asia in particular has been growing for

decades and has become one of the main hubs of the world economy. China and to a lesser

extent India followed the footsteps of newly industrialized economies and ASEAN countries on

a path of sustained rapid growth which raised general living standards and reduced poverty at an

unprecedented speed and scale. Sound policies and effective governments combined with

openness to foreign trade and technology to propel Asian countries from the fringes of the world

economy to the front and center within a generation. More recently, other parts of the developing

world such as Latin America and Africa have also seen more rapid growth due to rising global

commodity prices and improved policies. Structural factors such as younger populations will

further tilt global economic power in toward developing countries in the future.

 Unlike financial crises such as the Latin American debt crises of the 1980s and the Asian

financial crisis of 1997-1998, the global crisis of 2008-2009 originated in the advanced

economies. As a result, the global crisis hit the advanced economies harder than the developing

countries. While the crisis originated in the US subprime mortgage market, it spread like a

wildfire across the Atlantic to Europe due to the heavy exposure of European banks to US

subprime assets. Although its limited exposure to subprime assets sheltered Japan from financial

contagion, it suffered a recession along with the US and EU. In contrast to the fragile and

stuttering recovery of the advanced economies, the developing countries enjoyed a much more

                                                2
robust and speedy recovery. Indeed the continued strength of developing countries helped to

partly offset the sluggishness of the advanced economies and contributed to global recovery. The

global crisis and the post-crisis two-speed global recovery thus added further momentum to the

growing role of developing countries even though they did not initiate the trend.

 Notwithstanding their faster growth relative to the advanced economies before and after the

global crisis, by no means were developing countries entirely immune from the adverse impact

of the global crisis. To the contrary, the pronounced effect of the global crisis emphatically

disproved the increasingly popular notion that developing countries are now de-coupled from the

advanced economies. Put differently, despite their relative decline, the US, EU and Japan still

account for a large share of global output, trade and capital flows, and still exert a major

influence on the economic performance of the developing countries. Some parts of the

developing world were hit harder than others by the global crisis. For example, developing Asia

grew, and grew at a healthy pace, while Latin America suffered an outright contraction of output.

However, growth rate fell sharply across the developing world as its exports to the advanced

economies plummeted. Furthermore, some parts of the developing world such as Latin America

also suffered instability due to the sudden and sharp withdrawal of capital.

 Just a few years after the US-originated global crisis, the world economy finds itself confronted

with another crisis emanating from the advanced economies. The eurozone sovereign debt crisis

– henceforth the euro crisis – currently poses the single biggest downside risk to the global

outlook. The crisis is rooted in the uneven growth performance of the Euro countries, the

unsustainably large public debts of some EU periphery countries, and the European banks’

                                                 3
exposure to such debt. While massive and forceful liquidity support by the European Central

Bank (ECB) since December 2011 has temporarily calmed the financial markets, the euro crisis

still awaits a more fundamental resolution. The euro crisis differs from the global crisis in that it

has been (so far) largely confined to Europe due to the US banks’ lack of exposure to the

government debt of peripheral European countries. But from the viewpoint of developing

countries, both crises represent major external shocks from advanced economies. The

pronounced effect of the global crisis on developing countries naturally brings up the question of

the potential effect of the euro crisis on those countries.

 At a broader level, our paper seeks to investigate the potential impact of the euro crisis on

developing countries. More precisely, the central objective of our paper is to empirically assess

the scope for financial contagion from the EU to the developing countries via the equity and

bond markets. We apply the event study methodology to gauge the responsiveness of equity and

bond markets in three regions of the developing world – (1) Emerging Asia, (2) Latin America,

and (3) Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa – to news from the eurozone. For example, we

can expect new negative developments pertaining to the Greek crisis to adversely affect

European financial markets but the extent of the spill-over to developing-country financial

markets is uncertain. We implicitly assume that the prices of financial assets will efficiently

incorporate the financial markets’ expectations about the future effects of news from the

eurozone. Therefore, we limit our empirical analysis to developing countries which have

relatively well-developed, deep, liquid financial markets.



                                                   4
    The sample period of our event study period encompasses both the global crisis period – i.e.

the period when eurozone news interacted with and partly reflected news from the rest of the

world, in particular the US, the epicentre of the global crisis – and the post-global crisis period –

i.e. period when news from the eurozone largely reflected eurozone-specific news such as news

from Greece or Spain. The findings from our event study indicate that in the post-global crisis

period eurozone news had at best a mixed and limited effect on the returns of equity and bond

markets in developing countries. On the other hand, during the global crisis period, our results

imply that eurozone news had a consistently negative impact on the returns of the same markets.

Overall our evidence thus suggests that the risk of financial contagion from the eurozone to

developing countries was quite limited.1 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2

describes the data and methodology used for the event study analysis. Section 3 reports and

discusses the main results of the event study analysis. Section 4 concludes the paper.



2 Data and Empirical Specification

    We focus on the recent episode of negative spillovers of financial shocks from the western

countries to the rest the world, particularly the emerging markets. Our aim is to examine the

exposure of the emerging markets to the financial crisis of western economies, specifically the

Euro area. In this vein, we provide a new evidence of global market linkages based on the

responses of global capital markets to the recent financial events, namely the Eurozone crisis.
1
  Among the European Union members, Bekaert et al. (2010) find that the Euro adoption and the anticipation of the
adoption has minimal effects on market integration. Using an earlier period of data from 2007-10, Arezki et al.
(2011) find some evidence of the spillover effects of sovereign rating news on the financial markets (CDS, stock
indices) across the selected European countries. Bellas et al. (2010) study the EMBI from 1997-2009 and find that
the spreads are driven by financial volatility in short run, and by fundamentals in the long run.
                                                        5
While some have argued that the panic over the Eurozone crisis has started in October 2009 as

soon as the Greek Socialist government took the office, we extend our coverage of the negative

spillovers back to August 2007, with the whole sample period for estimation from 2003 to 2011.2

    Our measures of the financial market linkages are derived from the fluctuations of asset

returns, including the stock market [MSCI Broad Investable Stock Prices (US$)] and the bond

market [JP Morgan EMBI Bond Prices (US$)] indices. We consider the emerging market

countries where the bond market and the stock market are relatively developed; these country

indices are included in the MSCI and EMBI indices. By this matrix, the countries covered are

Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea,

Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, and

Turkey, totalling 20 countries for both the stock market and the bond market.

    In order to examine the detail dynamics of these countries’ reaction to the global news, we use

the daily data of the market series of the emerging markets spanning January 1, 2005 to

December 12, 2011. We then map the emerging markets’ asset returns to the negative (and

positive) news from the Euro area. We start by considering all financial news due to the Euro

area. As can be seen from Table 1, there are numerous news related to the Euro area. We proceed

by investigating four quantitative indicators pointing to major macroeconomic and financial

news emanating from the Eurozone, indicators that are frequently followed by the market:

    (i) VIX S&P500 (DataStream: CBOEVIX), considered the “fear-gauge” of the global financial

markets.


2
    Following Taylor and Williams (2009) we define the global crisis period as August 7, 2007 onwards.
                                                          6
 (ii) EONIA Swap Index 3-Month (DataStream: EUEON3M), signifies a funding cost in

European money markets. The rate is a weighted average of overnight Euro interbank offer rate,

calculated by the European Central Bank.

 (iii) iTraxx Europe 5-Year Credit Default Swap Index (DataStream: DIXE5MC), considered a

measure of default risk in the European capital markets. The index is tied to the most liquid 125

CDS of the region’s investment grade credits.

 (iv) Fitch 1-Year Probability of Default Western Europe (DataStream: FPWE01Y), provides a

market view of credit condition.       The index is computed from Fitch’s proprietary default

database, containing approximately 27,000 entities globally, based on latest information on the

size of debt, equity price, and financial statement.

                                            [Table 1 here]

2.1 Events

While the focus is how the negative news from the Eurozone (e.g. an abrupt increase of the

European default risk) has influenced the financial markets and asset returns in emerging

markets, we would like also to contrast positive with negative news impacting our quantitative

measures. We apply an event study methodology to examining the reactions of the emerging

markets to the news. The first empirical task is to arrange the window for events that appear to

influence of volatility of the stock and bond returns of the emerging markets. As shown in

Figure 1, the daily plots of the global financial market indicators suggest that we need to

standardize the criteria to filter these financial market fluctuations.



                                                   7
                                          [Figure 1 here]

We use three criteria to filter the fluctuations of the four quantitative measures (VIX, EONIA,

ITRAXX, and FITCH): (a) the event is unanticipated; (b) the event is significant; (c) the event

attracts the media interests. Following criteria (a) and (b), we quantitatively select events that

have large effects, negatively or positively, on the global markets according to the fluctuation of

global market indices; each of the indices must increase by more than four standard deviations

(either negatively or positively) of their sample average to be considered as the empirical event

due to the Euro area. Next we supplement the criteria (c) to the quantitative selection of news

events based on (a) and (b), tracking qualitatively the associated market news in the publications

of Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and New York Times listed in Table 1. Following this

filtering procedure, we then extract the fluctuations of VIX, EONIA, ITRAXX, FITCH by

calculating their daily percentage changes, plotted in Figure 2: from January 2005 to December

2011, we have 95 events, 23 of which are negative news since the onset of Eurozone crisis in

October 2009. Note that the decomposition of variance for VIX, EONIA, ITRAXX, FITCH

suggests that each of these series movements are distinctive from the others as the series’ own

lags explain more than 80 percent of their variation.

                                          [Figure 2 here]

2.2 Returns

       Based on the MSCI stock and JP Morgan bond indices, we use their daily returns from

January 1, 2005 to December 12, 2011. Figure 3 plots the financial market movements based on

the equity returns and the bond returns by regions.

                                                 8
                                        [Figure 3 here]



 In our estimation, we account for the correlation across global market returns using the market

model

                                      ri,t = ai + birm,t + ei,t

where ri,t denotes the return of country i on day t; m denotes the global market; ei,t the

idiosyncratic error term. To estimate the normal returns, the above regression is done over the

estimation window period from day t-70 to day t-30 (40 trading day observations). We next

calculate the abnormal returns

                                      ei,t = ri,t - ai - birm,t

inferring the 5-day cumulative abnormal returns (i.e. 2 days before and after the event date).

Figure 4 provides the average abnormal return on days in which an event is bad news, for during

the Euro crisis period, outside the Euro crisis period, equity market return, and bond market

return.

                                        [Figure 4 here]

 As a first pass on the financial market linkages between the Euro area and the emerging

markets, we classify emerging markets according to the exposure of their economies to the Euro

area. The exposure to the Euro area is measured by the size of a country’s exports to the Euro

area divided by the GDP of the exporting country. In Figure 5, top row, we plot the average

equal-weighted abnormal 2-day before and after return of the emerging bond market ei,t(-2,2) on

days in which an event during a negative news worsens the financial markets in the Euro area.

                                                 9
In the bottom row, we plot the average abnormal return of the emerging stock markets. The left

column shows the abnormal returns during the Euro-area crisis (October 2009 to December

2011), whereas the right column shows the abnormal returns outside the crisis (prior to October

2009).

 As expected, for emerging bond markets in the high exposure group, the negative Euro-area

news has a negative effect on returns. This effect larger than the low exposure group outside the

crisis but smaller during the crisis. For emerging stock markets, the negative Euro-area news

had a negative effect on returns, and this effect was larger than the low exposure group during

the crisis but similar during the crisis. The evidence in Figures 4 and 5 supports the notion that

the stock market of the high exposure emerging markets are more sensitive to the Euro area

crisis. Nevertheless, the responses of the emerging markets during the Euro crisis are rather

small, ranging from -1.2 to -1.8 percent for the bond markets and -1.2 to -2.3 percent for the

stock markets. Comparing these results to the events outside the Euro area crisis, one can’t rule

out the possibility that emerging market investors have already anticipated and partially priced

their exposure in the overall market risks well before the troubles in the Euro area were put in the

spotlight.

                                           [Figure 5 here]

3 Empirical results

In this section, we report and discuss our main empirical results. Table 2 provides the baseline

results. The estimating specification is

      ei,t(-2,2) =  + (Global Crisis Period 0/1 indicator) + (Euro Crisis News 0/1 indicator)

                                                 10
                  + (Euro Crisis News  Country i Exposure to the Euro area) + ui,t

where ei,t(-2,2) is the 2-day before/after cumulative abnormal return for country i for the event on

date t. The estimation uses the fixed-effects method to control for the unobserved country

effects. The sample period of estimation is January 1, 2003 to December 12, 2011. Following

Taylor and Williams (2009) we define the global crisis period as August 7, 2007 onwards. As

discussed above, the Euro area crisis is defined as the period of October 8, 2009 onwards.

Hence,  measures the average effect of news events from the Euro area during the Euro area

crisis.  measures the interaction of news events from the Eurozone and country i exposure to

the Euro area, thus measuring the effects of news by accounting for economic linkages with the

Eurozone.

 We employ several measures of emerging markets’ exposure to the Euro area’s economy. Our

main measure of country i exposure is the size of country i’s exports to the Euro area divided by

the GDP of country i. As alternative measures, we also use as an indicator of economic

exposure:       market   capitalization,   saving/GDP,   trade   openness,    and      manufacturing

production/value added. In the following, Table 2 reports the estimation using country i’s

exports to the Euro area as a measure of exposure, investigating the market responses for the

whole sample of emerging markets, and by the region. Tables 3 and 4 provide the results using

the alternative measures of the economic exposure for the stock markets and the bond markets,

respectively.

 In Table 2, the first two columns use cumulative normal return of equity and bond market,

while the third and fourth columns use cumulative abnormal returns. The results suggest that

                                                 11
returns across equity and bond markets drop during the global crisis period. According to the

cumulative normal return, bad news from the Eurozone negatively affects the equity market;

good news positively affects the cumulative abnormal return of the equity markets.

 For Emerging Asia, the average returns of the bond markets have declined since the global

crisis period started, whereas the average returns of the stock markets are higher. The Asian

markets are largely insulated from the Euro area news, both positive and negative events. For

emerging market Latin America, both the stock and bond markets react uniformly and negatively

to adverse global crisis period news. While there is some evidence of positive abnormal returns

in the stock markets, the effect of the Euro area events on the Latin American markets during the

sample period is mostly insignificant. For emerging markets in the Eastern Europe, Middle East,

and Africa, both the bond and stock markets decline since the global crisis started. As for the

effect of the Euro area events on this region, the estimation shows that the cumulative normal

return of the stock market drop on the bad news (about -2.9 percent), while the cumulative

abnormal return of the bond markets declines on good news (about -0.4 percent).              We

consistently find the negative effect of global crisis news on the stock and bond returns of the

emerging markets. Yet, the estimation provides a mixed result on the impact of the Euro area

events.

                                         [Table 2 here]

 Using alternative measures of economic exposure, Tables 3 and 4 provide the responses the

equity markets and the bond markets, respectively. In Table 3, the effects of global crisis and

bad news from the Eurozone on the emerging stock markets are similar as the baseline results in

                                               12
Table 2. We also find that none of these alternative measures seems to explain the market

reaction.   The bond market reactions using different measures of exposure to the Euro crisis

events, reported in Table 4, suggest a similar pattern as in Table 2. Except the lower return in the

global crisis period, the bond markets are relatively less responsive to the news events from the

Eurozone and various measures of country exposure.

                                          [Table 3 here]

                                          [Table 4 here]

 Admittedly, there are limitations of using the regression analysis to the study the reaction of

emerging markets to news events from the Euro area. Subject to data availability, we employ the

market returns as a measure of market reaction. A more comprehensive set of market variables

will include both the returns and the investment inflow and outflow. These inflow and outflow,

as well as the net flow, cannot simply be extracted from the Balance of Payment data, but rather

from the detail micro data due to the retail and institutional investors.        With the flow of

investment data, our study could examine returns and flows, as well as asset allocation, across

the emerging stock and bond markets.

 Table 5 supplement the formal estimation with a matrix of sample correlation across the

market indicators and the Euro news events. We report there the statistical correlations among

the quantitative Euro financial indicators (EONIA, iTraxx, Fitch’s Probability of Eurozone

Default), and emerging market MSCI and EMBI returns (by regions), for the whole sample

period (top panel), pre-Euro-crisis (middle panel), and during the Euro crisis (bottom panel).

While the correlation between EONIA and iTraxx, both of which are the widely followed money

                                                13
market indicators, and the emerging market returns provide a mixed pattern, the correlation

between the (Fitch’s) probability of default of the Euro area and the emerging market returns are

uniformly negative across the sample periods and regions. Figures 6A and 6B provide graphical

evidence that seems consistent with these findings. While the correlation between the emerging

bond markets and iTraxx Western Europe in 6A does not have obvious patterns, the plot in 6B

suggests strong co-movements between the emerging stock market returns and probability of

default in the Western Europe over the sample period.

4 Conclusion

  The global crisis of 2008-2009 highlighted the continued vulnerability of developing

countries, even those armed with sound fundamentals, to major shocks emanating from advanced

economies despite their growing relative weight in the world economy. Although there were

considerable divergences among developing countries in terms of the magnitude of the impact,

with some regions and countries suffering more than others, the crisis had a pronounced impact

on the developing world as a whole. Even in developing Asia, the region least affected by the

global crisis, exports and growth plummeted during the trough of the global downturn – i.e. 4th

quarter of 2008 and 1st quarter of 2009 – and massive, forceful fiscal and monetary stimulus

were required to stave off a deeper and more protracted recession. For all the talk of de-coupling,

the US, EU and Japan still account for a sizable share of the world economy and remain key



                                                14
economic partners of developing countries. Therefore, negative developments in advanced

economies will still be felt, and felt tangibly, in developing countries.

 Just a couple of years removed from the global crisis, developing countries face another major

external shock from advanced economies. The eurozone sovereign debt crisis, which has its roots

in the unsustainably high public debt of eurozone periphery countries and heavy exposure of

eurozone banks to such debt, still awaits a fundamental resolution despite the European Central

Bank’s decisive provision of liquidity support since December 2011. Broadly speaking, there are

two channels through which the euro crisis could affect developing countries. First, the eurozone

remains a key trading partner and export market for many developing countries so a eurozone

recession will hurt their exports and growth. This is the trade channel. Second, financial

instability in the eurozone can contribute to financial instability in the developing countries. For

example, eurozone banks may sharply curtail their lending to developing countries to bolster

their balance sheets back home. Or, and this is the issue addressed in this paper, bad news which

rocks eurozone equity and bond markets may spill over into markets in developing countries.

 We use the event study methodology to analyze the effect of news from the eurozone on the

equity and bond markets of developing countries. Overall, the results from our event study

analysis provide a very mixed picture about the existence and magnitude of financial contagion

from eurozone to developing countries via the equity and bond markets. Our analysis covers both

the global crisis period and the more recent euro crisis period to allow for a comparison of their

effects on the financial markets of developing countries. We find that global crisis news had a

consistently negative impact on the returns of the equity and bond markets of developing

                                                 15
countries. In sharp contrast, we could not detect any systematic pattern in the effects of euro

crisis news on developing-country financial markets. Even where there was a significant effect,

the magnitude of the effect was smaller than during the global crisis. Our finding of a stronger

impact of global crisis is intuitively plausible since whereas the global crisis brought about

financial paralysis in both the US and EU, the euro crisis was (so far) largely confined to EU.

This figure provides the average abnormal return on days in which an event is bad news. The exposure to the Euro area
is measured by the size of a country’s exports to the Euro area divided by the GDP of the exporting country. The figure is
calculated from the daily data: the whole sample period is January 1, 2003 to December 12, 2011; the Euro area crisis is
the period starting October 8, 2009 onwards.
