               The Economic Foundations of East—West

             Migration During the Nineteenth Century



                              ABSTRACT



     This paper argues that latitude-specific investments in seeds

and human   capital   provided an incentive for farmers to move along

east-west lines. The incentives were greatest during the early and

mid 1800s. Towards the end of the century migration patterns changed

as farmers learned about farming in different environments, as

settlement reached the Great Plains and beyond, and    as   farming

declined in importance. Census manuscript schedules and Mormon

family-group records form the basis for empirical work.

      Migration from East to West is a familiar theme in the economic

  development of the United States during the nineteenth
                                                           century (Mathews,
 1909; Thornthwajte, 1934; Lathrop, 1949; Holbrook, 1950; Clark, 1959;

 Boue, 1963; Billinaton, 1967). After the Arrsrican Revolution pioneers

 developed lands west of the Appalachians and during
                                                        the ensuing decades
 settlement reached the region of the Mississippi River. By the l840s

 many observers argued that the "manifest destiny' of the United States

 was to occuoy and control the territory that lay in the path of settiernt

 to the Pacific Coast.

     Aithouch there are many accounts and descriptions of migration during

 the nineteenth century, the economic incentives behind ocographic patterns

of migration have been neglected. This
                                          paper investigates these incentives.
It is araued that latitude soecific
                                      investments in seeds and human capital
induced farmers to move alonc east-west lines.     The incentives were great-
est during the early and mid l800s, and the area between the Appalachians

and the Great Plains became stratified
                                         by migrants according to their place
of birth. The incentives weakened and migration Datterns changed towards

the end of the century as settlement reached the Great Plains and beyond,

as the economy industrialized, and as information about farming in different

environments became more readily available.     Empirical work is based on
samples from the 1860 manuscript schedules of population and Mormon family—

qrouo records.

                A Framework for AnalyzinQ Miqration Patterns

      Miqration is an investment that has costs and returns (Schultz,

1961, 1962; Sjaastad, 1962). The money costs include expenditures on

food, lodging, and transportation. The non-monetary costs include fore-

cone    earninas while traveling, searching for and learning a new job, and

the    osychic costs of leaving family and friends. The returns include a
positive or negative increment to a real earnings stream attributable to

a change in earninqs; a change in the costs of employment; or a change

in prices paid or received by the migrant.

       This framework elucidates the stratified pattern of migration observed

in the U.S. during the nineteenth century. Factors that influenced the

rate o return on this investment are discussed under the headings of

seeds, crops, livestock, human comfort and the home economy, and distance.


Seeds

       The photoperiodic adaptation of seeds, especially corn, to a particular

latitude probably contributed to east-west migration during the early

and mid 1800s. The response of plants to relative lengths of day and

night is called photoperiodism (Martin et al., 1976, pp. 44-45; Vince-

Prue, 1975). Photoperiodic responses are usually classified on the basis

of flowering. Short-day plants only flower or flower most rapidly with

fewer than a certain number of hours of light in each 24 hour cycle.

Long-day    plants only flower or flower most rapidly with more than a
certain number of    hours   of liqht in each 24   hour   cycle. Some plants
are day-neutral and flower irrespective of the photoperiodic conditions.
For example, small grains (except rice) are long-day plants in which
vecetable qrowth is stimulated (and flowering is delayed) by the short

days of late sprina. Corn arid rice are short-day plants in which

veoetative nroth is stimulated (and flowerino is delayed) by the long

days of early sumer; fioweririn is triocered by the shorter days of

su—--er. [ono-dav     or short—day olants that are crown outside their
latitude   of   adantation mature too early or too late for optimum perform-
ance.   Cotton is a day-neutral plant.

    The effects of       maladaptation on yields are evident from experiments
on corn. Fortunately, a variety o experiments were coducted at the

Illinois acricultural exoeriment station during the late 18s. As

a service to the oublic, the station at Champaiqn tested the claims of

commercial corn seed suppliers (University of Illinois, 1888-1894). From

1888 to 1893 the station acquired seeds that were adapted to about 80

different locations in the !H.;est and Northeast. Station personnel

crew the seeds under carefully controlled circumstances, and determined

yields at an 11 percent moisture content. They acquired some seeds from

anricultural exneriment stations.

    Corn yield oer acre was recressed on a second degree polynomial

in the distance of the seed source in miles north (+), south (—), east

     or west (-     of   Champaign.1 The exnlanatorv variables include dummies

in crop year that control for variations in weather. The reoression also

includes a dummy variable in type of seed source because seeds grown at

experiment stations nay have differed from commercial varieties in their

deqrees o adaptation to local conditions. The discussions in the experi-

ment station bulletins and the values of the crop year coefficients in
                                      L




Table 1 indicate that the ex:eriments were conducted under a variety of
weather conditions.
     The curves in Charts 1 and 2 depict expected viel d as a function of
distances east or est and north or south of Ehacoaiqn.2 Distance north
or south sharply reduced yield hut distance east or west had reatively
little effect. The yields of seeds adapted 250 miles south and 250 riles
north were only 62 and 72 percent, resnectively, of the yield of seed
adapted to Chaciaiqn.    Yields of seeds adapsed up to 250   miles east were

slhtly hher than those adapted to Charpa. on, vrereas tre yelo of
seeds adaoted 252 miles west was 93 percent of the yield of seeds apted

to Champaign.

     The phctoperiodic   resnonse is probably the dominant factor at work

in Chart 2. Other features of climate such as temperature or the tirriinn
and amount of preciErtation may have affected the yields niven in Chart 1
Differences in soils between place of adaptation and place of crcwth
probably played a small role (Goodino and Kiesselbach, 1931).
     Although the experiments were conducted at one place, i seems clear

from the mechanisms at work and from other experimental evidence that

the effects depicted in Charts 1 and 2 are relevant to any areas suitable

for corn agriculture. The results of experiments conducted at Linoln,

Nebraska during the l930s are similar to those found at Champaign (Kiese1-

bach, 1937).

     The sensitivity of corn yields of latitude of adaptation affected the

rate of return to migration. The first settlers who left a corrriunity

in search of better agricultural opportunities may have fanned out in

various directions. They probably took their own supplies of seed orain,
                                       5




including corn (Gray, 1932, p. 123;   Holbrook,   1950, p. 26; Clark, 1959,

. 2l4   Bociue, 1962, p. 128). Corn was an ideal crop for frontier con-

ditions: it reou-ired little seed bed prearation, little cultivation,

few tools, and unlike other crams, could be harvested leisurely. Even

thouch princinies of photoperiodsm 'ere unknown in the nineteenth

century, farmers observed its consequences. Farmers who went too far

north or south had poor yields, and sent relatively unfavorable reports

back to the community from which they left. Thus the reputations of

earicultural areas became established and influenced the migration patterns

o subsequent settlers. The importance & Early settlements in directing

later miaration is well established (Dunlevy and Genery, 1977).

    Plant adaptation probably had a tenorary effect on miqration. As

settlers acouired knowiedac about SEEdS adapted to different latitudes,

seed purchases would have short-circuited the rnecanisrn. Seed distrbution

by the 'JSDA beginning in the l8SDs (Boaue, 1963, p. 137) facilitated

the movement of migrants to different latitudes. After the mid l870s

state agricultural experiment stations distributed information that made

it easier for migrants to farm in a new environment. The earliest settlers,

thouah, may not have had the ontion to buy seeds adaDted to their new

locality. Furthermore, the knowiedae of adaptation was acouired and diffused

over a period of time that may have taken decades. Many factors other than

adaptation determined yields, including rainfall ,   temperature,   length of

the growing season, planting and cultivating methods, and soil. The type

of adantation discussed here was probably difficult to isolate because it

anplied only to certain plants, varied across plants that were affected,

and applied larcely to north-south as ooposed to east-west movements. In
                                            6




addition, the possible role of adaptation may not ave occurred to many

farmers in the pre-Darwinian era. The fact that the Illinois experiment

station conducted experiments on this question as late as the l890s

suggests that an important segment of the farming population lacked reliable

information on the effects.


Crops

        Climate, soil, and terrain determined th collection of crops that

were grown profitably in a given locality. Given local conditions, farmers

acquired skills in ar      effort   to increase yields. They   learned, for eample,
how and when to plow,      plant,   cultivate, and harvest various crops and

how best to cope with the rnge of local weather conditions. The techniques

required to grow profitably the major staples in United States agriculture

were    widely   discussed in the agricultural journals, monographs, and hand-

books of the early and mid 1800s. These sources are discussed in Bidwell

and Falconer (1925) and Gray (1933). The major agricultural periodicals

of the period include The Cultivator, The Prairie Farmer, The American

Farmer, The Farmer's Register, The Southern Cultivator, and DeBows Review.

        A farmer contemplating a move sought, other things being equal, a

location that maximized the return on previous investments in human capital;

namely, a place where the climate, soil, and terrain ere familiar. The

area from the Appalachians to the Great Plains was subdivided into regions

where cotton, tobacco, and grain were profitably grown. While the boundaries

of these regions were irregular and there was considerable overlap in some

areas, when seen from the perspective of the entire country these regions

approximately stratified this part of the United States along east—west
                                        7




 lines. Within these major cropping reons, venetation and sril strata

 as well as seed adaptation may have provided additional incentives to

 migrate within bands of latitude.

      Short-staple cotton required at least 200 days between frosts, and

 therefore was generally not grown north of the piedmont region of North

 Carolina, parts of Southern Tennessee, and northern Arkansas (Gray, 1933,

 pp. 868-893). Tobacco can be grown under a wide range of climatic

conditions,    but the value of the crop depends heavily on the envi rorrent
where it is grown (Martin et al., 1976, p. 849). During       the nineteenth

century   the most successful tobacco growing areas were in aryiand,
Virginia,    northern North Carolina, northern   Tennessee, Kentucky, southern
parts of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and in cental Missouri. Wheat can
he grown under a variety of climatic conditions, but is poorly adapted to

warm or most climates that promote parasitic diseases (artin et al.,

1976, pp. 433-434). During the nineteenth century most of the wheat raised

in the U.S. was grown in or north of the border states (Bidwell and

Falconer,    1925, pp. 316-338). Corn can be adapted   to a wide range of

environmental   conditions (Martin et al., 1976, p. 326); and during the
nineteenth   century this crop was widely grown in states east of the Great

Plains (Bidwell and Falconer, 1925, pp. 339-349).

     Through experience with their native environments, farmers learned

to evaluate soils by their color and vegetation that they supported

(Hulbert, 1930, pp. 68-82). Black soils, for example, conl.ained a lot

of humus and were generally fertile. Red soils were high in iron and

usually well-drained. Vegetation was thought to be a more informative

guide, however, because it revealed what soils produced under different
                                      8




climatic   conditions. Soils acquired reputations from the trees that
they grew, and terms such as "piney soil," "wbite oak land," and "chestnut
oak soil" came into use. Treeless areas such as the "bluegrass" region

of Kentucky were characterized by the types of grass vegetation. What-

ever the vegetation, thick growth usually indicated gooc soil, and thin

growth poor soil.

     Farmers who sought familiar soils and vegetation east of the Great

Plains were induced to move within hands of latitude. Zonal soil groups

roughly divide the North and the South at the southern edge of the border

states (Martin et al., 1976, p. 49). The South is characterized by red

and yellow soils, where much of the Northeast and Midwest (except prairie

areas) have a grey-brown podzolic (forest) soil.

     Similarly vegetation groups roughly divided the U.S. east of the

Great Plains into broad zones that induced migration to the West or the

Southwest (United States Department of Agriculture, 1936). Along the

southern Atlantic and Gulf plains, longleaf and loblolly pine forest pre-

dominated, whereas the upland areas of this region hEd an oak-pine forest.

Much of the land in the border states had a chestnut, chestnut oak, and

yellow poplar forest. Th€ Midwest (except for the prairies) was coered

with an oak hickory forest, and the northern Great Lakes regior' had a

birch, beech, maple and hemlock forest. Several species of trees imparted

a strata within these major forest reaions (Preston, 1976). Prairie

grasslands dominated much of the landscape west of Indiana.3


Livestock

     Animals tend to be genetically adapted to a particular climate (Hafex,

1968a,b), Types of adaptation include: (1) Body size and conformation.
                                            9



 Heat loss is a function of body size and surface area. Animals that

 are suited to cold climates tend to have a large body size with a relative-

 ly small surface area, relatively short legs, and small ears; (2) Hair

and skin. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and hair covering control the

irss of body heat. Animals that are adapled to cold clTates tend to have

dark-colored hair, pink or pale skin, thick skin, relatively few sweat

glands, thick heavy coats, and a thick layer of subcutaneous fat. Seasonal

variations in hair growth (shedding) are under photoperiodic control in

horses    and cattle. Animal productivity based on milk output, body      growth,
wool    growth among sheep, food consumption and fertility may be adversely

affected by rnaladaptation.

        Over a period of weeks or months a given animal may acclimatize to

an environment through thermoreculation, body fluid reaulation, and

cardiovascular regulation (Bianca, 1968; Whittow, 1968a,b; Macfarlane,

1968; Hensel, 1968). Chronic exnosure to either heat or cold affects

food intake, metabolic rates, hair coat thickness, and weght of internal

body organs, the amount of subcutaneous fat, and the composition of body

fluids.

        During the nineteenth century there was a tendency for regions to

specialize in certain types of livestock (Bidwell and Falconer, 1925,

p. 387—447; Gray, 1933, pp. 831-857). Oxen and horses have a relatively

small surface area relative to weight and were relatively common in the

North and border states. Mules are well adapted to warm clinates because

their long ears and legs expel excess body heat. Southern farmers observed

that mules withstood the heat better than horses (Southern Cultivator 11

(July   1843), p. 116;   Oliver,   1925, p. 173).   Southern observers of the
                                      10



debate over the best type of draft animal also pointed out that oxen were

of limited value in the South because they could not take the heat of

late spring and summer (Brooks, 1838, p. 500). Mule production was con-

centrated in the border states and exports were directed primarily to

the   South. Sheep and dairy cattle were concentrated in the NortL and to
some extent in the border states. Swine production flourished in Kentucky,
TEnnessee, and southern Ohio and Indiana.

       The regional stratification of livestcck types was refined to some

extent by specialized breeds. Regional adaptation was accomplished

during the Colonial Period by selective retention or disposal of animals

according to needs and animal productivity. The number of breeds multiplied

rapidly during the antebellum period by importing stock from Europe.        With-

in the North, dairy cattle were particularly well-adapted to the Great

Lakes region. Shorthorn cattle thrived in the relatively mild climate

of the Ohio Valley. Saxony sheep were small and produced a light fleece

and were best suited to the warmer parts of the North. Light saddle

horses flourished in the border state climate, whereas heavy draft horses

were generally produced and used further north.

       Optimal use of livestock types, and to some extent livestock breeds,

usually required skills particular to the type or breed. The best methods

to raise, train, and care for heavy draft horses, for example, represented

a considerable body of knowledge. The best methods to raise, train, and

care for livestock types and particular breeds were widely discussed in the

agricultural literature cited in the discussion of crops.

       Animals were suited or adapted to climate (particularly temperature)

zones, and human capital was tied to the animals. Other things being equal,
                                        11




 miorants there+ore had an incentive to move within a temperature zone.

 Except for mountain or coastal areas, temperature zones tended to follow

 lines of latitude (United States Department of Interior, 1970, po. 102—111).

Mountain and coastal areas, however, absorbed only a small portion of the

arricultural Donul ati on.


uuran Comfort and the Home FconoZ

     neonle acclimatize to a certFin environment over a period of weeks

or months (Hirsh, 1941). People accustomed to warm temperatures in

the South, for example, have low body-heat production and therefore

less enemy and less protection aaainst disease when travelino to colder

tenoeratures in the North. Southerners avoided going to far north in

Dart for this reason (Farmer's Reoister 6 (Dec. 1838), p. 521). People

adapted to cold temoeratures have high levels of heat production and

are uncomfortable at warm. temperatures.

     People acquired skills that enabled them to live comfortably in

a given environment. Settlers often built their own homes and the floor

plan, materials, methods of construction, and type of exterior treat-

ment reflected the climate (Pickerino, l°51, no. 19—25). A mild climate

encourane'! outdoor hymn and a rambhino architectural plan. Loo

cabins in Tennessee and georgia, for example, frequently had two sinqie

rooms separated by a passaqe with both units covered by a single roof

(Weslaoer, 196°, o. 72).     In Viroinia the kitchen was often removed

from the house itself. In the North houses were compact rather than

rambhino, windows were kept small, and usually a single large chimney

orovided heat.
                                    12




     Other types of latitude specific knowledge contributed to the

output of the home economy. Tastes for food and knowledae of recipes

depended on the crops that were profitably produced within the region.

People who lived south of the border states, for example, made

extensive use of corn and corn flour in part because small grains were

usually not nrown locally. It is clear that methods of preserving

and Drenaring meat were a function of climate (Buley, 1951, pp. 213—215).

eore ready—made clothino was aenerallv available in small towns and

rural areas, the home manufacture of warm clothes as vital for human

comort in the North.


P1 stance

     Imaaine, temporarily, that the frontier of settlement moved from

cast to west along a line of lonnitude. Then if the terrain of

the United States was uniform, it would be difficult to establish the

arciuments advanced so far in this paper versus the hypothesis that

farmers moved from east to west merely to minimize the distance traveled

to new land. However, the frontier did not move from east to west

alono a line of longitude and the terrain was not uniform. Kentucky

and Tennessee were the first states west of the Appalachians to be

settled. By 1815 the reaion of settlement west of the Appalachians

resembled a trianole with points at St. Louis, Pittsburah, and south-

east Tennessee. i distance to new land was the only consideration,

then many migrants would have moved north or south out of this triangle.

Yet relatively few settlers from the border states ventured north of

southern Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois (Mathews, 1909; Billinoton, 1960;
 Bocue, 1963); this was despite the fact that low cost water transporta-

 tion along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and their tributaries provided

 an incentive for neople from Kentucky and Tennessee to move into these

 areas. The 185fl census data on nativity show that migrants from Tennessee

 avoided states that were substantially outside the path of east-west

 settlement; only 10 oercent of those born in Tennessee but livina outside

 the state resided in Texas, Louisiana, or Iowa (U.S. Census Office, 1853,

p xxxvi).   Furthermore, immiorants prom Tennessee to Texas nreferred

the northern nart of the state (Lathrop, 1949, p. 35).

     The previous discussion does not deny that distance was a relevant

consideration in east-west mioration. It is clear, however, that distance

was not the only consideration.




                                  Results

     One must recoqnize that many factors other than investments in human

caoital were involved in the choice of a new living site by an individual

or family. The terrain influenced transportation costs and therefore

travel routes. The Valley of Viroinia and the Ohio River, for example,

de.Flected some minration rom the Mid-Atlantic States towards the South-

west. The timing o land surveys, land prices, the threat of Indian

attacks, and ooportunities to export agricultural surpluses by rail or

steamboat were also relevant. tJhi}e all of these factors may have been

exoaenous for an individual, some were endoaenous when analyzed from the

view of the economy as a whole. Land surveys, for example, were influenced

by anticipated demand for land, which was a function of the number of

Dotential miGrants living to the east. The farmers living in a particular
area probably had similar investments in human   capital;   if

the farmers were sufficiently numerous they may have influenced the course

of public policy or the plans of railway or steamboat companies. Invest-

rnAnts in human capital were therefore more important determinants of

aeooraohic natterns of miqration than analysis of the choices facing an

individual   would suggest.
     The analysis suggests several observable implications for behavior;

the data available to investicate these implications include local histories,

the published census, census manuscript schedules, and Mormon family—

aroup sheets. Local histories and mid-century published census data

establish a general east to west settlement pattern (Billinton, 1960).

Settlers from the 1iddle Colonies, for example, moved into Kentucky and

Tennessee. People from New Enaland, New York and Pennsylvania dominated

the settlement of )hio, while North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia

contributed heavily to the settlement of Alabama and Mississippi.

     Stratification of settlement by place of birth is evident within

states. New Enalariders, for exarnole, settled lamely in northern parts

of flhio, Indiana and Illinois and in southern parts of Michican and Wis-

consin (Mathews, 1909). People from Tennessee, Missouri, and Arkansas

settled in northeastern Texas (Lathrop, 1949, o. 35). Kentucky, Tennessee,

and Virninia settlers predominated in southern Indiana, Illinois, and

southeastern Iowa (Boque, 193, p. 15).


Manuscript Schedules

     The analysis suoaests that migration patterns depended on occupation.

Other things being equal, farmers had greater incentives than non-farmers
                                        15



 to move within hands of latitude. The population schedules of the census

 for Illinois in l60 can be used to test the hvoothesis that there was

 no difference in the miqration patterns of farmers and non-farmers.

 Illinois lay in the paths of settlers from many states and the state

therefore is well-suited for testing the hynothesis with census data.

     Table 2 sets forth the results of a sample of individuals who resided

in 18 Illinois counties in 1860. Amono those born out of state but in

the U.S., farmers were more likely than non-farmers to reside in a region

due west of their state of birth. Generally the non-farmers born in a

aiven reaion were more dispersed up and down the state than were farmers.

The patterns of birth and residence for farmers and non-farmers were
    -.            .                 4
sianificantly different at 0.005.

     Although the results for farmers versus non-farmers are consistent

with the hypothesis that occupation was a determinant of destination,

there was considerable stratification among non-farmers. Among non—

farmers one can reject the hypothesis at 0.fl05 that region of residence

in Illinois and reaion of birth were indeDendent (chi-square     4P6.4,
d.f. =   12).   It should be observed, however, that the category of non-

farmers includes occupations such as farm laborers that were tied to

faming; thus some of the stratification observed among non-farmers

may have been related to the acquisition of agricultural skills.    En

addition, some children who moved into Illinois as part of a farm family

were adults in 1860 who may have chosen non-farm occupations. The first

permanent settlers in a region were larcely farmers, and migration studies

have found (Dunlevy and Gemery, 1977) that later migrants often seek
                                       16




settlements comprised of people with a cultural background similar to

their own. Thus, for example, non-farmers born in New England might have

earned equal incomes in northern and southern parts of Illinois, but chose

to reside in the northern part because of ties to farmers from New England.


Family-rouo Sheets

     The family-qrouo sheets, described in the Appendix, contain information

on the county of oricin and destination, father's age at the time of the

move, and the year of the move. The objects of investigation are the

determinants of the extent to which people left or remained in a familiar

environment. The dependent variable in the regression analysis is the

number of miles moved north (+)   or   south (-4-);   movement in either of these

directions is an approximate measure of the degree of departure from a

familiar environment.5 Although occupation is unknown in these data, the

extent of urbanization in the county of destination at the tine of the

move is a proxy for this variable; the hiqher the percentage that lived

in cities or towns the more likely it was that the migrant had a nonfarm

occupation or was leavinq aariculture in search of a nonfarm occupation.

The exoected e-ect of this variable on the dependent variable is positive.

     Farmers who moved from the timberland and prairies onto the Great

Plains confronted a new farming environment in which previous investments
                                                             Furthermore, in the
in human capital were less applicable (Webb, 1931).

reoions of the Rocky Mountains and the Far West relatively more of the

labor force was involved in nonfarm occupations such as mining and the

fur trade. Moves to or within the West should have been less along lines

of latitude than those within the East and the Midwest. An independent
                                    17




variable representing region of destination within the West is therefore

included in the regression. The expected effect of this variable is

positive.

     Miaration to a new farmino environment requires investment in new

skills. Since the outlays on this investment are concentrated in the

early Dart of the investment peiod, the net present value of this invest-

ment is directly related to the expected lenath of the payback period.

Consequently old compared to young farmers should have been more reluctant

to move outside a familiar zone of latitude. Father's aae should have a

negative effect on the dependent variable.

     Migrant farmers probably fanned out from a particular areas Some

may have been tempted to go suhstantiallynorth or south by attractive

opportunities in other crops; tobacco and grain farmers who left the

Chesapeake area for the cotton lands of the Southwest are an example.

Others may have been tempted out of a familiar environment by favorable

land prices in a different farming environment or by the attraction of

family or friends engaoed in nonagricultural pursuits. The oredorninant

pattern, however, was alone east-west lines. If the arguments of this

paper are correct, then an independent variable that measures miles moved

east (+) or west (+) should have a coefficient that is substantially

less than 1.

     The independent variables also include a polynomial in time. The

polynomial may caoture fluctuations in transportation costs, variations

in land oolicv, and changes in land prices.

     Table 3 gives the estimated relationship. The urban, West, and distance

moved east or west variables perform according to expectations. The
                                      18



father's age variable has the wrong sion and is statistically insignif-

icant, possibly because the sample is demographically selective with

resoect to father's ane and the presence of children. Young, unattached

men who may have been willin to move to a new anricuitural environment

are   excluded from the sanple. The time variables are jointly significant
at only   .2), which suaqests that relevant time related effects have not

been exclurled from the recression.

      The equation in Table 3 was estirated for the time period 1800 to

1874. Estimation by subperiods indicates that the explanatory power of

the model declined durino the late 1800s. The incentives to move within

zones of latitude diminished in the late l800s as farmers acquired

information and seeds relevant to farming in different environments.

Furthermore, the percentaoe of nonfarmers in rural counties probably

increased towards the end of the century.



             Conclusions and Sunoestions for Further Research

      armers acquired latitude soeciic skills in an effort to increase

output under local conditions. These investments provided an incentive

for farmers to miorate alono east-west lines.. Farmers who moved too far

north or too far south sacrificed crop yields, animal productivity, human

comfort, and output jr   the home economy. The incentives diminished and
national miqration patterns chanoed durinc the late iSOOs as farmers

learned about farming in different environments, as settlement reached

the (reat Plains and beyond, and as agriculture declined in importance.

      This research has several potential applications. First, much of

the continental United States was acquired at a time when incentives to
                                    19



migrate within zones of latitude were important. The political tensions

and negotiations, and the military conflict that were part of this

process miqht be understood better in light of these incentives. Second,

miorants take attitudes and ideals from their place of oriciin and often

leave family and friends behind. A stratified migration pattern implies

a stratified arrangement of attitudes, ideals, and family ties that may

last for years or decades, and vestices o which may last for generations.

This work may contribute to our understandino of the origins of regional

differences in votinq behavior, educational systems, religion, and forms

of local governrent. Third, the analysis may shed light on geographic

patterns of trans-Atlantic migration. It offers, for example, an explana-

tion of why European immigrants avoided the American South.

1. A separate rearession also included variables involving third degree

    oolvnornial terms; the coefficients of these variables are jointly

    sioniicant at only 0.25, which sunoests that the second degree

    formulation is adeouate. Distances from Charnoaign were determined by

    using latitude and longitude coordinates (United States Cemartnent of

    Interior, 1Q70) or Chamoaiqn and for the town, city, or township where

    the seed originated. Kirkham (1976) was useful for locating obscure towns.

2. The regression isthe source o the curves. The curves give equal weight

    to each crop year and sample mean weiaht to the variable Exp. An

   attemut was made to calculate "equal yield contours' for the yield

   surface, but the seed source locations are not distributed in a way that

   provides useful results.

3. The imDortance of experience with a particular environment is indicated

   by early settlers who avoided the Midwestern prairies. The great

   value of the prairies to agriculture is well-known today, but first gener-

   ation settlers were suspicious of land that grew no timber (Bidwell and

   Falconer, 1925, pp. 158-159). Their skills were adapted to preparing

   forest land for agriculture, and wood was the basic ingredient for their

   houses, furniture, bridoes, fencing, farm tools, and fuel. Through

   experiments conducted on prairie land at the edge of the fcrest,

   settlers learned about the productivity of this sail and were then willing

   to invest in the skills and capital equipment necessary tc farm or the

   prairies (McManis, 1964, pp. 86-88). They leErned. for example, to break

   the tough prairie sod with several yokes of oxen and a heavy plow, to make

   houses out of sod or bricks, and to make hedges serve as fences.

                    Appendix:   The Familv-(roup Records

       The (enealoaical Library in Salt Lake City contains several million

family-group records that give the date, county, and state (or country)

of birth of the parents and children in a family. A change in the county

of birth between successive children implies a migration.

       Two samoles from the collection comprise the data base for this

paper. The first is a samole of 1,682 family-group records, containing

3O   moves, drawn as part of the preliminary work on the economics of

mortality (The oroject is discussed in Focel et al., 1978). A second

sample of family group records was selected by stratifying by state

and time period in the nineteenth century. Records in the second sample

were selected only if they contained at least one migration. Religious

motives may have been important in Mormon migration. The pattern of moves

to, from, or within Utah was more dispersed and sionificantly different

from the pattern in all other moves. Moves to, from, or within Utah are

therefore not considered in this investigation of the non-religious

deterininants of migration patterns. The combined samples contain 514 moves.

       It should he observed that these data differ in certain respects

from   the population that miarated during the nineteenth century. The
data base includes no single individuals and is biased towards large
families. Althouoh the family-aroup records were assembled largely by
Mormons during the last 50 years, only a small fraction of their ancestors
were Mormons (Fooel et al., 1978, p. 79). Despite attempts to gain
representation by region and time period, approximately 65, 16, and 19
oercent of the states of origin in the sample are in the North, South,
and West, resoectively. The corresponding percentages in the population
                                    23



in 1870 were 64, 30, and 6. The sample contains migrations in every

decade of the nineteenth century, but ap?roximately 50 percent of the moves

occurred after 1870.

     One can correct or adjust for the influence of some deficiencies

in the sanle. rvertheiess, until more is kno'n about migration patterns

contained in the family Group records, it is advisable to interpret

these data as a special sample that ray   differ   from the population in

important ways.
