Trade, Foreign Investment, and Industrial Policy for Developing Countries

JEL No. F0,O0

                                               ABSTRACT

In this paper we explore the popular but controversial idea that developing countries benefit from abandoning
policy neutrality vis-a-vis trade, FDI and resource allocation across industries. Are developing countries
justified in imposing tariffs, subsidies, and tax breaks that imply distortions beyond the ones associated
with optimal taxes or revenue constraints? We refer to this set of government interventions as "industrial
policy". We explore the theoretical foundation for industrial policy and then review the related empirical
literature. We follow this with a broader look at the empirical work on the relationship between trade
and FDI and growth. In this review, we find little evidence that countries benefit from "hard" interventions
that distort prices to deal with Marshallian externalities, learning-by-exporting, and knowledge spillovers
from FDI. We discuss an alternative set of "soft" industrial policies that deal directly with the coordination
failures that may arise within the sectors or clusters where the country has a comparative advantage.

1    Introduction
      “. . . growth was not a passive, trickle-down strategy for helping
      the poor. It was an active, pull-up strategy instead. It required
      a government that would energetically take steps to accelerate
      growth, through a variety of policies including building infrastruc-
      ture such as roads and ports and attracting foreign funds."

               Jagdish Bhagwati, In Defense of Globalization (2004)

    During the last three decades, developing countries have made enormous
strides in opening up their protected domestic markets to international trade
and foreign investment. Yet most countries have not simply opened up their
markets. They have also instituted a range of policies to encourage exports,
attract foreign direct investment (FDI), promote innovation, and favor some
industries over others. This leads to the following question: is openness
to trade and FDI alone su¢ cient to achieve high growth rates in develop-
ing countries? If harnessing the gains from globalization requires additional
policies, can we identify them? While some types of complementary policies,
such as building roads and ports, are not controversial, others are. Bhag-
wati’s suggestion to "attract foreign funds" implies tilting incentives in favor
of foreign investors, which means abandoning policy neutrality. Our goal in
this chapter is to explore the popular but controversial idea that developing
countries bene…t from abandoning policy neutrality vis-a-vis trade, FDI and
resource allocation across industries.
    Policy neutrality does not necessarily mean free trade, or a neutral stance
regarding taxation of multinational corporations, or even a common tax
structure for all industries. Both optimal tax theory and practical …scal
considerations imply that countries (especially poor ones) will often want to
rely on tari¤s as a source of revenue or set di¤erent tax rates across indus-
tries. Are developing countries justi…ed in imposing tari¤s, subsidies, and tax
breaks that imply distortions beyond the ones associated with optimal taxes
or revenue constraints? We refer to this set of government interventions as
"industrial policy".
    The presence of externalities is the main theoretical justi…cation for de-
viating from policy neutrality. Learning externalities from exports could
justify export subsidies; knowledge spillovers from foreign companies could
justify tax breaks for FDI; production externalities in "advanced" sectors

                                       1
could justify infant-industry protection or other measures to expand those
industries. We begin this review with a series of simple models to highlight
the role of Marshallian and inter-industry externalities, industry-level rents,
sector-speci…c coordination failures and information spillovers as a rationale
for industrial policy ("IP").
    The main message that emerges from this review is that the theoretical
justi…cation for infant-industry protection requires at a minimum either that
the country have a latent comparative advantage in the protected industry
or that the international price for this industry is higher than warranted by
the true opportunity cost of this good in the rest of the world. Moreover, for
protection to deliver large gains, the protected industry must exhibit large
Marshallian externalities. In contrast to the temporary trade barriers as-
sociated with infant-industry protection, permanent protection of a sector
may raise welfare if it generates positive externalities to other sectors. In all
these models, however, other policies may be more e¢ cient than protection.
Even when protection could improve welfare, a production subsidy would be
more e¢ cient since it avoids the temporary consumption losses associated
with protection. In addition, protection may not work if the market failure
is due to sector-speci…c coordination problems, since tari¤-induced growth
does not necessarily help to solve coordination failures. Finally, just as R&D
subsidies can address the externalities arising from innovation spillovers, poli-
cies to promote entry into new industries can address information spillovers
associated with the discovery of new pro…table activities.
    While government intervention could address a number of market failures
in theory, one key question is whether IP has been successful in practice. The
theoretical discussion is followed by a review of the empirical literature on
industrial policy in Section 3. One challenge that we face in evaluating the
empirical literature is the large gap between the theoretical justi…cation for
IP and the quantitative work that has been done to evaluate its e¤ectiveness.
Even if we could show that protected sectors grow faster, for example, this
is not su¢ cient evidence to claim that IP increases welfare.
    Despite this shortcoming, we proceed in Section 3 to evaluate three di¤er-
ent approaches to measuring the e¤ectiveness of infant-industry protection.
The …rst approach focuses on particular industries that have received protec-
tion, such as the steel rail industry in the US and the semiconductor industry
in Japan. The few existing studies of this nature suggest that the conditions
necessary to generate positive net welfare gains from infant industry protec-
tion are di¢ cult to satisfy in developing countries.

                                       2
    A second empirical strategy exploits the variation in productivity growth
and di¤erent measures of support (including protection and production sub-
sidies) across industries to see whether supported industries exhibit faster
growth. The challenge here is that tari¤s and quotas are frequently imposed
for reasons other than the pursuit of industrial policy. If we cannot identify
the motive for protection, then it is di¢ cult to evaluate the consequences of
IP via trade policy instruments. Generating …scal revenue, improving terms
of trade, and political considerations (rent-seeking) are likely to be just as
important as infant-industry considerations in explaining the pattern of trade
policy and other measures of support.
    Finally, a third approach studies the connection between trade policy and
economic growth, both by focusing on particular countries (e.g., South Korea
and Taiwan) and by considering the entire cross section of countries. While
the literature on trade and growth linkages faces many challenging problems,
in Section 4 we suggest two general lessons that may be drawn from the vo-
luminous evidence. First, there was no signi…cant relationship in the second
half of the twentieth century between average protection levels and growth.
Second, there is a positive association between trade volumes and growth.
We interpret the lack of a signi…cant association between average tari¤s and
growth, combined with the strong relationship between trade shares and
growth, to suggest that any successful IP strategy must ultimately increase
the share of international trade in GDP. The fact that so many countries
have been unsuccessful in o¤setting the anti-trade bias of their interventions
may explain why so many have failed to succeed at IP.
    We also review a new set of studies that emphasize the complementarity
between trade and FDI reforms and other government policies. These studies
suggest that trade liberalization will not generate faster growth unless accom-
panied by changes in other parts of the economy, such as reducing barriers
to new …rm entry, encouraging more ‡exible labor markets, and improving
infrastructure. These new studies are consistent with one of the most im-
portant new theoretical developments in international trade: the emphasis
on heterogeneous …rms. The new heterogeneous trade models suggest a new
mechanism through which trade a¤ects productivity growth: greater com-
petition forces less productive …rms to exit and increases the market share
of more productive …rms. In this framework, gains from trade cannot be
realized when there are barriers to …rm exit and expansion, which suggests
a need to take into account complementary policies on entry and exit. We
…nish Section 4 with an analysis of whether learning-by-exporting seems to

                                      3
be quantitatively important, and a discussion of the empirical evidence re-
garding other mechanisms through which trade policy might a¤ect growth.
    Aside from intervening in trade, many developing countries deviate from
policy neutrality by introducing tax breaks and other policies to attract for-
eign direct investment (FDI). While economists are generally skeptical re-
garding the bene…ts of intervening in trade, they are much more likely to
have interventionist priors when it comes to FDI. In Section 5, we review the
micro studies which have identi…ed a number of important e¤ects of inward
foreign investment ‡ows. While most of the empirical literature focuses on
productivity spillovers, there is also a growing literature that examines ex-
port promotion through foreign investment, input linkages, and labor market
e¤ects. We argue that FDI is associated with technology transfer and pos-
itive labor market outcomes in developing countries, but that the empirical
literature on FDI does not show evidence of horizontal spillovers, and that
bene…ts from vertical spillovers may not exceed the cost of FDI subsidies.


2       The Theoretical Justi…cation for Industrial
        Policy
The textbook model of IP is based on the idea that some sectors or in-
dustries exhibit Marshallian externalities, which are local externalities that
increase with the size of the industry. These externalities can arise through
localized industry-level knowledge spillovers, input-output linkages together
with transportation costs to ensure that the externalities remain local, and
labor pooling (see Marshall, 1920, and Krugman, 1991). Marshallian exter-
nalities give rise to geographic agglomeration of industries (e.g., software in
Silicon Valley), which have been emphasized in the literature on economic
geography.
    The simplest model of IP entails a small-open economy with two sectors,
1 and 2. Sector 1 has constant returns to scale while Sector 2 has Marshallian
externalities. The key result is that under some conditions there are mul-
tiple equilibria, with the equilibrium with complete specialization in Sector
2 being superior to the one with complete specialization in Sector 1.1 One
    1
    Multiple Pareto-ranked equilibria can also arise in a closed economy, although the
behavior of prices makes this less likely. This is because as one sector is expanding, the
relative price moves against this sector, and this may rule out multiplicity. See Murphy,



                                            4
could say that the economy has a "latent" comparative advantage in Sector
2 but that a coordination failure prevents it from exploiting this advantage.2
Since the realization of Marshallian externalities is likely to take some time,
it is customary to talk about countries having a "dynamic" comparative ad-
vantage (Wade 1990, Amsden 1989) in sectors other than the ones in which
they are currently specialized, and to think of industrial policy as the way to
undertake the necessary transformation to capitalize on that dynamic advan-
tage. We think of this as the main theoretical justi…cation for infant-industry
protection.
     The following subsection presents a simple static model that formally
captures this idea for an economy facing exogenous international prices. We
then move on to endogenize these prices based on production costs in the rest
of the world, and then show how the results extend to a dynamic framework.
     If the South does not have a latent comparative advantage in the advanced
sectors likely to have Marshallian externalities, is there still a case to be
made for an IP that would promote a structural transformation towards
those sectors? In Subsection 2.2 we show that there are indeed conditions
under which this is the case. In particular, IP can increase welfare in two
scenarios: …rst, when there are rents associated with the advanced sector, so
that its international price is high relative to its cost; and second, when there
are inter-industry externalities, so that a large advanced sector increases the
economy’s productivity across the board.
     Marshallian externalities arise as an automatic consequence of the scale
of the sector: a sector necessarily experiences an increase in productivity as
it becomes larger. As argued by Baldwin (1969), however, the expansion of a
sector does not always bring about positive agglomeration externalities. Such
agglomeration e¤ects may instead depend on the way in which production
is carried out. In other words, externalities may not be intrinsic to sectors,
but to the way in which they are organized (Rodríguez-Clare, 2007). In this
case, a sectoral reallocation of resources is not enough; import substitution,
for example, may allow an economy to expand its manufacturing sector, but
production may take place in unsophisticated ways and no "clustering" ben-
e…ts may materialize. In Subsection 2.3 we present a model where, instead
of Marshallian externalities, sectors present opportunities for collective ac-
Shleifer and Vishny (1989).
   2
     There are other rationales that have been discussed for industrial policy, including
…nancial market imperfections. We ignore these arguments in this chapter (see Baldwin
1969 for an early criticism, and Pack and Saggi, 2006, for a recent survey).


                                           5
tion that increases their productivity by a certain amount (which may be
di¤erent across sectors). If there are no rents (i.e., if international prices
perfectly re‡ect production costs in the North), then the best policy is sim-
ply to exploit the opportunities for collective action in the sectors where the
economy is specialized. Under more general conditions, we show that sectors
that could bene…t most from IP would be ones that have large opportunities
for productivity-enhancing collective action, or that have high world demand
relative to the combined size of countries that have achieved such collective
action.
    In Subsection 2.4 we turn to IP aimed at "diversi…cation." This is some-
thing that is often stated as a goal by many countries. We present a simple
model where diversi…cation is linked to productivity and argue that if there
is a market failure reducing the level of diversi…cation below the optimal one
(as in Hausmann and Rodrik, 2003), then a policy of encouraging discovery
and diversi…cation would indeed be welfare enhancing.

2.1     Multiple Equilibria and Latent Comparative Ad-
        vantage
We …rst present a static model with exogenous prices, and then discuss the
implications of the model when prices are determined by production costs in
the rest of the world.

2.1.1    Exogenous international prices
There is a small economy, which we call "South," two goods and one factor of
production, labor, in …xed supply, L.3 Good 1 is produced with constant re-
turns to scale (CRS) and no aggregate externalities: a unit of labor produces
  1 units of good 1. Good 2 is produced with constant returns to scale at the
…rm level, but there are aggregate externalities, so that labor productivity
is:
                             2 1 + M in(L; L2 )

with   > 0 and          1 + L > 1. The term 1 + M in(L; L2 ) captures
Marshallian externalities that are increasing with industry-wide employment,
  3
    This subsection follows Rodríguez-Clare (2007). Models of multiple equilibria in a
small open economy include Okuno-Fujiwara, 1988, Rodríguez-Clare, 1996, Rodrik, 1996,
Ciccone and Matsuyama, 1996.


                                          6
L2 , but that are exhausted once the labor force in a sector reaches the level
L. The term can be seen as the maximum bene…ts of clustering in sector
2.4 We assume that the total labor supply in South is higher than L, so that
if there is complete specialization in good 2 then productivity is 2 .
    Let pi be the international price of good i and let p    p2 =p1 . Let us derive
a condition under which there are multiple equilibria, with one equilibrium
characterized by complete specialization in good 1 and the other by complete
specialization in good 2. We …rst check that specialization in good 1 is an
equilibrium. Letting w denote the wage in South, then w = p1 1 if South
is specialized in good 1. The unit cost of producing good 2 in South given
that all labor is devoted to production of good 1 (and hence no bene…ts of
clustering are realized) is w= 2 . Hence complete specialization in good 1 is
an equilibrium if and only if 1 = 2 p . Similarly, complete specialization
in good 2 implies p2 = w= 2 , and hence this is an equilibrium if and only
if 1 = 2      p . Thus, there is multiple equilibria if and only if the following
condition holds,
                                p      1= 2     p                               (1)
    Without loss of generality, in the following discussion we restrict attention
to the case in which this condition holds with strict inequalities. If there are
multiple equilibria, which equilibrium yields higher wages? In the equilibrium
with complete specialization in good 1 the wage is w = p1 1 , whereas in the
other equilibrium we have w = p2 2 . If condition (1) is satis…ed with strict
inequalities then p 2 > 1 , so wages are higher in the equilibrium with
complete specialization in good 2.5
   4
     In the traditional model, L is in…nite, so labor productivity is simply 2 (1 + L2 ).
The alternative assumption that these aggregate externalities are bounded is not only
more realistic, but also leads to a simpler analysis. Moreover, this assumption allows us to
focus on the issue of latent comparative advantage, as opposed to advantages arising from
di¤erences in size or scale. For an analysis where scale (but not infant-industry protection)
takes center stage, see Ethier (1982), which formalizes the discussion relating to Frank
Graham’s argument for protection (Graham, 1923). Scale e¤ects could be captured in the
model presented here by assuming that L is large; in this case small countries could not
exhaust the Marshallian externalities even if they specialized completely in industry 2.
   5
     The result of multiple Pareto-ranked equilibria can be converted into one of devel-
opment traps by introducing proper dynamics in the model (see Krugman, 1991 and
Matsuyama, 1991). Under some conditions, the economy may be specialized in the good
in which it doesn’t have latent comparative advantage, and there may be no equilibrium
taking it to specialization in the other good. Government intervention in this case would
require more than simple coordination to select the good equilibrium.


                                             7
    We will say that South has a latent comparative advantage in good i if
the opportunity cost of this good given the realization of all Marshallian
externalities is lower than the international price.6 For good 1 this entails
   2= 1    1=p , whereas for good 2 this is 1 = 2 p . Thus, condition (1)
with strict inequalities implies that South has a latent comparative advantage
in good 2. The equilibrium with specialization in good 1 is possible because
in this case Marshallian externalities are not realized, and hence the latent
comparative advantage of South in good 2 is not what determines the pat-
tern of specialization. Thus, the previous results (i.e., existence of multiple
equilibria and the fact that generally the equilibrium with specialization in
good 2 yields higher wages than the one with specialization in good 1) can be
reinterpreted as saying that a country may be specialized in a sector where it
doesn’t have a latent comparative advantage, and that in this case a policy
that induces the economy to switch to the equilibrium with specialization
in the good where there is a latent comparative advantage could be welfare
enhancing (see discussion below).
    Figure 1 illustrates the previous results. The curve labeled P P F repre-
sents the Production Possibilities Frontier for South, which is convex when
L2 < L (or Q2 < 2 L) and becomes linear when L2               L (or Q2     2 L).
The curve labeled P P FN C is the hypothetical Production Possibilities Fron-
tier when there are no Marshallian externalities (i.e., = 0), given simply
by a line with slope 1 = 2 , as in the standard Ricardian model. Note that
the slope of the P P F is the same as the slope of P P FN C at the corner where
there is complete specialization in good 1. Thus, if the international relative
price of good 2 (i.e., p2 =p1 ) is lower than 1 = 2 there is an equilibrium with
complete specialization in good 1, whereas if p2 =p1 is higher than the slope of
the PPF along its linear segment - namely, 1 = 2 - then there is an equilib-
rium with complete specialization in good 2. Clearly, then, if (1) is satis…ed,
there are multiple equilibria, with the equilibrium with specialization in good
2 delivering a higher consumption possibilities frontier for South.
    The standard case for infant industry protection or IP can now be stated
simply by saying that if the South is specialized in good 1, then a high
enough tari¤ would lead this economy to satisfy its own consumption of
good 2. This would allow the South to realize the bene…ts of the Marshallian
externalities associated with this sector, and thereby shift the equilibrium
  6
   If Marshallian externalities take time to be realized, then one could talk about a
dynamic comparative advantage. See Redding (1999).

towards complete specialization in good 2.7 At that point the tari¤ would
no longer be needed, and the economy could maintain free trade.
    Sauré (2007) presents an interesting and novel argument for why protec-
tion may fail to generate the results predicted by this model. He assumes
that goods 1 and 2 are tradable inputs into the production of a …nal non-
tradable good via a "modern technology." The key assumption is that the
…nal good can also be produced directly from labor with a "traditional tech-
nology" which exhibits CRS (no Marshallian economies). Under some con-
ditions protection makes the modern technology unpro…table because of the
increase in the price of input 2. Thus, rather than increasing production
of the good with Marshallian externalities, protection leads to the contrac-
tion of the whole modern sector and a reallocation of resources towards the
traditional sector.

2.1.2         International prices determined in North
The previous discussion takes international prices as exogenous. But prices
are (at least in part) determined by productivity levels in the rest of the world.
     7
         We assume here that the South is su¢ ciently large that under autarky it would have
L2        L.


                                               9
One would imagine that rich countries are already enjoying the lower costs
associated with clustering in sector 2, so these lower costs would be re‡ected
in p . Thus, for a small country to have a latent comparative advantage in
sector 2, it must have some deep parameters that confer it such an advantage.
To see this, imagine now that there are two countries, North and South,
which may di¤er in the productivity parameters, 1 and 2 , so that there are
exogenous international productivity di¤erences (independent of Marshallian
externalities) in the production of both goods 1 and 2. Imagine further that
South is small, so that prices are determined in North as if it were a closed
economy. Choosing labor in North as the numeraire, international prices
are simply given by the North’s unit labor requirements. Assuming that in
equilibrium L2N L then p1 = 1= 1N and p2 = 1= 2N , so p = 1N = 2N .
Note that the bene…ts of clustering are re‡ected in a lower international
relative price of good 2. This will be important in the analysis that follows.
    Imagine …rst that there are no Ricardian productivity di¤erences, ji = 1
for all j = S; N and i = 1; 2. Using (1) it is easy to con…rm that there are
multiple equilibria in South (since p = 1= then condition (1) is 1=         1
1), but since the second part of (1) is satis…ed with equality, then the wage is
the same in both equilibria. Thus, although there are multiple equilibria, the
wage is not higher in the equilibrium with specialization in good 2. This is
because even though the economy bene…ts from clustering in this equilibrium,
this is exactly compensated by the lower price of this good, which in turn
arises from the higher productivity in North derived from clustering.
    The equilibrium with specialization in good 2 may yield higher wages than
the one with specialization in good 1 if we allow for exogenous productivity
di¤erences. In particular, the equilibrium with specialization in good 2 will
have higher wages if the South has a latent comparative advantage in the
good subject to clustering. To see this, drop the assumption that ji = 1 for
all j; i, and assume instead that

                               2S = 1S   >    2N = 1N                     (CA)

The condition for multiple equilibria (i.e., condition (1)) is now (using p =
 1N = 2N )
                      1N =   2N     1S = 2S      1N = 2N                   (2)
The second inequality is satis…ed given (CA), so there is always an equilib-
rium with specialization in good 2. The …rst inequality (needed for there to


                                         10
be an equilibrium with specialization in good 1) is satis…ed if and only if

                                        2S = 1S
                                                                                        (3)
                                       2N = 1N

That is, the South’s comparative advantage in sector 2 must be weaker than
the bene…ts of clustering.
    The analysis here is exactly as above, with condition (2) replacing condi-
tion (1). Condition (CA) is necessary for South to have a latent comparative
advantage in good 2, and this is necessary for the wage with specialization
in good 2 to be higher and for IP to raise wages for South.
    An important point to note is that for the gains from IP to be large we
need South to have a strong latent comparative advantage in good 2. But
then condition (3) implies that Marshallian externalities must also be high
for there to be multiple equilibria. We can conclude that IP generates large
gains only if the sector that would be promoted exhibits both a strong latent
comparative advantage and large externalities.
    One can enrich the model to generate some additional implications. For
example, if sector 2 is intensive in physical and human capital relative to
sector 1, then if South is specialized in 1 this goes together with low levels of
both types of capital and a lower level of TFP than if it were specialized in
sector 2 (Ciccone and Matsuyama, 1996, Rodríguez-Clare, 1996). A policy
to shift resources towards sector 2 would then generate endogenous accumu-
lations of capital, as observed in East Asian countries. In other words, some
LDCs may have low capital stocks as well as low TFP as a consequence of
not exploiting their latent comparative advantage.8

2.1.3    Dynamic externalities
Here we extend the model to allow for dynamic Marshallian externalities,
as in Bardhan (1970), Krugman (1987), Lucas (1988), Redding (1999) and
Melitz (2005). To do so, we assume that productivity in sector 1 in country
i is 1i , just as above, whereas productivity in sector 2 in country i at time
t is now Ait 2i 1 + M in(L; L2it ) . Letting aSt        max fASt =AN t ; 1g and
aN t max fAN t =ASt ; 1g, we assume that Ait grows thanks to both learning
by doing (which happens if country i has a cluster in sector 2, i.e. L2it > 0)
   8
     One problem with this idea as a way to think about income di¤erences across countries
is that it would imply that poor countries have a lower physical capital share, which is not
consistent with the data (see Gollin, 2002).

                                            11
and international spillovers (which happens if ait < 1). Formally, we assume
that
                 A_ it = (g=L) min(L; L2it )Ait + "(1 ait )Ait
where " > g > 0. Productivity increases caused by dynamic externalities in
one country eventually di¤use to the other country even if there is no cluster
there. Thus, in this model clusters are important to generate knowledge but
are not critical to bene…t from knowledge spillovers.
    Note that if the North has a cluster but the South does not, then A_ St =
"(1 aSt )ASt . There are "bene…ts of backwardness," in the sense that a
lower relative productivity in South (i.e., lower aSt ) leads to a faster rate
of productivity growth. This implies that given " > g there is a steady
state productivity gap ASt =AN t = a   ^ given implicitly by g = "(1 a    ^): if
aSt < a ^ (aSt > a  ^) then aSt increases (decreases) towards a ^. For future
reference, note that the productivity of North relative to South in this steady
state is ( 2N = 2S ) =^a: the …rst term captures pure Ricardian productivity
di¤erences, whereas the second and third terms capture the impact of static
and dynamic bene…ts of clustering, respectively. Starting from such a steady
state, if South acquires a cluster in sector 2, so that now L2St       L, then
there will be full convergence as aSt increases from a^ towards 1.
    As before, assume that prices are wholly determined in North. Then
p1 = 1= 1N and p2t = 1=A2N t 2N , and assume that condition (CA) holds.
Focusing on the South, complete specialization in 1 is a steady state equilib-
rium if
                                  2S = 1S
                                              =^
                                               a                             (4)
                                  2N = 1N

On the other hand, complete specialization in good 2 is necessarily a steady
state equilibrium (given condition (CA)). Thus, there are multiple steady
states if and only if condition (4) is satis…ed. It can be readily veri…ed that
the steady state with specialization in good 2 entails a higher wage for South
than the steady state with specialization in good 1. This is because condition
(CA) implies that South has a latent or "dynamic" comparative advantage
in good 2.9
    Imagine that this condition is satis…ed and that the system is in steady
state with South completely specialized in good 1. Is there an equilibrium in
   9
     Formally, we would say that a country has a latent or dynamic comparative advantage
in a good if its opportunity cost given the realization of all static and dynamic Marshallian
externalities is lower than the international price.


                                             12
which South moves to the steady state with specialization in good 2? If South
becomes specialized in good 2 then it realizes the static externalities, but it
will take some time for it to catch up to the North in terms of productivity
(i.e., aSt < 1 for some time). During this period, specialization in good 2 is
an equilibrium if
                                2S = 1S
                                          1=aSt
                                2N = 1N

This implies that if
                                    2S = 1S
                           1=^
                             a                      =^
                                                     a
                                    2N = 1N

then there are multiple steady states, and also an equilibrium in which sim-
ply South switches from specialization in good 1 to specialization in good
2 and eventually reaches the steady state with complete specialization in
good 2. The government could achieve this switch with trade protection for
an in…nitesimally short time, and the gains would necessarily outweigh any
associated costs (see below).
   On the other hand, if
                                2S = 1S
                                        < 1=^a
                                2N = 1N

then this is no longer the case. In order to guarentee specialization in good
2, there would need to be temporary protection until aSt increases from a ^ to
         0
a level a de…ned implicitly by

                                 2S = 1S
                                           = 1=a0
                                 2N = 1N

After that, complete specialization in good 2 would be an equilibrium for
South. Eventually the system would reach the steady state with aSt = 1.

2.1.4   Discussion
The simple model presented here captures the notion that temporary pro-
tection may induce an economy in a bad equilibrium to switch towards the
equilibrium where specialization is according to its latent or dynamic com-
parative advantage. Of course, this is nothing more than the classic case for
infant-industry protection, where policy is supposed to turn a latent com-



                                      13
parative advantage into an e¤ective one.10 Such a policy would be welfare
enhancing provided it passes both the Mill and Bastable tests: the Mill test
is that the protected sector can eventually survive international competition
without protection, whereas the Bastable test is more stringent in requir-
ing also that the discounted future bene…ts compensate the present costs of
protection (see Kemp, 1960, and Corden, 1997). In the model above, infant-
industry protection passes the Mill test if and only if the South has a latent
comparative advantage in the protected sector. The Bastable test requires
that the discounted gains from IP compensate the temporary consumption
loses associated with protection during the period in which the economy is
generating the (dynamic) productivity gains associated with clustering. This
is the period when aSt is increasing from a    ^ to a0 . Bardhan (1971), Redding
(1999) and Melitz (2005) - among others - explore the conditions on the
learning process under which the bene…ts of protection justify these initial
losses. Bardhan (1970) and Melitz (2005) explore the optimal way in which
protection should be granted.
    Of course, protection does not directly target Marshallian externalities. A
production subsidy would be more e¢ cient, as it would avoid the temporary
consumption losses mentioned above. The whole discussion of infant-industry
protection is based on the presumption that a production subsidy is simply
not feasible, either for …scal, political or practical considerations (see Section
3). If this were not the case, then the analysis would be quite simple: provide
a (Pigovian) subsidy such that the marginal subsidy is equal to the marginal
externality. Naturally, if the source of the externality is not production but
some more speci…c activity (e.g., R&D) then the subsidy could be directed
there.
    The condition that the South have a non-exploited latent comparative
advantage to justify protection is speci…c to the simple Ricardian model
we presented, where the production possibilities frontier (PPF) is linear and
there is a tendency for complete specialization. If the PPF is strictly concave
and international prices are such that under free trade the economy is diver-
si…ed, then the presence of Marshallian externalities in the import competing
  10
    John Stuart Mill (1848, reference 1909) is generally credited for being the …rst to
express this idea in a clear and simple way, although it was Friedrich List (1885) who vig-
orously argued for the adoption of infant-industry protection of manufacturing in European
countries. See Corden (1997) for a discussion of the di¤erent arguments for and against
infant-industry protection, and Irwin (1996) for an excellent treatment of its intellectual
history.


                                            14
sector implies that a small tari¤ would necessarily be welfare increasing. But
this kind of "marginal intervention" is not what people commonly associate
with infant-industry protection.
    Another possibility that arises with a strictly concave PPF is multiple
equilibria where the bad equilibrium has a low (but positive) production
level, whereas the good equilibrium has a higher production level but not
enough for any of this production to be exported. Even if the economy
does not have a latent comparative advantage, temporary protection may
be welfare enhancing in this case as long as the Mill and Bastable tests are
satis…ed.
    Although it is a speci…c result to the simple Ricardian model presented
here, the result that a latent comparative advantage is necessary for infant-
industry protection to be welfare-enhancing is of general interest. First, in
all cases in which infant-industry protection has supposedly been successful,
the infant sector eventually generates signi…cant exports. It is simply hard
to imagine otherwise. Second, if there are resource constraints that prevent
the sector from becoming large, then the theoretical framework suggests that
the bene…ts of IP would be small while the associated costs and risk would
be relatively large. For this reason, in the rest of this section we restrict
attention to the Ricardian model (linear PPF).

2.2     Industrial Policy without Latent Comparative Ad-
        vantage
Can a policy to promote specialization in a good with Marshallian exter-
nalities (i.e., good 2 in the model above) be welfare-enhancing in spite of
not having latent comparative advantage in that sector? For this analysis
and the rest of this section we again restrict attention to the simpler static
analysis.

2.2.1   Sector-level rents
Imagine that prices are determined not in a single economy, but in a collec-
tion of economies. In particular, assume that North is partitioned into two
regions, N1 and N2 , with labor quantities L1N and L2N . Everything else is as
above. Without loss of generality, assume that region N2 is the one that will
produce good 2. If L2N is su¢ ciently large relative to the world’s demand
for good 2 then it will not be completely specialized in that good, in which

                                     15
case prices will be determined by technology levels (inclusive of clustering
e¤ects), so that p = 1N = 2N , just as in the previous case. But if L2N is
small relative to the world demand for good 2, then in equilibrium one can
have
                          1N = 2N > p > 1N =    2N                       (5)
In contrast to what we have with an integrated North, here p can be strictly
higher than 1N = 2N . The di¤erence can be interpreted as the "rents"
associated with good 2. To capture this, let
                                               p
                                     R
                                            1N =      2N

Condition (5) can now be stated as
                                         >R>1                                         (6)
    Consider again a "small" South, which takes international prices as given.
The condition for multiple equilibria is again given by (1), with p satisfying
(5). This can be written as
                                            1S = 2S
                                R=                         R                          (7)
                                            1N = 2N

We are interested in the case where South does not have a latent comparative
advantage in good 2, or

                                  1S = 2S   >    1N = 2N                              (8)
In this case, the LHS inequality in (7) is always satis…ed (given (6)), while
the RHS inequality, which is necessary for specialization in good 2 to be an
                                                        1S = 2S
equilibrium, is satis…ed if R > CA, where CA           1N = 2N
                                                                is a measure of
comparative advantage in South in good 1. In other words, there are mul-
tiple equilibria in South if its comparative advantage in good 1 is smaller
than the rents associated with international prices. Moreover, just as in the
previous cases, the equilibrium with specialization in the good with Marshal-
lian externalities sustains a higher wage.11 This result is reminiscent of the
  11
     Another way to think about rents is if South were no longer a small economy. Consider
Figure 1 again and imagine that there are no productivity di¤erentials between South and
North. Imagine further that these two regions have equal size, and that demand for good
2 is su¢ ciently high that the equilibrium entails one country fully specialized in good 2
and the other fully specialized in good 1. Then, if condition (1) is satis…ed, the country
that specializes in good 2 has higher welfare than the country that specializes in good 1.

literature on strategic trade policy, where increasing returns and imperfect
competition leads to the existence of rents which governments try to capture
via trade policy.
    An alternative way to get a similar result is by assuming the existence
of a wage premium in sector 1.12 To see this, assume again that North is
a single integrated region, but with a wage premium in sector 2, so that
w2 = Rw1 . Then it is easy to verify that p = R 1N = 2N , which is the same
as above.13 ,14

2.2.2    Inter-industry externalities
We have so far focused on intra-industry externalities. Consider instead
aggregate externalities, so that all sectors in the country bene…t from the ex-
ternalities realized in a sector (see Succar, 1987, Young, 1991, and Greenwald
and Stiglitz, 2006).15 Assume that now productivity in good i in country j
is
                               ij 1 + i M in(L; L2j )

with 1 < 2 , so that intra-industry externalities are stronger than inter-
industry externalities. Let i 1 + i L and note that 1 < 2 . We return to
the case of FPE in North with no rents, so that pi = 1= i iN , and assume
that South has a latent comparative advantage in good 1. It is readily veri…ed
  12
      Yet another way to have rents would be through the existence of pure pro…ts, as in the
literature on "strategic trade policy" (Brander and Spencer, 1983, Eaton and Grossman,
1989).
   13
      We have assumed here that there is no wage premium in South. If there were a
wage premium in South of equal magnitude as in North, then in the absence of a latent
comparative advantage in good 2, there would not be multiple equilibria, but it could be
welfare-enhancing for South to implement a policy to specialize in sector 2. This would
no longer be a case of Marshallian externalities and infant-industry protection, but rather
a standard application of the theory of domestic distortions and trade policy.
   14
      One di¤erence with the case analyzed above, where rents arise from lack of FPE, is
that with wage premia we no longer have the restriction that R < . The reason is that
now the opportunity cost of good 2 given that region is specialized in good 1 is R 1N = 2N ,
and we need this to be higher than p , which is possible even if 1N = 2N < p . Note that
in this case then there is no equilibrium with specialization in good 1 in South.
   15
      Perhaps the most important type of inter-industry externalities are generated by in-
dustries that supply specialized inputs that are used intensively by …rms in many other
sectors. According to Wade (1990), this kind of reasoning was quite important in Taiwan,
where the government promoted several sectors that were deemed to provide critical inputs
for many other industries. Noland and Pack (2003) disagree with this view.


                                            17
in this case that the only equilibrium in South entails specialization in good
1.16 But specialization in good 2 implies w = 2 2S p2 = 2S = 2N , while
specialization in good 1 implies w = 1S p1 = 1S = 1 1N . The …rst is higher
than the second if and only if

                                                  2S = 1S
                                    1=   1   <
                                                  2N = 1N

If this is satis…ed, then forcing the economy towards specialization in good 2,
even if this is not an equilibrium, is welfare-enhancing compared to staying
in the equilibrium with specialization in good 1. In this case, the losses from
going against comparative advantage by specializing in sector 2 are domi-
nated by the gains associated with the economywide externalities generated.
This may be one way of interpreting the argument in the late 1980s in favor
of protecting the semiconductor industry in the United States (see Borrus,
Tyson and Zysman, 1986).

2.3        Industrial Policy as Sector-Speci…c Collective Ac-
           tion
We have so far focused on Marshallian and inter-industry externalities as
reasons for IP. A more general conceptual framework for thinking about IP
is the existence of coordination failures at the industry or sector level. Of
course, coordination failures arise in the presence of Marshallian externali-
ties. The di¤erence is that the distortions associated with these externalities
(at least as modeled above) disappear when the sector gets su¢ ciently large,
whereas this is not the case with other types of coordination failures. For
example, in Rodríguez-Clare (2007) positive spillovers arise only when "mod-
ern" technologies are used in a sector. Thus, even sectors that are seen as
"advanced" in developed countries can behave as backward sectors when they
operate in LDCs, and hence fail to generate any externalities. This captures
the idea that what matters for productivity is not "what you produce, but
how" (Porter, 1998, De Ferranti et. al., 2001). In these circumstances, a
  16                                                                          2S = 1S
       The condition for specialization in good 1 to be an equilibrium is     2N = 1N
                                                                                        <   2
                                                                                            1
                                                                                                ,
                                   2S = 1S
which is clearly satis…ed given 2N = 1N < 1 together with 1 < 1 . On the other hand,
                                                                    2


specialization in good 2 implies that w= 2 2S = p2 . This is an equilibrium if w= 1 1S > p1 ,
or 2S
    1S
        > 2N1N
               , which cannot be satis…ed if South has CA in good 1.



                                                 18
sector can expand and still fail to experience an increase in productivity.17
Protection or export subsidies would fail to be welfare-enhancing, and other
policies would be called for.18
    The existence of coordination failures implies that collective action at the
sector level may lead to productivity gains. A concrete example of collec-
tive action is the eradication of foot and mouth disease in Uruguay’s cattle
industry, which generated signi…cant bene…ts by allowing the industry to ex-
port beef to the United States (see Hausmann, Rodríguez-Clare and Rodrik,
2005). Simply providing a production or export subsidy to the cattle indus-
try would not have led to more exports. A speci…c policy to deal with the
coordination failure associated with strong externalities was introduced. An-
other example is the case of ‡ower exports from Ecuador (Hernández et. al.
2007). Several attempts to export ‡owers in the 1960s and 70s failed in part
because of the lack of reliable air transport to the main destinations. A key
di¤erence in the 1980s was an e¤ort by the association of ‡ower exporters,
EXPOFLORES, to convince the government and the national airline to set
up the required number of cargo ‡ights for this activity. Thanks in part to
this e¤ort, the value of ‡ower exports boomed from less than half a million
dollars in 1984 to more than $400 million in 2006.19

2.3.1    A simple model
We now want to explore a model where policy can induce higher productivity
in a sector through some kind of industry-level collective action, and where
prices are determined in a collection of economies (not only in "the North"),
so that there may be rents. The goal is not to model the speci…cs of collective
   17
      This may explain the existence of cases of geographic concentration of sectors that
failed to experience signi…cant agglomeration economies(e.g., concentrations of footwear
and textile producers). Perhaps these are cases of clusters that failed to achieve Marshal-
lian externalities (see Altenburg and Meyer-Stamer, 1999).
   18
      An appropriate policy could be to subsidize production but only to the extent that it
is done using modern technologies.
   19
      Another example, also from Ecuador, concerns the development of new exports of
broccoli and mangoes, where …nding the best seeds and meeting international phytosani-
tary standards presented producers with signi…cant coordination problems. As stated by
Hernández et. al. (2007), collective action fostered and implemented by several private,
public and mixed agencies was important in dealing with such problems and in facilitating
the development of these new sectors. Similar cases are documented for Chile in Agosín
and Bravo-Ortega (2007) and for several countries in Chandra and Kolavalli (2006).

a country’s income level.
    There are N countries, indexed by j. Labor is the only factor of pro-
duction, and is available in total quantity Lj in country j. There are M
industries indexed by m. There are opportunities for collective action in
each industry. Collective action increases productivity in industry m by the
factor xm ; otherwise, productivity is one in all industries in all countries. We
refer to xm as the level of complexity in industry m, since it seems reason-
able to expect that more complex industries will bene…t more from collective
action. A country that has achieved high productivity in industry m thanks
to collective action will be said to have HP (for high productivity) in that
industry. Let kjm be the indicator
                           P         function for whether country j has HP in
industry m , and assume       Lj = 1 soP that Lj is also the share of worldwide
labor living in country j. Then sm        j kjm Lj is the share of labor in coun-
tries with HP in industry m. Also, country j 0 s productivity in industry m
can be written as x^jm (1 kjm ) + kjm xm . P     Preferences are Cobb-Douglas,
with a share vm devoted to industry m, and          vm = 1. Thus, we can think
of vm equivalently as the "size" of industry m, or the extent of the world’s
demand for its output.
    The model described thus far is a Ricardian model with N countries and
M industries, where productivity can be either low or high in each industry.
The equilibrium is easy to describe: it consists of a set of wages, wj , prices,
pm , and an allocation, Ljm , for j = 1; :::; N and m = 1; :::; M such that for
all j and m the following conditions Phold: wj x^jmP    pm and if Ljm > 0 then
wj = x^jm pm (zero pro…ts), and pm j x^jm Ljm = vm j wj Lj (i.e., the value
of sales of m equals total expenditures on m) for all m.
    It is useful to describe an equilibrium without rents. Choosing labor as
the numeraire, this entails wj = 1 for all j and pm = 1 if sm = 0 and
pm = 1=xm if sm > 0; it requires that for each industry either no country
has HP or there are enough countries (adjusting for their size) with HP that
the large supply drives the price to its marginal cost with unitary wages.20
Note that in this case a country that does not achieve HP in any industry
would still enjoy the same wage as other countries. We can think of this as
a case in which Factor Price Equalization (FPE) holds.
  20
    Formally, if sm > vm for all m then there is an equilibrium with wj = w for all j. To
see this, simply assume that wj = 1P all j, and pm = 1=xm , Pand Ljm > 0 only if kjm = 1.
We only need to check that (1=xm ) j xm Ljm = vm with j Ljm = vm holds for all m.
One can choose Ljm in such a way that this holds as long as sm vm all m.

                                           20
    Rents arise when sm is small relative to vm . For example, imagine an
equilibrium where sm = 0 for all m 6= 1, and only country 1 has HP in
industry 1. Then wj = 1 for j = 2; :::; N while w1 > 1 if and only if v1 > s1 :
there are rents in industry 1 (i.e., the price of industry 1 is higher than the
marginal cost at unitary wages, p1 > 1=x1 ).21
    Industries di¤er with respect to three variables: complexity (measured by
xm ), size (measured by vm ), and the share of people in the world that live
in countries that have HP (measured by sm ). We will refer to the later as
"prevalence," since it measures the extent to which HP is widespread across
the world in an industry. The previous result suggests that industries will
have rents if they are large relative to their prevalence. Apart from this
result, one can learn more from this model only by considering special cases.
Instead of doing this, we introduce some additional assumptions to "smooth
out" the kinks in the Ricardian model and obtain more general results.
    Assume that each industry is composed of a continuum of goods with
varying productivity levels. Preferences remain Cobb-Douglas, but now with
equal shares across all goods. Thus, assuming that industry m has a measure
                                                                         P
vm of goods, then (as above) expenditures on industry m are vm with vm =
1. (Note that it is natural to think of vm as the "size" of industry m because
it measures both the share of total expenditures devoted to this industry
and the measure of goods belonging to that industry.) More importantly,
we assume that productivity di¤ers across goods within an industry as in
Eaton and Kortum (2002). Speci…cally, productivity for any particular good
in sector m in country j is x^jm z, where x^jm is as above and z is an additional
productivity that is independently drawn from the Fréchet distribution with
parameters Tj and , i.e. Prj (z        Z) = exp[ Tj z ].22 This distribution
has sound microeconomic foundations (see Eaton and Kortum, 2001), but
understanding those foundations or its several convenient properties is not
important for our purposes here; it is su¢ cient to know that a higher Tj
  21
      The equilibrium could have goods in industry 1 produced by both country 1 and
other countries, in which case it is obvious that w1 > 1. Otherwise, if country 1 is
the only country with positive production in industry 1, then the equilibrium condition
p1 L1 x1 = v1 (1 L1 + w1 L1 ) together with p1 x1 = w1 and s1 = L1 imply that w1 =
v1 (1 s1 )=s1 (1 v1 ), hence v1 > s1 implies w1 > 1. If s1 = L1 > v1 then w1 > 1 cannot
be sustained, because country 1 cannot specialize completely in the good in which it has
a superior productivity.
   22
      To simplify the discussion, we assume that Tj = Lj for all j. Otherwise, countries
with a higher ratio Tj =Lj would tend to have higher wages for reasons that don’t relate
to IP (although see next subsection).

                                          21
implies better productivity draws for country j (on average).
    Since each good is in…nitesimally small and there are no transportation
costs, then each good will be supplied to the whole world by the country
with the lowest cost. If we consider a particular good in industry m with
productivity draws (z1m ; z2m ; :::; zN m ) in countries (1; 2; :::; N ) then this good
will be supplied by country j = arg minl fwl =^      xlm zlm g. Eaton and Kortum
(2002) show that a country with wage wj and productivity parameter x^jm
will capture a share

                                      (wj =^
                                           xjm ) Tj
                               Djm = P                                                    (9)
                                       l (wl =^
                                              xlm ) Tl
of total sales in industry m. A country with a lower Tj , a higher wj , or a
lower x^jm will capture a smaller market share in industry m. Contrary to the
standard Ricardian model, however, a country will have positive production
in all industries because it will always have a few goods withinP any industry
where its productivity draws are very high. Letting Y = P wj Lj denote
worldwide income, then the trade balance conditions are          m Djm vm Y =
wj Lj (value of sales equal value of purchases for country j). These conditions
determine the equilibrium wages w1 ; :::; wN .
    How is the wage in a country a¤ected by acquiring HP in an industry?
If a country had a choice, in which industry would achieving collective ac-
tion have the greatest impact on wages?23 These are key questions for IP.
Note that we have assumed that there are no deep sources of comparative
advantage, so this would not be an issue in this choice. Then it seems reason-
able that countries would be able to increase wages more by focusing their
e¤orts in industries that have higher complexity, are larger (or have higher
demand), and have a lower prevalence: higher complexity means that there
is more to gain from collective action, while larger demand combined with
low prevalence implies higher rents. Under some conditions, one can in fact
prove this result. In particular, assume that countries 1 and 2 are identical
except that they have HP in industries 1 and 2, respectively, with no HP in
the rest of industries (i.e., country 1 has HP only in industry 1 and country
2 has HP only in industry 2). Then one can show that if x^j1 = x^j2 for all
j = 3; :::; N then the wage in country 1 is higher than in country 2 if x1 > x2
  23
    If the costs of collective action di¤er across industries, then this clearly would have to
be taken into account in this choice. To simplify the analysis, we assume that the cost of
achieving collective action is included in the xm .


                                             22
or if v1 > v2 . Also, assuming that x1 = x2 and v1 = v2 , then w1 > w2 if
s1 < s2 (see Appendix).24
     We have assumed thus far that there are no di¤erences in industry-level
productivity across countries. If this were not the case, then it is clear that
a country may want to go against its latent comparative advantage and
specialize in goods with combinations of high complexity, high demand and
low prevalence. Thus, this model may be suitable to think about IP, although
it is important to note that trade protection is not an e¤ective policy in this
framework.

2.3.2    Relation of the model to some recent contributions
We now show how to place some recent arguments for IP in the context
of this simple analytical framework. Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik (2006)
argue that the varied economic performance of di¤erent countries is partly
explained by the goods that they produce. Other things equal (including
physical and human capital stocks), countries that specialize in what they
call "rich country goods" are richer. Their explanation is that such goods
provide more opportunities for learning by doing (similar to Young, 1991)
and for technological and institutional upgrading that ultimately bene…ts the
whole economy.
    The model presented here can capture this notion in a slightly di¤erent
way. In this model we may talk about "rich country industries" as ones
that are more complex, have higher worldwide demand, or exhibit lower
prevalence. Countries that achieve HP in these industries would be able to
sustain higher income levels, and getting there would entail higher growth
rates.
    Hausmann and Klinger (2006) argue that goods are connected, so that
productivity in one good would be higher if the country has already achieved
HP in a related good. This has similar implications as inter-industry exter-
nalities (think of "industries" as "goods"). For example, coming back to the
role of specialized inputs, if such inputs exist for one good, this would also
  24
    One could imagine a situation in which countries understand this model and implement
IP to maximize their income. If collective action had no cost, then obviously all countries
would simply achieve HP in all industries. But imagine that collective action is costly. In
the resulting equilibrium sectors with higher complexity and/or larger demand would be
matched by high prevalence in such a way that the return to collective action would be
the same in all sectors.


                                            23
help in the production of a similar or related good. Hausmann and Klinger
show that some goods are connected to many other goods, while other goods
are relatively isolated. They think of the space of goods as a forest, with
each good being represented by a tree, and talk about how this forest is
more dense in some areas. Hausmann and Klinger (2006) and Hausmann
and Rodrik (2006) suggest that if a country could choose, it would want to
locate in the denser parts of the forest.
    The idea that there are regions in the forest that are more dense is cap-
tured in the model above by having industries di¤er in their size or worldwide
demand. The suggestion that countries in dense part of the forests are better
o¤ corresponds to the result above that countries are better o¤ if they man-
age to achieve HP in an industry with a high measure of goods, vm , since
this corresponds to high demand. But the model reveals a weakness of this
notion: industries with high demand would not be attractive if they also
have high prevalence. Returning to the forest metaphor, being in a dense
part of the forest would not be better if this is also more crowded. For ex-
ample, although the electronics industry may be a "highly connected area"
of the forest, there may also be many countries (and large ones, e.g. China)
participating in this area. In principle, it could be better for a country to
remain in an isolated but relatively uncongested part of the forest.
    The measure of the "income level" of an industry developed by Haus-
mann, Hwang and Rodrik (2006) takes this into account: an industry with
high prevalence would exhibit low prices and would thus be classi…ed as one
with a lower income level. Thus, in principle, this measure may be seen
as a reasonable way to guide countries in choosing industries that are ideal
for productivity-enhancing collective action. Unfortunately, however, this
may be a noisy measure of the relevant notion needed for IP because it may
be capturing capital (physical, human, or knowledge capital) intensity, which
leads countries with good conditions for capital accumulation to produce and
export these goods. In other words, if there is an exogenous variation in con-
ditions for capital accumulation across countries, and if goods di¤er in their
capital intensity, then rich countries will tend to produce and export capi-
tal intensive goods, and this will have nothing to do with industry-speci…c
collective action and IP. The same association between rich countries and
certain sectors may arise because of an exogenous variation in the quality
of institutions. For example, if rich countries have institutions that are con-
ducive to capital market development, then they would tend to specialize in
goods that rely heavily on outside capital (Manova, 2006). If one could some-

                                      24
how adjust Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik’s measure to isolate the income
correlation of goods that is not explained by capital intensity or exogenous
variation in institutions, then this could be a useful measure for IP. In par-
ticular, countries could consider inducing collective action in sectors with a
high "adjusted income level."

2.4    Self-discovery and diversi…cation
The notion of IP that we have emphasized so far is that there are "special
industries," and that countries can increase welfare by reallocating resources
to those industries. An alternative idea that we now explore is to think of a
policy to increase diversi…cation. This has been a particular concern in coun-
tries that specialize in natural-resource intensive industries (see De Ferranti,
2001, and CAF, 2007, for recent treatments focusing on Latin America). Di-
versi…cation could be desirable as a way to reduce volatility, or as a way to
increase productivity. Here we focus on the later.
    To think about the connection between diversi…cation and productivity,
consider the Eaton and Kortum (2002) model of trade. As explained above,
Eaton and Kortum model productivities as being drawn from a distribution
that is common across countries except for a technology parameter T . This
technology parameter determines the location of the productivity distribu-
tion: countries with a higher T have "better" distributions in the sense that,
on average, productivity draws will be higher (formally, this entails …rst-
order stochastic dominance). Apart from T , countries also di¤er in size, L.
Assuming away trading costs for simplicity, wages are determined by the ra-
tio of technology to size, T =L. A high T =L means that the country would
have many sectors in which it has absolute advantage relative to its size,
leading to a high equilibrium wage. Moreover, given L, a higher T implies
the production (and export) of more goods, or more diversi…cation.
    Of course, higher productivity and higher wages may not go together with
diversi…cation. For example, high productivity in a sector that is not "di-
versi…ed" or "di¤erentiated" would draw resources away from the diversi…ed
sector and reduce overall diversi…cation even as it increases overall produc-
tivity and wages. It is also important to recall that the data reveals that
after a certain level of development, higher income goes together with less,
not more diversi…cation (see Imbs and Wacziarg, 2003).
    An interesting way to think about diversi…cation is via what Hausmann
and Rodrik (2003) call "self-discovery." They argue that countries don’t re-

                                      25
ally know their cost structure, and hence they don’t know the goods in which
they have comparative advantage. This must be discovered through costly
experimentation, which is plagued by information spillovers that render its
private bene…ts low relative to its social bene…ts. The following model shows
a simple way to capture the connection between diversi…cation and produc-
tivity, and then between self-discovery and diversi…cation.
    Consider an economy with labor as the only factor of production and two
sectors: agriculture and manufactures. Agriculture is a homogenous good,
produced with decreasing marginal returns to labor, with QA = F (LA ).
There are a continuum of manufacturing goods indexed with j 2 [0; 1] that
are produced from an input H = "L (" converts raw labor units L into
e¢ ciency units H) with productivities as in Eaton and Kortum (2002): one
unit of H produces z units of manufactures, with z for each good j 2 [0; 1]
drawn from the Fréchet distribution with parameters T and , as above.
Assuming no transportation costs for either agriculture or manufacturing,
and letting agriculture serve as numeraire, then the wage is w = F 0 (LA ).
The cost of producing a manufacturing good with productivity draw z is
w="z, and, analogous to the expression in (9), the share of manufactures
that will be exported by a country with wage w, labor e¢ ciency ", and
technology parameter T , is
                                (w=") T
                               P
                                 (wl ="l ) Tl
    Consider now two countries that di¤er only in , " or T . The country with
higher will exhibit a higher wage, but will also devote more resources to
agriculture and less to manufacturing, with a smaller share of manufacturing
goods exported and a lower level of diversi…cation (i.e., the number of goods
exported is lower). This is a case of "good concentration." On the other hand,
a country with a lower " or a lower T would also have a higher share of labor
in agriculture, with higher concentration, but in this case the equilibrium
wage would be lower. This is a case of "bad concentration."
    Now let us think about the determinants of T . In a dynamic setting, T
can be seen as the stock of ideas (see Eaton and Kortum, 2001). Imagine
that there is a worldwide stock of ideas, T , that grows at rate n. Discov-
ery can be seen as the process by which a country adopts these worldwide
ideas to the national environment. This is not exactly as in Hausmann and
Rodrik (2003), where productivity is determined ex-ante, and experimenta-
tion simply reveals what that productivity is. But the basic implications are

                                     26
the same. If x is the rate of discovery, then T_ = xT , and in steady state
T =T = x=n. Thus, a higher rate of discovery leads to diversi…cation and a
higher equilibrium wage.25
    The rate of discovery depends on its cost and associated private returns.
If there are knowledge spillovers, as in Hausmann and Rodrik (2003), so that
once an entrepreneur adopts a foreign idea then it di¤uses rapidly to others
in the economy, then the market by itself would lead to a suboptimal level
of discovery and a level of diversi…cation that would be too low. Polices to
encourage discovery would lead to more diversi…cation and higher welfare.

2.5     National and Global Gains from IP
The gains from IP for a country could come at the expense of other countries,
or they could lead to global e¢ ciency gains. We now explore the nature of
the gains from IP for the di¤erent models discussed above.
    Consider …rst the case in which the existence of Marshallian externalities
leads to multiple equilibria. Above we considered a small country, but to
explore whether gains are national or international we have to allow for the
possibility that a country’s IP hurts other countries. Consider a model with
two countries (A and B) and two goods (1 and 2). As above, good 2 exhibits
Marshallian externalities. In this context, IP entails a shift from an equilib-
rium in which countries are not specialized according to their comparative
advantage to one in which they are. Clearly such a shift increases worldwide
e¢ ciency. What happens to welfare in each of the two countries? First note
that the country that implements IP (country A) experiences an increase in
productivity in industry 2. If the terms of trade didn’t change, country A
would be better o¤ (as in Subsection 2.1.2). But if A is not small, then the
relative price of good 2 will fall, and this will erode some of A’s productivity
gains. Even if A was so large that the terms of trade were now equal to its
domestic prices, however, it would still gain, so country A necessarily gains
from IP.26 This is a simple application of Helpman and Krugman’s (1984)
  25
      This is not consistent with what happens for rich countries, where higher productivity
goes together with falling diversi…cation. One way to think about this is that at some point
a third sector emerges, a high-tech sector, which is a simple CRS sector where research
implies increasing productivity. When T and productivity in high-tech is su¢ ciently high,
the agriculture sector disappears, and increasing productivity in high tech leads now to
falling exports of manufactures and increasing concentration.
   26
      A key ingredient in generating this result is that country A0 s opportunity cost of good


                                             27
proposition that a country necessarily gains from a move to an equilibrium
in which it allocates more resources to a sector with positive externalities.
For the other country (country B) welfare can decrease. To see this, note
that for this country the e¤ect of IP is exactly the same as the e¤ect of an
increase in productivity in industry 2 in country A. This could be either
positive or negative for country B. For example, if the opportunity cost of
good 2 in country A is just barely lower than the opportunity cost of good 2
in country B when both countries fully exploit the Marshallian externalities,
then it is clear that country B loses from the IP implemented in country A.
    Di¤erent results arise when IP is geared towards the appropriation of
rents or broad (inter-industry) externalities associated with certain goods, as
in the literature on strategic trade policy (see Brander, 1995). In this case,
the use of IP by di¤erent countries entails essentially a zero-sum game, or
worse, as it could lead to an allocation of resources in which countries are
not specialized according to comparative advantage.
    Consider next the model where IP entails industry-speci…c collective ac-
tion. If collective action is costless, then the answer is very simple: IP
necessarily increases global welfare, although it may hurt another country by
worsening its terms of trade. Things become more interesting when collective
action entails costs. If countries bargain e¢ ciently among themselves regard-
ing trade barriers, then (by de…nition) only IP that increases global welfare
will be implemented. One could optimistically argue that global negotiations
that include trade and other policies actually take into account the ability
of countries to implement IP, and that the resulting agreements allow only
policies that increase global welfare. In this case, countries that can follow
IP that increases their own welfare but lowers global welfare would be paid
(perhaps though better trade access to other countries) not to do it, and
countries that can implement IP that lowers national welfare but increases
global welfare would be paid to do it. In fact, this is the way that trade
agreements work in Bagwell and Staiger’s (1998) model of GATT.
    Bagwell and Staiger show that as long as countries choose their policies
while disregarding their e¤ects on international prices, then they will lead
to a globally e¢ cient outcome. If international agreements are not e¢ cient
in this sense, however, then countries would evaluate the impact of IP on
welfare while taking into account its e¤ect on international prices. Clearly,
this could lead to a decline in global welfare. For example, imagine that
2 falls below that of country B, a result of A0 s latent comparative advantage in good 2.


                                           28
countries have committed to free trade. If IP for some good X implies a
reduction in the supply of some other good Y then the price of this good
would increase. If IP just barely makes the Home country implementing it
better o¤, then for the world as a whole (which necessarily sees a decline
in TOT) this entails a loss. Note, however, that this is a general feature of
domestic policies implemented by countries that a¤ect international prices,
and not something particular to IP.
    Finally, we turn to the model where IP aims at promoting diversi…cation.
As in the cases discussed above, the problem for global welfare may arise from
the in‡uence of IP on international prices. Imagine that the cost of a policy
to encourage "self-discovery" just barely justi…es the associated bene…ts. If
such bene…ts include an improvement in a country’s terms of trade (which
would arise from the decline in the supply of the non-diversi…ed good), then
the global e¢ ciency would decline. Again, global e¢ ciency would necessarily
increase from IP only if countries evaluate it while disregarding its impact
on international prices.


3      Empirical Evidence on Infant-Industry Pro-
      tection and other forms of IP
Since the best known form of IP is infant-industry protection, we devote most
of this section to a critical review of the empirical literature on this type of
IP. As discussed in Section 2, the theoretical justi…cation for infant-industry
protection relies on the existence of Marshallian externalities. There is
extensive evidence that these externalities exist and are signi…cant (Rosenthal
and Strange (2004)). When such externalities exist, temporary protection
may help the country switch towards a better equilibrium, and this may be
welfare improving if the short-run costs are not too high. Protection may
also be welfare enhancing if the protected industry generates positive (inter-
industry) externalities to the rest of the economy.27
    As we outlined in Section 2, such a policy would be welfare enhancing
only if it passes both the Mill and Bastable tests. Recall that the Mill
test requires that the protected sector can eventually survive international
competition without protection, whereas the Bastable test requires that the
  27
     It is important to note that this is not infant-industry protection, however, since the
protected industry is not presumed to become competitive at some future period.


                                            29
discounted future bene…ts compensate the present costs of protection. We
emphasize in our review that very few studies of IP have examined whether
industries pass either the Mill or the Bastable test. Consequently, even if we
could show that protected sectors grow faster, this is not su¢ cient evidence
to claim that IP is welfare-improving.
    Even if the conditions necessary for protection to increase welfare are sat-
is…ed, protection is not the most e¢ cient policy. The theory of targeting (see
Bhagwati and Ramaswami (1963)) suggests that a government’s objectives
can be met more e¢ ciently using instruments other than tari¤s, and that
when these instruments target the distortion at the source, a tari¤ of zero
maximizes welfare for a small economy. Unless there are speci…c distortions
or externalities associated with trade, the most e¢ cient policy instrument to
conduct industrial policy is not likely to be tari¤s. In a recent review on the
…scal implications of trade reform, Pelzman and Shoham (2006) point out
that "in the theoretical public …nance literature it is well established that
an optimal policy for a small open economy is to reduce tari¤s to zero and
raise consumption taxes (see Dixit (1985) and Diamond-Mirrlees (1971)),
thus maintaining production e¢ ciency" (p. 9).
    In practice, however, there are several reasons why countries have con-
tinued to use tari¤s to promote domestic industry. The most direct policy
instruments are frequently not available in countries with limited abilities to
collect income, consumption, or production taxes. Anderson (1996) shows
that in a budget constrained economy, where it is di¢ cult to compensate tar-
i¤ cuts with increases in consumption or other taxes, tari¤ reductions lead
to a curtailment of government spending and a resulting under-provision of
public goods, which lowers welfare. Irwin (2007) compares the deadweight
losses per dollar of revenue raised by tari¤s with other forms of taxation in
the United States. He argues that although the deadweight losses (per dollar)
for tari¤s were high in the 19th century, "import duties were probably much
easier to collect and enforce... than other modes of taxation" (p. 19). Irwin
(2002) draws similar conclusions for Argentina and Canada at that time. For
the same reasons, it could be argued that in some developing countries trade
protection could be an e¤ective tool to implement IP. An important impli-
cation is that if …scal considerations are the reason to use trade protection
rather than production subsidies, then clearly tari¤s would be the e¢ cient
policy and not quantitative restrictions.
    In the rest of this section we review the empirical research on the ef-
fectiveness of infant-industry protection. We begin by discussing case stud-

                                      30
ies where protection was clearly motivated by infant-industry considerations
and then move on to other approaches that exploit the cross-industry and
cross-country variation in trade barriers to see whether protection had the
consequences predicted by infant-industry models.

3.1    Single-Industry Studies
There are very few detailed evaluations of infant-industry protection. Some
important papers that explicitly take into account learning e¤ects include
Baldwin and Krugman (1986, 1988), Head (1994), Luzio and Greenstein
(1995), Hansen, Jensen, and Madsen (2003), and Irwin (2008). Baldwin and
Krugman (1986) study protection to the semi-conductor industry in Japan.
They use a simulation model to show that the Japanese semi-conductor in-
dustry in Japan could not have emerged as a global player without the pro-
tected domestic market. Protection was needed in order to achieve the kinds
of economies of scale and learning e¤ects that would allow the industry to
move down its marginal cost curve and be competitive on world markets.
However, Baldwin and Krugman (1986) also …nd that the costs to Japanese
consumers outweighed the bene…ts, leading to net welfare losses for both
Japan and the US. Thus, although the semi-conductor sector in Japan sat-
is…ed the Mill test, it did not satisfy the Bastable test.
    Baldwin and Krugman (1988) estimate the impact on US and European
welfare of Airbus’s entry into the imperfectly competitive aircraft model.
They show that subsidies to Airbus may have resulted in net welfare gains
for Europe, primarily due to the high degree of imperfect competition (and
monopoly rents) that characterized the industry. However, their simulation
also makes clear that these results depend heavily on the assumed parame-
ters, including the elasticity of demand. In any case, it is possible to evaluate
that sector in such a way that the European subsidy to Airbus passes both
the Mill and the Bastable test.
    Head (1994) studies the e¤ect of tari¤ protection on the emergence of the
steel rail industry in the United States. This case …ts the infant-industry
protection view almost perfectly: the local industry was initially uncompet-
itive (1860s), but a few decades after the imposition of an import tari¤ the
United States was the world leader in this market and the duty was repealed.
Head concludes that "the domestic industry did ‘grow up’and the duty was
eventually removed. Hence, protection certainly did not cause stagnation
and gross ine¢ ciencies. Furthermore, the duty led to long-run reductions in

                                       31
domestic prices. While the savings to railroad builders were too small and
came too late to yield a net gain to consumers, the overall e¤ect on welfare
appears to have been positive" (p. 163).
    Hansen, Jensen and Madsen (2003) examine the e¤ect of production sub-
sidies in Denmark for the production of electricity from wind power. They
conclude that the subsidies elicited strong learning-by-doing in the industry,
which achieved a dominant position in the world market. Moreover, accord-
ing to their calculations, the direct and indirect (environmental) bene…ts
outweighed the overall costs of the policy.
    Irwin (2008) evaluates the e¤ects of protection in the tinplate industry in
the United States. The industry ‡ourished after receiving tari¤ protection
in 1890. Whereas there were no US producers at all prior to the imposition
of the tari¤, after the imposition of the tari¤ (at rates exceeding 70 percent)
the industry became entirely self-su¢ cient. According to his counterfactual
simulations, the tari¤ accelerated the industry’s development by about ten
years, which would have developed anyway due to falling costs of iron ore.
However, the costs to consumer surplus were so large that welfare declined
as a consequence of protection. Irwin concludes that a lower tari¤ of around
50 percent could have improved welfare, but that the actual tari¤ imposed
exceeded the optimal level and actually decreased welfare.
    All the previous studies are for cases of protection or subsidies in devel-
oped countries. One single-industry study of infant-industry protection in a
developing country is that of Luzio and Greenstein (1995), who study the
e¤ects of protection of the microcomputer industry in the 1980s in Brazil.
They show that although there was rapid productivity growth in the pro-
tected industry, it never caught up with the also rapidly growing technolog-
ical frontier. As a result, welfare declined by a signi…cant amount (around
20 per cent of domestic spending on microcomputers) and the policy was
abandoned in the early 1990s.
    More studies like these analyzing the welfare implications of infant in-
dustry protection would be very useful. Yet even this brief review makes
it clear that protection may lead to higher growth but result in net welfare
losses. For tinplate, steel rail, wind power, semi-conductors and aircraft,
protection allowed domestic producers to grow and eventually become world
class producers. Yet for tinplate, semiconductors, microcomputers, and pos-
sibly aircraft, protection led to net welfare losses. These case studies suggest
that designing policies that increase overall welfare is very di¢ cult.


                                      32
3.2    Cross-Industry Studies
The theoretical framework makes a number of predictions for cross-country
empirical studies. If the conditions necessary for infant-industry protection
to improve welfare are satis…ed (see Section 2) are satis…ed, then protected
sectors should experience faster productivity growth than non-protected sec-
tors. With time, protected sectors should increase their importance in the
economy, and eventually become exporters. Under these conditions, one
would expect to …nd a positive correlation between trade protection and
productivity growth.
    One of the …rst studies to look for a correlation between trade protection
and productivity growth is Krueger and Tuncer (1982). Using cross-industry
data on protection and productivity growth for Turkey in the period 1963
- 1976, these authors conclude that the empirical evidence does not provide
support for the infant industry argument. However, Harrison (1994) uses
their data to show that more protected sectors did in fact exhibit higher pro-
ductivity growth. As pointed out by Harrison, "Krueger and Tuncer (1982)
applied no statistical tests to support their conclusion...If one runs simple
correlations..one obtains striking results: Krueger and Tuncer’s data show
a statistically signi…cant positive relationship between increased protection
and higher productivity growth. In contrast to their stated conclusions, it
is possible to show that, in Turkey, protected industries did in fact achieve
greater productivity gains during the sample period."
    While Krueger and Tuncer’s results appear to show some support for
infant industry protection, most studies …nd little support. Cross-industry
studies usually show that the removal of protection generates both intra-
…rm and intra-industry productivity gains (possibly through market share
reallocations, just as in Melitz, 2003). This includes work by Pavcnik (2002),
Tybout and Westbrook (1995) for Mexico, Harrison (1994) for Cote d’Ivoire,
Nishimizu and Page (1982) for Yugoslavia, Kim (2000) for South Korea,
Topalova (2004) for India, Muendler (2003) for Brazil, Beason and Weinstein
(1996) for Japan, and others.
    Rodrik (2007) has criticized the use of cross-industry studies to test for the
success of IP on the grounds that if IP is designed to deal with market failures
that impede sector growth, then one should not be surprised to …nd a negative
correlation between protection and growth. He assumes that gi = (1            i )A,
where gi is the growth rate of industry i, i is an index of market failures,
and A is a parameter that captures productivity growth that is common


                                        33
across industries. In this framework, industries with stronger market failures
would exhibit slower productivity growth. If there are political or …scal
costs associated with the promotion of an industry then in equilibrium one
would …nd industries with a higher i exhibiting stronger promotion and lower
growth. Rodrik’s point is that lower growth could be perfectly consistent with
a successful IP, just as it is consistent with a politically motivated policy of
promoting sunset sectors. Rodrik’s argument may be correct for certain
types of IP, but not for IP associated with the infant industry argument (as
de…ned in Section 2), since this would generate a positive correlation between
protection and productivity growth. Even if Rodrik were correct in the short
run, we would expect that in the longer term successful examples of infant
industry protection would lead eventually lead to growth.
    In any case, there is a more fundamental problem with existing tests of
infant industry protection. There is no evidence to suggest that intervention
for IP reasons in trade even exists. If intervention were motivated by IP
reasons, we would expect the pattern of protection to be skewed towards
activities where positive externalities or market failures are largest. Instead,
existing evidence suggests that protection is motivated by optimal tari¤ con-
siderations (Broda, Limao, and Weinstein, 2006), for revenue generation, or
to protect special interests (Goldberg and Maggi, 1999, Gawande, Krishna
and Olarreaga, 2005). Tari¤ protection is frequently granted to less suc-
cessful …rms or declining industries. Beason and Weinstein (1996) study the
pattern of industrial targeting in Japan and speci…cally ask whether the gov-
ernment targeted industries with increasing returns or emerging sectors such
as electrical machinery. They …nd the opposite result: protection and other
forms of targeting such as capital subsidies were highest for declining indus-
tries and industries without increasing returns. Most tari¤ protection was
heavily concentrated in processed food and textiles, while most subsidized
loans and tax relief went into mining. Beason and Weinstein conclude that
"industrial policy considerations were dominated by the desire to aid declin-
ing sectors or protect the interests of large unproductive industries". Lee
(1996) reaches similar conclusions for South Korea.
    Harrison and Hanson (1999) …nd that in Mexico in the 1980s the pattern
of trade protection was skewed towards food processing and garments, pre-
sumably for political economy reasons since these were sectors where Mexico
already had a comparative advantage. More recently, Mobarak and Pur-
basari (2006) use a database on …rms granted import licenses for raw mate-
rials and commodities in Indonesia to show that politically connected …rms

                                      34
are more likely to be granted protection. However, …rms that export are
signi…cantly less likely to be granted support. This suggests that …rms most
likely to succeed on world markets in Indonesia were in fact penalized by
restricting their access to import licenses.
     There are a number of other areas where additional research is needed.
To properly test the type of model presented in Section 2, we would expect
initial output and productivity gains from the imposition of tari¤s; later
removal of these tari¤s would generate no e¤ects. We are not aware of
any studies that test for these asymmetric e¤ects of imposing protection
and later removing tari¤s through trade reform. Nor do existing empirical
studies address the many other reasons why infant industry protection may
not work. Domestic demand in LDCs may lack the level of sophistication that
would induce …rms to meet the quality standards necessary for penetrating
richer markets (Porter, 1990). Porter also argues that weak competition
in small protected markets may not provide the incentives that …rms need
to upgrade their technologies and increase their e¢ ciency. Small markets
may also fail to reach a critical mass where Marshallian externalities are
fully exploited. Moreover, as mentioned above, industries that use simple
production methods may expand without the generation of any externalities,
even if those same industries do exhibit strong Marshallian externalities in
rich countries (Baldwin, 1969, Rodríguez-Clare, 2007). Firms may believe
that protection will fail to create a cluster, and so they may decide not
adopt the production methods that lead to externalities but are pro…table
only within a cluster. In other cases protection may actually favor the use
of backward technologies that do not contribute to the generation of higher
industry-level productivity (Sauré, 2007).
    The realization of Marshallian externalities is a much more complex process
than what the model in Section 2 suggests. As argued by Rosenthal and
Strange (2005), "there are many di¤erent aspects of a location that may
matter to …rms. A well-intentioned policy could easily fail because it failed
to attend to one or two of these... it may not be possible to duplicate else-
where the circumstances that led to a successful agglomeration in another
place... This is not to say that government policy has never contributed to
the formation of clusters. It certainly has, but the formation of clusters has
been a side-e¤ect rather than the primary goal of the policy..." (p. 19). In
other words, the econometric evidence regarding Marshallian externalities
may in fact be telling us that agglomeration may be necessary but not suf-
…cient for increased productivity. If a certain factor, policy or institution

                                     35
is necessary for geographic concentration of an industry to lead to higher
productivity, then we may observe Marshallian externalities taking place in
advanced countries, but not in LDCs. To put it crudely, subsidizing the
software sector may not generate a Silicon Valley in a developing country.

3.3    Cross-Country Studies
There are a number of cross-country studies evaluating the success of IP.
These can be grouped into (1) testing for an association between protection
and country performance and (2) qualitative case study evidence. A number
of recent studies emphasize the importance of the pattern of protection in
understanding possible linkages between IP and economic growth. These
include O’Rourke (2000), Clemens and Williams (2001), Chang (2002), Irwin
(2002), Lehmann and O’Rourke (2008),
    O’Rourke (2000) and Clemens and Williamson (2001) both …nd a posi-
tive correlation between import tari¤s and economic growth across countries
during the late nineteenth century. These two studies hypothesize that
protection was associated with growth because it allowed countries to ac-
celerate the growth of what were then "emerging" sectors (industry) out of
"declining sectors" (agriculture). These emerging sectors were character-
ized by learning e¤ects and the kinds of Marshallian externalities modelled
in Section 2. These new explanations for the observed positive relationship
between growth and protection at the turn of the twentieth century could
also be used to explain how …rst Britain, and then the United States, were
able to emerge as economic leaders in conjunction with tari¤s that were very
high in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Chang (2002) claimed that
protection was essential in the transformation of the United States into an
industrialized economy in the 19th century.      Others (for one such view,
see Sir Arthur Lewis, 1955) have argued that Latin America’s relatively high
growth rates during the 1960’s and early 1970’s in a time of high e¤ective
rates of protection was also no coincidence.
    Irwin (2002) casts doubt on the meaning and robustness of such correla-
tions, arguing that rather than a causal relationship from protection for IP
reasons to growth, the positive correlation comes from the fact that a few
fast growing countries (e.g. the United States, Canada, Argentina) imposed
high tari¤s as a means of raising …scal revenues. Lehmann and O’Rourke
(2008) are able to address this criticism by purging their results of tari¤s
imposed for revenue purposes.

                                    36
    As pointed out by Lehmann and O’Rourke (2008), what you protect
matters. If the pattern of protection is skewed towards increasing returns
sectors where there are important externalities, then IP would be much more
likely to work than if protection is given to declining sectors or sectors with-
out externalities. In their book analyzing whether openness to trade is likely
to be associated with higher growth, Grossman and Helpman (1991) make
a similar point. Lehmann and O’Rourke examine the pattern of protection
and growth for a sample of developed countries during the period between
1875 and 1913. They …nd that while agricultural tari¤s were negatively cor-
related with growth, industrial tari¤s were positively correlated with growth.
Lehmann and O’Rourke also separately examine the relationship between
growth and what they refer to as "revenue tari¤s"–tari¤s imposed on goods
not produced at home and applied to raise revenue. They …nd no relation-
ship between tari¤s imposed to raise revenue and economic growth. They do
not, however, estimate the impact of protection on productivity growth, nor
do they calculate the net welfare e¤ects of these policies.
    Two other recent studies that emphasize that it is the pattern of protec-
tion which matters and not the average level of protection include Nunn and
Tre‡er (2004) and Estevadeordal and Taylor (2008). Nunn and Tre‡er (2004)
…nd that countries which protect skill-intensive sectors grow more rapidly
than countries which protect unskilled-labor-intensive industries. Estevade-
ordal and Taylor disaggregate tari¤s into consumption, capital goods, and
intermediate goods tari¤s. For the 1970s through the current decade, Es-
tevadeordal and Taylor show that tari¤ protection a¤ects growth negatively
by more if tari¤s are on capital or intermediate goods than on consumption
goods. We continue and expand this discussion to include a more general
evaluation of the literature on trade and growth in Section 4.
    Another approach relies on qualitative case study evidence to contrast
the apparent success of East Asia countries relative to Latin America and
elsewhere in the use of industrial policy. There is signi…cant debate over
whether the use of a range of industrial policy instruments, including infant-
industry protection, helped or hurt development in East Asia. A common
view is that East Asian countries used export subsidies whereas Latin Ameri-
can countries used import tari¤s, and that this explains part of the di¤erence
in performance in these two regions. In fact, East Asian countries used both
import tari¤s and export subsidies, and this created a setting in which the in-
centives were neutral regarding import substitution versus exports, although
manufacturing as a whole enjoyed some net promotion (World Bank, 1993).

                                      37
China’s policies over the last twenty …ve years could similarly be described
as using both import tari¤s and export subsidies.
    South Korea and Taiwan had tremendous rates of physical and human
capital accumulation over the 60s, 70s and 80s, and this went together with
rapidly changing comparative advantage towards capital intensive goods. Of
course, the standard explanation of this experience is that capital accumula-
tion caused by some exogenous factors led to a changing comparative advan-
tage. But an alternative interpretation, consistent with the model presented
in Section 2.1.2, is that such a structural transformation was not inevitable
because of multiple equilibria. In particular, without protection or promotion
of the capital intensive sectors, countries would have remained specialized in
the sectors where they enjoyed a static comparative advantage; since these
sectors were not capital intensive, then capital accumulation would not have
taken place. Amsden (1989) and Wade (1990) have argued that IP was cru-
cial for some East Asian countries to capitalize on their latent comparative
advantage in advanced manufacturing.
    It is clear that East Asian countries indeed pursued several policies to
encourage particular sectors, such as production subsidies, subsidized credit,
…scal incentives, and trade protection. But what was the actual e¤ect of these
policies relative to what would have happened in their absence? Can IP be
credited with bringing about the successful industrialization experienced in
East Asia? One approach in the literature has been to check whether the
industries that received most support are the ones that have grown most
rapidly.28 As we discussed above, protection is typically motivated by politi-
cal or terms of trade reasons rather than prospects for higher growth through
IP. In the late twentieth century, in contrast to the last century when indus-
trial countries protected emerging industries, it appears that trade barriers
are often designed to protect "sunset" industries rather than to encourage
"sunrise" industries (see Noland and Pack, 2003).

3.4     Export subsidies and other forms of IP
We have focused our discussion of the empirical evidence regarding the ef-
fectiveness of IP on infant-industry protection. But clearly there are many
other forms of IP: countries could subsidize exports across the board or in
  28
    Beason and Weinstein (1996) perform this exercise for Japan while Lee (1996) does it
for Korea. See Noland and Pack (2003) for a comprehensive review of this literature.



                                          38
particular industries, they could impose di¤erential taxes, as well as di¤eren-
tiated production, credit and R&D subsidies. Since a comprehensive review
of all forms of IP is not possible, in the rest of this section we focus our
discussion on export subsidies.
    Consider again the case in which some sectors exhibit Marshallian ex-
ternalities. An overall export subsidy would simply preserve the allocation
associated with the current pattern of comparative advantage. If export sub-
sidies are targeted to the sectors that exhibit Marshallian externalities, then
they could also be e¤ective in switching the economy to the equilibrium with
higher welfare. Again, production subsidies are less distortionary than export
subsidies but they impose stronger …scal demands. Thus, for governments
with great …scal needs or where taxation is very distortionary at the margin,
export subsidies could be a reasonable option, although import tari¤s would
be less costly.
    In any case, the advantages of export subsidies relative to import tari¤s
in improving productivity are threefold: (1) that by promoting exports, a
country makes sure that …rms are subject to the "discipline of the inter-
national market," which forces …rms to become more productive; (2) that
by subsidizing only exporting …rms, a country e¤ectively limits the subsidy
to …rms with high productivity; and (3) that domestic markets may be too
small to allow the protected industry to reap the full bene…ts of Marshallian
externalities. All of these arguments are relevant but require some qual-
i…cation. First, the discipline of the international market applies both to
…rms that export and to those that sell in domestic markets as long as there
are no quantitative restrictions. Second, there is in principle no reason to
subsidize highly productive …rms over low productivity …rms (see Demidova
and Rodríguez-Clare, 2007), unless there are barriers that prevent resources
from ‡owing from the latter to the former, in which case the most e¢ cient
policy would be to remove those barriers. Finally, if the economy is small
in relation to the industry size needed to fully exploit the Marshallian ex-
ternalities, this is not going to be …xed by an export subsidy. A di¤erent
and more reasonable argument is that domestic demand is not su¢ ciently
sophisticated, hence …rms selling to domestic consumers will not develop the
necessary level of sophistication needed for success in international markets.
Export orientation for infant industries would avoid this problem.29
  29
    Although we have focused on trade policies, the use of local-content requirements
on foreign producers can also be justi…ed by appealing to Marshallian externalities. In


                                          39
    One could rede…ne the case for industrial policy as trying to change in-
centives to produce (or export) some goods and not others. What evidence is
there that what a country exports (or imports) matters? There are a number
of studies listed in Table 2 which suggest that the growth e¤ects of openness
hinge on the composition of trade. These include Dodaro (1991), Giles, Giles
and McCann (1992), Hansen (1994), Ghatak, Milner, and Utkulu (1997),
Pineres and Ferrantino (1997), Xu and Wang (1999), Choudhri and Hakura
(2000), Khalafalla and Webb (2001), and An and Iyigun (2004). With one
exception, all these studies …nd that exports are more likely to lead to growth
if they are in non-traditional sectors such as manufacturing or skill-intensive
goods rather than primary products or raw materials; studies also …nd that
greater export diversi…cation is more likely to be associated with growth.
    Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik (2005) develop a measure of the sophisti-
cation of a country’s exports based on the level of GDP per capita associated
with the export of di¤erent goods worldwide. Once they have attached a
level of GDP per capita to each detailed export category based on which
countries export the good, they can then derive the implied GDP level of a
country’s exports. Countries whose export baskets contain items typically
produced by higher income countries have a "high" level of export sophistica-
tion relative to what would be expected given their level of development. In
principle, one could construct a measure of the distance between the implied
income level of a country’s exports and the country’s actual level of GDP
per capita. In a related paper, Rodrik (2006) shows that China’s exports in
1992 were associated with an income level more than six times higher than
China’s per-capita GDP at that time. Rodrik suggests that the gap between
the implied level of income of China’s exports and China’s actual GDP per
capita is too large to have occurred naturally and is one outcome of China’s
activist industrial policy.
    These studies suggesting that what a country exports is more impor-
tant than how much the country exports for long run growth are suggestive
that IP has played an important role in country growth experiences, but are
not conclusive. No researchers have identi…ed an association between the
existence of Marshallian externalities in particular sectors, industrial promo-
tion of those sectors, consequent changes in the commodity composition of
fact, such requirements force multinationals to buy local inputs just as protection induces
domestic consumers (and …rms) to buy from local producers. A major di¤erence, of course,
is that local-content requirements are quantitative restrictions rather than explicit tari¤s
or subsidies.


                                            40
a country’s export basket, and growth. Consequently, we can only loosely
infer that rapid changes in the composition of a country’s exports towards
more sophisticated products could be indicative of IP.


4    Trade and Economic Development

Countries intervene in trade for many reasons, including the desire to shift
production towards sectors with positive externalities (industrial policy), to
raise revenue, to a¤ect terms of trade, and to satisfy special interests. We
reviewed in Section 3 some of the studies that explicitly evaluate the suc-
cess of IP. There is almost no research that has been able to isolate the
e¤ects of IP on welfare, taking into account all the other motives for pro-
tection. However, there is a large literature which estimates the reduced
reform relationship between openness to trade and economic growth. In
this section, we review nearly 200 prominent studies that use some kind of
reduced form approach. We identify the di¤erent measures of openness used
in this literature, the datasets, the identi…cation strategies, and the results
    Can we use this vast literature to cast light on the IP debate? In de…ning
openness to trade, we make a distinction between trade volumes, such as
exports or imports, and trade policy, such as tari¤ reductions or changes
in quotas. Most of the studies we review below …nd a positive relationship
between trade volumes and growth. While there are far fewer studies that
evaluate the linkages between tari¤s and growth, they tend to get insigni…cant
or weak e¤ects. This should not be surprising given the mixed motives
for imposing tari¤ protection. We hypothesize that these di¤erent results
imply that industrial policy is more likely to induce growth it is "pro-trade".
Yet from a practical standpoint, it is di¢ cult to envision a successful set
of policies that are both pro-trade and protectionist; at a minimum, this
would require policies that fully o¤set any anti-trade biases. The positive
correlation between trade shares and growth is consistent with our hypothesis
that IP implemented via export promotion and encouragement of FDI has
generally led to higher productivity and growth outcomes, relative to IP
implemented through protection from trade. Before we turn to the literature
on trade volumes, trade policies, and country outcomes, we begin with some
stylized facts.

4.1       Stylized Facts on Trade policies, 1980-2004
If we use a conventional measure of trade volumes such as export shares
in GDP, developing countries are now more integrated into the world econ-
omy than the industrial countries. Figure 2 shows that export shares for
developing countries overtook industrial countries in the early 1990s.

        Figure 2: Export Shares in Developing and High-Income Countries


    Table 1 shows the evolution of country trade policies over the last twenty
…ve years. Countries are ranked according to the net change in tari¤ levels
between 1985 and 2004. We have included both developing and developed
countries to provide an indication of how protection changes at di¤erent
stages of development. The …rst four columns indicate the ratio of tari¤
revenues to trade ‡ows, taken from the World Bank. The next four columns
report the actual administrative tari¤s, averaged across import categories
between 1980 and 2004. The last three columns report changes in these
tari¤s between 1985 and 2004. The last column indicates the change in the
standard deviation of tari¤s over time; this measure is an indication of the
change in the dispersion of tari¤s.
    It is evident from Table 1 that there has been a dramatic decline in tari¤
protection among developing countries. Average tari¤s in India declined from

                                          42
98.8 percent in 1980 to 28.1 percent in 2004; in Bangladesh from 86 to 16.4
percent; in Costa Rica from 53 percent to 5.7 percent; in China from 49.5
percent in 1980 to 9.8 percent in 2004; in Turkey from 44 to 2.6 percent, and
in Chile from 30 percent in 1985 to 4.9 percent. Not all countries had such
enormous declines, however: in Algeria, average tari¤s only declined slightly,
from 21 to 18 percent.
    There are several other features worth noting in Table 1. The last column
of Table 1 shows that there has been a dramatic decline in tari¤ dispersion, as
indicated by the fall in the standard deviation of tari¤s. There is also a large
discrepancy between tari¤ revenues as a percentage of trade ‡ows ("revenue
tari¤s") and actual statutory tari¤s. Revenue tari¤s are reported in the
…rst 5 columns of Table 1, while statutory tari¤s are reported in columns 6
through 10. To illustrate the di¤erence, Table 1 shows that average tari¤s
in India in 1985 were 98.8 percent but tari¤ collections as a percentage of
trade were only 24.4 percent. In Paraguay, average tari¤s were 71 percent
in 1980, while tari¤ collections were 6 percent; in Costa Rica, tari¤s were 55
percent and collections were 5.3 percent; in Chile, average tari¤s in 1985 were
30 percent but tari¤ collections were 5.7 percent. The di¤erence between
these two measures re‡ects in part the role of tari¤ exemptions–typically
state enterprises were exempt from paying tari¤s, as were many exporters
and foreign enterprises— as well as selective imposition of duties by customs
o¢ cers and the negative impact of high tari¤s on imports.
    We also highlight the historically high levels of protection in China. China
has arguably had the most spectacular success in integrating into the world
economy in the last two decades. Yet in 1990, it was still one of the most
protected economies in the world, with an average tari¤ rate of 40 percent.
According to Table 1, in 1990 China was tied for …fth place in average levels
of tari¤ protection, behind Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Kenya. The
dispersion of tari¤ levels was also high, and the maximum tari¤ exceeded
200 percent. Figure 3, taken from Rodrik (2006) documents that much of
China’s export surge occurred simultaneously with the imposition of high
tari¤s. Nevertheless, countries such as China and India— because they had
such high tari¤s to begin with— also exhibited the highest tari¤ reductions
between 1985 and 2004.

4.2    Cross-country Evidence on Trade Policies, Trade
       Volumes, Productivity, and Growth
A standard approach in the cross-country literature is to regress an outcome
of interest for country i at time t (GDP growth, real GDP per worker, or
total factor productivity growth) on a preferred measure of openness and a
set of controls Z,

          Yit = Constant + OP EN N ESSit + Zit +          i   +   t   + "it   (10)

   Most controversies have arisen over the following three issues:

  1. How to measure OP EN N ESS
  2. How to account for the endogeneity between Y and OP EN N ESS.
  3. Which variables to include in the set of controls Z.

    (1) How to measure openness. There is a large debate over how to measure
openness. The ideal measures for understanding the linkages between trade
policies and outcomes are measures of policies themselves— such as tari¤s
and quotas, but until recently, these measures were hardly ever used (see
Harrison (1996) for a discussion). How much of a problem is the lack of
information on statutory tari¤s (in contrast to revenue tari¤s) in practice?
If the di¤erence between actual tari¤s and revenues are due to exemptions
in the tari¤ schedule, then the tari¤ schedule is misleading, and it would
actually be better to use revenues as a share of import value. But if the
di¤erential between revenue tari¤s and statutory tari¤s highlighted in Table
1 re‡ects the restrictive impact of high barriers on trade volumes, barriers, or
corrupt practices which impose rent-seeking costs not re‡ected in revenues,
then using trade revenues to proxy for tari¤s is not ideal.
    A more fundamental problem which has plagued the literature on the
relationship between trade policies and growth is the continued use of trade
volumes as a proxy for policy. Trade volumes are a¤ected by many di¤er-
ent factors, including policies, distance to neighbors and trading partners,
country size, exchange rate movements, terms of trade changes, and barriers
to entry. Consequently, simply using trade volumes to proxy for changes
in trade policies may be misleading. We evaluate the relationship between
these di¤erent openness measures in Table 3. We present correlations be-
tween actual tari¤s, trade taxes as a percentage of trade, two measures of

                                      45
trade volumes, the nominal exchange rate, and the ratio of foreign investment
in‡ows to GDP using annual data from 1980 through 2004. For trade shares,
we include both nominal and real trade shares, where real trade shares are
de…ned as the ratio of trade to GDP in constant prices from the Penn World
Tables (version 6.1). Table 4 repeats the same exercise, but restricts the
sample to developing countries. The correlations reported in Tables 3 and 4
highlight the following:

     Although Table 1 indicates a big di¤erence in magnitude between the
     ratio of tari¤ revenues to trade and actual administrative tari¤s, the
     correlation coe¢ cient reported in Table 3 between the two measures is
     actually quite high at .63 and statistically signi…cant.

     There is a signi…cant negative correlation between trade shares and
     tari¤s. The correlation with nominal openness is -.25. The correlation
     with real openness about the same, between -.2 and -.3, depending on
     which measure of tari¤s is used.

     The negative correlation coe¢ cient between trade policies (tari¤s) and
     outcomes (trade shares) does not depend on how tari¤s or trade shares
     are measured.

     Tari¤ levels are highly (negatively) correlated with the ratio of foreign
     investment in‡ows to GDP, and trade volumes are highly (positively)
     correlated with foreign investment in‡ows. In fact, trade ‡ows are
     more highly correlated with foreign investment in‡ows than they are
     with tari¤s. These correlations suggest that measures of openness may
     also be capturing the gains from foreign investment in‡ows.

     The correlations are the same or stronger if we restrict the sample to
     developing countries (see Table 4). Trade taxes as a share of trade ‡ows
     continue to be highly correlated with actual tari¤s. The correlation
     coe¢ cient between trade shares and both tari¤ measures increases to
     (negative) .36.

   These stylized facts suggest that trade taxes as a share of trade are a
much better proxy for average tari¤s than trade shares. The correlation
coe¢ cient of statutory tari¤s with revenue tari¤s is signi…cantly higher than
the correlation of statutory tari¤s with trade shares (.70 versus -.35). Yet


                                     46
researchers continue to rely on trade shares as a measure of trade policy,
despite the easily available (World Bank or IMF) tari¤ revenue measure.
The other broad conclusion we can draw from these data is that there is
a signi…cant positive relationship between less restrictive trade policies and
higher trade shares. Pritchett (1996) suggested that:

     “alternative objective measures of trade policy are completely
     uncorrelated across countries. This result has serious implica-
     tions for empirical research that attempts to assess the e¤ects of
     liberalization on economic performance using comparisons across
     countries; it also highlights the di¢ culties of interpretation in
     these types of empirical studies”.

    We would argue that this is not the case: statutory tari¤s are highly
correlated with revenue tari¤s, indicating that they are excellent measures
of trade policy There is also a signi…cant and negative correlation between
tari¤ measures and outcome measures such as real or nominal trade shares in
GDP. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the (inverse) correlation between trade
shares and trade policies is not nearly large enough to allow proponents of
free trade to argue that high trade shares always re‡ect a free trade stance.
    Most studies listed in Table 2 use trade volumes as a measure of openness,
but trade volumes are outcomes of trade policies as well as a host of factors
including geography, shifts in terms of trade, exchange rate shocks, and
changes in transport and communication costs. Much of the criticism in
the important and widely cited Rodriguez and Rodrik (1999) NBER Macro
Annual paper is directed at the inadequacy of typical proxies for openness.
Rodriguez and Rodrik …nd fault with Dollar (1992), Edwards (1998), and
Sachs and Warner (1995) for using exchange rate distortions as measures of
trade policy, since exchange distortions re‡ect macro-economic distortions,
not trade policies per se. They also critique Edwards (1998) for using a World
Bank classi…cation of trade regimes which is subjective. While Dollar’s (1992)
openness measure seems ideal because it directly measures the deviation of
domestic from international prices, Rodriguez and Rodrik argue the measure
is primarily correlated with swings in the exchange rate. Dollar (1992) uses
the following de…nition of openness:
                                                 Pi
                     OP EN N ESSi = 100
                                              Ei PU SA

                                     47
    OP EN N ESS is the relative price level compared to the United States,
with all price levels converted to US dollars, using Summers-Heston country-
speci…c consumption price indices. A higher price level should indicate a
higher degree of distortions. Rodriguez and Rodrik (1999) argue that the
law of one price does not hold in general, and that domestic prices could be
high for reasons other than trade policy. These could include high transport
costs or monopolies in distribution channels. In practice, Rodriguez and
Rodrik show that there is no relationship between the openness measure
calculated by Dollar and actual tari¤s or non-tari¤ barriers. In fact, tari¤s
and non-tari¤ barriers enter with the wrong sign if this measure of openness is
regressed on tari¤s and non-tari¤ barriers. They then show that this measure
is primarily capturing exchange rate movements.
    Both Rodriguez and Rodrik (1999) and Harrison and Hanson (1999) cri-
tique a heavily used measure of openness created by Sachs and Warner (1995).
The Sachs and Warner measure has been updated by Wacziarg and Welch
(2007), but the updated measure may su¤er from the same shortcomings as
the Sachs and Warner measure. Harrison and Hanson show that the Sachs
and Warner (1995) measure of OP EN N ESS does not pick up di¤erences in
trade policy but instead re‡ects di¤erences across countries in exchange rate
policies and political regimes. One way to reinterpret the evidence presented
in Dollar (1992) and Sachs and Warner (1995) is that real exchange rate over-
valuation is bad for growth, a theme recently emphasized by Rodrik (2007).
One obvious implication for researchers is that any study which measures
the impact of real price distortions on growth due to protection should also
control for exchange rate movements.

   (2) Endogeneity problems. Endogeneity problems could arise for many
reasons. Policy makers may prefer not to open up to trade until …rms are
capable of competing on world markets, suggesting that the causality runs
from incomes to openness. Even statutory measures of trade policy (tari¤s,
quotas) are endogenously determined. The pattern of protection is likely
to be skewed towards protecting weak sectors,promising infant industries,
special interests or vocal minorities.
   While empirical work in the 1970s and 1980s largely ignored endogeneity
problems, newer studies give much greater weight to constructing plausible
identi…cation strategies. This progress is evident in Table 2, which lists
prominent studies on the linkages between openness and growth from the
1980s onwards. Most of the early studies had no identi…cation strategy at

                                      48
all, as indicated in column (4). More recent work addresses this omission,
using one of two general approaches.
    The …rst approach is to use granger-causality tests that exploit lags in
studies that use time-series datasets. As indicated in Table 2, these studies of-
ten …nd that causality runs in the reverse direction, from Y to OP EN N ESS:
more successful economies (or sectors) are more likely to open up to global
competition. Related to this approach is the use of lags as instruments, which
depends on some strong assumptions about the lack of correlation between
the instruments and the error term.
    The second general approach to identi…cation has been to seek additional
instruments for OP EN N ESS. One path-breaking study along these lines is
Frankel and Romer (1999). Frankel and Romer use the insights from gravity
models to derive an instrument based on geographic proximity. Gravity
models predict that countries closer to each other trade more with each other.
This means that distance can be used as an instrument for bilateral trade.
In the …rst stage regressions, Frankel and Romer regress the log of country
i’s trade with country j as a share of country i’s GDP on distance and other
variables:
                          ln ( ij =GDPi ) = a0 Xij + ij
    The vector X includes the log of distance between country i and j, the log
of population and area in both countries, and dummy variables indicating
whether the two countries share a common border and whether they are
landlocked. There are no subscripts for time in this speci…cation: this is a
pure cross-section using data for 1985. Frankel and Romer show that greater
distance from a trading partner reduces bilateral trade, and they are able to
explain 36 percent of bilateral trade in the …rst stage. Using the …rst stage
estimates, Frankel and Romer then generate an OP EN N ESS variable by
aggregating predicted bilateral trade with all of country i’s trading partners.
In the second stage, Frankel and Romer regress log of income per capita in
1985 on the predicted trade share, log of population and log of area. They
show that OP EN N ESS positively a¤ects income per capita.
    The beauty of this approach is that geographic proximity is without ques-
tion exogenous with respect to income. There are several problems, how-
ever. Since distance does not change over time, the authors cannot allow
for country-speci…c …xed e¤ects i in equation (1) and are restricted to pure
cross-section estimation. While one solution in principle would be to con-
trol for factors that vary across countries but remain …xed over time— such


                                       49
as cultural or institutional di¤erences— it may be di¢ cult to control for all
these omitted determinants of income. Another concern is that Frankel and
Romer’s original results are not very robust: the statistical signi…cance on
predicted openness disappears once we add continent dummies, which is not
surprising since all the identi…cation is from the cross-section. Frankel and
Romer also omit observations with zero bilateral trade in the …rst stage,
which probably contributes to the poor …rst stage R-square and the result-
ing weak instrument problem. Rodriguez and Rodrik (1999) are also critical
of Frankel and Romer because they argue that greater openness to trade gen-
erated through geographic proximity may have di¤erent e¤ects from trade
generated through trade policy interventions. One further concern is that
the instrumental variable estimates magnify the impact of trade on incomes,
in contrast to what one would expect if trade is a positive function of income.
The explanation given by Frankel and Romer is that the bias goes in the op-
posite direction because of measurement error, but one is still left wondering
whether or not the authors have successfully addressed the endogeneity of
trade to income.
    Alcala and Ciccone (2004) use the insights of Frankel and Romer to im-
prove on their initial speci…cation. They use all bilateral trade data available
in the …rst stage, including those bilateral trade pairs with zero trade, which
improves the …rst stage F-statistic from 3.06 using Frankel and Romer’s bilat-
eral trade pairs to 11.66. This gives them two and a half times the number of
observations in the …rst stage relative to Frankel and Romer. Consequently,
the second stage relationship between their chosen measure of openness and
their dependent variable Y (the log of PPP GDP per capita in 1985) is more
robust. They also add a measure of institutional quality to the Z vector,
which addresses the concern that trade is positively correlated with income
or growth because greater openness is correlated with better institutions.
They instrument institutional quality with language and settler mortality
data, drawn from Hall and Jones and Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson.
Nevertheless, any analysis which uses geography as an instrument is still
restricted to a pure cross-section analysis, which requires the researcher to
…nd all possible covariates which could induce a spurious correlation between
OP EN N ESS and Y .
    There are other aspects to Alcala and Ciccone (2004) which suggest that
the relationship between openness and income in a pure cross-section is not
very robust. Trade openness is only signi…cantly correlated with Y if the
authors use a “real”measure of openness, de…ned as the ratio of PPP trade

                                      50
to GDP. Nominal trade shares are not signi…cantly associated with GDP per
capita, which leads Rodrik, Subramanian, and Trebbi (2004) to suggest that
Alcala and Ciccone’s results are driven by movements in the price level, not
by trade. It is di¢ cult to be sure, however, since Rodrik, Subramanian and
Trebbi do not use exactly the same speci…cation as Alcala and Ciccone.
    Romalis (2007) suggests another clever instrument for a country’s OPENNESS:
tari¤s imposed by a country’s trading partners. In particular, Romalis uses
US most-favored nation (MFN) tari¤s as an instrument for developing coun-
try trade shares. Using this instrument, he shows that the change in real
per capita GDP is positively and signi…cantly a¤ected by trade, and that
the magnitude is economically important. Using MFN tari¤s is particularly
clever, since these are unlikely to be in‡uenced by developing country behav-
ior and are consequently exogenous. This is at the same time a limitation
of the approach: the instrument only varies over time, not across countries
since the US must apply the same MFN tari¤s to all its trading partners.
The results also could be interpreted to suggest that other country poli-
cies matter for developing country growth, but sheds less light on whether
own developing country policies to lower their trade barriers is bene…cial for
growth. What Romalis shows is that access for developing country exports is
bene…cial for growth, but his research does not indicate whether opening up
import-competing sectors to competition through reductions in protection
are also bene…cial for growth.
    Two very recent studies which make an important contribution to resolv-
ing the endogeneity of trade and growth are Feyrer (2009) and Donaldson
(2009). Feyrer (2009) suggests a solution to the problem faced by Frankel
and Romer in using geography as an instrument. To overcome the fact that
their instrument did not vary over time, which made it impossible to control
for country …xed e¤ects, Feyrer allows the importance of air and sea distance
across countries to vary over time. In the …rst stage of his estimation, Feyrer
allows the coe¢ cient on air and sea distance to be time-varying in explaining
bilateral trade. He then uses those time varying coe¢ cients to construct time
and country-speci…c instruments for the …rst stage. Feyrer shows that trade
has important, robust e¤ects on growth using a panel of countries for 1960
through 1995. Donaldson (2009) uses historical data for 1861 through 1930
across Indian districts to estimate the impact of the introduction of railroads
on trade costs, income volatility, price convergence, and economic growth.
He traces out the mechanisms through which railroads a¤ected income and
shows that the reduction of trade costs through the introduction of railroads

                                      51
had large and important e¤ects on economic growth.
    (3) Which variables to include in the set of controls Z : The third major
area of controversy in this literature is which variables to include in the set of
controls Z. There is a growing literature which claims that two key omitted
variables from the Z vector, leading to omitted variable bias in early stud-
ies, are institutions and geography. Indeed a recent literature has sought to
distinguish between institutions, economic geography, and trade as sources
of economic growth, including Easterly and Levine (2003), Rodrik, Subra-
manian, and Trebbi (2004), and Alcala and Ciccone (2004). Only Alcala
and Ciccone …nd that openness matters; the other two studies …nd that “in-
stitutions rule”. There are several reasons for why Alcala and Ciccone get
very di¤erent results from Rodrik et. al. (2004). First, Alcala and Ciccone
use real trade shares while Rodrik et. al. use nominal trade shares as their
measure of openness. Second, Alcala and Ciccone improve upon the Frankel
and Romer measure by expanding the …rst-stage and using more countries,
improving the …rst-stage F and reducing the fragility of the instrument.
    None of these three studies, which have been extensively cited in the
empirical literature on the determinants of growth, uses trade policy as a
measure of openness. Easterly and Levine (2003) use the Sachs and Warner
(1995) and Dollar (1992) measures to proxy for openness; the ‡aws of these
two measures are discussed above. Rodrik et. al. use the average of nominal
trade shares for 1950 through 1998 as their openness measure. All three
papers focus on a pure cross-section of countries. As pointed out by Harrison
(1996), trade policies and trade shares have changed too much over the last
forty years to make long run averages very meaningful.
    Given the problems inherent in the openness measures, and the reliance on
pure cross-sectional estimation, it is not surprising that openness is trumped
by institutions in two of these three studies. This research also highlights
the tremendous problems associated with measuring institutions in a way
which is distinct from trade policy. The correlation between the openness
and institutions measures in Easterly and Levine (2003) is .68, which suggests
that multicollinearity is likely to be a signi…cant problem. Both Rodrik et.
al. and Alcala and Ciccone use the Kaufmann, Kraay and Zoido-Lobaton
measure of institutions, which is constructed from World Bank surveys based
on responses for 1997-1998. Yet the dependent variables in these two studies
are PPP GDP per capita prior to that period: 1985 PPP GDP per worker
for Alcala and Ciccone and PPP GDP per capita in 1995 for Rodrik et. al.
It seems odd to try to understand growth in 1985 or 1995 using measures

                                       52
of institutions based on data from the end of the 1990s, unless institutions
change very little. Yet if institutions are not time-varying, then they may
simply be capturing the country …xed e¤ect i in equation (1).
    While this survey has highlighted some of the shortcomings of cross-
country work on openness and growth, there are several promising new areas
of research which deserve mention. Most of the work surveyed so far uses
a measure of real GDP per capita or per capita growth as a measure of Y .
Yet a number of studies have suggested that openness is important because
it allows countries to invest more. Levine and Renelt (1992) show that there
is no robust relationship between di¤erent measures of openness and average
per capita GDP growth in their cross-country sample. Replacing Y with
investment shares in GDP, however, they …nd that openness is robustly cor-
related with investment rates. They conclude that “the relationship between
trade and growth may be based on enhanced resource accumulation and not
necessarily on the improved allocation of resources”.
    Levine and Renelt show that trade matters for growth because it increases
investment. One mechanism could be by reducing the price of investment
goods. Delong and Summers show that countries with lower investment
prices grow faster, and Lee (1995) shows that a higher share of imported
capital goods in total investment are associated with higher growth. More
recently, Hsieh and Klenow (2007) argue that on the contrary there is no link
between lower relative prices of investment goods and trade policy. They cite
as evidence the fact that the actual level of prices for investment goods in
poor countries are not higher than in the rest of the world. Instead, they
argue that investment rates are low in poor countries because the relative
price of investment is high relative to non-traded consumption goods, such
as services.
    The importance of barriers to investment in understanding linkages be-
tween trade and growth is taken up once more by Estevadeordal and Taylor
(2008). They estimate a version of equation (1) in di¤erences, but separate
their measure of openness into tari¤s on consumption goods, intermediates,
and capital goods. They also allow for a country …xed e¤ect in di¤erences,
leading to a di¤erence-in-di¤erence speci…cation for (1). They show that this
approach successfully addresses the problem of whether institutions or trade
policy is responsible for higher incomes, since in …rst di¤erences there is no
clear correlation between the two. In addition, they address the potential
endogeneity of changes in openness by using as instruments for the change
the level of tari¤s in 1975 interacted with two measures of what they refer to

                                     53
as “GATT potential”: GATT membership in 1975 and a measure of diplo-
matic pressure constructed from number of diplomats. Estevadeordal and
Taylor show that tari¤ protection a¤ects growth more negatively if tari¤s
are on capital goods or intermediates, which is consistent with Levine and
Renelt’s 1992 hypothesis that openness matters because it a¤ects resource
accumulation.
    A second promising area of research is related to an emerging consensus
on the need for openness to trade to be accompanied by key complementary
policies. Recent research emphasizing the importance of complementarities
between trade and other policies includes Chang, Kaltani, and Loayza (2005),
Bolaky and Freund (2006), and Ja¤ee and Sutherland (2003). One reason
why the relationship in (1) may be fragile could be because openness to trade
is most successful if implemented in conjunction with other policies–which
make it possible for …rms to e¤ectively compete on world markets. If such a
policy can be characterized as X (there could be overlap between X and Z),
then it would lead to a slightly di¤erent speci…cation:

            Yit = Constant + OP EN N ESSit + Zit + Xit
                  + (OP EN N ESS X)it + i + t + "it

    Figure 4, taken from Bolaky and Freund (2006), makes this point graphi-
cally. Bolaky and Freund use three di¤erent measures of openness, including
real and nominal trade shares, and tari¤s. In countries with low barriers to
entry, there is a positive relationship between openness to trade and growth;
in regulated economies, there is a negative relationship. The importance of
other policies— in this case, low entry barriers— provides one explanation for
why it is so di¢ cult to …nd a robust relationship between openness to trade
and good performance. There is simply too much heterogeneity in outcomes,
in large part because other types of policies are so di¤erent. The necessity for
openness to trade to be accompanied by low barriers to entry and exit can be
understood in light of new trade theories that emphasize …rm heterogeneity,
as illustrated by Melitz (2003). In his model, gains from trade occur through
reallocation of market share from less productive to more productive …rms.
If …rms cannot easily expand or exit, this important source of productivity
gains through trade reforms is lost.
    Two other studies also …nd that gains from trade are contingent on other
policies. Chang, Kaltani, and Loayza (2005) use panel data instead of a
cross-section and trade shares corrected for country size are their measure of

                                      54

openness. In their work, the key complementary policies for ensuring that
openness to trade is associated with growth include infrastructure develop-
ment, labor market ‡exibility, and low barriers to entry. Given the cur-
rent levels of those variables, they conclude that “there are many countries
that currently stand to lose from opening their markets”. Chang, Kaltani
and Loayza argue that other types of reforms are not so critical for ensur-
ing growth gains from openness, including educational attainment, …nancial
depth, and good governance. DeJong and Ripoll (2006), using tari¤s as
a measure of openness, also …nd that the e¤ect of openness on growth is
conditional on the level of income. In particular, using cross-country data
for 1975-2000, they …nd a positive relationship between tari¤s and growth
rates for the world’s poorest countries, but a negative relationship for rich
countries.
    These three papers have several implications for trade policy. When elim-
inating both trade and other distortions simultaneously is not possible, these
papers suggest that bene…ts depend on the existence and the degree of non-
trade distortions and the feasibility of removing them. Packages tailored to
the speci…c circumstances of each country may be more appropriate than a

                                     55
"one size …ts all" policy. Another implication is that opening up to trade
is not enough to ensure growth; in particular, key complementary reforms
include lowering barriers to new …rm entry, encouraging more ‡exible labor
markets, and improving infrastructure.

4.3    What can the di¤erent e¤ects of trade volumes
       versus trade policy tell us about the success of IP?
Our review of recent evidence on trade policies, trade volumes, and growth
suggests that researchers face several challenges. In particular, measuring
openness to trade, identifying the direction of causality between openness
and growth, and identifying additional controls to include in cross-country
estimation are ongoing concerns. Nevertheless, our review of the studies in
Table 2 suggests the following broad conclusions:
      Studies that use trade volumes as a measure of openness generally …nd
      a positive relationship between changes in openness and growth.
      Studies that use tari¤s as a measure of openness for the post World
      War II period generally …nd an insigni…cant e¤ect of average tari¤s on
      growth. However, the pattern of protection matters. High tari¤s on
      intermediates or investment goods may be negatively associated with
      growth.
    Existing studies suggest that in the post World War II period, tari¤s on
average have not been successful in generating higher growth. We con…rm
these general conclusions using a panel dataset on non-OECD countries, for
the 1960 through 2000 period. In particular, we contrast the results us-
ing trade shares (X+M/GDP) as our openness measure relative to using the
World Bank’s revenue tari¤s (tari¤ revenue divided by imports). The de-
pendent variable is log income per capita. The use of a panel of annual
observations allows us to control for country-speci…c …xed e¤ects and also
for time e¤ects. Country …xed e¤ects are one approach to controlling for
country characteristics that vary across countries (such as institutions) that
are not perfectly measured and do not vary systematically from one year to
the next. Time e¤ects allow us to control for world-wide shocks, such as an
oil price shock or a world–wide currency crisis.
    The top two rows in Table 5 show that openness measured using trade
shares is positively and signi…cantly associated with growth. These results

                                     56
are consistent with the majority of the studies listed in Table 2 that use trade
shares as a measure of openness and generally …nd that changes in trade
shares are associated with higher growth. However, the bottom two rows
show that revenue tari¤s are not signi…cantly associated with growth. Even
skeptics, such as Rodriguez (2007), generally conclude that there is a strong
correlation between trade volumes and growth, while the association between
trade policy–as measured by the World Bank’s revenue tari¤ measure–and
growth is weak.
    The positive correlation between trade shares and growth is very strong
and remains after we add other controls. The negative correlation between
tari¤s and growth is signi…cant in some speci…cations but is not a robust
…nding. What should we make of this? As we discussed in Section 3, tari¤s
are imposed for many reasons. Foremost among these reasons are the need to
raise revenue, political economy considerations, and infant industry concerns.
Either IP via protection has increased growth, or protection on average has
been imposed for other reasons, leading to no net gains in output.
    A promising area for new research is to move beyond reduced form evi-
dence on the linkages between openness and growth so that we can identify
how openness to trade a¤ects growth. This is particularly important from
a policy perspective. If openness yields bene…ts because it allows …rms to
import new technology embodied in capital goods, the policy implications
are quite di¤erent than if openness is bene…cial because it forces …rms to
compete internationally or leads to market share reallocation towards more
e¢ cient …rms. Identifying the mechanisms leading from openness to growth
is precisely the focus of new micro-based studies of …rms (see, for example,
Melitz (2003) or Acemoglu, Antras, and Helpman (2007)). These theoretical
advances have been accompanied by a growing empirical literature, to which
we now turn.

4.4    Identifying the mechanisms for gains from trade
Much of the new research evaluates the importance of international trade for
growth using micro models of consumer and …rm behavior. This new research
focuses on the following mechanisms for understanding the linkages between
openness to trade and growth: (1) gains from consumption of increased va-
riety (2) gains from importing goods that embody new technology (3) gains
from increasing competition (4) gains from reaping economies of scale (5)
gains through reallocation of market shares to the most productive …rms and

                                      57
(6) learning by doing through exporting. We describe these in more detail
below.30
    Gains from consumption of increased variety Quantitative models are
useful for measuring gains from trade coming from increased variety, as in
Romer (1994). Romer (1994) and Feenstra (1994) showed that these gains
could be large, while Arkolakis et. al. (2008) show that Romer’s results
are sensitive to modeling assumptions. Under heterogeneity, gains could be
small, as the new varieties that are imported after liberalization are "mar-
ginal varieties," in the sense that total consumption of these goods is small.
Moreover, the bene…ts from the increase in foreign varieties could be com-
pensated by the losses associated with the displacement of domestic varieties.
Another important paper in this literature is Broda and Weinstein (2006).
Broda and Weinstein show that an important part of growth comes from the
increase in imported variety over the last decades. While this may in part
result from a country’s own trade reforms, it is also driven by diversi…cation
on the part of exporting countries like China.
    Gains from importing goods that embody new technology Eaton and Ko-
rtum (1999) argue that tari¤s a¤ect the price of capital, and through this
they a¤ect the capital-labor ratio in steady state. Coe and Helpman (1995),
Keller (1998) and others reviewed in Keller (2004) study the role of trade as
a vehicle for "international R&D spillovers." The idea is that by importing
intermediate and capital goods, a country bene…ts from the R&D done in the
exporting countries. This is a key feature of the model of R&D and trade
in Eaton and Kortum (2001). A di¤erent notion is that trade accelerates
the international ‡ow of technical know-how (see Grossman and Helpman,
p. 165). Several papers have explored this empirically with mixed results
(see Rhee et. al., 1984, Aitken et. al., 1997, and Clerides et. al., 1998, and
Bernard and Jensen, 1999).
    A number of theoretical papers have explored the role of intermediate
inputs in raising productivity growth (Ethier (1979,1982), Markusen (1989),
Romer (1987, 1990), and Grossman and Helpman (1991)). Some recent stud-
ies …nd that increasing intermediate goods inputs or lowering input tari¤s are
associated with large productivity gains. This includes Goldberg, Khandel-
wal, Pavcnik, and Topalova (2008), Kasahara and Rodrigue (2008), Amiti
  30
    A note of caution: the fact that we discover more mechanisms through which trade
leads increasing welfare does not necessarily imply that the overall gains from trade are
larger – there are likely to be important "crowding out" e¤ects. See Arkolakis, Costinot
and Rodríguez-Clare (2009).

                                           58
and Konings (2007), Halpern, Koren, and Szeidl (2006) and Broda, Green-
…eld and Weinstein (2008). Goldberg, Khandelwal, Pavcnik and Topalova
(2008) use Indian data to show that accounting for new imported varieties
lowered the price index for intermediate goods by 4.7 percent per year rela-
tive to conventional gains from lower import prices. They also …nd that lower
input tari¤s account for a third of the new products introduced by domestic
Indian …rms, suggesting potentially large gains from trade.
    Gains from increasing competition Levinsohn (1993), Harrison (1994),
and Muendler (2005) show that increasing competition due to lowering of
trade barriers reduced price-cost margins, using micro-level data for Turkey,
Cote d’Ivoire, and Brazil. Enhanced competition may encourage …rms to
engage more in innovative activity, or may simply lead to lower prices for
consumers. One important implication is that studies which measure the
productivity gains from trade reforms without allowing mark-ups to fall post
reform are likely to mismeasure the productivity gains from trade, as pointed
out by Harrison (1994). Harrison shows that the direction of the bias in
productivity measurement cannot be identi…ed a priori. She also shows that
a simple way to address this problem is to allow measured factor shares to
vary with changes in trade policy when doing production function estimation.
    Gains through reallocation of market shares to the most productive …rms
New heterogeneous trade models suggest that trade enhances productivity by
reallocating output towards more e¢ cient …rms. In the original framework
developed by Melitz (2003), …rms are endowed with di¤erent productivity
draws, which are pre-determined and unchanging over time. When a country
opens up to international trade, only the more productive …rms remain as
the less productive …rms are forced to exit.
    There are a number of implications of this framework which could be
tested using …rm-level data. As we discussed earlier, these models which
emphasize reallocation of …rm shares imply a critical role for other comple-
mentary policies that make it easy for …rms to expand, contract, enter, or
exit the market. Another implication is that productivity gains from trade
reforms should operate through market share reallocation. An early study
for the United States by Baily, Hulten, and Campbell (1992) did not focus
on trade policy per se but provided a framework for decomposing productiv-
ity growth into components due to within-…rm changes versus reallocation
of output. They concluded that the bulk of growth in aggregate total factor
productivity (TFP) was accounted for by the reallocation of output shares.
For developing countries, this decomposition has been performed by Pavcnik

                                     59
(2002) for Chile and by Van Biesebroeck (2003) for Colombia.
    Since Pavcnik’s sample begins at the end of the Chilean trade reforms, she
cannot use changes in trade policy as her openness measure. Instead, she sep-
arates enterprises into import-competing, export-competing, and non-traded
sectors. She then examines whether import or export-competing …rms had
higher productivity relative to other types of …rms. Using the Olley-Pakes
(1993) approach to estimating productivity, Pavcnik …nds that import com-
peting …rms improved their productivity over time, while export competing
…rms did not. This suggests that in Chile there was no learning among ex-
porters, but import-competing …rms did exhibit productivity growth. Pavc-
nik calculates that two-thirds of productivity growth in Chile was due to
reallocation of market shares towards more e¢ cient producers, and the re-
maining one-third was due to improved productivity among surviving …rms.
    Van Biesebroeck (2003) uses a variety of methods to compute productivity
growth and …nds that for Colombia the majority of changes in productivity
occur within the same plant. Van Biesebroeck …nds that between two thirds
and three quarters of the total change comes from within plant changes. The
second most important e¤ect is the entry of more productive plants into
the economy. While Pavcnik (2002) …nds that two-thirds of the increases
in productivity growth are due to reallocation of market shares, Van Biese-
broeck …nds the opposite: in Colombia, the bulk of aggregate increases in
productivity growth are driven by within-plant changes in productivity.
    One possible explanation for these di¤erent results is that entry and exit
barriers (due to restrictions on hiring and …ring) in Colombia were higher
than in Chile during this period. Barriers to entry or exit make it di¢ cult
for a reallocation of market share towards more e¢ cient producers to occur.
More case studies are needed before we can reach any de…nitive conclusions.
However, the limited evidence suggests that productivity growth stems from
both (1) a reshu- ing of production towards more e¢ cient producers and
(2) increasing productivity within the …rm. Consequently, Melitz’s (2003)
simplifying assumption that …rms receive an exogenous productivity draw
which is unchanging over time is not consistent with actual …rm behavior.
The latest heterogeneous …rm research modi…es Melitz (2003) to allow …rm-
level productivity to evolve over time, instead of being …xed at the initial
distribution. Atkeson and Burstein (2006), Costantini and Melitz (2007),
Lileeva and Tre‡er (2007), and Ederington and McCalman (forthcoming) all
develop models with heterogeneous …rms where productivity is allowed to
evolve within the …rm. Lileeva and Tre‡er (2007) allow reductions in foreign

                                     60
tari¤s to induce lower-productivity …rms to invest in raising labor produc-
tivity, engage in more product innovation, and increase their adoption of
advanced manufacturing technology, which in turn leads to within-…rm pro-
ductivity gains. Bernard, Redding and Schott (2006) have also developed a
model where …rms produce multiple goods, and trade liberalization may lead
them to focus on the goods in which they are most productive. Empirically
this would be seen as an increase in productivity within …rms, even though
the mechanism is essentially the same as in Melitz (2003).
    Learning by doing through exporting One likely channel through which
international trade leads to productivity gains is through learning by doing
for exporters. Yet a …rst round of empirical studies suggested that there
was very little, if any, learning from exporting. Instead, these …rst gener-
ation studies found that the best …rms select into exporting, leading to a
strong positive correlation between productivity levels and export status.
This research included case studies of Colombia (Clerides, Lach, and Tybout
(1998)), Spain (Delgado, Farinas, and Ruano (2002)), Germany (Bernard and
Wagner (1997)),and the United States (Bernard and Jensen (1999)). Pavc-
nik (2002) also found a similar result: …rms operating in export-competing
sectors are the most e¢ cient in manufacturing, but these …rms do not show
productivity improvements over time.
    This …rst-generation evidence is drawn from primarily high and upper
middle income countries. A second wave of empirical studies casts doubt
on the hypothesis that there is no learning by doing for exporters. For
developing countries, this includes Aw, Chung, and Roberts (2000) for Korea,
Van Biesebroeck (2005) for 9 African countries, Lileeva (2004), Blalock and
Gertler (2004) for Indonesia, Hallward-Driemeir, Iarossi, and Sokolo¤ (2005)
for East Asian countries, Fernandes and Isgut (2006), Park, Yang, Shi and
Jiang (2006) for China, Aw, Roberts and Winston (2007), and De Loecker
(2007) for Slovenia.
    All of these second generation studies …nd evidence of learning through
exporting. Blalock and Gertler (2004), for example, test for whether ex-
porting confers productivity gains using a panel of Indonesian manufactur-
ing enterprises. They …nd strong evidence that …rms experience a jump in
productivity of 3 to 5 percent following the initiation of exporting. Van
Biesebroeck (2006) examines the evidence in favor of learning by exporting
in Africa and also …nds a causal link from exporting to productivity. Aw,
Roberts and Xu (2009) also …nd evidence of learning by exporting in the
Taiwanese electronics industry.

                                    61
    Blalock and Gertler argue that previous tests of learning by exporting
were done on industrialized or middle income developing countries. They
point out that “while …rms in developed and middle income countries are
likely to be as e¢ cient as those in their trading partners’ countries, …rms
in the poorest countries may have much more to gain from exposure to in-
ternational export markets”. Lileeva and Tre‡er (2007) propose a similar
explanation for these disparate …ndings using Canadian data. They show
that lower productivity …rms are more likely to invest and learn in order
to access foreign markets, in contrast to higher productivity …rms that are
able to export without additional investment. De Loecker (2007) …nds that
for Slovenian …rms, there was evidence of a di¤erent kind of selection into
export markets: only the most productive …rms began exporting. He then
uses nonlinear matching estimation to test whether there was learning by ex-
porting during the 1994-2000 period. He …nds that while there was evidence
of selection into export markets, these same exporters increased productivity
as a result of exporting. The identi…cation strategy uses both matching
techniques and the di¤erence in productivity growth for those who began
exporting this period relative to a control group that did not. De Loecker
also …nds that learning by exporting was higher for …rms exporting to high
income destinations.
    All of the identi…cation problems present in (10) for the cross-country
literature are challenges for these micro studies as well. How can we distin-
guish between selection into exporting (i.e. the most productive …rms choose
to become exporters) and the impact of exporting on learning and produc-
tivity? A number of studies exploit the panel nature of the data, testing
whether …rms were more productive prior to becoming exporters. This in-
volves constructing an indicator for the period prior to when the …rm becomes
an exporter and testing whether it is statistically signi…cant in a regression
of productivity on export status. Another approach has been to …nd an in-
strument for export status. Van Biesebroeck (2005) uses as instruments for
lagged export status the location of the …rm, ethnicity of the owner, foreign
ownership and state ownership, although the validity of these instruments is
not completely clear. Lileeva and Tre‡er (2007) use US tari¤ cuts mandated
by the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement as an instrument for Canadian
export status.
    Despite ongoing controversies regarding the importance of learning by
doing through exporting, it is probably safe to conclude the following:


                                     62
    1. The most productive …rms are likely to become exporters.

    2. While there is selection into exporting, there is also learning through
       exporting.

    3. Learning from exporting is most likely in technologically backward
       countries and among less productive …rms.


5     Foreign Direct Investment
Many countries encourage inward FDI because they expect that foreign …rms
will enable domestic enterprises to become technologically more advanced.
This is nothing other than industrial policy, although it is rarely identi…ed
as such. As pointed out in our introduction, attracting foreign funds typ-
ically means tilting incentives in favor of foreign investors. Hanson (2001)
reviews the many incentives o¤ered to foreign …rms, which include income
tax holidays, tari¤ exemptions, and subsidies for infrastructure. In 1998, 103
countries o¤ered tax concessions to foreign companies that set up production
or other facilities within their borders. Some of these concessions were enor-
mous: the Government of Alabama paid the equivalent of 150,000 dollars per
employee to Mercedes for locating its new plant there in 1994; the British
government provided between 30,000 and 50,000 dollars per employee to at-
tract Samsung and Siemens in the late 1990s; Ireland o¤ered until recently
a corporate tax rate of 10 percent to all foreign manufacturers who chose to
locate there (Gorg and Greenaway (2003)). Until 2008, China o¤ered sig-
ni…cantly lower corporate tax rates to foreign companies locating there, and
continues to subsidize infrastructure investments for multinationals locating
in foreign enterprise zones.
    Most countries encourage FDI in‡ows to speci…c sectors; typically these
are sectors which are technologically more advanced. Chandra and Kolavalli
(2006) document that "attracting FDI has been an important strategy in
technological adaptation" in a number of cases (p. 33) Table 6 from Alfaro
and Charlton (2008) identi…es the speci…c sectors targeted by 29 countries
for the 1985-2000 period. The most targeted sectors include machinery,
computers, telecommunications, and transport equipment.
    Alfaro and Charlton …nd that FDI in‡ows are likely to be higher in tar-
getted sectors, and that FDI in these sectors generates higher growth. Their
study suggests support for the argument that IP with respect to FDI has

                                      63
been successful at generating growth, possibly because governments appear
to target sectors with positive externalities. Nevertheless, it is di¢ cult to
econometrically identify whether targeting has worked, since FDI may be
attracted to sectors with high potential for growth.
    Aggregate cross-country studies on FDI and growth are reviewed in greater
detail in another chapter of this volume. Given the strong correlation be-
tween FDI in‡ows as a share of GDP and openness to trade reported in
Tables 3 and 4, identifying a separate impact of FDI from trade on country
outcomes is likely to be challenging. All of the problems associated with
the cross-country evidence on trade and growth— measuring policies, identi-
fying the direction of causality, and omitted variable bias–are present in this
literature as well. Researchers typically use FDI ‡ows, rather than policies
targeted at FDI, to measure its e¤ects, since panel data on FDI policies is
even more di¢ cult to obtain than data on tari¤s. Reverse causality is also
a problem, since extensive evidence suggests that FDI is attracted to large,
less risky, and growing local markets. Nevertheless, there is generally mixed
evidence on the relationship between FDI and a country’s growth (Carkovic
and Levine (2002), Bosworth and Collins (1999), Borenzstein et al (1998)).
Recent work on FDI and growth suggests that other complementary policies
need to be in place to maximize the gains from inward foreign investment,
reinforcing the theme introduced in Section 4 on trade. Important policies
that need to be in place for a country to bene…t from FDI include a minimum
level of human capital (Borenzstein et al, 1998), developed …nancial markets
(Alfaro et al, 2004) and openness to trade (Balasubramanyam, Salisu, and
Dapsoford, 1996).
    There is signi…cant research interest in FDI as a vehicle through which
developing country …rms learn about new technology. While most of the
empirical literature focuses on productivity e¤ects of FDI, there is also a
growing literature that examines the impact of FDI on factor markets. We
review these two research areas below.

5.1    FDI and Productivity
To justify special treatment, foreign enterprises would need to confer some
type of positive externality which is not internalized by …rms. A typical test
of whether foreign …rms transfer technology to domestic enterprises would be
to estimate …rm-level productivity, and measure whether a more extensive
foreign presence increases domestic …rm productivity. As an illustration,

                                      64
Aitken and Harrison (1999) estimate the following production function for
…rm i in sector j at time t:

 Yit = Constant + 1 DF I_P lantijt + 2 DF I_Sectorjt
       + 3 (DF I_P lantijt  2 DF I_Sectorjt ) + 4 Zijt +         i   +   t   + "it

where
                            P
                               i2j   DF I_P lantijt Employmentijt
          DF I_Sectorjt =              P
                                         i2j Employmentijt

    The dependent variable could be log of output, in which case the Z vector
would control for input use, leaving foreign investment to a¤ect the resid-
ual determinants of output, which is typically interpreted to be total factor
productivity (TFP) levels. Alternatively, the dependent variable Y could
be output per worker or TFP, and the vector Z could include a number of
other controls, such as size, openness, or other determinants of productiv-
ity. DF I_P lant is typically measured as the share of the plant which is
foreign-owned. The coe¢ cient 1 then measures whether …rms with foreign
investment are more productive than other plants. Most researchers …nd
that the own-plant e¤ect is large and signi…cant. In other words, …rms with
foreign equity participation typically have higher output, higher output per
worker, or higher levels of TFP.
    This is an important point which has not been emphasized enough in
the literature on FDI. While many researchers are focused on identifying
some sort of externality or technology spillover, probably the most impor-
tant contribution that foreign …rms make is the direct e¤ect captured by
the coe¢ cient 1 on DF I_P lant. Ramondo (2008) develops a model where
countries gain access to foreign technologies through the activities of multi-
nationals. In counterfactual exercises with her estimated model she …nds
that for small countries the associated bene…ts can be quite large.
    Policies that promote joint venture activity are consistent with the em-
pirical results showing productivity gains from FDI that are internalized by
joint ventures. As an illustration, promoting joint ventures has been the core
of China’s policy to bene…t from inward foreign investment. Foreign investors
in key sectors (mobile phones, computers) were required to enter into joint
ventures with domestic …rms (Rodrik, 2006). In electronics, Huchet (1997)
writes that China’s technology strategy has been clear: “allow foreign …rms
access to the domestic market in exchange for technology transfer through

                                       65
joint production or joint ventures.”Wholly owned foreign …rms are a rarity in
China; most …rms are joint ventures between local (frequently state-owned)
and foreign enterprises.
    China is a particularly interesting case to study in seeking to understand
the role played by technology transfer via FDI. Since opening its economy to
the outside world in late 1978, China has absorbed an increasing amount of
FDI and is now among the world’s largest hosts of FDI in‡ows. A number
of recent papers use Chinese …rm-level data to evaluate the the own-plant ef-
fect (the coe¢ cient 1 that measures whether …rms with foreign investment
are more productive than other plants).        All these studies, including Hu
and Je¤erson (2002), Du, Harrison, and Je¤erson (2008), and Lin, Liu, and
Zhang (2008) …nd that joint ventures in China exhibit not only higher pro-
ductivity levels than other enterprises but also higher productivity growth.
Du, Harrison, and Je¤erson (2008) …nd that these e¤ects are largest for state-
owned enterprises that form partnerships with foreign …rms. The impact on
their productivity is 10 times that on privately-owned enterprises. Du, Har-
rison, and Je¤erson (2008) suggest that forming joint venture partnerships
for Chinese state-owned enterprises has provided an alternative approach to
privatization as a way of increasing public sector performance. Bartel and
Harrison (2004) also …nd that public sector enterprises in Indonesia improved
performance after forming joint ventures with foreign enterprises.
    Although there is a strong relationship between foreign ownership and
productivity levels, that e¤ect often cannot be separately identi…ed from
a …rm …xed e¤ect. So if the equation above is estimated either in …rst-
di¤erences or with …rm speci…c e¤ects, then the coe¢ cient on DF I_P lant
may not be signi…cant. What this implies is that …rms with foreign equity
participation are at a higher level of technology, but technological change is
not always higher for these enterprises. This should not be surprising, since
many of these …rms are already at the technology frontier.
    Evidence suggests that encouraging less productive state enterprises to
make alliances with foreign …rms may raise productivity. However, most
research has not used any sort of identi…cation strategy to tease out the di-
rection of causality. One possibility is that foreign …rms acquire the most
productive domestic enterprises, or form alliances with the most productive
…rms. Arnold and Javorcik (2006) attack this problem by asking whether for-
eign …rms are simply acquiring the most productive domestic enterprises (in
Indonesia) or whether they cause these enterprises to become more produc-
tive. Combining di¤erences-in-di¤erences estimation with nonlinear match-

                                     66
ing techniques, they show that the acquired …rms outperformed the control
group in every observable dimension, including exhibiting higher productiv-
ity growth, higher investment, and higher sales growth. They conclude that
foreign equity infusions do confer bene…ts to domestic enterprises, and that
the e¤ect is not simply one of picking winners. However, more studies in this
regard would be useful.
    The coe¢ cient 2 on DF I_Sector measures the extent to which foreign
ownership in the sector positively a¤ects the productivity of domestic enter-
prises. This e¤ect is sometimes referred to as a horizontal spillover, since it
measures the extent to which foreign investment in the same sector a¤ects
the productivity of domestic …rms. Early studies, such as Blomstrom and
Wol¤ (1994) for Mexico, typically estimated a pure cross-section or failed to
include …rm or industry-speci…c e¤ects. Consequently, the coe¢ cient 2 was
always positive and frequently signi…cant, indicating the presence of positive
horizontal spillovers. Aitken and Harrison (1999) showed that this positive
coe¢ cient for Venezuelan manufacturing enterprises was spurious, indicating
that foreign …rms were attracted to highly productive sectors. When they
include …rm or sector e¤ects, the coe¢ cient on DF I_Sector switched from
positive to negative. Aitken and Harrison interpreted the negative coe¢ -
cient as indicative of market-stealing: foreign …rms grab market share from
domestic …rms, driving them up their cost curves in sectors with economies
of scale.
    Other recent studies measuring the extent of horizontal spillovers are
listed in Table 7. In contrast to earlier studies which generally found sup-
port for positive (horizontal) spillovers, more recent studies that have at-
tempted to reproduce Aitken and Harrison (1999) for other countries have
typically found insigni…cant or negative horizontal externalities. This in-
cludes Djankov and Hoekman (2000) for the Czech Republic, Smarzynska
(2002) for Lithuania, Lopez-Cordova (2003) for Mexico, Damijan et al (2001)
for eight transition economies, Kathuria (2000) for India, Hu and Je¤erson
(2002) and others. Most studies published since 1999 has found negative or
insigni…cant horizontal externalities.31
    One explanation for the lack of positive horizontal spillovers is that for-
eign …rms have no incentives to transfer knowledge or technology to competi-
  31
     One interesting exeption in Poole (2008), who uses a matched establishment-worker
database from Brazil to present evidence consistent with the existence of positive multi-
national spillovers through worker mobility in Brazil.



                                           67
tors within the same industry. They should, however, have an incentive to
help the productivity of their suppliers, by transferring knowledge to them
(see Kugler (2001)). More recent work has sought to identify what is now re-
ferred to as vertical spillovers, which are positive externalities stemming from
the relationships of foreign enterprises with domestic suppliers or customers.
Forward spillovers could occur if foreign …rms that locate domestically sup-
ply inputs that embody new technologies or processes. Backward spillovers
could occur if domestic suppliers to downstream foreign …rms bene…t from
contacts with the …rms to increase productivity. Smarzynska (2004) de…nes
horizontal, forward, and backward FDI spillovers as follows:
                                   P

where jm is the share of inputs purchased by industry j from industry m in
total inputs sourced by sector j. Finally, if jkt is the proportion of sector
j’s output that is supplied to sector k (taken from the input-output matrix),
then backward FDI spillovers are de…ned as:
                                    X
               BackwardF DIjt =           jk HorizontalF DIkt

   Smarzynska …nds a zero or negative impact from forward linkages, and
a positive impact of backward linkages, indicating that technological gains
from FDI are primarily concentrated among domestic suppliers interacting
with downstream foreign …rms. Recent studies on other countries (Table
7) also …nd these positive backward FDI spillovers, including Blalock and
Gertler (2003) for Indonesia, Liu for China (2005), Gorodnichenko, Svejnar,
and Terrell (2006) for 15 transition economies, and Lopez-Cordova (2003) for
Mexico. The evidence in favor of backward spillovers may be one factor that
could explain China’s emphasis on the use of domestic content requirements.
Sutton (2004) describes the use of domestic content requirements in both
India and China as follows:


                                           68
           "From the early ’90s onwards, a wave of multinational …rms
       entered both markets. In both countries, these entrants were
       required to achieve a high level of domestic content within a spec-
       i…ed period (typically, 70 percent within 3 years). For at least
       some of the new entrants, this was seen as an unreasonable tar-
       get, as domestic suppliers could not meet the price and quality
       requirements of the car makers. Achieving the 70 percent tar-
       get required the car makers to switch rapidly from a reliance on
       imported components to sourcing from local vendors; and this in
       turn gave the car makers a strong incentive to work closely with
       (…rst-tier) suppliers, to ensure that quality standards were met,
       within an acceptable price."


    These requirements illustrate how IP has been actively used to shape
China and India’s auto sector through the use of domestic content require-
ments. Even if there are backward spillovers, however, these spillovers could
be captured by subsidizing domestic input purchases by foreign …rms instead
of imposing them through domestic content requirements. Domestic content
requirements could deter some investments that would have created back-
ward spillovers, and may lead to ine¢ cient outcomes by protecting domestic
suppliers from import competition.
    A related approach is to think of the bene…ts of FDI through their im-
pact on the variety of non-tradable inputs available in the host country.
Rodríguez-Clare (1996) presents a model to explore this idea. Under full em-
ployment, multinationals expand at the expense of domestic …rms, so what
matters is the demand for domestic inputs per unit of labor hired, a term that
Rodríguez-Clare labels the linkage coe¢ cient.32 If multinationals’linkage co-
e¢ cient is higher than that of domestic …rms, the multinationals’backward
linkage e¤ect is positive and FDI would lead to an increase in input variety
and host-country productivity.33
    Using …rm-level data for several Latin American countries, Alfaro and
Rodríguez-Clare (2004) show that although multinationals source a lower
share of their inputs domestically than domestic …rms, they nevertheless tend
  32
     This is in contrast to most of the literature on multinationals and linkages, which
focused instead on the share of inputs that multinationals source domestically.
  33
     The positive productivity e¤ect relies on the presence of love of variety for inputs, as
in Ethier (1982) and Romer (1990).


                                             69
to have a higher linkage coe¢ cient thanks to the fact that they use more
roundabout production methods, requiring more inputs per unit of labor.
Still, to date there is only anecdotal evidence that multinationals indeed lead
to an increase in the variety of inputs available in the host country. Moreover,
one concern is that if multinationals generate positive backward linkages then
this should bene…t domestic …rms that use similar inputs as multinationals.
One would then expect to see positive horizontal externalities, but this is
generally not what the literature …nds (at least in LDCs).
    To summarize, the evidence seems to consistently indicate that:

  1. Firms that receive FDI (joint ventures) or are acquired by multination-
     als generally exhibit higher productivity levels.

  2. There is evidence of positive vertical spillovers from foreign buyers to
     domestic suppliers (backward linkages) and from foreign suppliers to
     domestic buyers (forward linkages).

  3. There are generally insigni…cant horizontal spillovers to …rms within
     the same industry.

    Anecdotal evidence and new research (Chandra and Kolavalli (2006), Al-
faro and Charlton (2008)) suggests that FDI has been particularly important
in cases where governments were actively engaged in strategies of technologi-
cal upgrading in certain sectors, and brought in foreign companies as part of
those strategies. Typically, these e¤orts were part of a set of complementary
policies that included increasing the supply of skilled workes in a targetted
industry, improving regulation and infrastructure, promoting new activities
and innovation, and increasing exports. In many of those cases, the govern-
ment probably encouraged joint ventures, but the direction of causality is
not so clear.
    Given these results, do the bene…ts of …scal incentives for foreign enter-
prises outweigh the costs? If the primary reason for giving these incentives
is to encourage technology transfer, then the answer is likely to be no: if
foreign …rms are the only ones that use the inputs that bene…t from back-
ward spillovers and there are no horizontal spillovers, then FDI will occur
without subsidies. Yet there is clearly a further need to understand the
mechanism through which foreign …rms generate vertical spillovers. Even if
vertical spillovers do exist, Pack and Saggi (2006) argue that "the magnitude
of some of the incentives being used seems di¢ cult to justify”. (p. 281).

                                      70
They also point out that “investment incentives and tax breaks to multi-
national investors work against their local competitors. Thus, if there are
local …rms that could potentially compete with multinationals, the adverse
e¤ect on such …rms of tax incentives to multinationals needs to be taken into
account. The e¢ cacy of investment incentives is also unclear— such policies
could easily end up transferring rents to foreign investors without a¤ecting
their investment decisions.”(Pack and Saggi (2006), p. 281)

5.2    FDI and host country factor markets
One robust result in the literature on foreign ownership and productivity
is that …rms with foreign equity have higher productivity levels. Foreign
…rms are also typically more capital intensive, and spend more on worker
training. As long as …rms do not face a perfectly ‡at labor supply schedule,
it is likely that these di¤erent …rm characteristics will translate into higher
wages. There could also be other imperfections in the labor market, such as
search costs for …rms seeking skilled workers, or e¢ ciency wage setting, that
could result in foreign …rms paying higher wages. To the extent that there is
worker mobility or productivity spillovers, these wage e¤ects for workers at
foreign enterprises could also spill over to other workers.
    Almost all studies …nd that workers in foreign …rms are paid higher wages,
which may re‡ect the fact that foreign …rms or joint ventures have higher
productivity levels. In perfect markets more productive …rms would not pay
higher wages, but market imperfections (such as search costs or informational
asymmetries) could generate such a link. Evidence showing higher wages paid
by multinationals includes Aitken, Harrison and Lipsey (1996) for Mexico
and Venezuela, Lipsey and Sjoholm (2004) for Indonesia using a pure cross-
section, Harrison and Scorse (2004) for Indonesia using a panel, Velde and
Morrisey (2003) for a set of African economies, Martins and Esteves (2007) for
Brazil, and Earle and Telegdy (2007) for Hungary. Studies of industrialized
countries also …nd large wage gaps between domestic and foreign enterprise
wages when researchers do not condition for worker or …rm characteristics.
This includes Almeida (2003) for Portugal, Girma, Greenaway and Wakelin
(2001) and Dri¢ eld and Girma (2003) for the United Kingdom, and Feliciano
and Lipsey (1999) for the United States. The unconditional wage gap, which
is the gap in wages paid by foreign versus domestically owned enterprises
without controlling for worker or …rm characteristics, is typically large. It is
frequently as high as 40 percent (for Hungary) or 50 percent (for Brazil).

                                      71
    When researchers control for worker and …rm characteristics, then the
wage premium paid by foreign …rms declines dramatically, to around 10 per-
cent. Earle and Telegdy (2007) …nd that the wage gap between workers
employed at foreign and domestic enterprises is not much a¤ected by condi-
tioning on worker characteristics, but that controlling for industry reduces
the premia to 34 percent, and controlling for …rm size further reduces it to 28
percent. (Robert Lipsey has questioned whether it makes sense to control for
characteristics such as …rm size: if foreign …rms are larger and consequently
pay higher wages than domestically owned enterprises, workers are neverthe-
less better o¤.) When Earle and Telegdy control for unobserved …xed e¤ects
by exploiting changes in …rm ownership to identify its e¤ect on wages, the
premium is further reduced to 7 percent. Harrison and Scorse (2004) also
…nd that the premium falls to between 5 and 10 percent when worker and
…rm characteristics are controlled for. Ibarraran, using data for Mexican
macquilas in 1992 and 1999, …nds no premium in 1992 but a small premium
in 1999.
    Martins and Esteves (2007) use matched worker and …rm panel data for
1995 through 1999 to analyze the impact of foreign ownership on wags in
Brazil. Like Earle and Telegdy (2007) they use changes in …rm ownership as
a way to control for unobserved …rm-speci…c e¤ects that could be correlated
with wage premia. They also follow workers who move to or leave foreign
enterprises, to control for unobserved worker-speci…c e¤ects. They …nd that
workers moving from foreign to domestic …rms typically take wage cuts when
they move, while movers form domestic to foreign …rms increase their pay.
However, compared to the unconditional wage gaps of 50 percent, the wage
premium associated with working for a foreign …rm falls to between 3 and 7
percent once worker and …rm characteristics are controlled for. The authors
conclude that their results support a positive impact of foreign …rms on
Brazilian wages.
    To summarize, the evidence suggests that foreign …rms pay a small wage
premium of between 5 and 10 percent. While the earlier literature found
larger wage premia of more like twenty percent, these earlier estimates failed
to adequately control for individual characteristics of workers, such as edu-
cation and experience. Consequently, part of the wage gap stems from the
fact that foreign …rms tend to hire better educated and more skilled work-
ers. Nevertheless, we can safely conclude that foreign enterprises do not pay
workers below what their domestic counterparts would pay. In fact, most
of the evidence suggests that foreign …rms tend to pay higher wages than

                                      72
comparable domestic …rms. There is also evidence that foreign …rms are
more susceptible to pressure from labor groups, leading them to be exhibit
greater compliance with minimum wages and labor standards. Harrison and
Scorse (2008) …nd that foreign …rms in Indonesia were much more likely
than domestic enterprises to raise wages and adhere to minimum wages as a
consequence of the anti-sweatshop campaigns there. They also …nd that the
employment costs of the anti-sweatshop campaigns were minimal, as garment
and footwear subcontractors were able to reduce pro…ts to pay the additional
wage costs without reducing the number of workers.
    While most of the emphasis on the role of FDI in local factor markets
is on the relationship between FDI and host country wages, there is also an
emerging literature on FDI’s e¤ect on local capital markets. One reason
policy makers give for promoting foreign investment in developing countries
is the scarcity of capital for new investment. This argument is based on the
assumption that incoming foreign investors provide additional capital when
they set up new enterprises in local markets. However, as exchange rate
volatility has continued to rise many foreign investors have found ways to
hedge by borrowing on local capital markets. This increase in local …nancing
for incoming foreign investors may lead to crowding out of domestic …rms.
    Harrison and McMillan (2003) and Love, Harrison, and McMillan (2004)
test whether or not borrowing by local multinationals is crowding out do-
mestic enterprises. The framework in both papers uses an Euler equation
approach combined with Generalized Method of Moment estimation. While
Harrison and McMillan (2003) is a country case study which analyzes the
behavior of mostly French multinationals operating in Cote d’Ivoire, Love,
Harrison and McMillan (2004) use company level data across a panel of
countries. The results suggest that in a country such as the Cote d’Ivoire,
which was riddled with market imperfections and where access to credit was
rationed due to interest rate ceilings, foreign investors did indeed crowd do-
mestic enterprises out of local credit markets. However, Love, Harrison, and
McMillan (2004) found that foreign investors tended to “crowd in” domes-
tic enterprises— i.e., as foreign investment increased, the amount of credit
available to domestically-owned …rms actually rose. The contrasting results
again point to the important role of policy complementarities: in a country
with credit market imperfections such as the Cote d’Ivoire, FDI exacerbated
these problems. These studies using micro-data are consistent with macro-
level evidence on the importance of complementarities with …nancial market
development for ensuring productivity gains from FDI (Alfaro et al, 2004).

6    Concluding Remarks
Given the varied experiences across countries and time periods, the di¤er-
ent interpretations possible, and the di¢ culties in conducting clean empirical
analyses, it is not easy to synthesize the literature on industrial, trade, and
FDI policy in development. Our survey of the theory and the evidence nev-
ertheless suggests some tentative conclusions.
    There are instances where infant-industry protection led to higher growth
–particularly in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries— but our
review suggests that the conditions needed for infant-industry protection to
produce higher growth in developing countries are not often satis…ed. The
framework in Section 2 shows that the theoretical justi…cation for interven-
tion requires at a minimum either industry-level rents or a latent comparative
advantage, as well as large Marshallian externalities from production. These
necessary conditions are not easy to identify for policy makers ex ante. Nor is
there evidence suggesting that developing countries have generally protected
sectors with latent comparative advantage and Marshallian externalities. The
types of sectors where there are important Marshallian externalities may not
be those where developing countries have a latent comparative advantage
(i.e., sectors that are intensive in knowledge and human capital). It is also
likely that protection has been used as a tool to protect sunset industries in-
stead of sunrise industries; hence, there is an inherent bias against promoting
sectors with a latent comparative advantage.
    For infant-industry protection to improve welfare it must pass both the
Mill and Bastable tests. The Mill test requires that the protected sector can
eventually survive international competition without protection, whereas the
Bastable test requires that the discounted future bene…ts compensate the
present costs of protection. This means that the dynamic forces which in-
crease industry productivity must operate quickly. In practice, most research
assessing the success of IP has ignored these tests. Even if studies could show
that protected sectors grew faster, this would not be su¢ cient evidence to
claim that IP is justi…ed from a welfare standpoint. There are other prob-
lems as well. In all the models presented in this review, protection is never
the …rst-best policy. In addition, the infant-industry framework typically
assumes that the mere expansion of a sector will generate all sorts of posi-
tive e¤ects that will increase industry-wide productivity. But this may not
happen, and the economy may simply end up with a larger version of the
ine¢ cient sector it began with. We discussed an alternative set of policies

                                      74
aimed directly at eliciting the investments that will increase productivity.
Such investments may not occur without public intervention because of co-
ordination failures.
    The hundreds of studies on trade policies, trade shares, productivity, and
growth show a strong correlation between increasing trade shares and country
performance, and no signi…cant correlation between tari¤s on …nal goods and
country outcomes. The only exception is for intermediate or capital goods,
where a higher tari¤ is associated with lower growth. Putting aside the
serious problems of reverse causality identi…ed in our review, we interpret
this evidence as suggesting that trade and FDI policies have generated the
greatest welfare gains when they are associated with increasing exposure to
trade. One implication is that interventions that increase exposure to trade
(such as export promotion) are likely to lead to higher welfare gainsthan other
types of interventions (such as tari¤s or domestic content requirements).
    New evidence suggests that IP through FDI promotion may lead to higher
welfare gains than intervention in trade, in part because FDI-promotion poli-
cies focus on new activities rather than on protecting (possibly unsuccess-
ful) incumbents. Still, as Chandra and Kolavalli (2006) have concluded in
their overview of 10 cases of successful technology upgrading, “without host-
country policies to develop local capabilities, MNC-led exports are likely
to remain technologically stagnant, leaving developing countries unable to
progress beyond the assembly of imported components” (p. 19). Chandra
and Kolavalli go on to state that “the role of government was most e¤ective
when its support for speci…c industries was embedded in institutions and
policies that were internally consistent, had an explicit purpose, and were
blessed with political commitment” (p. 39). Rodrik refers to this charac-
teristic as “embeddedness.” Chandra and Kolavalli conclude that “in every
case, getting it right depended upon the degree of synchronization between
institutions and government policies to motivate learning among exporters.
The hallmark of these policies was industry speci…city, which o¤ers some
useful lessons for other developing countries”(p. 41).34

    Harrison and Rodríguez-Clare (2009) expands on the current paper and discusses some
of the policy implications of these …ndings.

where A = j=3 zj wj . If v1 = v2 then the solution of the system entails
 1 =   2 . Also, if  1 =    2 then necessarily v1 = v2 . Now we show that
when v1 > v2 the solution of the system is such that 1 < 2 : We consider
          0
( 1    2 )v1 at the point v1 = v2 and    1 =   2 . At the point v1 = v2 and
 1 =  2  we  have
                                              ! =(1+ ) 1

               1+      m=3 m       1        1             1

This establishes that a small increase in v1 implies that 1 < 2 . Now
suppose there exist v1 > v2 such that 1 > 2 . Due to continuity there

                                                      76
would exist v1 > v2 such that 1 = 2 . But this contradicts v1 = v2 ()
  1      2 = 0. Thus, the solution of the system above implies that if v1 > v2 ,
then 1 < 2 : Thus, we have that 1 < 2 in equilibrium, and this implies
w1 > w2 .
    Now consider two countries such that country 1 has HP in the …rst indus-
try and country 2 has HP in the second industry. We assume that v1 = v2 = v
and (as above) that x^j1 = x^j2 = zj for any j = 3; ::; N . We will show
that x1 > x2 implies w1 > w2 . From 12 we see that w1 > w2 is equiv-
alent to x1 1 2 > x2 1 1 . Obviously, x1 = x2 ()                       1 =   2.
We can write 1 = f (x1 ; x2 ) and 2 = g(x1 ; x2 ). Moreover, f (x1 ; x2 ) =
g(x2 ; x1 ):This implies that x1 1 2         x2 1 1 = x1 1 g(x1 ; x2 )
 x2 1 f (x1 ; x2 ) = 0 if and only if x1 = x2 : We have that x1 1 2
 x2 1 1 is equal to

Notes: Source is Aisbett, Harrison, and Zwane (2005), as reported in Harrison (2007). Huber robust standard errors in parenthesis. Data are annual data, with one
observation for each country and year. The dependent variable is the log of income per capita, in PPP $1993. Trade share is the share of exports plus imports in
GDP. Import tariffs are import revenues divided by the value of imports. Both are taken from the World Bank’s indicators. OLS indicates ordinary least squares and
IV indicates instrumental variables. All regressions exclude OECD high‐income countries. Columns (3) and (7) include controls for inflation, government
expenditure in GDP, currency crises, investment in GDP, and the fraction of the population that is literate. Columns (4) and (8) include controls for inflation,
government expenditure, and currency crises. In instrumental variable regressions, trade share is instrumented using 3‐year lagged value, and import tariff is
instrumented using 3‐year lagged value.

Notes: Number of industries corresponds to the 3‐digit ISIC Rev. 3. FDI corresponds to Foreign Direct Investment Flows from OECD International Direct Investment
Database. Dependence on external finance is the difference between investment and cash generated from operations in the US following Rajan and Zingales (1998).
Skill data are the ratio of high‐skilled workers to other workers in German Industries. Skilled workers include: White‐collar high‐skill (WCHS): Legislators, senior officials
and managers (Group 1), Professionals (Group 2), Technicians and associate professionals (Group 3). White‐collar low‐skill (WCLS): Clerks, service workers (Group 4),
shop and sales workers (Group 5). Blue‐collar high‐skill (BCHS): Skilled agricultural and fishery workers (Group 6), Craft and related trade workers (Group 7). Blue‐collar
low‐skill (BCLS): Plant and machine operators and assemblers (Group 8), Elementary occupations (Group 9). See Appendix for detailed explanation of all variables and
