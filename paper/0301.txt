                Should We Organize? Effects of Faculty Unionism

                         on Academic Compensation



                                  ABSTRACT


      This   paper uses the American Association of University Professors

surveys for the period 1965 to 1976 to examine the effect of faculty unionism

on faculty pay. It compares estimated effects of unionism on compensation

from cross—section regressions of faculty pay on union organization and

from a longitudinal model designed to correct cross—section   estimates

for "unobserved characteristics" of schools that are correlated with unionism.

The major findings are that: 1. unionism raises faculty pay but that the

extent of the effect varies greatly by estimating model and time period

covered; 2.     the years a school has been organized has a stronger effect on

pay than the standard 0—1 union duny variable; 3. unionism raises the

fringe benefit share of compensation; 4. the estimated coefficient on

faculty unionism in cross—section
                                    regressions overstates the union impact
because unionized schools tend to have been higher paying even before

organization.

       In 1964 virtually no
                               college or university faculty in the United States
 was represented by a trade union. In 1977 over 300 institutions
                                                                   were organized,
 corstituting over 10 percent of Institutions
                                              of higher education.1 Faculty unions
 were among the most rapidly growing in the economy, scoring
                                                              considerably better
 than the average in winning representation.2
                                                How have faculty unions
 affected the economic position of
                                       academics? Which components of the compen-
 sation structure have been
                                most influenced by unionism? Have the economic

 effects of unionism changed over time as the academic market place has

 deteriorated?

      This paper examines these and related
                                                questions regarding the effects of
 faculty unionism on compensation with detailed longitudinal data files from
 the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). In contrast to
                                                                           pre-
 vious work on the economic effects of faculty unionism, which have been
 limited to small   samples   and obtained inconclusive often contradictory results

 (Birnbauni, Morgan—Kearney, Brown—Stone)3, this study expoits the full set of

 AAUP compensation data to estimate union
                                              effects on longitudinal as well as
 cross—section data. The paper finds a substantial union effect which, however,

 differs over time and
                         among institutions, and whose magnitude varies with the
model used in the estimation procedure. In
                                                cross—section calculations, faculty
unionism has a significant effect on compensation which differs among institu-

tions, rank of faculty, and over time; and which is more pronounced on fringe

 benefits than on straight—time
                                   pay. In a longitudinal model, which takes
 account of the possible selectivity bias in Institutions that

organize and of the effect of school characteristics
                                                         on the growth of
compensation, estimates of the magnitude of the union compensation effect vary

from small to fairly sizeabic, dcpcning on the before union compensation

used to control for the omitted factor.     In both the cross—section and longi-

tudinal analyses, institutions that have been organized for longer periods of
                                                                   2


time appear to have been more affected by unions than those organized more recently.

      Section one of the paper sketches briefly the institutional background

of faculty unionism. Section two describes the data set under study and the

econometric methodology used to estimate union effec-. Section three examines

the characteristics of schools that become organized. Section four presents

estimates of the effect of academic unions on compensation and fringes. The

paper concludes with a brief summary of the empirical results.



I. Faculty Unionism in the U.S.

      Beginning in the late 1960's academic faculty in the U.S. moved from

essentially complete nonunion status to moderate levels of organization.

In 1966, just 5,200 faculty were represented by unions; in 1970, 47,300 were

represented by unions; in 1977 133,000 faculty were on organized campuses

(Burton, table 7, p. 34).

      The burst of organization was aided by several institutional developments:

the passage of state laws making organization of public workers, including

faculty at public colleges and universities, easier than in the past; changed

attitudes toward unionization by faculty; the extension of NLRB election proce-

dures to the university sector in 1969; and the general growth of unions of

public employees.

      With respect to the first development, in the 1960's and 1970's a large

number of states enacted laws which either directly or indirectly made organi-

zation of faculties in the public sector easier. Some states enacted laws

relating to the right of public employees in postsecondary educational

institutions to form unions and bargain collectively. Others passed

omnibus public employee bills which include employees of state colleges and

universities. Still others have de facto recognized the right of faculties to

organize and have considered legislation to legalize the de facto situation,

while yet others have treated the possibility of organization less favorably.
                                                                           3


  The Education Commission of the States has categorized collective negotiations

  legislation along several dimensions, according to whether states have

  specific laws relating to postsecondary education and according to the

  nature of public employee legislation. From the Commission's classifications,

  five types of states can be distinguished:4


         Group 1 —   States which have specific legislation which deals with
                     public employees in postsecondary educational institutions.
        Group 2 —     States in which there is no specific
                                                           mention of post—
                     secondary education in an omnibus public employee bill
                     but where by implication or interpretation postsecondary
                     personnel and flstitutjons are included.
        Group 3 —    States which have no collective negotiations legislation
                     for postsecondary education but in which there are de facto
                     postsecondary contracts or employee unit recognition and
                     in which some legislative activity in respect to legalization
                     of the de facto situation has taken place since 1970.

        Group 4 —    States in which there has been no notable legislation
                     pending on the subject of collective bargaining for public
                     employees in Postsecondary education or where there was
                     legislative activity since 1970 of an omnibus legislation
                     level in which pOstsecondary personnel would have been
                     included but where no legislation has been
                                                                passed.
        Group 5 —    States which by statute prohibit
                                                      any form of collective
                     negotiations by public employees.
        While
           not without problems, the Commission classification provides a
rough grouping of the favorableness of state laws toward organization. Those
with explicit collective bargaining laws have an institutional
                                                               framework for
recognition and negotiations, which should encourage unionization, while those
without laws make recognition and bargaining an uncertain and
                                                                     riskier process.
The states which outlaw public employee negotiations can be expected
                                                                     to have
the least favorable environment for unionization.
        With respect to attitudes, several surveys of the views of faculty       in
the   late l960's and early l970's reveal surprising support toward unions
                                                                                 on
campus. In the 1969 American Council on Education
                                                         survey   of faculty, 59 percent
                                                                    4




 thought that there was a place on campus for faculty collective bargaining

and 47 percent agreed that "faculty strikes can be legitimate action." In a

1972 survey, 43 percent of faculty agreed that "the recend growth of union-

ization of college and university faculty is beneficial and should be extended,"

 [Ladd & Lipset, pp. 252—253]. While we lack survey evidence on attitudes in

earlier years and have not investigated the potential causes of attitudinal

changes, it is highly unlikely that faculty were as favorably inc]Jned to orga-

nization in previous decades.

      The extension of NLRB elections to private colleges and universities in

1969 eased the task of organizing those institutions. From 1969 to 1977,

colleges and universities held 127 representation elections of which 61 percent

were won by the union.

      Finally, and more speculatively, the growth of public sector organization

in general may also be a potential cause of the growth of faculty unionism in

the public sector. On the one hand, as increasing numbers of public employees

become organized, the acceptability of organization rises. On the other, facul-

ties may feel the need for a union to bargain for their interests against those

of other public employees



Bargainers and Bargaining

      There are three main faculty unions: the American Federation of Teachers

(AFT), which had 101 organized schools in 1977; the National Education        -



Association   (NEA) with 132 schools; and the American Association of University

Professors (AAUP), which like other professional organizations threatened with

unionization, responded by conducting representation elections and signing

collective agreements; in 1977, the AAUP represented faculty in 41 schools and

shared representation with the NEA on 4 (National Center of Education Statistics,

table 4.166, p. 196). The NEA and AFT tend to be concentrated among two year

co1legs while the AAUP is found largely in four year institutions.
                                                                      5



     On the employer side, most organized faculties are public iflStItutjons.

 In the sample covered in this
                                 paper, for example, 34.4 percent of public

 institutions were organized in 1976—77 compared to 16.7 percent of all
                 6
 institutions.

    Faculty unions that negotiate with public institutions face the problem,

endemic to the public sector, that budget decisions are made by legislators

 rather than by the administrators whom they face across the bargaining table.

Because final funding authority rests with legislatures, academic
                                                                  managers may be
willing to agree on certain increases, with the
                                                   knowledge that if budgets are
 not raised, the contracts will not be
                                         effective. In Massachusetts, Worcester
 State College and Massachusetts
                                   College of Art negotiated contracts with the
AFT in sunmer 1975 which provided for
                                         wage increases but because of legislative
and executive decisions, no action was taken and the increase was not
                                                                      granted.
The ability of unions to extract gains may depend on their influence
                                                                     on the
legislature, rather than on negotiations with academic administrators.

      Collective bargaining in academia has similarities and differences with

bargaining in other sectors. In terms of
                                             topics, faculty unions evince considerable
concern for job security and tenure provisions, much like other unions.

Faculty unions have also sought additional
                                             fringe benefits, with the result
that many two year and newer Institutions have obtained fringes
                                                                formerly exclusive
to older, senior institutes [Duryea,
                                     Fisk, and Associates, p. 96}. Most
faculty contracts contain grievance clauses
                                               [ibid., pp. 66—86], of a fairly
standard type. In several negotiations
                                          unions have expressed concern for pay
inequities, seeking greater standardization of rates —— a
                                                            common union goal.
The 1973 AAUP — Adei.phj.
                          University contract established an "Inequity Fund"
designed to reduce differentials
                                   among faculty..7 On the other hand, unlike
nearly all American unions, which eschew a union role in operating establishments,
                                                                     6


 academic unions are typically greatly concerned with governance, seeking to

 enhance the role of faculty in academic decision—making. In addition, faculty

 unions have rarely invoked the prime weapon of conflict of labor, the, strike,

 with a result that bargaining often stretches over long periods of time.

       Whether the institutional and market structure in academe is likely to

 create the possibility of large or small union—induced increases in earnings

 is not clear. Public sector bargaining problems, and lack of a significant

 strike threat, may make faculty unions relatively weak.




 II. Data and Methodology

       This study examines the effect of faculty unions on academic pay using

 data on average compensation by institution from the annual
                                                               compensation surveys
 of the AAUP. The AAUP data are obtained from an annual questionnaire distributed

 to academic Institutions every year:
                                         the questionnaire requests detailed infor-
mation on pay by rank for each school. The sample covered has increased over

time: in 1964—65 the AAUP survey contained 755 schools; in 1977—78, the
                                                                         survey
included 2652 IflStitutjons. The AAUP data files used for the annual
                                                                     reports on
the Economic Status of the Profession from 1970 to 1976
                                                        provide the basic compensation
figures for this study. Relatively few faculties were organized in 1970 compared

to 1976, giving valuable before/after unionization
                                                      comparisons. In addition, a
special file was created from the questionnaires of
                                                      1965 to provide figures for
the period prior to the advent of any substantial unionization. The files for
1970—76 and 1965 were grouped into a single time series of cross—sections, with

longitudinal information on a large number of institutions in different years.

The size of the sample varies over time due to differences in responses. While

the data set does not cover the entire universe of academic institutions, it

offers a large and reasonably                                                         8
                                representative sample of colleges and universities.
     The data tapes contain three measures of compensation which will be used

in the empirical work:
                         salaries; total compensation defined as salaries plus
                                                                               7


 fringe benefits; arid fringe benefits. When fringes are the dependent variable,

 total compensation is included as
                                              an explanatory variable in order to isolate
 the impact of unionism on the composition of the compensation package. In

 addition, they contain information on the degree granting status of schools:

 whether they grant Ph.D.'s, masters, bachelors, or two year degrees.

        Information on whether or not a campus is covered by collective bargaining

 was obtained from the Directory of
                                               Bargaining Agents and Contracts in Higher
 Education (1 April 1977) of the National Center for the Study of Collective

 Bargaining in Higher Education which provides a hicomplete?1 count of trade union

 organization of academic enterprises. The'
                                                      year an institution was first listed
 as unionized was added to the tape
                                              as the appropriate indicator of unionization.
         Additional data on the characteristics of
                                                            schools was obtained from a

 computer tape originally put together by G. Jackson of Stanford University.

 This tape includes information
                                           on SAT scores, family income of
 students, enrollments, and related factors which might affect compensation

 oetting.

         The sources of the data arc described in
                                                           detail in the notes to Table 1.




Estimating the Union Effect

         There are two basic
                                   ways in which the AAUP data set can be used to
estimate the impact of trade unionism on faculty compensation: through

 cross—section regressions of compensation on unionization;

nature    of the     data to eliminate "unobserved" school factors.

        Least square regressions will yield unbiased estimates of the union

  coefficient a when E(E.t UNt) = 0.                    When the residual is correlated with

  unionization, however, say because organization is more likely in high wage

  institutions, least squares will yield biased estimates. The availability

  of longitudinal data provides a means of correcting for the bias, essentially

  by permitting "before/after" comparisons of union compensation effects.

  Formally, we model the potential correlation between
                                                                      UNit and c.     'y   dividing
      into two components: an omitted institution factor h. which is correlated

  with UNit (and the controls Z) and a component independent of the variables

  in the equation,                This yields the following model:

afterwards, the comparable equation for the pre—union period is:


      (3)

 Least squares       estimates of equation (7) do not yield consistent estimates of
  the   union effect   because E(W v )           0. One can obtain consistent estimates

 by instrumenting W.0 on other variables, such as wages in another period. Alter-

 natively, the extent of the bias on the union coefficient can be estimated

 using omitted variable bias formulae.

        The principal independent variable in the anaisi3, tl'c union status
  of schools, is measured in this
                                  paper in two different ways: with an 0—1
 dichotomous variable for whether a school is or is not organized in a
                                                                       given
 year; and with a more complex indicator of union
                                                              strength, the years a school
  is organized. While years organized is unlikely to be an
                                                           appropriate measure
 of union strength in industries
                                          that have long been unionized, the newness
 of faculty unionism makes it         a   potentially valuable measure of organizational

 strength. Years organized may be expected to have a positive impact on

 compensation for two reasons: because it takes time for faculties to obtain

 signed contracts and translate organization
                                                       into wages and becaus institutions
 where union wage gains are more likely to be sizeable
                                                       may tend to be organized
 earlier than those where unionism
                                            might have smaller economic effects. In
 empirical work, estimates are made of the
                                                    effects on compensation of an 0—1 union
dummy variable, of years organized, and of the two variables together.


III. Who Gets Unionized?

        Before examining the effects of unionism on compensation, it is important

to consider the determinants of unionization and, in particular, the extent to

which organization is or is not related to level of compensation prior to

unionization.
                                                                               10

      Table 1 records estimates of the relation
                                                          between characteristics of
institutions and union status in the AATJP sample as of 1976—77. Columns 1 to

3 give the        coefficients from a logistic curve that estimates the impact of

the characteristics of institutions,
                                                including compensation in 1970 (column 1)
or 1965 (column 2) on organization:


      (8)            Pr(U) =   1/(1 + exp   —


where Pr(U) =      probability   of unionization in 1976
      X =    explanatory   factors

       Columns 4 to 6 give regression
                                                coefficients linking the number of years

 variables  are used to explain the probability that a school is organized and
 the years organized: (1) measures of the characteristics of the school and its
 student   body; log enrollment, to measure the impact of size; log of dollars

per full—time enrollee, to measure wealth of the institution; the log of SAT

 scores of students, to measure the quality of the student body; three variables
 representing the position of the families of students in the income distribution,
 the percentage with incomes less than $5,999, with incomes from $6,000 to $8,900

 and with incomes from 9,00O to $11,999; and a series of dummy variables reflecting

whether the school is public (vs. private); whether it is a Ph.D.,

masters, or 2 year granting institution (vs.
                                                       a four year college); whether it is
a primarily black school, a co—ed or female school or a religious
                                                                  school;
(2) measures of the region in which the school is located, to
                                                              capture the
different attitudes toward unionism
                                             in different parts of the country; (3)
measures of state legislation
                                     regarding organization represented by dummy
variables for whether the state had
                                            legislation regarding Post—secondary
educational institutions,
                          an omnibus public employee bill, de facto union recognition,
or anti—union legislation (as described in section one);
                                                          (4) measures of
the log compensation prior to the advent of
                                             extensive unionism in two years:
in 1965, when no lflStitutjons
                               in the sample were organized, and in 1970, when

relatively few were organized. The
                                            coefficient on wages in an early period will
                                                                      11
 show whether or not unions have tended to organize high wage institutions,

 which would bias cross—section estimates of the union compensation effect upwards.

 Because some schools were organized in 1970, the equations with 1970 compensation

 as controls are estimated in two samples: the full sample of
                                                                schools, including
 those who were union in 1970, which could yield biased estimates of the

 link from compensation to organization because of the simultaneous effect of

 unionism on wages; and a sample excluding institutions already organized in

 1970, which eliminates this problem. The sample sizes in columns 1 and 2

and in columns 4 and 5 differ because of the fewer matches between the 1965
and 1976 samples than between the 1970 and 1976
                                                samples. The sample sizes
in columns 3 and 6 are smaller than
                                    in columns 2 and 5 due o deletion
of schools organized in 1970.

      The logistic and OLS estimates show that certain types of institutions

are more likely to be organized than others.   Organization is more frequent
for: public than for private schools; for two year institutions relative to

institutions granting higher degrees; for schools with lower SAT scores among

students; and for institutions in the Northeast, especially relative to those

in the South.

      The coefficients on the dummy variables for the types of legislation

indicate that the favorabj.eness of state laws has a substantive impact on

organization, with positive estimated effects for the more favorable laws

and a negative estimated effect for the least favorable. Since the calcu—

lations include regional variables which are correlated with the legislation
dummies, the result is a reasonably powerful
                                              one. While several of the
legislative dummy variables have sizeable standard errors, as a set they

enter the equations significantly.

      Finally, in all of the calculations the base year wage variable is

positively correlated with organization, indicating that unions have tended

to organize faculties that had relatively high initial pay. The coefficient

on the base period wage is considerably larger in columns 2, 3 and 5 and 6

when 1970 compensation is used as the control than in columns 1 and 4 when
                                                                                         12

 The other school characteristics data
                                       were supplied by Gregory Jackson of the
 Stanford University School of Education and defined as follàws:
       Enrollment (measured by full—time equivalent students) and expenditure
 data for the 1970, 1971, and 1972 academic years were compiled from the Higher
 Education General Institutional Survey conducted annually between 1966 and
 1974 by the U.S. Office of Education. Enrollment data for years preceding
 and following this perios are not strictly comparable. The expenditures
 data used are under the category "Educational and
                                                   General Expenditures: Total."
 The post—1970 expenditures were deflated to 1970 dollars with the Consumer
 Price Index. The mean amount of expenditures per full—time equivalent student
 for the 1970 to 1972 period was used in the computations.
       The average academic ability of each relevant college's undergraduates
 was approximated by an estimate of the average combined verbal and math
 Scholastic Aptitude Test of the school's 1971 entering freshmen. These esimates
 (which involved some imputations) are discussed at length in Astin and Henson.

                                                   tape. These data were collected
 from the "Tripartite Application" (i.e., "Institutional Application to Participate
 in Federal Student Financial Aid Programs"), a standard form (#1035) of the U.S.
 Office of Education. On the 1974 application (from which the data were obtained)
 each school was asked to estimate the number of full—time and half—time under-
 graduates from families in the following income
                                                 ranges: $O—5,999, $6,000—8,999,
 $9,000—l1,999, and $12,000 and above. Full—time and half—time students were
 combined for this study by multiplying the latter by .50 to obtain the total number
 of full—time equivalent undergraduate students from families in each of the four
 income classes.

1965 compensation is used as the control. The positive regression coefficients

on in compensation prior to unionization in the equations highlight the

need to control for initial compensation in analyzing the impact of faculty

unions on compensation.

IV.    Regression    Analysis of Union Compensation Effect

      Estimates   of the effect of faculty unionism on in compensation    are

presented   in this   section   using the cross—section and   longitudinal models

described   earlier. The estimates suggest that faculty unionism raises
wages, with schools organized earlier evincing a larger union impact than
those with more     recent unionism.

        Least    squares estimates of the cross—section relation between faculty
unions and in of salaries or in of total compensation from 1970—1971 to
1976—1977 are given in Table 2. Columns 1 and 2 of the table list the total number
of    institutions in each year's sample and the number of organized institutions.

Columns 3 and 4 give the coefficients and standard       errors of the union dummy variable
on in compensation and in salaries,, respectively. Columns 5—8 present com-
parable   information for the effect of unions on the compensation of faculty

by rank. All of the regression calculations include the list of control
variables given at the bottom of the table. The calculations for total

faculty also include the percentage of faculty in various ranks, as specified

in the table note.

        The regression results show a significant union impact, which is larger

on total compensation than on salaries and which is modestly larger for pro-

fessors than for those in lower ranks. The greater impact of unionism on corn—

pensation than on salaries reflects the fact that unionism appears to raise

fringes   especially significantly (a pattern to be explored further in Table 5),
possibly    as   a result of the greater weight given in a union setting to senior

personnel who favor fringes. The larger impact of unionism on professorial

than other salaries may also reflect the role of older faculty in unionized

marLets cormared to competitive riarketc 'ierc wagc 'e rore resonsivc to

younger "marginal" employees.

        The estimated coefficients on unionism differ noticeably over time,
                                                                            drop-

 ping fairly steadily from high levels of .11 (total) to .10 (professors) in
 1970—71 to much lower levels of .05 (total and professors) by 1976—77. Because

 the cross—section samples change over time, there are two possible explanations

 for this    pattern: a true time effect in which the impact of unionism is
 weakened in the declining market of the mid 1970's; or a "cohort effect" in

 which union effects have been smaller on more recently organized campuses.

         One way of differentiating between these two situations is to estimate

 the coefficient of unionism on a fixed set of schools over an extended number

 of periods. If there is a time (or "age") effect in which the union impact de-

 clines over time, the coefficient on unionism in the same set of schools will

 drop from the early years to 1977. If there is no such effect, the estimated

 union impact will rain the same. Table 3 presents the results of such

 calculations. It compares, for a fixed set of schools, the estimated cffcct

of unionism in each year from 1970—71 to 1975—76 with the effect in 1976—77,

when, according to Table 2, the union impact was the smallest. Column 1

records the size of the sample of schools
                                                 reporting in each base year.
Columns 2 and 3 show the number unionized in the base
                                                      year and in 1976—77. The
coefficients   on unionism in      the base year and in 1976—77 are given in columns
4 and   5.   In each   year the   comparison shows a decline in the union impact,
ranging from .04 to .06 points. While this
                                                  comparison controls for changes in
the overall sample, it does not control for the growth of organization
                                                                       over

the period and the changing schools in the union sample. To compare the effect

of unionism on the same schools the unionism variable       was decomposed into two
variables:    a dummy variable for schools organized in the base year and a

separate dummy variable for those that became unionized thereafter. Column 6

gives the coefficient for the dummy variable for the schools organized in the

base year. With the exception of 1970—71 the coefficients in column 6 are

considerably larger than those on the union dummy variable in the preceding column,

 indicating that schools already organized in the base year had larger union

wage effects. In several cases the estimates on the dummy variable for the

newly organized schools is negative, indicating that, for whatever reason,

 there is a definitive differential effect of unionism on schools depending

on when they were organized. While the estimated effect of unionism on the

same schools shows a decline in the impact of organization from each base

year to 1976—77, the drop is much attenuated from that found for all schools.

At least half of the estimated drop in the ovei'all union effect is due to the

smaller impact of unionism on schools that were more recently organized

rather than to a drop in the effect of unionism on a fixed set of organized

institutions.




Years organized and compensation

      The evidenca that the union wage effect in 1976—77 is greater for

schools that were organized earlier than for those organized later suggests

that the 0—1 union dummy variable may not be the best measure of the

characteristics of organization that leads to higher wages. A potentially
better variable may be the length of time organized. Accordingly, the

regressions of Table 2 were re—estimated with the 0—1 dummy variable replaced

with years organized as the prime explanatory factor and with both the dummy

variable and years organized used as explanatory factors.

        The results of these calculations are given in Table 4. Columns 1 and 2

record the mean years organized for all schools and for the unionized schools.

Column 3 gives the coefficient on years organized when it is the sole measure

of unionism while columns 4 and 5 record the coefficients on years organized

and on the union dummy variable when both are included in the regressions.

From 1970—71 through 1972—73 both variables enter significantly, roughly

"dividing up" the union effect. Thereafter, the coefficient on years organized

tends to be much more significant, while that on the union duimny variable drops

from .02 to an insignificant positive or to a negative value. In the later

period, the years organized variable dominates the calculations, implying

that newly organized schools obtained slight, if any, union wage gains in

the mid 1970s. According to the regression coefficients for 1976—77,

a school that was organized for only one year had no union wage effect

whereas one organized for, say 5 years, would obtain a .08 gain. While it would

be wrong to extrapolate the log—linear form beyond the period under study,

as the effect of years organized is likely to level off as the variable increases,

the results suggest much larger effects for schools that have been organized

longer, with little or no union impact for those organized in recent years.

Whether the observed pattern represents the effect of period of organization,

the weakened market at the time of organization in the.1970's, or the unmeasured

characteristics of schools that lead to small or negligible union gains,

cannot be determined from the data, requiring additional years of observation.


Fringes

      The larger effect of faculty unionism on total academic compensation than

on salaries suggests the value of a more detailed look at the area of pay where

unions appear to make the biggest impact, fringes. In academe the most impor-

tant fringes are insurance and pensions,with the university contribution to TIAA—

CREFF often constituting a sizeable fraction of faculty pay. Faculty unions have

tended to press for increased institutional contributions to these programs and

to many other fringes as well.

      The impact of faculty unionism on fringes is examined in Table 5, which

records the results of regressing dollars of fringes on dollars of straight—

time—pay, unionism, and the control variables used in preceding tables. By

controlling for salary, the regressions estimate the effect of unions on the

composition of the compensation package. Salary rather than total compensation

is used as the independent variable because of the simultaneity problem due to
                                                                               20

 the fact that fringes are included
                                         as part of compensation. Formally, the
 "structural" parameter for thc impact of unioni on fringes,
                                                             conncncatjor
 held fed, can be derived from the regression using a
                                                      simple sirmiltaneous ecuaticn
 model. Let S   salary, F = fringes, C =         compensation   (S +   F).   Then, the
 impact   of    unionization on fringes, total compensation held fixed, is:


          (9)        F   aU + bC = aU + b(F + S) so that F =
                                                                 (a/i-b)U + (b/l-b)S
Hence we can obtain the parameter
                                       a by dividing the coefficient on U by 1 minus
the coefficient on S.

      The calculations reveal a significant impact of unionism on fringes
                                                                          except
in 1970—71. As in the
                       compensation and salary calculations, the impact of union-
ism does, hos.iever, change over time, It drops from 25—30
                                                           percent from 1971—75 to
10 percent in 1976—77. Estimates (not
                                            reported in the table) of the union effect
on a fixed sample of schools show
                                        that, as with total compensation much
of the drop is due to changes in the Schools that
                                                        are organized rather
than to declines in the
                             effect of unionism on the same school over time.



.gitudinai Model
      The longitudinal model developed in
                                          Section I uses wages prior            to unioni-.
zation to control for omitted
                                   factors that may be correlated with unionism and
with later wages, biasing
                               cross—section estimates of the union compensation
effect. Table 6
                      presents least squares estimates of
                                                            the longitudinal model
with in of compensation in
                                1970 and in of
                                                 compensation in 1965 as indicators
for the omitted factors.
                               The least squares calculations
                                                                  ignore the problem
noted earlier of the
                    correlation between the residual and the initial period's
level of pay. Experiments with instrumental
                                            variables, in which the lagged
compensation was instrumented
                                   on in compensation in other years, gave suff i—
ciently similar results to suggest that the OLS calculations
                                                                       suffice to cap-
ture the effect of unionism in the data. Each

 tains the full set of controls used in Table 2 but is limited to the sample

 of institutions reporting in the base year 1970 or 1965 as well as in the

 specified year. Because of this restriction the sample sizes are smaller

 than in Table 2.

      Lines 2—5 deal with the sample of institutions reporting in 1970
 as well as in the later year. The first
                                           line gives the coefficient and
 standard error on the 0—1 union dutrny variable in the absence of lii
                                                                       com-
 pensation in 1970. The second line records
                                              the coefficient on unionism and
 on the ln of 1970 compensation obtained
                                           by addition of the latter variable
 to the regressions. Given the positive link between unionization and
                                                                      1970
 compensation obtained in Table 1, addition of
                                                 the compensation variable
 should reduce the estimated effect of unionism. This is
                                                         clearly the case,
with a sizeable drop in the
                              estimated impact of unions of .03 to .05 points.
The coefficients in line 2 are generally small and in several cases insig-

nificant, implying that much of the cross—section relation between the 0—1

dummy variable and compensation j the result of the organization of insti-

tutions that were already high paying in 1970 rather than the effect of
                                                                        or-
ganization on tompensation. A much less drastic chance in the estimated
                                                                        effect
of unionism is obtained in lines 4—5, which record the results of rresfn in

compensation on years organized with and without ln compensation in 1970 as a

control. While addition of 1970
                                  compensation substantially reduces the impact of
unionism (by 1/3rd to 3/4ths), years organized still obtains a significant

positive coefficient in all but one year (1973—74). With the apparently

better specification of the union variable, the positive correlation between

base year pay and organization does not reduce the impact of unionism to

the marginal levels given in line 3.

     Lines 7—9 record the results of
                                       analogous experiments using ln com-
pensation in 1965 as the control variable.    The results are strikingly dif-
ferent. When 1965 pay is the proxy for the omitted factor, the coefficient

 on th 0—i union dummy drops by just .01 to .02 points, leaving a sizeable

 estimated impact, while the coefficient
                                           on years organized barely falls.

       There are two possible reasons for these disparate findings: 1. Since

 the schools reporting compensation in 1965 and in 1970 are somewhat different,

 the difference could reflect differences in the samples; 2. Since faculty

 unionization increased rapidly in the 1970's,     the result could reflect a

 tendency for schools facing organizing drives or potential organizing drives

 to raise pay with the hope of discouraging unionization.
                                                               The possibility
 that the differences are due to differences
                                               in samples can be examined by
 comparing the effects of adding In compensation in 1965 and in copensatjon

 in 1970 to regressions
                          covering the same sample of firms.
                                                                The results of
 such an analysis for two
                            years, 1976 and 1973, are given in Table 7, which
records coefficients and standard errors on the
                                                  union dummy variable and on years
organized, entered separately, in in
                                       compensation regressions. Column
 (1) presents results without
                                controlling for compensation in 1965 or 1970;
column (2) gives results with in of 1970 compensation as the indicator of

omitted factors; while column (3) gives results with in of 1965 compensation

as the additional explanatory factor. The
                                             regressions show clearly that dif-
ferences in the samples do not
                                 explain the differential results: in the same
set of schools, controlling for in compensation in 1970 reduces estimated

effects of unions by considerabiy
                                    more than controlling for in compensation
in 1965. This leaves open the possibility that compensation
                                                            may have been
raised in schools about to organize in the l970's.



A Full Sample Analysis

     The evidence that unionism has only a modest effect on compensation

when in compensation in 1970 is entered as a control but a sizeable effect

when ln compensation in 1965 is entered leaves open the question of the

     Regressions in lines 1,4 employ the 0—1 union dummy variable as measure

     of unionism and do not include years organized. Regressions in lines

 nitude of the union impact. To obtain an overall estimate of the union effect

 corrected for omitted establishment factors, it is necessary to

 pool the information on h1 from the full set of data over time. The easiest

 way to do this is to assume that h1 has the same effect on in compensation

 in each year and add individual school constants to regressions of in com-

 pensation on the various control variables,
                                                 measures of unions, and time duzrznies.
Such an analysis permits         maximum use of the available observations, since

all institutions that report to AAUP more than once
                                                            are included in the
calculations. The result of the regression is            an estimate of the average
effect of unionism on in
                              compensation over the period, corrected for a constant
institution effect. To the extent that h is not constant
                                                         over time, the regres-
sions are likely to understate the
                                       union effect, since on the basis of the cal-
culations in Table 6, A is likely to be less than

of iflstjtutjons
                   reporting at least twice in the AAUP survey over the period 1965,

1970—1977. Colis (1) and (3) give the coefficient on unionism and
                                                                  years

planatory variables.      The final,two coluts present coefficients on the two

measures of unionism, entered together, with and without the individual

constants. The analysis shows a significant effect of trade unionism in all

cases, with years organized bearing a much stronger relation to compensation
than the 0—1 duny variable,
                             especially after addition of the school constants.
The coefficient on the union duumiy variable
                                                drops by about 80 percent upon addition
of the constant (column 2 vs. column 1), while the coefficient on years

falls much more modestly. In columns (5) and (6) addition of the school constants

effectively   wipes   out the impact of the union dt.mmiy variable but does not alter the

coefficient on

  are based on a sample with 7 years of experience from the 1970's arid just

  a single earlier year, the overall results are closer to those obtained by

  adding in compensation in 1970 to the regressions for individual years than

  to those obtained by adding in compensation in 1965. If institutions with

  potential for organizing raised compensation in the 1970's, the overall

  effect of faculty unions on compensation is likely to be understated compared

  to results that would be obtained if we had additional data for the 1960's.

 As they stand, the results do show a fairly substantial impact of years

 organized on compensation, with institutions that became union in, say,

 1970, having compensation about 9 percent higher than they would otherwise

 have had. As noted earlier, however, the
                                             linear years organized effect
 should not be extrapolated beyond the limits of the sample: presumably

 the effect will decline as years organized grows.



 Conclusion

       This paper has examined the effects
                                             of faculty unionism on faculty corn-.
 pensation using different types of models and found that the estimated

 impact depends significantly on the model. Cross—section calculations
                                                                        yield
 sizeable estimates of the effect
                                  of faculty unionism on compensation, and on
fringe benefits, which, however, differ over time and
                                                      among institutions,
and which show a stronger impact for
                                          years organized than for an 0—1 dummy
variable measure of unionism. A
                                   longitudinal model, which allows for a link
between unionism and pre—union compensation levels and fo a link between

unionism and the characteristics that affect rates of change of
                                                                compensation,
yielded divergent estimates: with 1970 compensation entered in the regressions,

the union effect was substantially
                                     reduced; with 1965 compensation entered,
the effect remained sizeable. In
                                   a fixed effect model using all of the
institutions and years, the
                              average effect of years organized was significant
                                                                    29

and sizeable, but the effect of 0—1 union dummy variable declined greatly

from cross—section estimates. The different results obtained in different

years arid with different samples and models is consistent with the divergent

estimates of the effect of faculty unionism obtained in previous work,

highlighting the need for more inclusive samples and estimating techniques.

      Perhaps the most surpri3ing finding relates to the dependence of the

union effect on years organized. This finding could result from three possible

factors: 1. The increased ability of unions to win gains as time proceeds,

at least over the span considered here; 2. Early organization of institutions

with greater potential for gains in wages (as opposed to initially higher wages);

3. Greater difficulty in obtaining increases by unions organizing in the l970s

weakened academic market place than by uni 1s organizing earlier. If the

results reflect the first factor, there are obviously much larger economic

benefits from organization of remaining nonunion campuses than if they reflect

the second or third factors.

     These estimates relate to schools rather than campuses.    More than

500 campuses are reported as having bargaining agents. The figures on

faculty unionism given by Burton relate to campuses; those

given by the National Center of Education relate to schools.

     Birnbaum analyzed a sample of 88 matched union and nonunion campuses

and found sizeable union wage advantages in 1972 and greater increases

in wages on unionized campuses from 1968 to 1972.    Morgan and Kearney ana-

lyzed a sample of 46 paired 4—year institutions, also finding larger mone-

tary gains for unionized institutions, in this case from 1969—79 to 1974—75.

Brown and Stone analyzed salary and compensation growth before and after

collective bargaining on 37 campuses from 1970—71 to 1975—76 and compared

the rates to those in the nation. They found t'no significant impacts on

salary, compensation, and promotions associated with the adoption of col—

lective bargaining by college and university faculty."
