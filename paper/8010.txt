1. Introduction

The GATT/WTO antidumping (AD) statute requires two criteria to be met in
order to impose duties on foreign suppliers named in antidumping suits. First,
there must be evidence that the domestic industry has suÔ¨Äered ‚Äúmaterial injury‚Äù
(e.g., a decline in proÔ¨Åtability) as a result of foreign imports. Second, the foreign

suppliers must be found to be pricing at ‚Äúless than fair value‚Äù (LTFV). This latter
criterion can be determined in either of two ways: (1) by showing that the price
charged in the domestic market by the foreign suppliers is below the price charged
for the same product in other markets (i.e., the ‚Äúprice-based‚Äù method) or (2) by

showing that the price charged in the domestic market is below an estimate of
cost plus a normal return (i.e., the ‚Äúconstructed-value‚Äù method).
       The focus of this paper is on how macroeconomic factors in general, and Ô¨Çuc-
tuations in real exchange rates in particular, can aÔ¨Äect the determination of each
of these criteria. At a theoretical level it is not obvious how real exchange rates

will aÔ¨Äect Ô¨Åling behavior, given the criteria laid out above. For example, when
the domestic currency strengthens, the normal response of foreign Ô¨Årms is to in-
crease the foreign currency price of shipments to the domestic market relative to
other destinations, but by less than the appreciation of the domestic currency.1

An increase in the price of shipments to the domestic market obviously reduces
   1
    The relationship between exchange rate Ô¨Çuctuations and destination-speciÔ¨Åc pricing of ex-
ports is known as pricing-to-market behavior. The evidence on pricing-to-market varies by
industry (see Goldberg and Knetter (1997)), but the median price response to a real exchange
rate change across industries studied in the literature is close to 50%‚Äîi.e., half of the movement
in the real exchange rate is oÔ¨Äset by destination-price adjustment.



                                                1
the chance that the foreign Ô¨Årm is guilty of LTFV pricing. Thus, a strong (weak)
domestic currency makes it less (more) likely that the foreign Ô¨Årm is guilty of
LTFV pricing.

       However, since the price increase in foreign currency units does not typically
oÔ¨Äset the full eÔ¨Äect of the domestic currency appreciation, the domestic currency
price of foreign goods will fall. This would be expected to reduce the proÔ¨Åts of
domestic producers in the same industry by lowering their margins or market
share.2 Thus, a strong (weak) domestic currency should increase (decrease) the

likelihood of a Ô¨Ånding of material injury to the domestic industry.
       Empirically which eÔ¨Äect is more important is an open question. Within the
business community there appears to be a belief that a strong domestic currency
precipitates Ô¨Ålings. For example, in its March 26, 1999 Economic Analyst publi-

cation, Goldman Sachs documents a rise in AD cases associated with an increase
in the value of the trade-weighted U.S. dollar. Interestingly, the existing empirical
literature reaches the opposite conclusion. In particular, using a dataset based on
U.S. AD Ô¨Ålings from 1982‚Äì87 Feinberg (1989) Ô¨Ånds that Ô¨Ålings increase with a

weaker dollar.
       Fluctuations in economic activity, both in the importing country and the ex-
porting country, might also aÔ¨Äect Ô¨Åling decisions. Clearly, a slump in economic
   2
    Note that the dollar price of imported goods will fall relative to domestic goods with a real
appreciation of the dollar provided the foreign Ô¨Årm does not completely oÔ¨Äset the relative cost
change with a markup change. The special case in which markups are adjusted to fully oÔ¨Äset
the eÔ¨Äects of currency movements is known as ‚Äúcomplete pricing-to-market‚Äù in the literature.
The opposite case, in which exchange rate changes are fully passed-through to foreign buyers is
known as ‚Äúfull pass-through.‚Äù



                                               2
activity in the importing country makes it more likely domestic Ô¨Årms perform
poorly which may facilitate a Ô¨Ånding of material injury. Also, a weak economy
in the importing country might naturally lead foreign Ô¨Årms to reduce prices on

shipments to the importing country. This could increase the likelihood of pricing
below fair value. Thus we would expect that import country GDP will be neg-
atively related to Ô¨Ålings. It is less clear how export country GDP is related to
Ô¨Ålings. One possibility is that a weak foreign economy increases the likelihood
that foreign Ô¨Årms will cut prices to maintain overall levels of output. While such

behavior might cause injury to domestic Ô¨Årms, it is not clear that it would trigger
pricing below ‚Äúfair value‚Äù in the price-based sense, since foreign Ô¨Årms would pre-
sumably be lowering prices to all markets (especially their own home market). It
is possible, however, that generally low prices would increase the chance of LTFV

using the ‚Äúconstructed-value‚Äù method.
   The conventional wisdom on these issues seems to be that the more diÔ¨Écult
test to pass for a successful antidumping Ô¨Åling (i.e., one that leads to duties being
imposed on the foreign Ô¨Årm) is the material injury criterion. For instance, over the

past 20 years only 28 of 800 U.S. cases received negative LTFV determinations; by
contrast, there have been over 300 negative injury determinations. This fact might
suggest that more antidumping cases would be Ô¨Åled when exchange rates or output
Ô¨Çuctuations improve the odds of an aÔ¨Érmative material injury decision‚Äîi.e., when
the domestic currency is strong in real terms or when the domestic country is in

recession. However, the exact relationship will depend on the sensitivity of prices
and proÔ¨Åts to exchange rates changes and the correlation between exchange rates

                                         3
and other macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, the criteria for imposition of
duties may be implemented somewhat diÔ¨Äerently across other countries. It is
therefore an empirical issue.

       Our goal in this paper is to determine the relationship between Ô¨Ålings, real
exchange rates, and economic activity. First, we develop a model that links cur-
rency Ô¨Çuctuations to the criteria for dumping. We presume that the incentive
to Ô¨Åle an AD case is positively related to the likelihood of aÔ¨Érmative decisions
on the injury and LTFV criteria. Then, we investigate the empirical relationship

between Ô¨Ålings and macro factors since 1980 for four of the primary AD users
(Australia, Canada, the European Union, and the U.S.).3 We believe systematic
evidence that macro factors are related to Ô¨Ålings would be further ammunition
for the view that antidumping law is a tool of protectionism that is frequently

abused. While Ô¨Çuctuations in real GDP and real exchange rates are certain to
aÔ¨Äect industry equilibria, they are unlikely to be systematically associated with
malevolent behavior by foreign Ô¨Årms. A Ô¨Ånding that dumping allegations are re-
lated to macro factors would seem to suggest that foreign Ô¨Årms are potentially

being held responsible for the impact of factors beyond their control.4
   3
      Several recent papers study issues related to those examined in this paper. Hens, et. al.
(1999) study pricing-to-market in a reciprocal duopoly model. However, they do not address
the issue of how pricing-to-market is aÔ¨Äected by AD law. Blonigen and Haynes (1999) study
the pricing behavior of Ô¨Årms following the imposition of AD duties. We are interested in the
pricing behavior prior to an AD investigation. Finally, a number of papers including Baldwin
and Steagall (1994) and Krupp (1994) examine how various factors inÔ¨Çuence the ITC injury
decision. We focus not on the injury determination but on the number of Ô¨Ålings in this work.
    4
      This view is echoed in the Goldman Sachs Economic Analyst which claims that ‚Äúthe corre-
lation between the number of AD cases initiated and the change in the G7 trade-weighted dollar
index suggests that domestic producers have been seeking protection against adverse market
conditions, not against anti-competitive dumping.‚Äù


                                              4
2. The Model

This section will setup a two-period duopoly model that identiÔ¨Åes how AD law
complicates the foreign Ô¨Årm‚Äôs pricing decision. We begin by assuming that there
are two Ô¨Årms, one domestic and one foreign. In each period, the Ô¨Årms produce
diÔ¨Äerentiated products that are close, but not perfect, substitutes for one another.

The domestic Ô¨Årm services the domestic market with local production while the
foreign Ô¨Årm exports to the domestic market.
      For simplicity we will ignore the foreign Ô¨Årm‚Äôs behavior in its own home mar-
ket. This assumption can be justiÔ¨Åed on two grounds. First, it avoids needless

complication without much cost. Second, in the majority of AD investigations
the foreign Ô¨Årm‚Äôs home market pricing is not directly relevant to the investiga-
tion. This is the case, for instance, when a constructed-value approach is used
to calculate the LTFV margin.5 Also, when home market sales are too small (or
do not exist), or when the exporter operates in a centrally planned economy, the

dumping calculation will be based on sales of a comparable product sold by a
third party in another market. In all these circumstances the home market price
used in the AD investigation is largely outside the control of the foreign Ô¨Årm.
      As discussed by McKinnon (1979) and Giovannini (1988) the foreign Ô¨Årm faces

a decision as to which currency to use when announcing its price. We will not
analyze that problem here, but rather follow Feenstra (1989) and assume that the
  5
    Clarida (1992) reports that about two-thirds of US AD cases use the constructed value
method. Messerlin (1989) reports an even higher percentage of EU cases use the constructed
value method.



                                            5
foreign Ô¨Årm sets its price in the domestic currency and then uses the exchange
rate to convert into foreign currency units. Let et denote the bilateral exchange
rate at time t, expressed as foreign currency per unit of domestic currency. Let

qt (pt ) denote the foreign (domestic) Ô¨Årm‚Äôs price and yt = y(qt , pt ) (xt = x(qt , pt ))
denote the foreign (domestic) Ô¨Årm‚Äôs quantity in period t, t = 1, 2. Let œï(yt ) and
œÜ(xt ) denote the foreign and domestic Ô¨Årms‚Äô costs of production.
       If AD duties are not present, the domestic Ô¨Årm will earn proÔ¨Åt œÄt (qt , pt ), and
the foreign Ô¨Årm will earn Œ†t (qt , pt , et ),


                             œÄt (qt , pt ) = pt x(qt , pt ) ‚àí œÜ(x(qt , pt ))            (1)

                         Œ†t (qt , pt , et ) = et qt y(qt , pt ) ‚àí œï(y(qt, pt ))         (2)


It is important to realize that œÄ is denominated in the domestic currency while Œ†
is denominated in the foreign currency.
       When Ô¨Årms compete under the specter of AD law, the foreign Ô¨Årm‚Äôs pricing
decision is complicated by the LTFV and injury determinations. We will say

that the foreign Ô¨Årm has sold at LTFV if its price in the domestic market during
the Ô¨Årst period is less than some benchmark price (denominated in the foreign
currency). In other words, LTFV sales are said to occur if e1 q1 < qH , where we are
implicitly assuming that the benchmark price is calculated using the constructed

value method.6
   6
   The model is equally relevant for a price-based case in which the comparison price is in-
dependent of e. For example, qH could be the price in the home market if there are constant
marginal costs and no imported inputs.



                                                   6
   At this point we will assume that both the domestic and foreign Ô¨Årms only
know the general rules by which qH is constructed. In other words, the distri-
bution governing qH , F (¬∑), is common knowledge. We also assume that F (¬∑) is

twice-continuously diÔ¨Äerentiable on support [0, q]. The probability of a LTFV
determination can be written as

                                                           q
                    L
                   œÅ (q1 , e1 ) = Prob(e1 q1 < qH ) =             F  (x) dx.
                                                         e1 q 1



   An injury determination must also be made before duties can be levied. For
simplicity, we will say that the domestic Ô¨Årm has been injured if œÄ1 (q1 , p1 ) ‚â§ œÄ I +¬µ.
In other words, we interpret the injury criterion as establishing a minimum proÔ¨Åt

level, œÄ I . However, factors beyond the Ô¨Årms‚Äô control‚Äîthe political environment,
the general state of the economy, etc.‚Äîcreate a random component to the injury
decision, ¬µ, which we assume is drawn from a twice-continuously diÔ¨Äerentiable
distribution G(¬∑). We assume that G(¬∑) is common knowledge and has zero mean.

Thus, the probability that injury occurs is

                                                               ‚àû
          œÅ (q1 , p1 ) = Prob(œÄ1 (q1 , p1 ) ‚àí œÄ ‚â§ ¬µ) =
            I                                I
                                                                               G (x) dx.
                                                            œÄ1 (q1 ,p1 )‚àíœÄ I



   The timing of play is as follows: (1) The exchange rate, e1 is realized. (2) Firms
announce their Ô¨Årst period prices; Ô¨Årst period sales and proÔ¨Åts are realized. (3) If
it desires, the domestic Ô¨Årm can initiate an AD investigation at a cost of C. (4) If

a petition is initiated, the government determines whether or not both criteria



                                           7
are satisÔ¨Åed and announces its decision. (5) The exchange rate, e2 is realized.
(6) If dumping is found, a dumping duty is charged; in a manner consistent with
current WTO rules, we will model the dumping order as establishing a minimum

price, below which the foreign Ô¨Årm cannot sell in the domestic market. We will
denote this price as qD ; the foreign Ô¨Årm collects only q1 . If dumping is not found,
the Ô¨Årms simply announce their second period prices. (7) Second period sales and
proÔ¨Åts are realized.


Equilibrium Pricing and Pricing-to-Market without Antidumping Law

Without the threat of AD the Ô¨Årms simply maximize their proÔ¨Åt in each period.

Letting Œ¥ denote the common discount factor we can write the Ô¨Årms‚Äô objectives
as


                        max œÄ = œÄ1 (q1 , p1 ) + Œ¥œÄ2 (q2 , p2 ),                  (3)
                       {p1 ,p2 }


                       max Œ† = Œ†1 (q1 , p1 , e1 ) + Œ¥Œ†2 (q2 , p2 , e2 ).         (4)
                       {q1 ,q2 }



     The Ô¨Årst order conditions can be written as

                         ‚àÇœÄt           ‚àÇxt               ‚àÇxt
                             = xt + pt        ‚àí œÜ (xt )     = 0,                (5)
                         ‚àÇpt            ‚àÇpt              ‚àÇpt
                         ‚àÇŒ†t                 ‚àÇyt            ‚àÇyt
                             = et yt + et qt     ‚àí œï (yt )     = 0.             (6)
                         ‚àÇqt                 ‚àÇqt            ‚àÇqt

     We will assume that the second order conditions are satisÔ¨Åed, that the own-

price eÔ¨Äects dominate the cross-price eÔ¨Äects, that there exists a unique, stable

                                              8

strictly positive.7 Let (qt‚àó (et ), p‚àót (et )) denote the Nash equilibrium prices and let
the domestic and foreign best response functions be denoted as Œ≤(qt ) and Œ≥(pt , et ),

respectively.
       Totally diÔ¨Äerentiating the Ô¨Årst order conditions we can derive the eÔ¨Äect of the

       Of most interest is the elasticity of the foreign Ô¨Årm‚Äôs price with respect to the
exchange rate:

where Œ∑t = (qt /yt )‚àÇyt /‚àÇqt is the foreign Ô¨Årm‚Äôs own price elasticity of demand.
       The latter is the typical pass-through result found in the literature (Feenstra,

1989; Knetter, 1989) and it implies that when the domestic currency appreciates,
the foreign Ô¨Årm lowers its domestic currency price.8 Feenstra established con-
   7
    Friedman (1983) discusses the suÔ¨Écient conditions for these conditions to hold.
   8
    We should point out this result does not depend on which currency the foreign Ô¨Årm uses
to set its price. If we suppose instead that the foreign Ô¨Årm sets its price in its home currency,
then the above result implies that an appreciation of the domestic currency will raise its foreign
currency price.


                                                     9
ditions when pass-through is less than one-for-one, which implies that that the
foreign Ô¨Årm‚Äôs price rises in terms of foreign currency. Empirically, Goldberg and
Knetter (1997) Ô¨Ånd that about half of the movement in the real exchange rate is

oÔ¨Äset by destination-speciÔ¨Åc price adjustment.
    This result provides the intuition behind the conjecture that exchange rate
Ô¨Çuctuations have an ambiguous eÔ¨Äect on AD Ô¨Ålings. Given the above result, we
expect that when the domestic currency appreciates, the foreign Ô¨Årm will lower
its domestic currency price by less than the change in the exchange rate. With

partial pass-through, this means that an aÔ¨Érmative LTFV determination is less
likely (since e1 q1 increases) and an aÔ¨Érmative injury determination is more likely
(since q1 falls). We now formally consider how pricing decisions are aÔ¨Äected by
AD law.


Equilibrium Pricing and Pricing-to-Market with Antidumping Law

In general, the threat of an AD action implies that the strategy of simply maxi-
mizing proÔ¨Åt on a period-by-period basis will not be optimal. Rather, Ô¨Årst period
pricing decisions inÔ¨Çuence second period proÔ¨Åt.
    We therefore need to solve the model recursively. At the beginning of period
two, Ô¨Årms know whether duties have been levied. If duties have not been levied,

the Ô¨Årms‚Äô simply maximize second period proÔ¨Åts, just as they did without AD law.
Denote this equilibrium as {q2‚àó , p‚àó2 }. In this case, the Ô¨Årms will earn œÄ2 (q2‚àó , p‚àó2 ) and
Œ†2 (q2‚àó , p‚àó2 , e2 ), respectively.
    If, on the other hand, dumping has been found, the domestic government

                                             10
requires the foreign Ô¨Årm‚Äôs price equal qD . In this case, the domestic Ô¨Årm sets a
price pD = Œ≤(qD ) and will earn proÔ¨Åts œÄ2 (qD , pD ).
   The domestic Ô¨Årm‚Äôs gain when AD duties are imposed can be expressed as


                            ‚àÜ(qD ) ‚â° œÄ2 (qD , pD ) ‚àí œÄ2 (q2‚àó , p‚àó2 ) > 0.                            (8)


   Recall that when dumping duties are levied the foreign Ô¨Årm collects only q1

per unit. Thus, the foreign Ô¨Årm‚Äôs expected loss is


      Œì(qD , e2 ) ‚â° Œ†2 (qD , pD , e2 ) ‚àí e2 (qD ‚àí q1 )y(qD , pD ) ‚àí Œ†2 (q2‚àó , p‚àó2 , e2 ) < 0.        (9)


   For the moment, we will assume that the domestic Ô¨Årm Ô¨Ånds it proÔ¨Åtable to
Ô¨Åle an AD petition. In this case, we can write the AD law-distorted two-period
expected proÔ¨Åt functions as


          œÄ(q1 , p1 ) = œÄ1 (q1 , p1 , e1 ) + Œ¥ œÄ2 (q2‚àó , p‚àó2 ) + œÅI (¬∑)œÅL (¬∑)‚àÜ(qD ) ‚àí C ,           (10)

  Œ†(q1 , p1 , e1 , e2 ) = Œ†1 (q1 , p1 , e1 ) + Œ¥ Œ†2 (q2‚àó , p‚àó2 , e2 ) + œÅI (¬∑)œÅL (¬∑)Œì(qD , e2 ) .   (11)

                                     + Œ¥œÅI (¬∑)œÅL (¬∑)e2 y(qD , pD ) = 0                              (13)


                                                  11
      The conditions can be interpreted as follows. In both equations the Ô¨Årst term
is the marginal change to Ô¨Årst period proÔ¨Åt while the bracketed expression is the
net eÔ¨Äect of a price change on second period proÔ¨Åt. When the Ô¨Årms myopically

maximize their Ô¨Årst period proÔ¨Åts, as they do without AD law, the prices are
chosen so that the Ô¨Årst term (in each equation) equals zero, as seen in (5)‚Äì(6).
      For the domestic Ô¨Årm, simply maximizing Ô¨Årst period proÔ¨Åt (i.e., setting p1 =
Œ≤(q1 )) is always a solution to (12). Since our focus here is the eÔ¨Äect of AD on
pass-through behavior, we will assume that this is indeed the unique outcome.9

      By contrast, simply maximizing Ô¨Årst period proÔ¨Åts cannot be a solution for the
foreign Ô¨Årm. Altering its Ô¨Årst period price directly impacts both the LTFV and
injury determination. In particular, an increase in the Ô¨Årst period price decreases
both the probability of injury and LTFV sales. An increase in the Ô¨Årst period

price also reduces the second period loss if duties are imposed. All three eÔ¨Äects
lead the foreign Ô¨Årm to announce a higher Ô¨Årst period price than it would without
AD law. In other words, letting Œ≥D (p1 , e1 ) denote the foreign Ô¨Årm‚Äôs best response
function with AD law, we know that Œ≥D (p1 , e1 ) ‚â• Œ≥(p1 , e1 ).

      We will once again assume that the second order conditions are satisÔ¨Åed,
that there exists a unique, stable Nash equilibrium in this AD-distorted scenario
and that in equilibrium both Ô¨Årms‚Äô prices and output are strictly positive. Let
(q1D (e1 ), pD
             1 (e1 )) denote the Nash equilibrium prices.

      Totally diÔ¨Äerentiating (12) and (13) we can derive the eÔ¨Äect of the Ô¨Årst period
  9
    In a related paper, Prusa (1994) establishes conditions when p1 = Œ≤(q1 ) is the unique
equilibrium response.

the impact that if duties are levied a higher Ô¨Årst period price generates higher
second period revenue (because the Ô¨Årm pays lower duties). This term is nega-
tive, reÔ¨Çecting that the higher exchange rate lowers the probability of a LTFV
determination and thus allows more pass through.

   The second square bracketed term is where ambiguity appears. It can be ei-
ther positive or negative. Recall that Œì(¬∑) < 0 so the second bracketed term is
the change in the probability of the foreign Ô¨Årm loss. The Ô¨Årst curly bracketed
term captures that the foreign Ô¨Årm‚Äôs incentive to raise its price in order to reduce

                                       < 0) is attenuated by the fact that the exchange
                                                     L
rate appreciation reduces the chance of LTFV ( ‚àÇœÅ‚àÇe1(¬∑) < 0). In eÔ¨Äect, in terms of

the LTFV determination the exchange rate appreciation allows the foreign Ô¨Årm
to lower its price. The second curly bracketed captures the direct eÔ¨Äect of a
higher price on the LTFV determination. In general, either eÔ¨Äect can dominate.
Therefore, we cannot be sure whether AD law will increase or decrease the in-

centive for incomplete pass-through. If the competing eÔ¨Äects roughly oÔ¨Äset each
other, we would expect incomplete pass-through to be common in the presence
of AD law (as it appears to be in the empirical literature on pass-through and
pricing-to-market).
   The domestic Ô¨Årm may not, of course, choose to Ô¨Åle an AD petition. It will

Ô¨Åle a petition if
                             œÅI (¬∑)œÅL (¬∑)‚àÜ(qD ) ‚àí C ‚â• 0.

For some industries the expected payoÔ¨Ä from Ô¨Åling will not exceed the costs.

   One would expect that Ô¨Ålings would be positively related to œÅI (¬∑), œÅL (¬∑), and
the expected dumping margin. What we have shown is that exchange rate pass-
through creates a trade-oÔ¨Ä between œÅI (¬∑) and œÅL (¬∑). If the outcome of AD cases
tend to hinge on the injury test then we would expect Ô¨Ålings to be associated with

strong domestic currency. If, on the other hand, the the LTFV test tends to be
the crucial determination, then we would expect Ô¨Ålings to be associated with weak
domestic currency. While our model has taken the dumping duty as exogenous, it
is likely that in practice a weak domestic currency increases the dumping margin.


                                          14
Therefore, if anything, our model may understate the incentives to Ô¨Åle when the
domestic currency is weak. This suggests that in our empirical study we must
be careful in our interpretation if we Ô¨Ånd that a weak currency stimulates Ô¨Ålings,

since this could be due to œÅL (¬∑) or the size of the margin. If, on the other hand,
we Ô¨Ånd that a strong currency stimulates Ô¨Ålings then it is clear that the injury
determination is the key factor in Ô¨Ålings.


3. Data

To investigate the relationship between antidumping Ô¨Ålings and macroeconomic
conditions, we collected data on AD Ô¨Ålings by the four largest users: Australia,

Canada, the United States, and the European Union. The Ô¨Åling data is available
from the GATT/WTO annual reports.
       These four users accounted for more than two-thirds of all AD actions Ô¨Åled
worldwide since 1980. For each of these four reporting regions (henceforth referred

to as ‚Äúreporting‚Äù or ‚ÄúÔ¨Åling‚Äù countries), we have aggregate Ô¨Åling data on an annual
basis from 1980‚Äì98.10 For each Ô¨Åling, we know the Ô¨Åling country, the industry, the
country named in the Ô¨Åling (i.e., the defendant), and the ultimate determination
(injury or no injury). The GATT/WTO reports do not include any information

on the dumping margin which precludes us from directly looking at how exchange
rate changes aÔ¨Äects margins.
       Figures 1 displays the number of Ô¨Ålings by Ô¨Åling country for our 1980‚Äì98
  10
    Changes in antidumping law in 1979 preclude us from using Ô¨Åling data prior to 1980. Also,
due to reporting problems we do not have Australian Ô¨Ålings in 1980 and 1981.

sample period. The solid line depicts total Ô¨Ålings while the dashed line depicts
Ô¨Ålings excluding those made by the steel industry, which is generally viewed to
be unique in terms of its proclivity to Ô¨Åle a large number of cases.11 The Ô¨Ågures

show there is considerable variation in the number of Ô¨Ålings from year-to-year.
Furthermore, it is clear that Ô¨Ålings are related to the business cycle, especially for
the United States and Australia. The recessions that began in the early 1980s
and early 1990s (the only two in our sample) are associated with large spikes in
the number of Ô¨Ålings.

      The level and variation of Ô¨Ålings across Ô¨Ålers is also summarized in Table 1.
Adjusting for the fact that its Ô¨Åling data is missing for 1980‚Äì81, we Ô¨Ånd that
Australia is the heaviest Ô¨Åler of the four regions. This is surprising given that it
is the smallest of the four countries by a fairly large margin (e.g., Canada has a

population about 50% greater than Australia, while the U.S. and EU are about
10 times the size of Canada.) Table 2 shows the pattern of bilateral Ô¨Ålings across
countries. As is readily apparent there is substantial variation in Ô¨Åling across
countries. The US and EU have frequently targeted Japanese products while

Australia and Canada have both made the US a prime target.
      The International Monetary Fund International Financial Statistics CD-ROM
provided real GDP data for both the Ô¨Åling countries and the named countries. In
our empirical work we perform tests using both aggregate Ô¨Ålings and also the
number of Ô¨Ålings against individual countries. For the aggregate Ô¨Åling behavior,

we use the real eÔ¨Äective exchange rate index (based on labor costs) for the Ô¨Åling

      GATT/WTO reports have only identiÔ¨Åed industry since 1987.

country as reported by the IMF. In our examination of Ô¨Ålings against individual
foreign countries (i.e., ‚Äúbilateral Ô¨Ålings‚Äù), we used bilateral real exchange rates
between each of the four Ô¨Åling countries and each country named in at least

one antidumping case since 1980. The Economic Research Service of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture was a convenient source for bilateral real exchange
rates since they report exchange rates in a consistent fashion for virtually all
countries in the world. The exchange rate is deÔ¨Åned as foreign currency per
unit of domestic currency so that an increase in the exchange rate reÔ¨Çects an

appreciation of the Ô¨Åling country‚Äôs currency. Also, we normalize each country‚Äôs
exchange rate by dividing by the sample average.


4. Empirical Specification and Results

The theoretical model motivates how Ô¨Ålings might be aÔ¨Äected by real exchange
rates, Ô¨Åling country GDP, and rest of world GDP. The dependent variable in our

econometric work will be the number of Ô¨Ålings (and for robustness, sometimes
number of Ô¨Ålings excluding steel‚Äîan industry with an unusually large amount of
Ô¨Åling activity) occurring in a year.
   Since the number of Ô¨Ålings is a non-negative count variable, we will estimate the

relationship between number of Ô¨Ålings and macroeconomic factors using Poisson
and Negative Binomial regression as well as OLS, with the belief that the Poisson
or Negative Binomial regression is probably more appropriate given the nature of
the data.



                                        17
   The Poisson regression model assumes that the incidence rate v (the rate per
unit time at which happenings occur) is a function of some underlying variables
as follows:

                           vj = eŒ≤0 +Œ≤1 x1j +Œ≤2 x2j +¬∑¬∑¬∑+Œ≤k xkj

   The expected number of occurrences is equal to this incidence rate multiplied
by the exposure (the number of units of time over which observations are mea-

sured). The exposure is uninteresting in our case since each observation in the
data set is the number of AD Ô¨Ålings in a one year interval. We believe that the
incidence rate is a function of GDP growth in the home and foreign countries,
the real exchange rate, and possibly other factors. This Poisson regression is
estimated by maximum likelihood.

   One feature of the Poisson model that is frequently violated in applications is
the equivalence of the expected value and variance of a Poisson random variable.
Often, count data exhibit overdispersion with respect to the Poisson model‚Äîi.e.,
the variance of the observed counts exceeds their mean. This is certainly true

regarding the data reported in Table 1. In such cases, an alternative is to assume
that the data are generated by a negative binomial random variable, which allows
for a variance that is greater than the expected value of the distribution. While
we will base most of our conclusions on the negative binomial (NB) regression

model, all models yield similar results in terms of the statistical and economic
signiÔ¨Åcance of the macroeconomic factors on AD Ô¨Ålings.
   In addition to method of estimation, another important speciÔ¨Åcation issue is


                                           18
the lag structure of the regressors. The legal framework for determining LTFV
and material injury oÔ¨Äers some guidance here. While not speciÔ¨Åed under WTO
rules, all of the reporting countries generally analyze pricing behavior over the

year prior to the Ô¨Åling of the case in order to assess LTFV. By contrast, all of the
reporting countries evaluate injury over a longer time horizon. In general, injury
is determined over the three years preceding the Ô¨Åling. Given these features of the
law, it seems plausible to consider lags from one to three years for our variables.
We report results with a one-year lag on the real exchange rate (since we conjecture

that exchange rates may be more important for LTFV which is assessed over the
one year period) and three year lags on real GDP growth. We have experimented
with other lag structures (and contemporaneous values) and are conÔ¨Ådent that
none of our main results is aÔ¨Äected by the choice of lag structure.


Annual Data on Aggregate Filings

Our Ô¨Årst set of results is based on the annual number of Ô¨Ålings for each of our
four reporting units (Australia, Canada, EU, and US). We estimate the number
of Ô¨Ålings as a function of the real exchange rate, domestic real GDP growth, and
rest of world real GDP growth using OLS, Poisson, and NB regression. The real
exchange rate variable is normalized by dividing each exchange rate series by its

sample mean before taking logs. The real GDP growth variable is the three-year
growth rate from t ‚àí 3 to t (i.e., the three years prior to the Ô¨Åling date).
   Table 3 reports the results of OLS estimation when the data from all four
countries are pooled in a single regression. We experiment in diÔ¨Äerent speciÔ¨Å-

                                         19
cations with the set of independent variables and the lag structure used for the
real exchange rate and the real GDP variables. In all speciÔ¨Åcations, the real ex-
change rate is statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at the 1% level. The positive sign implies

that Ô¨Ålings increase as the currency of the Ô¨Åling country strengthens against its
trading partners. The range of values of the point estimates for the exchange rate
response across these speciÔ¨Åcations is from 45-55. This implies that a 100% real
appreciation (a unit increase in the log of the real exchange rate) of the Ô¨Åling
country‚Äôs currency would be expected to generate an additional 45-55 AD Ô¨Ålings

in the following year. Given the linear speciÔ¨Åcation, we can also conclude that
a one (two) standard deviation appreciation in the real trade-weighted exchange
rate (which is a 12% (24%) increase in our exchange rate variable) will tend to be
associated with six (12) more AD Ô¨Ålings.

   Our other macro factors, growth in Ô¨Åling country real GDP and growth in rest
of world GDP, have a more ambiguous relationship with AD Ô¨Ålings. When Ô¨Åling
country real GDP is added to a model with real exchange rates and Ô¨Åling country
dummy variables, we Ô¨Ånd a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant negative relationship, which

is what we would expect. For each percentage point decline in real GDP growth
between (t‚àí3) and (t), we expect slightly more than three additional Ô¨Ålings in year
t. However, when we add world real GDP growth (deÔ¨Åned over the same interval)
to this regression, neither GDP variable is statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, although both
have a negative sign. Other regressions experiment with changing the window

over which the exchange rate variable and GDP variables are deÔ¨Åned, but these
modiÔ¨Åcations do not alter the basic Ô¨Ånding about the impact of real exchange

                                        20
rates. When we use only the most recent year‚Äôs growth in real GDP, world GDP
growth is negative and signiÔ¨Åcant at the 5% level, suggesting that weak economic
conditions outside of the Ô¨Åling country may precipitate more dumping allegations.

   As noted earlier, OLS is not the appropriate method for analyzing the count
data on AD Ô¨Ålings. Table 4 reports the results for the Poisson regression, which
uses random eÔ¨Äects, rather than Ô¨Åxed eÔ¨Äects as were used in the OLS regressions.
In these tables, we report ‚Äúincidence rate ratios‚Äù associated with the parameter
estimates. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) is the ratio of the counts predicted by

the model when the variable of interest is one unit above its mean value and all
other variables are at their means to the counts predicted when all variables are
at their means. Thus, if the IRR for the real exchange rate is 1.50, then a one unit
increase in the real exchange rate (a 100% real appreciation given that we use the

log of the real rate) would increase counts by 50% when all other variables are at
their means. The t-statistics are reported for a test of the null hypothesis that
the IRR= 1, which would imply no relationship between the dependent variable
and the regressor.

   Our Ô¨Åndings regarding the impact of real exchange rates on AD Ô¨Ålings are
qualitatively the same using the Poisson regression as they were using OLS. In
every speciÔ¨Åcation, the real exchange rate is statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at the 1% level.
The range of IRR values associated with the exchange rate coeÔ¨Écients suggest
that the count of AD Ô¨Ålings increase anywhere from 240% to 355% in response

to a 100% real appreciation of the currency of the Ô¨Åling country. Given a mean
number of annual Ô¨Ålings around 32, this implies between 77 and 114 additional

                                          21
Ô¨Ålings due to a 100% real appreciation. This is a greater quantitative impact than
we found using OLS. Because the Poisson model is non-linear, we also calculate
the increase in Ô¨Ålings for one- and two-standard deviation real appreciations. A

one-standard deviation real appreciation is associated with six more Ô¨Ålings, while
a two-standard deviation real appreciation is associated with 14 Ô¨Ålings for the
model presented in column (2) of Table 4.
       The ambiguity we witnessed regarding the impact of real GDP growth on
Ô¨Ålings is less apparent in the Poisson model. Filing country real GDP growth over

the three-year interval corresponding to the period over which material injury is
assessed is negatively and signiÔ¨Åcantly (at the 1% level) related to Ô¨Ålings, whether
or not world real GDP growth is included.12 A one percentage-point decline in
the three-year real GDP growth of the Ô¨Åling country leads to a 5-10% increase in

the number of Ô¨Ålings, depending on whether world real GDP is included. A one
percentage-point decline in the three-year world real GDP growth leads to a 12%
increase in the number of Ô¨Ålings when Ô¨Åling country real GDP growth is included.
Both domestic and world GDP growth variables are statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at the

5% level.
       Although the Poisson model seems more intuitively appealing than OLS as
a way to analyze the count data on Ô¨Ålings, the goodness of Ô¨Åt statistics show
that we can reject that the data obey the Poisson distribution at the 1% level
for each model. Usually this is a result of ‚Äúoverdispersion‚Äù of the data‚Äîi.e.,
  12
    Note that IRR values less than 1.0 imply a negative relationship between a variable and
Ô¨Åling counts.



                                            22
the variance of the counts exceeds the mean. Based on the means and standard
deviations reported in Table 1 this Ô¨Ånding is not terribly surprising. Consequently,
we consider an alternative count data model, the negative binomial (NB), which

is similar to Poisson but does not constrain the relationship between mean and
variance.
       The results of estimating the NB model on aggregate Ô¨Ålings are presented in
Table 5. Once again, rather than report the coeÔ¨Écient estimates themselves, we
report the IRR associated with each estimate. The Ô¨Årst point to note is that the

IRR estimates associated with the real exchange rate using the NB model are very
similar to those obtained using Poisson. The various models imply that a 100%
real appreciation is associated with an increase in Ô¨Ålings of 265% to 370%. They
are all statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at the 1% level. Clearly, the aggregate Ô¨Åling data

suggest that AD Ô¨Ålings increase substantially when the Ô¨Åling country currency
strengthens in real terms, which contrasts with Feinberg‚Äôs (1989) result that U.S.
Ô¨Ålings rise with a weakening currency.13
       The relationship between real GDP growth and Ô¨Ålings in Table 5 is somewhat

diÔ¨Äerent from Table 4. Domestic GDP growth is negatively related to Ô¨Ålings when
it is included alone, but when domestic and world GDP growth are both included,
neither variable is statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, although both have the expected neg-
  13
    Feinberg‚Äôs analysis diÔ¨Äers from ours in two ways. First, he uses quarterly data from 1982‚Äì87
for U.S. Ô¨Ålings against Korea, Mexico, Brazil, and Japan. Second, he uses a Tobit model with
the contemporaneous exchange rate. We have estimated a Tobit model on aggregate Ô¨Åling data
with the contemporaneous exchange rate and Ô¨Ånd that these results are very similar to what is
obtained with our speciÔ¨Åcations reported in Tables 3‚Äì5. (Results available upon request.) Thus,
it appears that the larger data sample is what leads to the diÔ¨Äerences in our Ô¨Åndings, not the
method of estimation or lag structure of the regressions.


                                              23
ative relationship.
   In Table 6 we report results on aggregate Ô¨Ålings that include a Ô¨Åling-country
speciÔ¨Åc real exchange rate eÔ¨Äect. This allows us only 19 annual observations (17

for Australia) with which to detect a relationship, and more importantly, only a
few big swings in the real exchange rate series for each Ô¨Åling country. Here we
Ô¨Ånd that Australia has by far the most pronounced exchange rate eÔ¨Äect. The
IRR values exceed 50 in some cases and the coeÔ¨Écients are signiÔ¨Åcant at the 1%
level. The U.S. results are ‚Äúborderline signiÔ¨Åcant‚Äù with t-values ranging from

1.6 to 1.8 and IRRs between 2.5 and 2.6. Canada and the EU are never close
to being statistically signiÔ¨Åcant and the IRRs tend to be quite small. Part of
the problem may be the limited number of observations, which we can rectify by
examining Ô¨Ålings by ‚ÄúaÔ¨Äected country‚Äù (i.e., those countries named in a suit as

‚Äúdefendants‚Äù) for each of our Ô¨Åling countries. These results are discussed below.
All of the countries have the expected negative relationship between own GDP
growth and Ô¨Ålings, but only Canada‚Äôs is statistically signiÔ¨Åcant.
   Since our Ô¨Åndings in Tables 3‚Äì6 are based on pooling all data on AD Ô¨Ålings

across our four Ô¨Åling countries, it is of interest to see how these eÔ¨Äects hold up for
various subsets of the universe of cases. In particular, we are interested in whether
our Ô¨Åndings hold for Ô¨Ålings outside the steel industry (the steel industry Ô¨Åles a
large fraction of U.S. and Canadian cases). The results are reported in Table 7.
When we exclude steel cases from the data, we Ô¨Ånd that the statistical signiÔ¨Åcance

of the real exchange rate eÔ¨Äects is similar and the economic signiÔ¨Åcance (given by
the magnitude of the IRR in NB regression) is much greater. The real GDP growth

                                         24
eÔ¨Äects become insigniÔ¨Åcant (although the point estimates are still negative) when
steel cases are excluded from the data. The impact on exchange rates and GDP
from excluding steel suggests that AD Ô¨Ålings in steel are heavily inÔ¨Çuenced by the

business cycle, but not so much by exchange rates.


Annual Data on Bilateral Filings

In constructing the database with Ô¨Ålings broken down by aÔ¨Äected country, we
lost a relatively small number of observations due to the inability to construct
real exchange rates or real GDP growth over the sample period. Most of the
cases involved countries that were part of the former Soviet Union. Once these

observations were eliminated, we had a panel dataset with 4 Ô¨Åling countries, 48
aÔ¨Äected countries (47 for each Ô¨Åling country), and 19 years (17 for Australia).14
We model the number of cases against an aÔ¨Äected country by a Ô¨Åling country in
each year as a function of the bilateral real exchange rate, Ô¨Åling country real GDP

growth, and aÔ¨Äected country real GDP growth. The advantage of this dataset,
which we believe is substantial, is that the exchange rate and foreign GDP growth
variables are more precisely targeted to match the country named in the Ô¨Ålings.
Following the Ô¨Åndings with aggregate Ô¨Åling data, we apply the negative binomial
regression model to the data.

       The main results are presented in Table 8. These regressions use random eÔ¨Äects
for each Ô¨Åling-aÔ¨Äected country pair. When we estimate a common response to
  14
    There are still a small number of missing observations for certain aÔ¨Äected countries due to
missing GDP data.



                                              25
exchange rates across all Ô¨Åling countries, we Ô¨Ånd the real exchange rate variable
is signiÔ¨Åcant at the 1% level in all models, with an IRR ranging from 3.28 to
3.37. Although the estimated IRR values are somewhat lower than with aggregate

Ô¨Ålings, one must keep in mind that the bilateral exchange rate series are much
more volatile than the trade-weighted exchange rates used in the aggregate Ô¨Ålings
(e.g., the standard deviation tends to be about twice as big).
   The results when we allow for a Ô¨Åling-country speciÔ¨Åc response to the real ex-
change rate with random eÔ¨Äects and real GDP growth are reported in column (4).

We Ô¨Ånd that the real exchange rate impact is signiÔ¨Åcant at the 1% level for Canada
(with an IRR of 2.37), the U.S. (IRR equal to 2.09), the EU (IRR equal to 4.23)
and Australia (IRR equal to 7.80). The increased detail of the observations has
the greatest impact on our results for the EU, which with the aggregate data

showed no indication of increased Ô¨Ålings when the trade weighted real exchange
rate appreciated. In the bilateral data, it is clear that Ô¨Ålings rise systematically
against countries whose real exchange rates have depreciated against the countries
of the EU. The exchange rate impacts are very similar when we allow reporting

country-speciÔ¨Åc real GDP growth eÔ¨Äects (column 5). It is worth noting that
the country that has Ô¨Åled the most AD cases, Australia, also has the greatest
estimated increase in Ô¨Ålings in response to a currency appreciation.
   In the bilateral Ô¨Ålings database, it is also apparent that Ô¨Åling country real
GDP growth is negatively and signiÔ¨Åcantly related to the number of Ô¨Ålings. In

the model with random eÔ¨Äects and a common real exchange rate response in
column (2), we Ô¨Ånd that a one percentage-point increase in Ô¨Åling country three-

                                        26
year real GDP growth leads to a 3% decrease in the number of Ô¨Ålings (i.e., the
IRR is 0.97). Adding real GDP growth of the aÔ¨Äected countries in column (3)
does not aÔ¨Äect this estimate. AÔ¨Äected country real GDP growth now appears to

be unrelated to the number of Ô¨Ålings. The IRR estimates are very close to 1.00
and are never close to being statistically signiÔ¨Åcant. This change in the impact of
reporting country and aÔ¨Äected country real GDP growth on the number of Ô¨Ålings
is the main diÔ¨Äerence from the results obtained with the aggregate Ô¨Ålings data.
It appears that domestic, but not foreign, recessions systematically provoke more

Ô¨Ålings.
   In terms of the economic signiÔ¨Åcance of the macro factors in the bilateral
Ô¨Ålings data, we Ô¨Ånd that for the speciÔ¨Åcations in columns (1) and (2) of Table 8,
a one-standard deviation real appreciation of the domestic currency leads to a

33% increase in Ô¨Ålings, while a two-standard deviation real appreciation results
in a 77% increase. In column (2), the estimated real GDP impact implies that a
one standard deviation reduction in real GDP growth leads to a 23% increase in
Ô¨Ålings. Based on these estimates, we conclude that both variables are economically

signiÔ¨Åcant in explaining the pattern of Ô¨Ålings across countries and over time, and
that real exchange rates are somewhat more important.
   The more robust link between Ô¨Ålings and macro factors (especially for Ô¨Åling-
country speciÔ¨Åc responses to exchange rates) in the bilateral data is no doubt
attributable to the increased number of observations and the reduction in noise

associated with the real exchange rate. The latter results from the fact that the
real exchange rate is matched to a speciÔ¨Åc aÔ¨Äected country, rather than being

                                        27
a trade-weighted average rate as it was for the regressions based on aggregate
Ô¨Ålings. This appears to be a case where aggregation over the aÔ¨Äected countries
and studying total Ô¨Ålings in relation to a trade-weighted exchange rate obscures

some interesting information. We place more faith in the bilateral results.


5. Conclusion

Antidumping suits have become an increasingly popular form of protection for
Ô¨Årms engaged in international markets. This paper has examined how macroeco-
nomic factors in general and the real exchange rate in particular, can inÔ¨Çuence
the probability of aÔ¨Érmative Ô¨Åndings for the LTFV and material injury criteria.

Using a duopoly model of trade we Ô¨Ånd that changes in the real exchange rate
have oÔ¨Äsetting eÔ¨Äects on the dumping determinations. A real currency appreci-
ation (depreciation) increases (decreases) the likelihood of injury and decreases
(increases) the likelihood of LTFV. Ultimately, which eÔ¨Äect is more important in

driving AD Ô¨Ålings is an empirical matter.
   Our empirical work uses data on AD Ô¨Ålings from Australia, Canada, the Euro-
pean Union, and the United States. We Ô¨Ånd that a real appreciation of the Ô¨Åling
country‚Äôs currency will lead to a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in AD Ô¨Ålings. This result is at

odds with existing research on the subject, but is robust to the method of estima-
tion, to the inclusion of other macroeconomic variables such as real GDP growth,
and to the elimination of steel cases in the Ô¨Åling data. The results are strongest
when we examine bilateral Ô¨Ålings. The economic signiÔ¨Åcance is substantial‚Äîa one



                                         28
(two) standard deviation real appreciation of the Ô¨Åling country currency leads to
a 33% (77%) increase in AD Ô¨Ålings in our speciÔ¨Åcation that contrains the response
to be common across Ô¨Åling countries. We also Ô¨Ånd that a one standard deviation

fall in domestic real GDP growth leads to a 23% increase in AD Ô¨Ålings.
   The link between real exchange rates and Ô¨Ålings suggests that either foreign
Ô¨Årms are being held responsible for factors outside of their control or that foreign
Ô¨Årms behave in a ‚Äúpredatory‚Äù manner when conditions favor them most. Given the
Ô¨Åndings of other related literature (Boltuck and Litan, 1991) we are more inclined

to believe the former hypothesis, which casts further doubt on the fairness of AD
law.
