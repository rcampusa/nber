Wages and Employment: The Canonical Model Revisited

                                           ABSTRACT

The basic canonical model fails to predict the aggregate college premium outside of the original
sample period (1963-1987) or to account for the observed deviations in college premia for
younger vs. older workers. This paper documents that these failings are due to mis-measurement
of the relevant prices and quantities when using composition adjustment methods to construct
relative skill prices and supplies, which ignore cohort effects that are particularly important in the
1980s and 1990s. Re-estimating the model with prices and quantities that incorporate cohort
effects produces a good fit for the out of sample prediction and explains the observed deviation in
the college premium for younger vs. older workers even with perfect substitutability across age.
Moreover, the estimated elasticity of substitution between high and low skill is higher and there is
a much smaller role for skill-biased technical change in explaining the path of the college wage
premium. The elasticity of substitution is also an important parameter for the broader literature on
education and wages, especially in assessing general equilibrium responses to government
policies. In the case of a tuition subsidy, price responses can undo most of the direct (partial
equilibrium) effect of the subsidy on enrolment, so that general equilibrium enrolment responses
are substantially weaker. The higher elasticity estimated in this paper, produces much weaker
general equilibrium relative price changes and stronger enrolment effects.

1    Introduction

A simple supply-demand framework has formed the basis of a large body of research on the deter-
minants of wages and employment in the post-war US economy. The basic framework, used most
notably in Katz and Murphy (1992) and termed the “canonical model” in Acemoglu and Autor
(2011), considers two broad types of skills – low (i.e. high school) and high (i.e. college) skill – in
which relative prices (and quantities) of the skills are determined in equilibrium. The primary aim
of this literature has been to understand the extent to which supply and demand factors, especially
technological changes, have influenced the evolution of the “skill premium”, motivated in large part
by the dramatic rise in wages among skilled relative to unskilled workers over a sustained period of
increases in the supply of skilled labor.
    Two features of aggregate productivity play leading roles in the canonical supply-demand frame-
work: the productivity of skilled relative to unskilled workers and the substitutability between
skilled and unskilled labor inputs. The literature on skill-biased technological change (SBTC) em-
phasizes the evolution of relative productivity levels (Katz and Murphy (1992), Heckman, Lochner
and Taber (1998), Katz and Autor (1999) , Card and Lemieux (2001), Autor, Katz and Kearney
(2008), Acemoglu and Autor (2011)), while the literature studying the general equilibrium effects
of government policy relies heavily on the elasticity of substitution (Heckman, Lochner and Taber
(1998a), Heckman, Lochner and Taber (1998b), Abbott, et al (2013), Lee and Wolpin (2006)).
    Estimating these key features of the production technology requires accurate and consistent
measures of relative skill prices and aggregate skill inputs over time. The standard approach employs
a simple composition adjustment to account for changes in the composition of each broad skill type
(high vs. low) based on such observable characteristics as educational attainment, age or experience,
and gender; however, it does not account for changes in the productivity of workers within each of
these narrow categories. That is, it assumes that a 30-35 year-old male college graduate in 2000
provides the same effective skilled labor input as his counterpart from 1970, effectively ignoring any
changes in the selection of individuals into college or advances in the production of human capital
over time. As demonstrated in Bowlus and Robinson (2012), this assumption is unlikely to be true,
leading to gross mis-measurement of the time trends of relative skill prices and labor inputs.
    This paper builds on the approach of Bowlus and Robinson (2012) and Heckman, Lochner and
Taber (1998) to better measure the evolution of relative skill prices and inputs when the skill levels


                                                  2
of workers are changing across cohorts. Using these improved measures, this paper re-estimates
the canonical model, providing new estimates of SBTC and the elasticity of substitution across
skilled and unskilled labor. Interestingly, this more general measurement approach helps resolve a
number of puzzles raised in previous studies (Card and Lemieux (2001, Acemoglu and Autor (2011))
regarding the canonical model and its predictions, lending greater legitimacy to the simple supply-
demand framework favored by much of the literature. The new estimates of technological change
suggest a more muted role for SBTC than previous estimates of the same canonical model based
on composition adjusted wage and skill measures that neglect cohort effects.1 Our estimates of the
elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor are higher than previous studies (based
on simple composition adjustments) suggesting that equilibrium price changes in response to policy
shifts are likely to be weaker than previously thought.
       As Acemoglu and Autor (2011) note, estimates of the canonical model using composition adjusted
wages and skill supplies (assumed to be exogenously determined by demographic factors) and a linear
trend representing SBTC fits the evolution of the skill premium in the US remarkably well over the
1963-1987 period as studied by Katz and Murphy (1992). These estimates suggest a significant
role for SBTC and a low elasticity of substitution between high school and college labor, σ, that
ranges from 1.4 to 1.8.2 Unfortunately, major problems arise in identifying SBTC-induced demand
changes and the value of σ when the model is estimated over a longer time horizon (using simple
composition adjusted wages and supplies). Examining the performance of the model from 1963 to
2008, Acemoglu and Autor (2011) document poor out of sample predictions when using parameters
estimated on the original Katz and Murphy (1992) period (1963-1987) to predict the college premium
after 1987. They further document wildly varying estimates of σ when the extended period of data
is used. Finally, if a more flexible time trend is used to improve the fit over the full 1963-2008
period and to stabilize estimates of the elasticity of substitution, the implied time path for SBTC is
inconsistent with other direct evidence from, for example, expansions in computer use.
       A further problem with the standard implementation of the canonical model emphasized by
Card and Lemieux (2001) is its failure to explain differences in the paths of skill premia over time
   1
     Card and DiNardo (2002), Eckstein and Nagypal (2004) and Lemieux (2006) raise other concerns about the extent
to which SBTC can explain the broad trends in wage inequality over the past few decades.
   2
     Estimates from this literature suggest a major role for SBTC when estimated directly as linear trend changes in
production function parameters following the approach of Katz and Murphy (1992) or indirectly through capital-skill
complementarity coupled with increases in capital (Krusell, et al (2000)).




                                                         3
for different age groups. In particular, Card and Lemieux (2001) note that the rapid rise in the skill
premium from 1975-1995 was largely confined to younger workers. They address this problem by
disaggregating labor input groups by age and allowing for imperfect substitutability across these age
and skill groups; however, this resolution detracts from the simplicity of the canonical framework.
       The primary contribution of this paper is to show that many of these ‘problems’ with the canonical
model are due to measurement problems and not the underlying economic framework. In particular,
the standard composition adjustment procedure fails to account for important cohort changes in
the skill levels of workers within narrowly defined age-sex-education cells that compose each broad
skill type. The work of Heckman, Lochner and Taber (1998), Carneiro and Lee (2011), Bowlus and
Robinson (2012) and Hendricks and Schoellman (2014) draws attention to the distinction between
relative skill prices and relative wages. Recognizing that human capital investments decline to zero
near the end of workers’ careers, Heckman, Lochner and Taber (1998) show that it is possible to
identify changes in skill prices from changes in wages for older workers. Applying this methodology,
Bowlus and Robinson (2012) (henceforth, BR) show that over the 1963-2008 period, there is a large
difference in the behavior of composition adjusted relative wages and relative skill prices.3
       Using the BR prices and quantities in place of the standard composition adjusted measures,
there is no significant out-of-sample prediction problem when parameters estimated on the 1963-87
period of Katz and Murphy (1992) are used to predict the evolution of relative skill prices over the
following decades (1988-2008). Since composition adjusted relative wages – the conventional skill
premium – remains a measure of great interest, an augmented version of the canonical model with
BR-estimated quantities is developed to explain the path of relative wages in terms of a part due to
changes in relative prices and a part due to changes in relative skill levels (i.e. the amount of human
capital supplied by the typical college graduate relative to the amount supplied by the typical high
school graduate). SBTC is relevant for the first, but not the second. A decomposition shows that
relative price changes and, therefore, SBTC are much less important than suggested by the previous
literature. Furthermore, the difference in relative college and high school skill levels across cohorts
fully explains the observed evolution of relative wages by age, suggesting little need to differentiate
   3
     BR refer to this as the “flat-spot” method. Using estimated price series from this approach, they estimate human
capital profiles that vary substantially across cohorts due to selection in education choice and technological change in
human capital production. Using a very different methodology, Carneiro and Lee (2011) directly estimate selection
effects and find similar variation in ‘quality’ among college graduates from different birth cohorts based on their
enrolment rates.

skill groups further by age as in Card and Lemieux (2001).4
       The elasticity of substitution not only plays an important role in determining the effects of SBTC,
but it is also an important parameter for the broader literature on education and wages, especially
in assessing general equilibrium responses to government policies due to changes in relative skill
prices. For example, the relatively low elasticity of substitution estimated in previous studies of the
canonical model (using composition adjusted prices) implies large skill price responses to any change
in the skill composition of the economy. In the case of a tuition subsidy, these price responses
undo much of the direct (partial equilibrium) effect of the subsidy on enrolment, so that general
equilibrium enrolment responses are substantially weaker (Heckman, Lochner and Taber (1998b)).
By contrast, the higher elasticities obtained when accounting for cohort differences in skill levels
(as estimated by BR) produce much weaker general equilibrium relative price changes and stronger
enrolment effects.
       The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly summarizes the canonical model and
introduces the distinction between relative prices and composition adjusted relative wages. Section
3 contrasts estimates of the canonical model based on skill prices and quantities as derived in BR
with those obtained from the standard composition adjusted wages and quantities as in, e.g., Katz
and Murphy (1992) or Acemoglu and Autor (2011). This section demonstrates that when prices
and quantities that generally account for cohort differences are used, the canonical model with a
linear trend fits the evolution of the skill premium over the entire 1963-2008 period quite well. The
estimates imply a much higher elasticity of substitution and a much smaller role for SBTC.
       Section 4 extends the analysis to the disaggregated canonical model introduced by Card and
Lemieux (2001) to explain the age or experience pattern in relative (composition adjusted) wages.
The results show that when relative quantities for the different experience groups are adjusted to
take into account cohort effects, the qualitative patterns in composition adjusted relative wages
across experience groups can be reproduced, substantially reducing the need to introduce imperfect
substitutability across age or experience groups in the canonical model.
       The use of standard composition adjusted measures results in a much lower value for σ than is
   4
    A comparison of the US, UK and Canada also presents challenges for the canonical model. In particular, Card
and Lemieux (2001) estimate very different trends in SBTC and the elasticity of substitution for Canada compared to
the US and UK, despite the fact that the US and Canadian economies are more economically integrated and similar
than those of the US and UK. Accounting for cohort differences in relative skills, Bowlus, Liu and Robinson (2017)
estimate different relative price and quantity paths for Canada and the US, which helps reconcile this puzzle.

obtained when the measures are corrected for cohort effects. Section 5 provides two examples of the
importance of σ in the context of endogenous relative supplies. First it documents the sensitivity
of SBTC estimates to alternative values for σ within the framework of the canonical model, but
relaxing the assumption of exogenous relative supplies. Second, it contrasts the partial and general
equilibrium effects and shows the sensitivity of the general equilibrium effect to the value of σ.
    Finally, Section 6 provides some conclusions.


2     Estimation of the Canonical Model

In this section, we formally describe the canonical model and the frequently estimated relative wage
(or skill premium) equation, pointing out the important roles played by SBTC and the elasticity of
substitution between skill types. We also discuss the distinction between observed wages and actual
skill prices, and the implications of this distinction and cohort variation in average worker quality
(or human capital) for estimation of the canonical model.

2.1   The Standard Two Skill Type Model

The canonical model assumes competitive labor markets with two imperfectly substitutable skill
types, high and low. The total supplies of aggregate low and high skill inputs to production are,
respectively:
                                                  Z
                                          L =             li ni di
                                                  Zi∈L
                                          H =             hi ni di,
                                                    i∈H

where li (hi ) reflect the efficiency units (or human capital) supplied each hour and ni reflects total
hours worked for worker i ∈ L (∈ H). The aggregate production function is of the CES form:
                                    h      σ−1
                                                         i σ
                                                      σ−1 σ−1
                                 Y = (AL L) σ + (AH H) σ      ,                                      (1)

where AL and AH reflect technology constants that determine the productivity of low and high skill
labor inputs, respectively and σ ≥ 0 reflects the elasticity of substitution between the two skill types.
Factor-augmenting technical change is captured by changes over time in AL and AH .
    The competitive labor market assumption implies that firms will set the value of the marginal

products of L and H equal to the unit wage, or price per efficiency unit of each type of skill:
                                                                                     1

                                                                                i
                                                                                    σ−1       −1
                               = AL σ           (AL L)    σ    + (AH H)    σ              L   σ    = wL         (2)
                         ∂L
                                                                                     1
                         ∂Y           σ−1   h            σ−1              σ−1
                                                                                i
                                                                                    σ−1       −1
                               = AHσ            (AL L)    σ    + (AH H)    σ              H   σ    = wH .       (3)
                         ∂H

As discussed further below, it is important to recognize that these skill prices, wL and wH , differ
from the corresponding hourly wages received by workers given by wL li and wH hi , respectively.
       Combining equations (2) and (3) and taking logs yields the relative demand function:

                               ln(H/L) = (σ − 1)ln(AH /AL ) − σln(wH /wL ).                                     (4)

Relative demand depends on a technology component (σ − 1)ln(AH /AL ), which may evolve over
time due to SBTC, and relative skill prices. The elasticity of substitution determines both the slope
of the demand function, −σ, with respect to relative prices, as well as the importance of changes in
technology.
       Equation (4) may be re-arranged to yield the well-known skill premium equation:

                                                         σ−1              1
                           lnω = ln(wH /wL ) =               ln(AH /AL ) − ln(H/L).                             (5)
                                                          σ               σ

This equation clearly shows that even in an era of secular increases in the supply of skilled labor (i.e.
increases in H/L), the skill premium can increase if relative demand shifts at a faster pace. This is
often characterized as a race between education (supply shifts) and technology (demand shifts).5 As
emphasized in Goldin and Katz (2007) and evident from equation (5), the elasticity of substitution
plays a critical role in this race. The larger is σ the greater the impact of changes in technology
(AH /AL ) on the skill premium, while the opposite is true for changes in relative skill supplies (H/L).
Intuitively, as high and low skilled workers become closer substitutes, the skill premium becomes
less sensitive to any change in relative supplies and more responsive to any SBTC-induced demand
shifts.

2.2       Relative Prices, Relative Wages and Composition Adjustments

The canonical model, encapsulated in equation (5), applies directly to relative skill prices, wH /wL ,
and aggregate relative skill supplies, H/L. However, neither of these are directly observed by re-
   5
    See, for example, Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and Goldin and Katz (2007) who attribute the first use of the phrase
to Tinbergen (1974).


                                                               7
searchers. When there is on-the-job investment of the form discussed in Becker (1964) and Ben-
Porath (1967), it is particularly difficult to separate the price of skill from the individual supply of
human capital since both may change over time. As noted by Heckman, Lochner and Taber (1998)
and BR, this challenge can be overcome by looking at older workers whose skills stop evolving as
they stop investing in their human capital. Changes in skill prices can, therefore, be identified (up
to a scale normalization in one period) from changes in their wages. Aggregate low and high skill
supplies, Lt and Ht , can then be obtained each period by dividing the total low and high wage
bills, WLt = wLt Lt and WHt = wHt Ht by the respective estimated skill prices that period, wLt and
wHt . Our direct approach to estimating equation (5) uses relative skill prices and aggregate supplies
obtained by BR using this procedure.
       This approach to measuring aggregate skill supplies is not typically taken by the literature.6 In-
stead, most previous studies (Katz and Murphy (1992), Katz and Autor (1999), Card and Lemieux
(2001), Autor, Katz and Kearney (2008), Acemoglu and Autor (2011)) employ a composition adjust-
ment approach, which takes into account changes in the composition of the workforce with respect
to age, gender and educational attainment, but implicitly assumes that average human capital levels
for workers in these observable groups do not change over time. Specifically, let ¯ljt (h̄jt ) be the
average level of low (high) skill for all workers i ∈ Lj (i ∈ Hj ) in period t, where Lj (Hj ) reflect
different subsets or cells of workers defined by age, gender and educational attainment (e.g. high
school dropouts and graduates are typically included in L, while workers with some college, college

where njt is the number of person hours in cell j at time t and JL and JH reflect the set of all low

       The njt are directly observed from the hours measures for each cell. However, the ¯lj and h̄j have
to be estimated. In most previous studies using the composition adjustment approach, these are
estimated as follows. First, all worker hours are assigned to cells according to the detailed education
and experience level of the worker, as well as some demographic characteristics, such as male or
female. Second, the cells are assigned to high or low skill, based on the education level for the cell.
Third, for all the cells in each of the high and low groups, the real hourly wage for each cell in the
group, averaged over the full period of the sample, is calculated and a “base” cell for each skill type
is defined (e.g. high school graduates with 1-5 years of experience). Fourth, the relationship between
the quantity of each cell in the high or low group, relative to the base cell for the skill type, is then
estimated by the ratio of the average real hourly wage for each cell relative to the base cell.8
       While the composition adjustment approach accounts for effects on skill supplies as a result of
composition changes (njt ) over time, it does not account for changes over time within cells (¯ljt and
h̄jt ). If cohort effects lead to changes in the average human capital supplied by workers within cells
over time, then the time path of the composition adjusted supplies will not generally be the same
as the time path of the true aggregate skill supplies. Indeed, BR document substantial differences
in the evolution of these composition adjusted measures and true aggregate stocks of skill that take
into account cohort effects, i.e. that do not impose ¯ljt = ¯lj and h̄jt = h̄j .
       To incorporate these differences across cohorts in the canonical model, define the time-varying
constants BLt = Lt /Lct and BHt = Ht /Hct . A normalization is required for comparison of Lt (Ht )
and Lct (Hct ). Let ¯lj and h̄j be the the long run average of the ¯ljt and h̄jt , respectively. With
this normalization, BLt and BHt reflect the (njt weighted) deviations of the ¯ljt and h̄jt from their
long run average over the full data period.9 If, on average across all low (high) skill cells, there was
an increase in the average amount of skill supplied per worker hour, this would be reflected in an
increase in BLt (BHt ) over time.

         Since the total wage bill for a skill type is the product of the skill price and the skill quantity, the
                                               c = W /L = B w

BHt wHt .10 Notice that composition adjusted wages differ from actual skill prices whenever average
human capital levels within different subgroups vary across cohorts.
         Substituting the composition adjusted terms into (5), using BLt and BHt , the skill premium
equation can be re-written in terms of composition adjusted wages and supplies:

where ln(BHt /BLt ) accounts for potential discrepancies between composition adjusted measures and
true measures of skill prices and aggregate supplies. Note that the term ln(BHt /BLt ) plays exactly
the same role in determining the composition adjusted wage premium, lnωc , as the SBTC term,
ln(AHt /ALt ). However, they reflect very different economic forces: the former reflects changes in the
relative human capital per worker of skilled vs. unskilled workers, while the latter reflects changes in
relative demand due to technology shifts in production. That is, the workers of each skill type, but
from different cohorts vary in the amount of efficiency units they supply within a given time period
and a given production function and ln(BHt /BLt ) reflects these cohort effects as the cohort makeup
of the labor force changes over time. In contrast, ln(AHt /ALt ) captures changes in the production
function.
         Most studies do not include the adjustment term ln(BHt /BLt ) in estimating equation (10),
ignoring changes in relative human capital per worker (within age-gender-education groups), and
instead attribute these changes to SBTC. As shown below, average human capital per worker has
increased more for high relative to low skilled workers, causing previous studies to overstate the
importance of SBTC in explaining the skill premium. We refer to equation (10) as the augmented
canonical model.


3         Empirical Implementation of the Canonical Model

Identifying the relative importance of demand and supply shifts in determining the path of the
skill premium is complicated by the fact that, while various measures of the skill premium and
the relative supply variable are available, the variable relevant for demand intercept shifts or SBTC,
    10
     The previous literature typically computes the composition adjusted wages using an alternative procedure to adjust
for composition changes with data restricted to high school graduates and college graduates only. The relative wage
series obtained are similar, as internal consistency requires.


                                                          10
ln(AHt /ALt ), is not. In addition, relative supply may not be exogenous. The most common approach
in the literature assumes exogenous supplies and a parametric time trend for ln(AHt /ALt ), estimating
both SBTC and σ from data on composition adjusted relative wages and skill supplies (Katz and
Murphy (1992), Card and Lemieux (2001), Autor, Katz and Kearney (2008), Acemoglu and Autor
(2011)).11 In practice, these studies typically estimate equation (10) under the implicit assumption
that ln(BHt /BLt ) does not change over time (i.e. there is no cohort variation in average within cell
relative human capital levels).
       If an estimated series for ln(BHt /BLt ) is available, it can be included in equation (10) (i.e. the
augmented canonical model) to account for cohort differences in worker human capital levels. This
model can be estimated with the same composition adjusted relative wage and supply series used in
the standard literature. Assuming exogenous supplies and a parametric time trend for SBTC, both
σ and SBTC effects can be estimated from equation (10). An alternative approach is to estimate
equation (5) directly using estimates of actual skill prices (wLt , wHt ) and supplies (Ht , Lt ), as in
BR, that account for differences in human capital levels (within narrowly defined subgroups) across
cohorts.12 This enables estimation of both demand and supply effects on the evolution of relative
prices, lnωt . If desired, these estimates can then be combined with the path of ln(BHt /BLt ) to
generate relative wage paths, lnωct , which can be decomposed into supply effects, demand effects
(i.e. SBTC), and changes in relative worker quality.

3.1      Data and Construction of the Variables

To estimate the canonical model, we use the same data as BR from the March CPS over earnings
years 1963-2008.13 These data are very similar to those used by Acemoglu and Autor (2011) in their
replication of Katz and Murphy (1992) and in their extension to 2008.
       We follow the literature in defining skill types according to the educational attainment of work-
  11
      The literature has taken two main approaches to modelling supply. One approach assumes only that the observa-
tions are on the demand curve and uses a constant “reasonable” value of σ obtained from “the literature”, together with
observations on ln(H/L) and lnω, to back out the implied SBTC from equation (5) using various sub-periods of the
data (Goldin and Katz (2007), Autor, Levy and Murnane (2003)). Card and DiNardo (2002), noting the tautological
nature of an unrestricted SBTC hypothesis, discuss a third approach that uses a proxy for the unobserved demand
shifts, typically related to computer use. Krusell et al (2000) explore a capital-skill complementarity hypothesis and
measures of capital over time to provide more direct measures of the demand shift.
   12
      Note that this approach would be equivalent to the standard approach using composition adjusted relative wages
and supplies if BHt /BLt were constant over time (normalized to one), since then lnωt = lnωct and ln(Ht /Lt ) =
ln(Hct /Lct ).
   13
      We apply individual year top-code correction factors as in BR.

ers. The literature typically begins with four education groups (high school dropouts, high school
graduates, some college, and college graduates) and collapses them into two broad skill “types”:
the high skilled (i.e. college graduate) type and the low skilled (i.e. high school graduate) type. In
creating aggregate skill supplies, most studies allocate all college graduate cell hours and 50% of
some college cell hours to the high skill type and the remainder to the low skill type. In constructing
relative composition adjusted wages, only college graduate and high school graduate wages are typ-
                          c and w c , respectively.14 We use the definitions specified in Autor, Katz
ically used to calculate wH      L

and Kearney (2008) and used in Acemoglu and Autor (2011) to construct composition adjusted
relative wage ratios, lnωc , and supplies, ln(Hc /Lc ), representative of the literature. As noted earlier,
these measures are not necessarily the same as true relative prices and supplies, lnω and ln(H/L),
if average human capital levels within age-gender-schooling cells have changed.
       Carneiro and Lee (2011), BR, and Hendricks and Schoellman (2014) provide evidence that
ln(BH /BL ) varies over time, especially over the period of the rapidly rising wage premium. Carneiro
and Lee (2011) and Hendricks and Schoellman (2014) attribute this primarily to variation in the
quality of college graduates across birth cohorts linked to their enrolment rates. BR allow for these
selection effects as well as secular changes in human capital production, especially at the college level,
that might reflect advancements in knowledge or education. We construct a series for (BH /BL ) using
a comparison of the quantity ratios, (H/L) and (Hc /Lc ). The ratio (H/L) is obtained by dividing
the ratio of the total wage payments, (WH /WL ), by the price ratio (wH /wL ), estimated using the
BR prices.15 The ratio (Hc /Lc ) is constructed as in Autor, Katz and Kearney (2008).16

3.2      Relative Prices, Wages, and Supplies: 1963-2008

Figure 1 shows the path of relative composition adjusted wages, lnωct , and relative prices, lnωt ,
over the 1963-2008 period. For comparison purposes, the relative price series from BR, lnωt , is

     See Autor, Katz and Kearney (2008) for details.
  15
     BR calculate four price series for four education groups, college graduates, some college, high school graduates and
high school dropouts. To match the approach in Autor, Katz and Kearney (2008) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011)
where only college and high school graduates are used to compute the composition adjusted high and low skill prices,
we use the BR series for college graduates for the high skill price and high school graduates series for the low skill
price.
  16
     The ln(BH /BL ) series can be calculated from a comparison of estimates of the log quantity ratios, ln(H/L) and
ln(Hc /Lc ), or from log price ratios, lnω and lnωc . In theory, these should yield the same values for ln(BH /BL );
                                                                       c       c
however, as noted above, most studies do not obtain estimates of wL      and wH   by dividing total wage payments to low
and high skilled workers by the composition adjusted stocks Lc and Hc . As a result, estimated series for ln(BH /BL ) will
generally differ depending on whether they are obtained from comparing relative composition adjusted wages/prices
or skill supplies. In practice, we find only minor differences.

normalized to the same initial (1963) value as lnωct . The two series show a fall from the early to
mid-1970s to the late 1970s, followed by a strong secular increase up to the late 1990s. Explaining
the turnaround in relative prices/wages in the early 1980s followed by a period of sustained increases
due to supply increases with a simple linear time trend in SBTC is considered a key success of the
canonical model. However, there are major differences between the paths for lnωt and lnωct , with the
difference between these two series reflecting changes in the relative “quality” of college graduates
compared to high school graduates, ln(BHt /BLt ).
   The path of ln(BHt /BLt ) over time is plotted in Figure 2. After the mid-1970s the relative
quality of college graduates compared to high school graduates increases over time. The pattern
of increasing per capita efficiency units for college graduates over this period is consistent with
findings in Carneiro and Lee (2011), BR, and Hendricks and Schoellman (2014). The implied rise in
ln(BHt /BLt ) and modest increase in lnωt suggests that much of the increase in the observed skilled
wage premium is likely due to an increase in the relative quality of skilled workers rather than SBTC.

       The path of ln(BHt /BLt ) also creates a difference in the two measures of estimated relative
supplies: the composition adjusted relative supplies, ln(Hct /Lct ), and ln(Ht /Lt ) obtained by dividing
total relative wage payments by the BR relative price series. These are plotted together in Figure 3.
Both measures show a strong increasing secular trend in the relative supply of skill. In the absence
of demand shifts in favor of high skilled workers, this increased relative supply should have reduced
the relative price ratio, in contrast with both series in Figure 1. The composition adjusted relative
quantity measure, ln(Hct /Lct ), is the same as Figure 2 in Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and shows
a noticeable flattening starting in 1982. Estimated average annual growth in ln(Hct /Lct ) declines
from 4.37% over 1963-1982 to only 1.91% from 1982 to 2008.17 The BR ratios, ln(Ht /Lt ), show
much less flattening in the early 1980s due to the increased relative per capita efficiency units for
college graduates, ln(BHt /BLt ).
  17
    Card and DiNardo (2002) note that relative supply grew at a roughly constant annual rate of about 4.5% from
1967 to 1982, dropping to a much lower rate of about 2.0% from 1982-2000. They also report that a regression of the
supply index on a linear trend and a post-1982 linear trend interaction has a R2 of 0.997.

3.3   Estimates from Parametric Canonical Models

Figure 3 shows that the estimated skill ratio has increased substantially. This should have reduced
the skill premium, but obviously did not as seen in Figure 1. The canonical framework accounts for
the simultaneous increase in relative skill prices/wages and supplies by introducing SBTC through
time-varying relative productivity constants ln(AH /AL ). Empirically, the increased demand through
SBTC must dominate the effects of rising relative skill supply.
   An assumption must be made regarding the time trend for ln(AH /AL ), since the technol-
ogy coefficients are not directly observed. Furthermore, it is not possible to simultaneously esti-
mate the elasticity of substitution σ and to allow completely unrestricted year-to-year variation in
ln(AH /AL ). The simplest assumption, Katz and Murphy (1992), is that SBTC follows a linear
trend: ln(AHt /ALt ) = γ0 + γ1 t. This linear trend specification and the assumption that relative hu-
man capital levels do not change within cells (i.e. ln(BHt /BLt ) = 0) yields the standard estimating

                                lnωct =       γ0 +     γ1 t − ln(Hct /Lct ).                                  (11)

       Replicating Katz and Murphy (1992) for the 1963-1987 period, Acemoglu and Autor (2011)
obtain the result:
                                   lnωct = α + 0.027t − 0.612ln(Hct /Lct ).

This simple specification captures the sharp reversal of the trajectory in relative log wages coinciding
with the deceleration in the growth of relative skill supply in the late 1970s. The implied elasticity of
                        1
substitution is σ =   .612   ' 1.634. SBTC increases the skilled wage premium by 2.7% per year. Table
1 reports estimation results using our data set that are analogous to those of Acemoglu and Autor
(2011) and Katz and Murphy (1992), including the former’s extension through 2008.18 Comparing
columns 1 and 3 shows the marked difference in estimates for the elasticity of substitution and for
the time trend using the extended period compared to the original Katz and Murphy (1992) period
of 1963-1987. This is consistent with a poor out-of-sample fit using the parameters estimated on
the original period to predict relative wage changes after 1987. Figure 4 shows this problem as
highlighted in Autor, Katz and Kearney (2008). The prediction systematically deviates from the
data, with a much larger predicted increase in relative wages after 1987 than actually occurs in the
data.
       Inspection of columns 1 and 3 in Table 1 shows that a linear time trend imposed over the full
period results in a much higher estimated elasticity of substitution (2.955 vs. 1.598) and a much
weaker SBTC time trend (1.64% vs. 2.74%). Autor, Katz and Kearney (2008) and Acemoglu and
Autor (2011) explore more flexible specifications for SBTC to see whether they are better able to fit
the data over the entire time period while producing reasonable estimates for σ. Columns 4 and 5
show identical results using our data. Column 4 allows for a break in the time trend at 1992, while
column 5 allows for a more flexible (cubic) time trend throughout the period. These specifications
produce a relatively stable elasticity of substitution, but the estimated time trends for SBTC imply
that the relative demand for high skill workers decelerated in the 1990’s, which Acemoglu and Autor
(2011, p. 1109) argue “...does not accord with common intuitions regarding the nature or pace of
technological change occurring in this era.”
  18
   We follow the procedure described in Acemoglu and Autor (2011) for construction of the variables and apply their
sample selection criteria. The results reported in Table 1 are almost identical to those in Table 8 of Acemoglu and
Autor (2011).

     Table 1: Canonical Model Estimated Using Composition Adjusted Prices and Quantities



   Estimating both SBTC and σ using aggregate time series variation in relative wages and supplies
is complicated by the absence of a direct measure of SBTC and the consequent identification problem.
The results in column 2 of Table 1 highlight the challenges. Estimating the (linear trend) model
on the post-1987 data yields the wrong sign for σ and no evidence of SBTC. In fact, expanding the
sample to use data from 1980 to 2008 makes things worse, producing a more negative and statistically
significant value for σ. Unless the sample period includes enough pre-1980 data to cover both sides
of the “break” in the trend for relative supplies, the estimate of σ has the wrong sign. Even then,
estimates of σ are highly sensitive to the chosen sample period. Columns 4 and 5 fit the data over
the full 1963-2008 period with a low σ and a flexible path for SBTC that is fairly strong over most
of the period.
   We now show that standard estimates of σ and SBTC are quite sensitive to the implicit main-
tained assumption that ln(BHt /BLt ) is constant over time. This assumption can be relaxed, obtain-
ing alternative estimates by using lnωt and ln(Ht /Lt ) from BR to directly estimate equation (5)

or by estimating the augmented model with lnωct and ln(Hct /Lct ) while incorporating estimates of
ln(BHt /BLt ) over time as in equation (10). In both cases, parametric assumptions for SBTC can be
made to match the previous literature. For example, in the simplest case of linear time trends, the
estimating equation for the augmented model is

                           σ−1      σ−1        σ−1                1
                 lnωct =       γ0 +     γ1 t +     ln(BHt /BLt ) − ln(Hct /Lct ).                 (12)
                            σ        σ          σ                 σ

   The results from direct estimation of equation (5) using lnωt and ln(Ht /Lt ) (columns 1-3),
and from estimating the augmented model equation (10) with lnωct and ln(Hct /Lct ) and including
ln(BHt /BLt ) (columns 4-7) are reported in Table 2. Both approaches produce the same pattern of
results. Notably, both produce much higher estimates of σ and weaker demand growth from SBTC.
Incorporating the cohort effects by estimating equation (5) directly, using lnωt and ln(Ht /Lt ) from
BR eliminates problems with the wrong sign for σ in any sub-period (columns 1-3). The point
estimates for σ range from 3.8-5.7 regardless of the sample period. However, the estimate is relatively
imprecise for the post-1987 period. Estimates for σ are roughly double those reported in Table 1,

suggesting much greater substitutability between skill groups than previous estimates suggest. In
addition, the estimated SBTC is substantially smaller than suggested by previous studies (Table 1).
   This pattern is the same when cohort effects are incorporated using the augmented model esti-
mated with composition adjusted wages and supplies, but also including ln(BHt /BLt ). (The aug-
mented model has a restriction that the difference in the estimated coefficients on ln(BHt /BLt ) and
ln(Hct /Lct ) equals 1. This restriction is not rejected using the F-test statistic reported in Table 2,
except for column (5) where a linear time trend is assumed for the full period.)
   Why are the results in Table 2 so different from those reported in Table 1? As shown in Figure 1,
there is much less variation in relative prices, lnωt , than in relative wages, lnωct . The weaker long-
run increase in relative prices – due to improvements in the quality of skilled relative to unskilled
workers as captured by ln(BHt /BLt ) – means less SBTC is needed to explain the time series. A
weaker correlation between deviations from trends in “true” relative prices and supplies compared


                                                          19
to their composition adjusted counterparts is responsible for the larger estimates for σ in Table 2.
Finally, the smaller early-1980’s breaks in trends for both relative prices (Figure 1) and relative
supplies (Figure 3), compared to their composition adjusted counterparts, produces more robust
results across sub-periods when using the former (or when incorporating changes in ln(BHt /BLt ) as
in the augmented model).




                                              Figure 5


   The direct approach models the skill price ratio, lnωt , rather than the wage premium, lnωct .
Figure 5 shows the excellent fit for the direct approach (R2 = 0.97) based on estimates using the
full sample period (Table 2, column 7). The weaker SBTC and higher σ provide a much-improved
out-of-sample fit for the estimated model incorporating cohort effects relative to the basic model.
   Now, consider out-of-sample prediction for the relative wage premium, lnωct . Figure 6 plots the
out-of-sample prediction for the augmented model using estimates from the 1963-1987 period (re-
ported in column 4 of Table 2) along with the out of sample paths for ln(Hct /Lct ) and ln(BHt /BLt ).
Using estimates from the direct approach for 1963-1987 (reported in column 1 of Table 2) to predict
the relative skill price, lnωt , one can add the change in relative human capital levels per worker,


                                                 20
ln(BHt /BLt ), to calculate a predicted relative wage premium, lnωct . This is also plotted in Figure
6. The out-of-sample fit for both models that incorporate cohort effects (with a simple linear trend
for SBTC) is quite good for all but the last few years, in contrast to the poor out-of-sample fit for
the basic model shown in Figure 4.




                                               Figure 6


      One concern with the direct approach is the potential bias introduced from using a regressor,
ln(Ht /Lt ), that is obtained by dividing the ratio of total wage payments by the BR relative price
series, lnωt , which is the dependent variable. As a result, ln(Ht /Lt ) is likely to be correlated with
any measurement error in the BR relative price series. If the measurement error in the BR relative
skill prices is classical, then the estimate of σ will be biased towards 1.19 In fact, the estimates of
σ using the direct approach are quite similar to estimates from the augmented model, and both are
much larger than estimates from the literature that completely ignores cohort differences in relative
human capital levels within subgroups.

4    Is Imperfect Substitutability Across Experience Needed in the
     Canonical Model?

Acemoglu and Autor (2011) argue that the basic canonical model is unable to explain important
differences in the college wage premium by age or experience. In particular, Card and Lemieux
(2001) point out that the rapid increase in the wage premium over the 1980s was almost exclusively
confined to young age groups. Figure 7 plots the log composition adjusted relative wage ratio for
young workers with 2-6 years of experience and older workers with 22-36 years of experience. As
documented by Card and Lemieux (2001) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011), there is a very strong
(more than 20 log point) increase in the college wage premium for young workers over the 1980s,
while the premium increased very little for older workers.




                                             Figure 7


    Card and Lemieux (2001), therefore, introduced imperfect substitutability across age groups
within the original two broad skill input “types”, estimating both the substitutability across skill
types and across age groups within skill types. Acemoglu and Autor (2011) take a similar approach
in introducing imperfect substitutability across experience groups within skill types. While their


                                                 22
estimated elasticities of substitution across age groups (Card and Lemieux (2001)) or experience
groups (Acemoglu and Autor (2011)) are high, they still help reconcile differences in the wage
premium path by age or experience.
       These studies, like the standard canonical model literature, rely on composition adjusted relative
wages (and supplies), ignoring changes in relative worker quality/human capital over time. Yet, BR
document much larger increases in the relative per worker human capital (high vs. low skill) over
the 1980s for young workers compared to older workers.20 This rapid increase can be explained by
the improvement in quality for college cohorts born over the 1950s (much more than in surrounding
decades) due to a decline in college attendance rates. Consistent with this cohort quality explanation,
the increase in college relative to high school skill levels that first appears for younger workers in
the 1980s was followed roughly two decades later by a similar increase among older workers with
22-36 years of experience. This suggests that the more parsimonious canonical model, with perfect
substitutability across age or experience groups, may provide a good approximation for wage patterns
as long as cohort effects are taken into account. Put another way, the “problem” raised by Card and
Lemieux (2001) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011) may be one of measurement more than a failure of
the basic canonical model.21
       To formalize this, it is useful to incorporate cohort effects disaggregated by age or experience
groups, j = 1, 2, .., J, into our framework. Replace the aggregate BLt and BHt terms of Section 3
with disaggregated BLjt and BHjt terms, where Ljt = njt ¯ljt , Lcjt = njt ¯lj , etc., and BLjt = Ljt /Lcjt
and BHjt = Hjt /Hcjt .22 Composition adjusted wages for each experience group j are given by
 c
wLjt                  c
     = BLjt wLjt and wHjt = BHjt wHjt , so:

                                           lnωcjt = lnωjt + ln(BHjt /BLjt ).                                              (13)

Even with perfect substitutability across experience groups, the time path of the wage premia may
differ by experience group because of the ln(BHjt /BLjt ) terms.23
  20
     Also, see Heckman, Lochner and Taber (1998) for a similar point. They also emphasize the importance of adjust-
ments in on-the-job human capital investment as a source of substantial wage fluctuations among younger workers.
  21
     Carniero and Lee (2011) make a similar point. Accounting for cohort differences based solely on selection of ability
among college students, they estimate an elasticity of substitution across age groups of roughly 10, much higher than
the values estimated by Card and Lemieux (2001) and Accemoglu and Autor (2011).
  22
     The BLjt and BHjt are the experience dis-aggregated components of the aggregate cohort effects represented by
BLt and BHt , respectively, in Section 3. Ljt = njt (¯     d
                                                     lj + ljt                 d
                                                              ) = Lcjt + njt ljt                              d
                                                                                 and BLjt = 1 + (1/Lcjt )njt ljt         d
                                                                                                                 . When ljt = 0,
BLjt = 1.
  23
     These cohort effects may be introduced into the basic canonical model with imperfect substitutability by age (Card
and Lemieux (2001)) or experience (Acemoglu and Autor (2011)) by incorporating the disaggregated BLjt and BHjt
terms to create an augmented imperfect substitutability model. See the Appendix for more details.


                                                              23

   The disaggregated (BHjt /BLjt ) can be constructed analogously to the aggregate (BHt /BLt ) se-
ries in Section 3.1 using a comparison of the quantity ratios (Hjt /Ljt ) and (Hcjt /Lcjt ). The ratio
(Hcjt /Lcjt ) is constructed as in Acemoglu and Autor (2011). The (Hjt /Ljt ) are obtained by dividing
the ratio of the total wage payments (WHjt /WLjt ) by the price ratio (wht /wLt ), where the skill prices
are, as above, estimated from the wage changes of older workers (see Section 2.2). This implicitly
assumes perfect substitutability across experience groups. Using these series, the derived paths for
ln(BHjt /BLjt ) show the expected qualitative differences by experience group. That is, a common
price across experience groups for a given skill type produces series for ln(BHjt /BLjt ) that are con-
sistent with the evolution of college relative to high school worker quality as documented in BR and
Carneiro and Lee (2011). See Figure 8, which plots ln(BHjt /BLjt ) for three experience groups: 2-6
years, 7-21 years and 22-36 years. There is a much larger increase for the youngest relative to the
oldest group over the 1980s, precisely when relative wages increased sharply for the younger but not
the older group (Figure 7).
   The younger group in Figure 8 (and Figure 7) in 1975 corresponds to 1945-1949 birth cohorts.



                                                   24
These cohorts have the largest fraction of college graduates, suggesting strong negative selection
effects on their per capita human capital.24 However, subsequent cohorts of college graduates im-
prove as college enrolment rates decline (about 5 percentage points between 1950 and 1960 cohorts
according to BR), implying increasingly positive selection (BR, Carneiro and Lee 2011). BR argue
that there were also secular improvements in the production of human capital among the more recent
cohorts. Altogether, they estimate an 11% upward shift in the life-cycle human capital profile for
college graduates between the 1949 and 1961 birth cohorts, much more than observed for cohorts
born during the decades before or after.
         Figure 8 further shows the increase in relative skill levels ln(BHjt /BLjt ) over the 1950-1960 birth
cohorts advance through the different experience groups as these cohorts age. The sharp increase in
relative skill quality appears first for the youngest and least experienced workers in the late 1970s
and 1980s, followed shortly by an increase among workers with 7-21 years of experience and finally
by workers with 22-36 years of experience beginning in the late 1990s. Properly measuring relative
skill prices by accounting for these cohort effects resolves much of the “puzzle” regarding differential
college wage premiums by age or experience.


5         The Importance of the Elasticity of Substitution: Endogenizing
          the Supply Response in the Canonical Model

The elasticity of substitution, σ, and SBTC are the basic parameters of the canonical model. The
results presented in Sections 3 and 4 suggest that the use of composition adjusted measures for the
relative skill prices and quantities in the usual implementation of the canonical model results in a
much lower value for σ, and a larger importance for SBTC than are obtained when these measures
are corrected for cohort effects. A key secular trend in the US and many other countries over the
last half century has been the increase in the relative supply of high skilled workers, largely through
the increasing education levels. The response to this in the canonical model is governed by σ: a
high value of σ dampens the response of relative wages. More generally, σ is of major importance in
determining the general equilibrium effects of any changes in the economy that affect the incentive
to become a skilled worker through its role in governing the responsiveness of relative wages to
    24
    Using state-level across cohorts, Carneiro and Lee (2011) show that cohorts with more students taking the SAT,
which is strongly correlated with four-year college completion rates, have significantly lower average scores on the test.
Similarly, test scores from the International Adult Literacy Survey among Americans with at least some college were
lower for those from cohorts with higher college attendance rates.



                                                           25
relative supply shifts. This section provides two examples of the importance of σ in the context of
endogenous relative supplies. First we show the sensitivity to alternative estimates of σ within the
framework of the canonical model. Second, we contrast the partial equilibrium effect of an increased
subsidy to attend college that holds relative college and non-college wage rates constant with the
general equilibrium effect that allows a supply response to an endogenized college premium response
and show the sensitivity of the general equilibrium effect to the value of σ.

5.1      SBTC, Relative Skill Supply and the Elasticity of Substitution

Relative demand is given in Equation (4) and SBTC shifts the intercept in this relative demand,
                                                                                              σ−1
(σ − 1)ln(AH /AL ). This affects the skill premium, by shifting the intercept,                 σ ln(AH /AL ),    in the
skill premium Equation (5). Given σ, these two intercepts are proportional over time, where the
factor of proportionality for the premium intercept relative to the demand intercept is (1/σ).
       The overall path for relative wages, lnωct , can be decomposed into the path for relative prices,
lnωt , and the path for relative per capita college graduate quality (or human capital), ln(BHt /BLt ),
reflecting the overall cohort effects on the relative skill supply in any year. The path for relative
prices, lnωt , is a net demand-supply effect determined by the “race” between relative supply growth
and SBTC, resulting in a positive net demand-supply effect if SBTC dominates. Altogether, the
wage premium decomposition can be written as:
                                                                                     

         lnωct = lnωt + ln(BHt /BLt ) =                                             /B ) .
                                                                                  {z Lt}

                                                                         

       The decomposition of the relative wage premium, lnωct , into the path of the net demand-supply
effect (i.e. relative prices, lnωt ) and the path of relative quality of the two skill types, ln(BHt /BLt ),
does not depend on the estimate of σ.25 However, the further decomposition of the path of the net
demand-supply effect reflected in the relative prices into the path of the (positive) demand (SBTC)
effects, ( σ−1                                                      1
            σ ln(AHt /ALt )), and the (negative) supply effects, (− σ ln(Ht /Lt )), does depend on σ. We
  25
     It just requires an estimate of ln(BHt /BLt ) and the composition adjusted wage premium, lnωct . Figure 2 in
Section 3 plotted the series for ln(BHt /BLt ) showing an important role for cohort effects in increasing the relative
quality of the high skill type. The relative quality and net demand-supply components of lnωct are plotted together
in the left panel of Figure A1. The large increase in the wage premium over the 1980-2000 period is driven in part by
a sustained relative price increase over that period, but mainly by cohort effects that increased the relative per capita
college graduate quality. The relative skill price declined from the late 1990s so that over the period as a whole the
change in relative wages is driven largely by cohort effects reflected in the path of ln(BHt /BLt ).



                                                           26

consider the sensitivity of the estimated effects of SBTC on the wage premium to alternative assumed
values for a constant σ obtained from estimates with and without cohort effects. Figure 9 contrasts
the path of the implied SBTC effect (the first term in the square bracket in equation (14)) under
the assumption of σ = 4.868 from the augmented model that accounts for cohort effects, with the
path of the implied SBTC effects under the alternative assumption of σ = 1.789 from the standard
model that excludes cohort effects, reported in column (5) in Table 1. Both series are normalized to
zero in 1963.
   Unlike Tables 1 and 2, Figure 9 imposes no functional form on the estimates of SBTC and takes
the value of σ as given. However, Figure 9 shows, as expected from the parametric results in Tables
1 and 2, a much smaller role for SBTC using the higher value for σ. Over the full period, less than
one percent a year of SBTC is required to offset the negative relative supply effect, since the effects
of relative supply changes are muted when the elasticity of substitution is high.

5.2     The Elasticity of Substitution and General Equilibrium Effects of Education
        Policy

Education policy can influence college attendance decisions in a variety of ways. This section con-
siders policies equivalent to reductions in tuition, examining the partial and general equilibrium
impacts of those policies with an emphasis on the importance of σ for the latter. In principle, the
same analysis applies to the effects of any changes that reduce the costs of going to college and
increase the relative skill supply.

5.2.1    College Attendance Decisions and the Human Capital Stocks

Consider a standard lifecycle schooling choice model in which individuals choose whether to attend
college with the objective of maximizing lifetime earnings (net of schooling costs). Individuals face
two options at age 18: (i) work and receive earnings corresponding to the low skill (high school)
human capital or (ii) go to college for four years and then work and receive earnings corresponding
to the high skill (college) human capital. As in the canonical model of Section 2, there are only two
skills. Using the notation of Section 2, the present value of low skill earnings associated with high
school is given by:
                                                    JL
                                                    X
                                      P VE (hs) =         R−j wL lj = wL θL ,
                                                    j=0

where JL represents the number of years since leaving school (i.e. experience) to retirement for low
skill workers, lj is the individual’s low skill human capital at experience j, wL is the price of low skill
human capital, R = (1 + r) is the gross interest rate, and θL ≡ Jj=0
                                                                     P L −j
                                                                           R lj . Similarly, the present
value of high skill earnings associated with college are given by:
                                                JH
                                                X
                                P VE (coll) =         R−(j+4) wH hj = wH θH ,
                                                j=0

where JH represents the number of years of experience to retirement for high skill (college) workers,
hj is the high skill human capital of the college graduate at experience j, wH is the price of high
skill human capital, and θH ≡ Jj=0
                              P H −(j+4)
                                     R       hj .
   In order to attend college, individuals must incur idiosyncratic costs. To simplify some of the
expressions, represent the annual costs for individual i at j as a share cji of lifetime low-skill earnings:




                                                          28
Cji = wL θL cji .26 The present value of these costs is:
                                                       3
                                                       X
                                                Ci ≡         R−j Cji = wL θL φi ,
                                                       j=0
                 P3         −j c .
where φi =          j=0 R       ji   There is also a (common) subsidy for attending college with present value:
                                                       3
                                                       X
                                                 S≡          R−j Sj = swL θL ,
                                                       j=0

where s is the subsidy rate expressed as a fraction of low skill earnings.
       Assuming individuals are lifetime income maximizers who can freely borrow and lend, individual
i enrols in college if and only if

                                             P VE (coll) − Ci + S ≥ P VE (hs)

or equivalently, if and only if:
                                                       φi ≤ s + ωθ − 1,
                 θH
where θ ≡        θL ,   and ω, as before, is the relative skill price, wH /wL . Assuming the density for the
college cost parameter φi is given by F (φ) (with pdf f (φ)), the fraction of individuals choosing
college in any cohort is
                                                 E(s, ω) = F (s + ωθ − 1).

As discussed further below, the college enrolment rate, E(s, ω), is increasing in the subsidy rate, s,
and in the relative skill price, ω.
       Assuming all cohorts have a mass of n and that individuals work for J = JL = JH years regardless
of their schooling, the steady state stocks of high and low skill human capital are given by:
                             J
                             X                                                      J
                                                                                    X
                    L=n            lj [1 − F (s + ωθ − 1)]       and       H=n            hj F (s + ωθ − 1).        (15)
                             j=0                                                    j=0


5.2.2       Partial and General Equilibrium Response to Policy Changes

Now consider a policy change to increase college enrolment by increasing the subsidy rate, s. The
partial equilibrium response in the enrolment rate ignores any changes in the relative skill price, ω,
and is given by
                                                      ∂E(s, ω)
                                            ∆Ps E ≡            = f (s + ωθ − 1).
                                                        ∂s
  26
       Similar results are obtained if direct costs of college are proportional to the price of high skill labor.


                                                                29
This response would accurately measure the changes in enrolment for a small (random) subpopulation
targeted by an increased subsidy rate. However, it does not reflect the total enrolment response for
a policy administered to the full population. In the latter case, changes in enrolment rates (and,
consequently, aggregate skill stocks L and H) induced by the policy will lead to general equilibrium
responses in relative skill prices (as discussed in Section 2), which feeds back into the enrolment
decision (Heckman, Lochner and Taber 1998b). Due to the equilibrium relative price changes and
their feedback effects on enrolment choices, the general equilibrium effects of a tuition subsidy policy
will tend to differ from the partial equilibrium responses.
    To characterize the full general equilibrium effect of a subsidy change, it is necessary to first
show how the skill premium varies with the subsidy rate. This is easily done when comparing steady
states. Substituting for the steady state aggregate stocks H and L (see equation (15)) into the
skill premium equation (5) yields the equilibrium log relative skill premium implicitly defined as a
function of s (and other model parameters):
                                                                                                    

             lnω(s) =     ln(AH /AL ) − ln(χH /χL ) − ln                                                 ,   (16)

where χH =        j=0 hj ,   and χL =     j=0 lj .   To simplify some of the expressions below, define τ ≡
(s + ωθ − 1). The marginal effect of a change in s on relative skill prices can be obtained from
implicit differentiation of equation (16) with respect to s:
                                                h                  i
                                                     f (τ )
                                          − σ1 F (τ )(1−F    (τ ))
                              ω 0 (s) =          h                  i ∈ (−θ−1 , 0].                          (17)
                                        1     1       f (τ )
                                        ω + σ F (τ )(1−F (τ )) θ

A larger tuition subsidy raises the college enrolment rate and the stock of high skill relative to
low skill labor, which reduces the skill premium. This reduces the general equilibrium response of
enrolment to a change in the subsidy rate.
    Accounting for the relative skill price response, the full (steady state) general equilibrium response
to an increase in s is given by

                                      dE(s, ω(s))
                              ∆GE
                               s  ≡               = f (τ )[1 + ω 0 (s)θ] ∈ (0, f (τ )].
                                          ds

The potential reduction in the earnings of high skill relative to low skill labor, −1 < ω 0 (s)θ ≤ 0 (from
equation (17), determines the magnitude of the general equilibrium offset to the partial equilibrium
effect. Notably, 0 < ∆GE
                      s  ≤ ∆Ps E .

5.2.3      The Importance of σ for General Equilibrium Responses

The magnitude of the general equilibrium response relative to the partial equilibrium response de-
pends critically on the elasticity of substitution between high skill and low skill labor, σ. To see
this, take the ratio of the steady state general equilibrium effect to the partial equilibrium effect,
substituting for ω 0 (s) from equation (17):

                                       ∆GE
                                        s                         1
                                             =                                           .          (18)
                                       ∆Ps E
                                                         h                      i
                                                     1             f (τ )
                                               1+    σ       F (τ )(1−F (τ ))       ωθ

Based on this expression and rough estimates of ωθ, f (τ ) and F (τ ) from the literature, we next
show that our estimated values for σ lead to much larger general equilibrium enrolment responses
to a tuition subsidy than would be predicted from previous estimates of σ.
      Avery and Turner (2012) use the CPS to calculate the discounted present value of average
earnings for high school and college graduates in the US. Their estimates for the 1980s-1990s suggest
that college men earn around $1.2 million over their careers, compared to $0.8 million for male high
school graduates. This suggests that ωθ ≈ 1.5. The estimated response of college enrolment rates
to changes in annual tuition/subsidies can be used to determine f (τ ). Within the framework of this
section, the partial equilibrium response to a discrete change in subsidies from s to s0 is:

                  P r(CollegeAttendance|s) − P r(CollegeAttendance|s0 ) ≈ f (τ )[s0 − s].

Most of the literature suggests that a $1, 000 reduction in annual tuition would increase attendance
rates in the range of 0.01-0.05.27 Since s is the subsidy rate expressed as fraction of wL θL ≈
$800, 000, a $1, 000 change in the annual subsidy is equivalent to a change in s (i.e. s0 − s) of roughly
4 × $1, 000/$800, 000 = .005. Assuming a change in the probability of attendance of 0.02, this
                      .02
suggests f (τ ) ≈    .005   = 4. Finally, Bailey and Dynarski (2011) show that approximately 60% of
cohorts born from 1970 to 1990 had completed at least some college. So we set F (τ ) ≈ 0.6.
      Implementation of the canonical model using the standard composition adjusted relative prices
and quantities yields estimates of σ around 1.5 - 1.8 (Table 1). Taking an intermediate value of
σ = 1.6 and using our back-of-the envelope calculations for ωθ, f (τ ) and F (τ ) in equation (18)
yields
                                                 ∆GE
                                                  s
                                                       = 0.060.

    As discussed in Section 3, estimates of σ based on the BR relative prices and quantities are
at least double those of the previous literature (compare estimates in Tables 1 and 2). Using the
smallest estimate of σ = 3.2 from Table 2 yields

                                                    ∆GE
                                                     s
                                                          = 0.110,
                                                    ∆Ps E

while a mid-range estimate of σ = 4 yields

                                                    ∆GE
                                                     s
                                                          = 0.138.
                                                    ∆Ps E

    While the direct effect of the subsidy on enrolment is important, the elasticity of substitution
is also a major determinant of the full general equilibrium response.28 A high elasticity implies
a weaker supply response to policy, which results in smaller price adjustments and more similar
general and partial equilibrium enrolment responses. In light of this, it is not surprising that the
much higher elasticity obtained when accounting for cohort differences in skill levels (as estimated in
this paper) produces general equilibrium enrolment effects that are roughly twice as large as those
implied by previous estimates.


6     Conclusion

The standard implementation of the canonical model of wages and employment uses composition
adjustment to construct “unit” wages and employment for low and high skilled labor. While this
implementation of the model performed well for the 1963-1987 period studied in Katz and Murphy
(1992), subsequent literature has pointed to a failure of the model to predict the aggregate college
premium outside of this sample period or to predict the observed deviations in college premia for
younger vs. older workers. This paper documents that these failings are due to mis-measurement of
the relevant prices and quantities for low and high skill labor when using the standard composition
adjustment methods, which ignore cohort effects that are particularly important in the 1980s and
1990s. Re-estimating the basic canonical model with prices and quantities that incorporate changes
in skill levels across cohorts produces a much better fit for the out of sample prediction (from 1988
   28
      Heckman, Lochner and Taber (1998b) examine partial and general equilibrium responses to a $500 tuition subsidy
financed by higher taxes on earnings. They also allow for heterogeneity in ability and do not link schooling costs
directly to wage rates for high school graduates. While their framework is richer than here, they find a ratio of general
                                                                   ∆GE
                                                                    s
equilibrium to partial equilibrium effects of similar magnitude:   ∆P E   = 0.087.
                                                                    s

onward) and helps explain the observed deviation in the composition adjusted college premium for
younger vs. older workers even with perfect substitutability across age or experience groups.
   An important consequence of accounting for cohort effects is that the model implies a much
higher elasticity of substitution between high and low skill labor than has been found in the standard
literature that relies on composition adjusted measures. This has two significant implications. First,
the higher estimated elasticity results in a much smaller role for SBTC in explaining the path of the
college wage premium. Second, the elasticity of substitution is also an important parameter for the
broader literature on education and wages, especially in assessing general equilibrium responses to
government policies. For example, the relatively low elasticity of substitution estimated in previous
studies of the canonical model implies large skill price responses to any change in the skill composition
of the economy. In the case of a tuition subsidy, these price responses undo most of the direct (partial
equilibrium) effect of the subsidy on enrolment, so that general equilibrium enrolment responses are
substantially weaker (Heckman, Lochner and Taber (1998b)). By contrast, the higher elasticity
obtained when accounting for cohort differences in skill levels, as estimated in this paper, produces
much weaker general equilibrium relative price changes and stronger enrolment effects.

A.1    Measurement Error

Suppose the relative price in BR is measured with error such that:

                                                 lnω m = lnω + 

Since the relative skill quantity, ln(H/L), is obtained by dividing the total wage payment to H
relative to the total wage payment to L by the relative price, the log relative skill quantity will also
be measured with the same error, but opposite in sign:

                                            ln(H/L)m = ln(H/L) − 

This implies that estimating equation (5) is equivalent to estimating the model:

                                       lnω m = α + βln(H/L)m + (1 + β)

            σ−1
where α =    σ ln(AH /AL ),     β = − σ1 and (1 + β) is (part of) the error term. Unless σ = 1, classical
measurement error for  will bias σ towards 1, since plimβ̂ is a weighted average of β and −1:

                                           plimβ̂ = θβ + (1 − θ)(−1),

                V ar(ln(H/L))
where θ =   V ar(ln(H/L))+V ar() .   As V ar() → 0, plimβ̂ → β.

A.2    Incorporating Imperfect Substitution in the Canonical Model

Imperfect substitution across experience is incorporated into the basic canonical model by Acemoglu
and Autor (2011), analogously to the introduction of imperfect substitutability across age groups by
Card and Lemieux (2001), by redefining the low (L) and high (H) type inputs as composites given
by:
                                                                  σE
                                              J                     (σE −1)
                                             X            (σE −1)
                                         L=    (αLj Lj )   σE                                      (19)
                                                j=1

and                                                              σE
                                             J                     (σE −1)

where Lj and Hj reflect the supplies of low and high skill, respectively, for experience group j, and
σE is the partial elasticity of substitution across experience groups within skill type. The different
αLj and αHj reflect the different relative amounts of low and high skill for each experience group.
   As shown in Card and Lemieux (2001), in this case the log skill premium can be written as:

           σ−1              1          σE − 1                   1
  lnωj =       ln(AH /AL ) − ln(H/L) +        ln (αHj /αLj ) −    [ln(Hj /Lj ) − ln(H/L)],       (21)

where the coefficient on the log ratio of the aggregated supplies, ln(H/L), provides an estimate of   σ

(elasticity of substitution between skill composites L and H) and the coefficient on the deviation of
the experience group specific supplies from the aggregated supplies, [ln(Hj /Lj ) − ln(H/L)], provides
                   1
an estimate of    σE   (elasticity of substitution between experience groups).
   To incorporate the experience-specific cohort effects in the disaggregated canonical model, re-
write Equations (19) and (20) that incorporate these cohort effects as:
                                                               σE

   Composition adjusted wages for each experience group j are given by wLj   Lj j cj  Lj Lj
     c = w H /H = B w . Substituting these into equation (21), the augmented canonical
and wHj   Hj j cj  Hj Hj

model with imperfect substitutability across age or experience groups for the college wage premium
is then:
