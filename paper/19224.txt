Nudging Energy Efficiency Behavior: The Role of Information Labels

                                               ABSTRACT

We evaluate the effectiveness of energy efficiency labeling in guiding household decisions. Using
a carefully designed choice experiment with alternative labels, we disentangle the relative importance
of different types of information and intertemporal behavior (i.e., discounting) in guiding energy efficiency
behavior. We find that simple information on the economic value of saving energy was the most important
element guiding more cost-efficient investments in energy efficiency, with information on physical
energy use and carbon emissions having additional but lesser importance. The degree to which the
current EnergyGuide label guided cost-efficient decisions depends importantly on the discount rate
assumed. Using individual discount rates separately elicited in our study, we find that the current EnergyGuide
label came very close to guiding cost-efficient decisions, on average. However, using a uniform five
percent discount rate—which was much lower than the average elicited rate—the EnergyGuide label
led to choices that result in a one-third undervaluation of energy efficiency. We find that labels that
also endorsed a model (with Energy Star) or gave a suggestive grade to a model (EU-style label), encouraged
substantially higher energy efficiency. Our results reinforce the centrality of views on intertemporal
choice and discounting, both in terms of understanding individual behavior and in guiding policy.

1. Introduction

        Many information programs are in place to guide energy consumption decisions by firms
and households, including product labeling, energy audits, voluntary public–private partnerships,
mailings, internet-based information, and other methods. Notwithstanding their differences, these
programs all intend to improve energy efficiency choices by firms and households. With limited
or otherwise imperfect information about the potential benefits and costs of energy-efficient
choices, households may not be eager to opt for products that are more energy efficient but also
more costly at the time of purchase. Information programs seek to address impediments to
economically efficient consumer and firm decisionmaking by providing understandable
information and assisting in the weighing energy cost savings against higher capital cost.

        Despite the central role that information programs play in existing and proposed energy
efficiency policy portfolios, surprisingly little is known about how consumers and firms respond
to such programs. Although a reasonably large literature surveys various potential market
failures in energy efficiency investment, 1 few analyses have focused specifically on information
programs, partly because of inadequate data. Energy efficiency labeling is a particularly
prominent program in this context. For example, the major household appliances sold in the
United States must include the EnergyGuide label to describe their estimated annual energy
usage and operation costs. Similar energy efficiency labeling programs, often with alternative
label formats, are widely used worldwide. Moreover, in some cases, multiple differently

structured information programs, such as EnergyGuide and Energy Star in the United States,
address the energy usage of the same appliance.

        As noted by Allcott and Greenstone (2012), however, no large-scale evaluations are
available on the impact of energy efficiency labeling on consumer choices. This is the focus of
our study. We use an experimental approach to evaluate the effectiveness of information
provision through labeling in improving energy efficiency decisions by households. By coupling
a carefully designed choice experiment with information on all of the key elements of
intertemporal energy efficiency choices, we are able to disentangle the role played by (a)
different types of information and (b) intertemporal behavior (i.e., discounting) in guiding energy
efficiency behavior.

        Earlier work has focused on the role of information in energy efficiency decisions by
firms. 2More recently, several studies have investigated the role of inadequate and asymmetric
information, inattention, and other behavioral drivers of the adoption of energy-efficient
appliances and technologies by households. For example, Davis (2010) examines the difference
between rental units and owner-occupied homes and finds that renters are 1 to 10 percentage
points less likely to have Energy Star appliances. Similarly, Gillingham et al. (2012) find that
owner-occupied houses in California are 12 to 20 percent more likely to have insulation than
rental units. Both studies estimate the findings conditional on potentially confounding and
observable characteristics of the property, occupant, and neighborhood.

        In research regarding vehicle fuel efficiency, Allcott (2011a) finds that consumers are
poorly informed about the financial value of fuel efficiency, typically substantially misestimating
the gasoline cost difference between the vehicle they own and other potentially preferred
vehicles. However, the misestimate is not systematically greater than the actual value. One way
to better inform decisions is to use information disclosure programs, such as energy efficiency


2 DeCanio   and Watkins (1998) investigate voluntary participation in the US Environmental Protection Agency’s
Green Lights Program, finding that the characteristics of individual firms influence their decision to participate in
the program. Morgenstern and Al-Jurf (1999) find that information provided through demand-side management
utility programs appears to make a significant contribution to the diffusion of high-efficiency lighting in commercial
buildings. Newell et al. (1999) find that the responsiveness of energy-efficient innovation in home appliances to
energy price changes increased substantially after energy efficiency product labeling was required. Anderson and
Newell (2004) analyze technology adoption decisions of manufacturers in response to free energy audits. They find
that plants respond as expected to financial costs and benefits, though there are unmeasured project-related factors
that also influence investment decisions. Revealed behavior of plants suggests that most require a payback period of
15 months or less as their investment threshold.




                                                          2
labels. Other studies have used structured interviews (Turrentine and Kurani 2007) or laboratory
studies (Larrick and Sol 2008) to assess the role of imperfect information in automobile fuel
economy decisions, finding that consumers are not very adept at the calculations underlying cost-
effective decisions. Larrick and Sol (2008) further find that the form of information provision in
labels could guide people in incorrect directions depending on how they process that
information.

          Sallee (2012) develops a heuristic model of consumer energy efficiency decisionmaking,
in which uncertainty about goods’ energy efficiency can be resolved through a costly search. The
paper argues that energy consumption labels are not sufficient to eliminate this uncertainty; that
rational inattention may therefore play an important role; and that if consumers are inattentive,
then providing salient signals, such as a binary energy efficiency certification (e.g., the Energy
Star logo) may be efficient, even if it induces supply distortions. In a welfare evaluation of the
Energy Star program, Houde (2011) suggests that the program may improve social welfare and
lead to large energy savings. He finds that, under certain circumstances, certification may induce
consumers to invest too much in energy efficiency; however, the certification also partly crowds
out efforts to fully account for energy costs, and may therefore induce consumers to invest too
little in energy efficiency.

        Another important aspect of this type of investment decisionmaking is the hurdle rate or
other discounting factor that consumers employ when measuring current costs against future
benefits. A substantial literature suggests that “implicit discount rates,” which one can calculate
based on the capital cost versus energy operating cost savings of alternative projects, can be quite
high in practice (Hausman 1979; Train 1985). As noted above, a related literature further
contends that these high implicit discount rates are attributable to various market barriers and
failures—including information problems—and that these problems can be ameliorated by
appropriate policies. However, the literature has been hampered by an inability to disentangle
individual intertemporal preferences from market failure explanations for energy efficiency
decisions. We approach this issue by separately eliciting data on individual discount rates so that
their role as part of the energy efficiency decision can be assessed, as explained in section 2
below.

Overview of Approach

        Our purpose in this study is, first, to experimentally examine the extent to which any
reluctance of households to adopt energy-efficient appliances stems from informational
inefficiencies and, second, to identify the degree to which these inefficiencies can be resolved by


                                                 3
alternative information disclosure programs, such as different forms of energy efficiency
labeling. We are interested not only in the current US product-labeling options, such as
EnergyGuide and Energy Star, but also in their potential variations. We focus on investigating
potential misperceptions by consumers and households—that is, the extent to which their
decisions diverge from an objectively determined optimal behavioral principle. Exploring energy
efficiency in this regard is especially attractive because a clearly measurable value can be
attached to the averting behavior (i.e., the direct value of the energy savings), and a relatively
objective measure is available of what might constitute a “best choice,” based on minimization
of present value costs under a particular discount rate.

        We examined the above issues by conducting a series of stated choice experiments, in
which a large number of randomly selected US homeowners were subject to randomized
treatments using alternative energy efficiency labeling programs. Each study participant went
through several product choice decisions, which involved choosing the preferred option from
different available appliance options. We evaluated a large number of different alternative
product models across the respondents and each labeling treatment so that the data elicited
enabled a statistically efficient estimation of how different product attributes, including the
energy efficiency of the appliance, determine households’ appliance choice.

         Methodologically, the survey draws from (conjoint) choice experiment methods, which
are widely used in models of individual decisionmaking (e.g., McFadden 1974; Louviere et al.
2000; Train 2003). The objects of household choice—alternative appliances—are viewed as
bundles of product attributes, such as purchase price, energy efficiency, durability, capacity, and
brand. Using data on a large number of choices among products with an array of characteristics,
statistical analyses can recover implicit preference trade-offs between different attributes, such as
energy efficiency and product price, helping to reveal the valuation of each product attribute by
the decisionmakers examined.

        Although field experiments have an advantage in assessing decisions in an actual rather
than hypothetical context, the experimental approach taken here has advantages in terms of the
detail and control with which we are able to construct the choice experiment as well as the rich
information we have on respondents. Moreover, regardless of the hypothetical context, survey-
based approaches are informative in projecting market valuations. For example, in an extensive
review of hypothetical and revealed preference studies to value quasi-public goods, Carson et al.
(1996) find that the valuations based on hypothetical and revealed preference approaches are
similar for similar goods. On average, stated preference studies predict values that are about 90
percent of the estimates derived from revealed preference studies. The extent of commercial


                                                 4
market research, the main user of the choice experiment method, also demonstrates the value of
this method in eliciting information on consumer preferences (Louviere et al. 2000).

        To guarantee that our stated preference survey is pertinent to the respondents, we
sampled respondents who are the owners of single-family homes and elicited choice data
regarding a central household water heater. Studying preferences for a water heater provides a
range of advantages to this study. For example, all homes in our sample feature a central water
heater, so focusing on it enables the development of a realistic choice situation to which each
study participant can potentially be exposed. Moreover, water heaters have a comparatively
simple product attribute space, which helps the design of relatively uniform decision problems
across a large sample of households. Additionally, water heaters have reasonably high upfront
and annual operation costs, which is useful when examining households’ valuation of energy
efficiency and their willingness to pay (WTP) for it. In addition, the annual operation cost of
water heaters is entirely associated with the use of a single type of fuel and not a combination of
multiple sources, such as electricity, natural gas, and water use, as may be the case with some
other energy-using equipment, such as heating systems or clothes washers.

        A household’s subjective valuation of energy efficiency is revealed by the investment it
is willing to make for increased energy efficiency of the water heater. This involves
intertemporal trade-offs between the higher up-front purchase price and longer-term energy
operating cost savings. Besides the purchase price and the annual operation cost of the water
heater, the value of the long-term energy savings to the household therefore depends on the
discount factor and the planning horizon used.

        To help better understand the role of discounting in households’ valuation of energy
efficiency, we separately elicited individual-specific discount rates from each study participant.
Using an approach from the experimental economics literature (Coller and Williams 1999), each
respondent went through a series of choices for receiving different amounts of money at two
different points in time—one (payment A) available one month hence and the other (payment B)
available in one year. We used a fixed amount ($1,000) for the payment available in 1 month,
and varied the amount available in 12 months. Using multiple payment comparisons for each
study participant, we determined the amount received in one year to which the person is
indifferent and, based on this amount, inferred an implicit discount rate that equalizes the present
value of the two payments.

        In the rest of the paper, we first explain the household survey experiments conducted in
this study, including their development, design, and implementation. Thereafter, we develop an



                                                 5
econometric model for directly estimating households’ subjective valuation of energy efficiency
as an appliance attribute. We then present and discuss our estimation results.

2. Household Survey Experiments

Survey Development

        We developed the experiments in four stages. First, we conducted focus groups to better
understand how households approach appliance choice decisions, the importance of energy
efficiency in those decisions, and the perceptions of households of several alternative energy-
labeling programs. Each focus group participant also completed a draft of our survey instrument
so that we could discuss it. Second, we asked colleagues to complete and review a computerized
version of the experiment. Third, we revised and tested five alternative energy-labeling
treatments using pilot experiments with our sample of households. These treatments functioned
well, and their data therefore comprise part of our overall assessment. Fourth, we finalized the
survey instrument and developed and administered further information treatments. Altogether,
we examined 12 labeling treatments, described in more detail below.

Survey Sample

        We implemented the experiments using a computerized instrument and a random sample
from the GfK panel (formerly the Knowledge Networks panel). The GfK panel is a probability-
based respondent panel designed to be representative of the United States. 3 The panel is widely
used for academic research in many fields; applications to economics include, for example,
Rabin and Weizsacker (2009) and Fong and Luttmer (2009). Our sampling frame consists of
homeowners among US residents age 18 and older. Only one person per household could be
selected to participate in the experiments. Additionally, the study participant had to be a head of
the household, ensuring that the data elicited in the study correspond to preferences of those
individuals most likely to make decisions regarding major appliances.




3 Panel members are recruited by random digit dialing (RDD) sampling and address-based sampling methodologies.
To offset attrition, multiple recruitment samples are fielded evenly throughout the calendar year. GfK panel
recruitment methodology has used the quality standards established by selected RDD surveys conducted for the
federal government (such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention–sponsored National Immunization
Survey).




                                                      6
        The GfK panel is especially helpful for the purposes of this study not only because it
enables sampling from the general population, but also because the basic information about panel
members, such as their home ownership, is known in advance. Moreover, the panel enables the
use of a computerized and automated survey instrument, which is essential, as we explain later.
Finally, GfK panelists are accustomed to occasionally taking surveys, so their level of comfort in
going through surveys such as ours is high.

        The survey administration consisted of two stages: initial screening to ensure that the
respondent considered himself or herself a head of the household, followed by the main survey
with study-eligible respondents. Of 2,936 individuals initially contacted, 1,909 (65.0 percent)
passed the initial screening. Of those passing the initial screening, 1,248 individuals (65.4
percent) qualified for the survey. These individuals form our survey sample; altogether, 1,217
(97.4 percent) of them completed the experiment (with 1,214 individuals fully completing the
choice experiments).

         To enhance survey cooperation, we sent email reminders to nonresponders on day three
of the field period; additional email reminders to nonresponders were sent throughout the field
period; and participants were eligible to win an in-kind prize through a monthly GfK
sweepstakes.

        Table 1 provides descriptive statistics on the characteristics of the households in our
sample. For comparison, we compiled estimates of the household characteristics of US
homeowners from American Housing Survey data (US Census Bureau 2012). Although slight
differences emerge between our sample vs. that of the American Housing Survey in income
($65,206 vs. $58,919) and education level (40 percent vs. 35 percent with a minimum of a
bachelor’s degree), our sample matches well the average household characteristics of US
homeowners.

Energy Label Treatments

        Each study participant was randomly assigned to 1 of the 12 different energy-labeling
treatments, each of which included about 100 study participants (i.e., about 1,200 respondents
and 12 treatments yields a subsample of about 100 respondents per treatment). Aside from the
energy-labeling treatment, the experiments faced by each respondent were identical. That is,
different treatments elicited choices about the same appliance options; only the information
presented differed.




                                                7
        We next describe the labeling treatments. The current EnergyGuide label (Figure 1)
provides the baseline; most of the treatments are variations of the EnergyGuide label. Our
experimental approach involves evaluating both the information content and the style of
representing the information on the label. Regarding information content, we evaluated the use
of economic information (“estimated yearly operating cost” in the current EnergyGuide label)
and physical information on energy use (“estimated yearly energy use” in the current
EnergyGuide label) as well as the inclusion or exclusion of the range of energy costs for other
similar appliance options on the market (“cost range of similar models” in the current
EnergyGuide label). Moreover, we examined whether including information on the
environmental consequences of the appliance choice in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions influences study participants’ appliance choice decisions.

        Regarding the style of representing the information, we examined treatments that
included or excluded the current EnergyGuide logo and its colors. We also evaluated an
altogether different energy-labeling option: an energy efficiency grade label, which is commonly
used in Europe, parts of Asia, and South America. The energy efficiency grade label, illustrated
in Figure 2, was identified as one of the favorite labels by the focus group participants, so it was
included in the experiments.

        Finally, we fielded treatments that included (with and without the EnergyGuide label) the
Energy Star logo administered by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The Energy Star
logo is approved for display only on high-efficiency product models. These treatments help
examine the effectiveness of multiple simultaneous labeling programs with related information
content, as is the current policy practice in the United States.

         To evaluate the above dimensions of an energy-labeling program, we designed and
administered 12 labeling treatments, which fall into the following 4 main categories (examples of
the graphics used in the different treatments and a table summarizing the information attributes
of the treatments are included in the appendix in Figure A1 and Table A5):


   1) current EnergyGuide label and its direct variations
          a. current label (information on the yearly operation cost, energy use, and the range
              of yearly operation cost of similar appliances; Figure A1.1).
          b. variations
                   i. yearly operation cost and range only (Figure A1.2)
                  ii. yearly energy use only (kilowatt-hours [kWh], therms; Figure A1.3)
                 iii. simplified EnergyGuide

                                  1. no EnergyGuide logo or colors (Figure A1.4)
                                  2. no EnergyGuide logo or colors; no range of yearly operation cost
                                     of similar appliances (Figure A1.5)
    2) Energy Star labels
          a. Energy Star with EnergyGuide (Figure A1.6)
          b. Energy Star with simplified EnergyGuide (Figure A1.7)
          c. Energy Star without EnergyGuide (Figure A1.8)

    3) labels with CO2 information
           a. EnergyGuide with CO2 information expressed in a manner similar to that of
               yearly energy usage (numeric data; Figure A1.9)
           b. simplified EnergyGuide with CO2 information using graphics (carbon footprint)
               and numeric information (Figure A1.10)
           c. information only on CO2 using graphics (carbon footprint) and numeric
               information; no EnergyGuide (Figure A1.11)

    4) energy efficiency grade, with operating cost (EU-style label, 4 similar versions are also
       used in parts of South America, China and other Asian countries, and Russia; Figure
       A1.12)

        In the estimation model, we describe different labeling treatments as a set of common
attributes, such as the absence or presence of economic information, physical information,
EnergyGuide label graphics, the Energy Star logo, and so forth, as explained below. In addition
to helping reduce the dimensionality of the treatments, this enables the construction of compound
information treatments to help better understand and evaluate different labeling program options.
Nonetheless, we have also estimated the model directly, employing the 12 treatments as separate
variables. Those specifications generate results similar to those presented here but are less
readily interpretable for contrasting how the different attributes of the label affect households’
choices and implicit valuation of energy efficiency.

Choice Experiment Design

        Our choice experiments follow a standard framework used in the marketing, economics,
and transportation literature for eliciting data on individual preferences (e.g., Louviere et al.
2000). Each study participant was subjected to five different choice decisions, each of which

4 Note that   the actual EU efficiency label does not include operating cost information.




                                                            9
contrasted three water heater alternatives. Different water heater options varied by purchase price
and the attributes included in the labeling treatment. In each choice problem, the study
participant indicated which of the three options he or she preferred, assuming that they were the
only options available and assuming that the water heater replacement was necessary and
imminent. A stylized example of the choice problem using the current EnergyGuide labeling
treatment is shown in Figure 3. Other labeling treatments replaced the graphics in the “energy
use” row with a graphic corresponding to each alternative treatment.

        Prior to the choice problems, the survey instrument introduced the study and explained
the upcoming choice questions and the information portrayed by the labels. The survey also
collected basic information regarding the home of the respondents (for example, the fuel type of
the water heater and water heater’s capacity and type). The respondents were also asked
questions about the importance of many different factors in the potentially sudden decision to
replace a water heater. Besides eliciting valuable data, these questions prepared the respondents
to carefully consider a potential water heater replacement decision.

        When explaining the choice problems, we explained in detail and intuitively the meaning
of each appliance attribute. Figure A2 in the appendix illustrates the description of attributes in
the current EnergyGuide labeling treatment. 5 Although water heaters are relatively uniform,
some differences among them go beyond the attributes examined here. We therefore asked each
study participant to assume that the appliance options presented in the experiments matched in
all other respects the desired replacement option for his or her home.

Choice Set Design

        The range of potential energy cost, purchase price, and CO2 emissions of different
appliance options are summarized in Table A1 in the appendix. We developed the ranges of all
attributes to correspond to the actual range of appliances currently available, as explained below.


5 For the  “purchase price” attribute, we noted that it “denotes your out-of-pocket cost of purchasing the appliance,
after all possible rebates, credits, and other deductions. In other words, ignore any energy and other rebates, credits,
and other deductions when making the choice.” For the “estimated yearly operating cost,” we noted that it “lists the
estimated annual energy cost of the water heater option considered.” For the EnergyGuide label, we indicated that
“energy use is described using the EnergyGuide label administered by the Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s
consumer protection agency. EnergyGuide label can help you compare the energy use of different models as you
shop for an appliance. The more energy efficient an appliance is, the less it costs to run, and the lower your utility
bills.”




                                                           10
        The range of potential annual operating costs assigned to different appliance options
matched the information available for water heaters in the EnergyGuide final rule notice by the
Federal Trade Commission (2007). . Because the yearly operating cost of water heaters
substantially varies by the fuel used by the water heaters, we designed the entire survey,
including information in the energy-labeling alternatives, to match the fuel type of the water
heater in the respondent’s home. This was achieved with an automated survey instrument in
which the final instrument design is determined midsurvey using respondent-provided
information on the fuel of the water heater in the respondent’s home. The two primary fuels are
natural gas (49 percent of the sample) and electricity (41 percent of the sample). The range of the
annual operating cost attribute for water heaters by fuel is given in Table A1 in the appendix.

       The range of purchase prices matched the range of actual purchase prices of water heaters
available from the chief appliance retailers (Sears, Best Buy, Lowe’s, and Home Depot). Using
estimates developed by PG&E, 6 we determined the CO2 emissions to match the actual CO2
emissions from different appliance options presented (energy use and fuel determine CO2
emissions). However, in two treatments where this could be achieved without confounding the
choice problem (i.e., the treatments with the carbon footprint), we randomized information on
the CO2 emissions so that estimating preferences for CO2 emissions, independent of annual
operating cost and energy use, became feasible. 7

        Summing up, each water heater option evaluated in the survey is realistic compared to the
options currently on the market. Moreover, the range of energy use, purchase price, and CO2
emissions of water heaters examined in the overall survey corresponds to the range of options
actually on the market. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics on the attributes of the products in
our sample.

Statistically Efficient Experimental Design of the Choice Sets

       Altogether, we developed 100 different potential instrument designs for each labeling
treatment. Within each of the 12 treatments, instruments varied only in the attribute levels
associated with each product model presented (i.e., purchase price, energy use, operating cost,

separately identified.




                                                         11
and/or CO2 emissions). The choice sets in the 100 potential designs were constructed using
Bayesian methods for statistically efficient experimental design (Kessels et al. 2006, 2009;
Ferrini and Scarpa 2007; Sandor and Wedel 2002). Because the statistical efficiency of discrete
choice models is not guaranteed by the orthogonality of experimental design, but also depends
on the underlying choice probabilities, we developed a GAUSS program for a Monte Carlo
modified Fedorov design algorithm to identify an experimental design that maximizes the
statistical efficiency (D-efficiency) of the parameter estimates in a multinomial logit model. We
used results from the literature (Brownstone and Train 1999) to inform the experimental design
of the pilot experiments. We reevaluated the design after the pilot, but maintained it because the
identification of treatment effects worked well in practice. Similar experimental designs over
different treatments also helped the identification of treatment effects.

        The purchase price and yearly operating cost of each alternative was drawn from seven
potential levels within the ranges shown in Table A1 in the appendix. Each choice problem
included three alternatives, none of which was strictly dominant relative to the other two
alternatives. In other words, a water heater option could not be simultaneously less expensive to
purchase and more energy efficient than the other two water heater options in the same choice
question. This reflects the situation in the actual marketplace and was necessary to make the
hypothetical choice situation realistic to the study participants. Because this design introduces
correlation between the “yearly operating cost/energy use” and “purchase price” attributes,
which may deteriorate estimation efficiency, we incorporated a nondominance requirement in the
experimental design algorithm so that one could identify correlated experimental designs least
detrimental to estimation efficiency.

        Given that we used an individualized experimental design, examined 12 different labeling
treatments, and customized the survey instrument design by fuel (natural gas or electricity), the
survey required the development of 2,400 different survey instruments. Although this is beyond
what is conventionally evaluated in choice experiments, it was beneficial for the estimation of
the parameters of interest and is feasible using computerized experiments.

Elicitation of Individual-Specific Discount Rates

        Our goal in the design of the intertemporal payment choice experiment was to match the
relevant temporal and monetary scale of an appliance choice decision. We always used $1,000
for payment A, (explained to respondents intuitively as a tax-free cash credit), because it is a
round sum roughly comparable to the magnitude of investment required to purchase a new water
heater. Following previous research on eliciting individual discount rates, which suggests that


                                                12
making the near-term payment immediately available may result in unreliable estimates of
longer-term discount rates (Coller and Williams 1999), we made payment A available after a
one-month period. Moreover, the scheduling of the payments in 1 and 12 months keeps the
choice problem intuitive and reflects the relatively long time horizon relevant in the water heater
purchase decision compared to many other decisions posed in the experimental literature on time
preferences.

       We introduced the payment choice problem to the study participants as follows.

        “Think next that your household receives a $1,000 tax-free cash credit. You will be given
the credit as a $1,000 check mailed to your address one (1) month from now. However, you can
also opt for a higher credit amount mailed to you twelve (12) months from now. The credit in
twelve months is higher to compensate you for agreeing to wait for the credit. You can only
receive one credit. Both credits are certain to be delivered at their due date, and you will not need
to pay tax on either one of them. The only difference between the credits is the delivery date and
the payment amount.”

        Thereafter, a series of payment choices was presented, each payment choice with only
two payment alternatives: $1,000 available in 1 month and a greater amount available in 12
months. Each respondent checked the box next to the payment option he or she preferred in each
comparison. Altogether, we used 18 different payment B amounts. They were determined using
gradually increasing discount rates, starting with 2 percent ($1,019) and reaching up to 100
percent ($2,501). For discount rates between 2 and 20 percent, we used intervals of 2 percentage
points between different payment B amounts. For discount rates between 20 and 30 percent, we
increased the interval to 5 percentage points. Thereafter, the interval width increased to 10
percentage points until the 60 percent discount rate. Finally, we also included two payment
choices constructed using 75 percent and 100 percent discount rates.

        After making an initial choice between payment, A or B, each respondent who chose
payment A continued through new payment-choice problems, each of which included a larger
payment B. The payment choice problem continued until the respondent switched from choosing
payment A to choosing payment B. Table A2 in the appendix lists the different payment amounts
used in the payment choice experiment. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics on the elicited
discount rates. The mean rate was 19 percent, the median rate was 11 percent, and the standard
deviation was 23 percent.

      Many studies have estimated discount rates using field and laboratory data on, for
example, health- and finance-related choices (Frederick et al. 2002). Although these studies


                                                 13
mostly estimate relatively high discount rates, the range of estimates is wide. In the context of
long-term choices (from several months to several years), the estimated discount rates vary from
no more than 10 to 20 percent (e.g., Green et al. 1997; Cairns and van der Pol 1997; Wahlund
and Gunnarson 1996) to 100 percent or more (e.g., Thaler 1981; Loewenstein 1987). However,
among those studies using elicitation methods similar to ours, the results align closely with our
estimates. Coller and Williams (1999), whose elicitation method we apply, estimate a median
discount rate of 17 to 20 percent using a sample of students. Harrison et al. (2002) use the Coller
and Williams (1999) elicitation method in a field experiment in Denmark, predicting a 28
percent discount rate, on average. Therefore, the level of discount rates we find for homeowners
is consistent with other similar experimental evidence on discount rates.

3. Discrete Choice Econometric Model in Willingness to Pay Space

Conceptual Model

        Using the random utility model (McFadden 1974, 1984) as the point of departure to the
econometric modeling of the elicited choice data, we consider an individual i choosing the
preferred alternative from a set of m alternatives. The utility that person i derives from alternative
j is denoted Uij. It can be additively separated into an unobserved stochastic component εij and a
deterministic component Vij, the indirect utility function, so that Uij = Vij + εij. To model utility in
the context of our choice experiments, we specify Vij as a linear additive function of the purchase
price (p), present value of annual operating cost (PVOC), and nonmonetary attributes X of a
water heater option j:

                                    Uij=αipij+βiPVOCi j+ θiXij + εij.                                (1)

The water heater’s PVOC is determined as
                                                           1       1
                                     PVOCij=𝐴𝑖𝑗 �1 − (1+𝑟 ) 𝑛� 𝑟 ,                                   (2)
                                                               𝑖   𝑖


where A is the annual operating cost included in most of the energy labels, r is the discount rate, and
n is the planning horizon (taken to be 13 years, the typical lifetime of a water heater). Note that r
varies by individual, reflecting the subjective discount rate of each individual or household elicited
through the cash-over-time choice task. We also estimate a version of the model where PVOC is




                                                   14
calculated assuming a uniform 5 percent discount rate across all individuals, which lies midway
between the 3 percent and 7 percent rates used for government regulatory analysis. 8
                                                                                                       π2
          We assume that εij are type I extreme value random variables with variance 𝜇𝑖2 ( ), where
                                                                                                       6
μ is a scale parameter. As is standard, we divide equation (1) by μ, leaving the model
behaviorally unaffected and resulting in a new error term variance given by π2/6 (Train and
Weeks 2005). Denoting λ=α/μ, ω=β/μ, and φ=θ/μ, utility is written as

                                      Uij= λipij+ ωiPVOCij+ φiXij + εij.                                        (3)

Equation (3) specifies the model in utility (or preference) space, incorporating a scale parameter
implicit in all coefficients.

        WTP for improved energy efficiency (reduced PVOC), our key interest, is given by the ratio
between the coefficients for the purchase price and PVOC, denoted here as γ = ω/ λ. WTP for
nonmonetary attributes is determined similarly, denoted here as η= φ/ λ. WTP relationships can also
be directly incorporated into the utility model by rewriting equation (3) in “WTP space,” following
(Train and Weeks 2005):

                                      Uij= λi[pij+ γiPVOCi j+ ηiXij] +εi j.                                     (4)

        Although equations (3) and (4) are behaviorally equivalent, equation (4) allows for a
more intuitive and useful interpretation of the parameters of key interest in this study, which is to
examine households’ subjective valuation of energy efficiency. By using equation (4) for
estimation, we can observe trade-offs implicit in households’ choices between upfront
investment costs and long-term savings associated with energy efficiency directly from the
estimated model coefficients.
        Note that equation (4) expresses the operating cost of the appliance option, PVOC, using
the present value, calculated using equation (2) from the yearly operating cost communicated on
the label. Therefore, for a “rational” cost-minimizing household exhibiting discount rate ri, WTP
for a $1 reduction in PVOC should equal $1 of purchase price. This requires that γ = 1,
indicating a one-to-one trade-off between purchase price and PVOC.



8 There is a subtlety here regarding nominal versus real discount rates. In government regulatory analysis, the 3
percent and 7 percent benchmarks are real rates. In this experiment, we did not specify what the respondents should
assume about inflation, so their responses implicitly represent nominal rates and incorporate whatever their
subjective inflation expectations might be.




                                                        15
         To complete the estimation framework, we note that choices are based on utility
comparisons among the available alternatives, such that the alternative providing the highest
utility is chosen. The probability of person i choosing alternative j from among the three
alternatives therefore equals the probability that alternative j provides person i with a greater
utility Uij than any other available alternative in the choice set:
                                     Pij = P(Uij > Uik , k = 1,2,3," k¹ j).                                   (5)

        We predict response probabilities using a flexible mixed logit model, which allows the
preference parameters γi and ηi to vary within the population rather than be fixed at the same
value for each person. Combining equations (3)–(5) and using Γ=[λ, γ, η] to denote the vector of
estimated parameters then yields the mixed logit model 9 (McFadden and Train 2000;
Brownstone and Train 1999; Train 2003), and the probability of person i choosing alternative j out
of m alternatives is written as:


                                   eVij 
                           =Pij ∫  k =3  f ( Γ | Ω)d Γ .                                                   (6)
                                   ∑ eVik 
                                   k =1  

         We approximate the above choice probability using simulation (Train 2003). Using R draws
of Γi from f(Γ|W) and denoting the probability of the observed response sequence as Pir, the
                                                 1 r=R
simulated probability is determined as SPi ( Γ) = ∑ Pir . To improve estimation, we generate
                                                 R r =1
Halton sequences and incorporate them in the simulation routine (Feenberg and Skinner 1994;
Bhat 2002; Train 2003). 10 Because each study participant in our experiment was subjected to six
independent choice problems, we estimate the joint probability of observing the choice sequence
elicited from each respondent. Denoting the choice problem by h, the simulated log-likelihood
function is determined as:
                                         logL= ∑𝑁       6
                                                𝑖=1 𝑙𝑛(∏ℎ=1 𝑆𝑃𝑖𝑗ℎ ).                                           (7)




9 The mixed logit model has other advantages in addition to random taste variation, including unrestricted
substitution patterns and correlation in unobserved factors over time (Train 2003).
10 We use 250 Halton draws in all estimations. We have estimated the main models also using 500 and 1,000 Halton
draws and find that the model results remain robust.




                                                         16
        Using the above estimation framework with varying preference parameters among different
individuals enables us to accommodate the many different potential drivers of heterogeneity relevant
to different respondents. Heterogeneity can arise from genuine taste differences, but could also be
related to several other potential differences among respondents and their situations, including the
likelihood of moving to another home and each person’s perception of the degree to which benefits
from an investment in energy efficiency may be recoverable in a home sale. Heterogeneity could also
be associated with differences in each respondent’s willingness and ability to pay attention to and
process information in the label. 11

Empirical Specification

        According to equation (4), cost-minimizing trade-offs between PVOC and purchase price
require that γ = 1. To examine this equality under different labeling programs, we reparameterize
γ, the WTP coefficient on PVOC, so that it becomes a function of the information treatment. We use
the following seven indicator variables (denoted below with the subscript INFO) to describe
variation in the labeling treatments included in the experiment:
         1) any operating cost information included (yes/no)
         2) continuous operating cost information included (yes/no)
         3) EnergyGuide image included (yes/no)
         4) Energy Star logo included (yes/no)
         5) physical energy information (therms, kWh) included (yes/no)
         6) CO2 emissions information included (yes/no)
         7) relative energy efficiency grade information included (EU-style label; yes/no)

        Each of the 12 labeling treatments is assigned a set of seven 0–1 indicator variables Z1, Z2,
…, Z7 (see Appendix Table A5). Each of these seven dummy variables equals 1 if the specific



11 Besides using the random coefficient formulation we develop here, one can account for individual parameter
heterogeneity by using information on the observable characteristics of the respondent. As a robustness check, we also
estimated our main models including individual heterogeneity as a product of the socioeconomic background of the
respondent (age, income, education, employment status, gender, and geographic region). We estimated the model by
reparametrizing the purchase cost parameter as a function of these characteristics. We estimated, while also allowing for
random coefficients for the label attribute variables, thus introducing a rich structure for different forms of hetrerogeneity.
These models suggest that, although both unobservable (random coefficients) and observable (socioeconomic
characteristics) forms of heterogeneity may be present, our main results—the estimated effects from different label
attributes—are robust to the inclusion of observable heterogeneity.




                                                              17
characteristic 1–7 above is included in the labeling option; otherwise, the dummy variable is 0.
In the specification, these dummy variables are each interacted with PVOC, allowing the WTP
for PVOC (i.e., γi) to be a function of the available information as follows:
                                                  7
                                         γi =    ∑        γ i , INFO * Z i , INFO .                            (8)
                                                INFO =1


        Each of the seven information coefficients is estimated flexibly as a random parameter so
that the effect of information treatment may vary among individuals. We assume that random
parameters are distributed normally and estimate the mean and standard deviation of the
distribution of each random parameter.

        Additionally, the experimental design and estimation framework enables us to
independently identify WTP for CO2 emissions (tons per year), electricity usage (kWh per year),
natural gas usage (therms per year), the Energy Star logo along with other information, and the
Energy Star logo alone. These effects are estimated through the addition of five variables
alongside the PVOC terms (i.e., the vector of X in equation [4]), three of which are continuous
random parameters (kWh, therms, and CO2 emissions) and two of which are discrete fixed
parameters (the Energy Star logo indicators). 12

4. Results

        Our mixed logit estimation results are given in Table 2 and 3 based, respectively, on
discounting operating costs using individual-specific discount rates and a constant 5 percent
discount rate for all individuals. For information treatments, the tables list both the estimated
mean and the standard deviation of the coefficient distribution, given the random coefficient
approach to estimation. To provide a normalized sense of the degree of variation in the
coefficient estimates, we also list the coefficient of variation (i.e., the standard deviation divided
by the mean) for each random-parameter distribution. Estimation employing a fixed-parameter
model shows similar results, which are given in the appendix in Tables A3 and A4.




12 Oureconometric specification with a large number of random parameters and our estimation in the WTP space is
demanding for identification in practice; we therefore restrict the Energy Star dummies to being fixed to assist in
estimation. Robustness checks indicate that this specification choice has minimal impact on the remaining
estimation results.




                                                            18
         We find a statistically significant effect on appliance choice of information on the
purchase price, energy operating cost, Energy Star qualification, physical energy use (i.e., kWh
or therms), CO2 emissions, and energy efficiency “letter grade”. This is indicated by the
statistically significant estimated mean coefficient of the parameter distribution for the above
information treatments. The presence of information on the operating cost relative to a range of
comparable models and the yellow EnergyGuide image, however, did not have a consistently
significant effect on choice. 13 Note also that, for attributes entering both interacted with
operating costs and alone (e.g., the Energy Star logo), the associated coefficient estimates need to
be considered together to assess the overall impact of that information element.

         The estimated standard deviations of the coefficient distributions are also generally
statistically significant for the information treatments for which the estimated distribution mean
parameters are statistically significantly different from zero. This indicates that the effect of
information varies by individual. The coefficients of variation of the coefficient distributions
vary roughly between 0.1 and 0.9, suggesting that the degree of individual variability in the
effect of information varies considerably by information treatment. As a robustness check on the
current results, we estimated both the random- and fixed-parameter models with demographic
variables alongside the main variables of interest (see footnote 11). The results of interest were
robust to the inclusion of these demographic variables, which was expected given the random
nature of the experimental design. As another robustness check, we also estimated the model
excluding observations with extremely high (more than 50 percent or 75 percent) and low (less
than 2 percent) individual discount rates. The results are robust also to this change in the sample.

         Recall that each of the coefficients, other than that on purchase price, has been
normalized by the coefficient on purchase price to yield more easily interpreted estimates
expressed in dollars of WTP. For the information attributes interacted with discounted operating
costs, the interpretation of the coefficients is dollars of WTP per dollar saved in discounted
operating costs. It is easiest to interpret the magnitude of these information attributes as
combined information-labeling treatments, which we do below in Table 4. Table 4 summarizes
the estimated WTP for discounted operating cost savings for six composite labeling treatments,

13 Note thatthe estimated effects of these two information elements tended to be closely related. In the estimation
using a constant 5 percent discount rate, both were close to zero in magnitude and were statistically insignificant. In
the estimation using individiual-specific discount rates, each was larger in magnitude (with the EnergyGuide image
having a counterintuitive negative sign), but the combined effect was again close to zero and statistically
insignificant.




                                                          19
based on the results in Table 2 and 3. These labeling treatments, which are illustrated in Figure 4,
represent a sufficient subset of the 12 treatments actually used in the experiment to illustrate the
key results.

        It is helpful to compare the estimated WTP to a value of 1 because it indicates cost-
minimizing behavior, in which equal weight is given to changes in the purchase price and the
discounted operating cost savings. In contrast, a value less than 1 indicates relative
undervaluation of energy savings, whereas a value greater than 1 represents overvaluation of
energy savings. The classic energy efficiency gap or energy paradox is associated with values
less than 1. Note that the results using individual discount rates consistently indicate a greater
degree of relative value attached to discounted energy cost savings compared to a 5 percent rate.
This is because the individual rates are higher, on average, than 5 percent—with a median value
of 11 percent and mean value of 20 percent—and will therefore appropriately attach lower
discounted value to energy savings under cost-minimizing behavior.

        Information-labeling treatment A includes only simple operating cost information and
yields an estimated WTP for discounted operating cost savings of 0.80 when employing
individual discount rates and 0.56 when using a 5 percent rate. Although this suggests a
significant degree of undervaluation of energy efficiency when only modest information is
available, it also indicates how potent even modest information can be. Adding information on
the relative operating cost range of comparable models and the yellow EnergyGuide image
(Label B) does not significantly add to the basic information value already given by Label A.

        Adding CO2 emissions information in Label C provides a further boost to the relative
value of energy savings, but is not as individually important as the direct monetary value of
energy cost reductions. Information on CO2 emissions is particularly heterogeneous in its effect
on WTP for reduced operating costs (see Tables 2 and 3). Although the mean of the coefficient
distribution associated with the CO2 information treatment is positive, it is only about one
standard deviation away from zero (using both individual and 5 percent discount rates). Because
the coefficient is estimated using a normal distribution, this result suggests that, for about 15
percent of the population, the presence of CO2 information decreases WTP for lower operating
costs. This finding is consistent with the experience of energy efficiency marketers (based on
anecdotal conversations with the authors) and with recent research by Gromet et. al (2013),
demonstrating how promoting the environment can negatively affect the adoption of energy
efficiency in the United States because of the political polarization surrounding environmental
issues. For the rest of the population, the effect of the presence of CO2 information in the label
increases WTP for reduced operating costs in our study.

        Label D is the same as C except that CO2 information is replaced by physical energy use,
in kWh or therms depending on whether the individual uses electricity or natural gas for water
heating. Physical energy use information adds a value of energy savings similar to that added by
CO2 information, but again, not as much as monetary information on energy costs. Label D
represents the current EnergyGuide label mandated by US regulation, so it is worth further
reflection. Using individual discount rates, Label D leads to choices placing a relative value of
1.04 on energy cost reductions compared to reductions in the purchase price. This is very close to
cost-minimizing behavior—assuming one takes the individual discount rates as an appropriate
indication of time preferences. If, on the other hand, one questions the relatively high individual
discount rates and instead uses a 5 percent rate, Label D is still associated with choices that
significantly undervalue discounted energy savings: they are roughly one-third lower in value
than the value associated with saving on the equipment purchase price. The issue of the
appropriate discount rate to use for energy efficiency analysis (and benefit–cost analysis more
generally) once again exhibits its importance.

         Label E adds the Energy Star logo to Label D for qualified models. 14 The Energy Star
endorsement significantly raises the value placed on energy efficiency and, using a 5 percent
rate, the Energy Star logo supplementing the other information yields a relative WTP for energy
savings (1.23) that is now somewhat greater than with cost-minimizing behavior. Assuming one
uses individual discount rates, the Energy Star endorsement raises the importance of energy
efficiency by an even greater degree, to the point where individuals placed substantially higher
private value on discounted operating costs than on purchase costs (i.e., the relative WTP is
1.50). Also note from Tables 2 and 3 that the Energy Star logo induces a discrete positive
inclination toward energy efficiency, while dampening the continuous incentive associated with
varying operating costs (i.e., the coefficient on Energy Star interacted with operating costs is
negative).

14 The coefficients on the indicators that a model was Energy Star–qualified are interpretable simply as incremental
dollars of WTP relative to a model that is not Energy Star–qualified. In cases where the only information presented
was an Energy Star logo, we found an incremental WTP of $667 using individual discount rates and $663 using a
constant 5 percent rate across all individuals. To place this in perspective, the average Energy Star–qualified model
saved $109 per year in energy operating costs relative to a non-Energy Star model. The present value of this savings
is $733 using the average individual discount rate or $1,019 using a 5 percent rate. Thus, the ratio of WTP for an
Energy Star model to the value of its discounted energy cost savings was 0.91 using individual discount rates and
0.65 using a 5 percent rate. This is for labels on which only the Energy Star logo was presented. In Label E, for
example, on which other information was presented as well, one needs to add the discrete impact of Energy Star to
the impact of the other information attributes, as in Table 4.




                                                         21
        Label F, which bears an EU-like energy efficiency letter grade, yields results similar to
those of the current US label plus Energy Star logo (i.e., Label E)—that is, somewhat beyond
cost-minimizing behavior using a 5 percent discount rate and substantial overvaluation of energy
savings using individual discount rates. Note that the EU-style label includes a letter grade from
A to G, which suggests that the lower the energy use the better. Even with a relatively simple
indication of energy operating cost and no other information, this suggestive label has a powerful
effect. Anyone who has been to school wants to get an A rather than a C or F.

        For the information attributes (shown in the lower half of Tables 2 and 3) that express
continuous physical information (i.e., kWh, therms, and CO2), the interpretation of the
coefficients is in dollars of WTP per unit (i.e., kWh, therms, and CO2) saved per year. To
provide a useful interpretation of these physical coefficients, one must first divide the coefficient
by a present value factor, thereby yielding a WTP estimate that is measured simply in dollars per
unit; we do this in Table 5. The results are quite interesting and show an almost surprising degree
of economically sensible valuations. The estimated WTP for reductions in electricity use was
8.0¢ per kWh and 11.8¢ per kWh (for 5 percent and individual discount rates, respectively). To
put these values in context, note that the residential average retail price of electricity in 2010 was
11.5¢ per kWh—almost exactly the same as the valuation estimated from our data using
individual discount rates. Moreover, one must keep in mind that these values were based purely
on the exposure of the respondent to information on annual electricity use, estimated solely from
the treatments that included only physical measures of energy use (in kWh rather than dollars;
see treatments 3 and 11 in Appendix Figure A1).

        This suggests that, although physical energy information alone is not sufficient to guide
informed economic decisions, households are able to translate between physical energy and its
economic value. Similarly, the estimated WTP for reductions in natural gas use was $0.84 per
therm and $1.16 per therm (for 5 percent and individual discount rates, respectively)—compared
to a $1.14 per therm residential average retail price of natural gas in 2010. Again, these estimates
suggest a high degree of economically sensible valuations in the stated preference context.
Finally, the mean WTP estimate for CO2 reductions is approximately $12 per ton and $18 per ton
for the 5 percent and individual discount rates, respectively. Although this does not necessarily
provide further evidence of individually rational valuations—CO2 emissions are not commonly
valued through markets—this estimate of the private valuation of CO2 reductions is close to the
range of central estimates of the near-term social cost of carbon, which tend to range from $20 to
$30 per ton of CO2.

5. Conclusion

        This paper evaluates the effectiveness of information provision through energy efficiency
labeling in improving energy efficiency decisions by households. By coupling a carefully
designed choice experiment with information on all key elements of intertemporal energy
efficiency choices, we are able to disentangle the roles played by (a) different types of
information and (b) intertemporal behavior (i.e., discounting) in guiding energy efficiency
behavior. Virtually all previous research has been limited in its ability to isolate and understand
the nature of the energy efficiency gap due to the need in those studies to make assumptions
about some elements of the choice decision in order to evaluate claims about other elements of
the decision.

        We find that simple information on the economic value of saving energy is the most
important element guiding more cost-efficient investments in appliance energy efficiency—that
is, investments that place equal value on saving $1 in purchase price or present value operating
costs. Adding more complex economic information to place these operating costs within the cost
range of available models did not have significant additional value. Information on the amount of
physical energy an appliance uses had incremental value in guiding decisions, but was of less
importance than the monetary information. Information on CO2 emissions also had incremental
value, but was of still lesser importance than the physical and economic information. We also
were able to elicit WTP estimates for CO2 emissions reductions of roughly $10 to $20 per ton.

        Bringing these elements together, we find that the degree to which the current
EnergyGuide label guided cost-efficient decisions depends on the discount rate assumed
appropriate for the analysis. Using the individual discount rates separately elicited in our study
(which had median and mean values of 11 and 20 percent, respectively), we find that the
EnergyGuide label came very close to guiding cost-efficient decisions, on average—choices that
were not statistically different from placing equal weight on up-front purchase costs and
discounted operating costs. In contrast, using a uniform 5 percent rate for discounting—which is
much lower than the average individual elicited rate—we find that the EnergyGuide label
resulted in choices that placed too little weight on energy operating cost savings, resulting in a
one-third undervaluation of energy efficiency. Information treatments with less economic or
physical energy information than in current US labeling led to an even greater degree of
undervaluation, resulting in too little weight being placed on energy operating costs, regardless
of the discount rate used.




                                                23
         Interestingly, we find that labels that not only nudged people with dispassionate monetary
or physical information, but also endorsed a model (with Energy Star) or gave a suggestive grade
to a model (as with the EU-style label), had a substantial impact on encouraging choices with
higher energy efficiency. Moreover, depending again on one’s view of the appropriate discount
rate, these more suggestive labels yielded choices that placed a greater incremental value on
discounted energy than on purchase cost to either a moderate (using a uniform 5 percent rate) or
substantial degree (using individually elicited discount rates).

        These results reinforce the centrality of one’s view on intertemporal choice and
discounting, both in terms of understanding individual behavior and in guiding public policy
decisions. Using additional information gathered in our survey (e.g., on consumer interest rates
and payback thresholds), a companion paper further explores individual behavior related to the
intertemporal trade-offs involved in energy efficiency decisions. Finally, our estimation approach
finds considerable heterogeneity in individual valuation of information related to energy
efficiency decisions, particularly the valuation of information related to CO2 emissions.

F. EU-style relative grade added to treatment A                             1.69               1.19

Notes: Estimates are found by adding the relevant information attributes from Tables 1 and 2. For
treatment E, which includes the Energy Star logo, we add the continuous impact of Energy Star to its
discrete impact after dividing the latter by the present value of operating cost savings for the average
Energy Star versus non-Energy Star model. 1.0 is equal weight, or cost-minimizing behavior; < 1 is
undervaluation of energy savings; and > 1 is overvaluation of energy savings.
