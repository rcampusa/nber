I. INTRODUCTION

     The "New Economy" in the U.S. since the mid-1990s has featured

surprisingly benign behavior of inflation and unemployment.     Before

this experience, most estimates of the NAIRU -- the non-

accelerating inflation rate of unemployment -- were in the

neighborhood of six percent.   Yet unemployment has fallen far below

this level, reaching 4.2% in 2000, and inflation has not risen

substantially.    This paper presents an explanation for the apparent

improvement in the unemployment-inflation tradeoff.    We argue that

it is caused by another feature of the new economy: the rise in the

growth rate of labor productivity.

     Our argument builds on an old idea: workers' wage aspirations

adjust slowly to shifts in productivity growth.    As a result, such

shifts produce periods when aspirations and productivity are out of

line, causing the Phillips curve to shift.    Authors such as Grubb

et al. (1982) use this idea to argue that the productivity slowdown

of the 1970s caused an unfavorable Phillips-curve shift.    Authors

such as Blinder (2000) and Council of Economic Advisors (2000)

suggest that this process worked in reverse in the late 1990s, with

a productivity speedup causing a favorable Phillips-curve shift.

This paper presents new evidence that changes in productivity

growth do indeed affect the Phillips curve.    In addition to

documenting this idea in general, we show that it explains most of

the Phillips curve puzzle since 1995.

     Our argument proceeds in several steps.    In Section II, we

discuss the ideas about wage determination that underlie our story.

We draw on previous research suggesting that concepts of fairness



                                     1
affect wage setting, and that perceptions of fair wage increases

are tied to past wage increases.

     Section III embeds these ideas in an otherwise standard model

of the Phillips curve.    In the model, an increase in productivity

growth feeds one-for-one into lower price inflation for given wage

inflation.    It has less effect on wage inflation, which is

determined largely by past wage increases.     Wage inflation also

depends negatively on unemployment.     Combining these assumptions

yields a Phillips curve in which the change in inflation depends on

unemployment and the difference between current productivity growth

and past real-wage growth.    Shifts in productivity growth cause

shifts in the unemployment-inflation relation for a period while

wage aspirations are adjusting.

     Section IV discusses the measurement of key variables in our

model, and Section V presents our central empirical results. We

estimate alternative Phillips curves with annual U.S. data from

1962-1995, and then use these equations to forecast inflation over

1996-2000.    We first confirm previous findings that a conventional

Phillips curve overpredicts inflation after 1995.    We then

estimate the Phillips curve from our model and find that the new

variable -- the gap between productivity growth and past real wage

growth -- has the effect predicted by our theory.    When this

variable is included, the overprediction of inflation since 1995

disappears.    Section VI discusses extensions of the analysis, such

as the addition of traditional "supply shock" variables to the

Phillips curve.

     Sections VII and VIII leave aggregate U.S. data to look for



                                    2
other evidence for our theory.    Section VII is a case study of

Chile in the 1990s.    This episode is another one in which a

productivity acceleration appears to have caused a favorable

Phillips-curve shift. Section VIII examines micro data from the

U.S. Current Population Survey.    Here, we show that our model

helps explain differences in wage growth across workers as well as

movements in aggregate variables.

     Section IX concludes the paper.



II. WAGE ASPIRATIONS

     It is clear that real wages are tied closely to labor

productivity in the long run.    Consequently, our model will have

the feature that productivity, real wages, and real-wage

aspirations all grow at the same rate in a steady state.     We

consider the possibility, however, that a shift in productivity

growth is not matched immediately by a shift in wage aspirations,

because these are tied partly to past wage increases.    Many

authors have suggested ideas along these lines; recent examples

include Blanchard and Katz (1997), Stiglitz (1997), Blinder

(2000), and DeLong (2000).    However, these authors seldom justify

their ideas about wage aspirations in much detail.    We will not

attempt a full theory of aspirations, but we will briefly review

some relevant literature.

     By "wage aspirations" we mean the real wages that workers

consider fair.   Our model rests on two assumptions about

aspirations: that they affect the actual wages that workers

receive, and that they are tied to past wage increases.     We



                                    3
discuss these points in turn.

     The assumption that wages depend on what workers consider

fair is a departure from neoclassical microeconomics, but one with

strong empirical support.   Akerlof and Yellen (1990) discuss a

likely channel: workers reduce their effort if they perceive

wages as unfair, making it in firms' interests to pay fair wages.

An experimental literature in psychology (surveyed by Akerlof and

Yellen) shows that workers’ performance deteriorates when they

believe wages are unfair.   Management textbooks such as Milkovich

and Newman (1996) stress the importance of paying fair wages to

elicit effort.   Bewley's (2000) field research suggests the

similar idea that firms pay fair wages to maintain worker morale.

     What wages do workers consider “fair?”   The psychology

literature suggests that workers judge the fairness of their wages

by comparing them to “reference transactions” –- certain   wages

they have observed in the past (see Kahneman et al., 1986, Oswald,

1986, and Elliot, 1991).    Researchers disagree about which wage

payments are the reference transactions for a given worker.     One

possibility is wages paid to the same worker in the past, and

another is wages paid to other workers of the same type.   When we

examine microeconomic data in Section VIII, we will ask whether a

worker’s wage is more closely tied to his own past wage or to

others’ wages.   However, this distinction is not crucial at an

aggregate level.   If wage setters base their actions on past

wages, aggregating across the economy yields a relationship

between current and past wage increases, regardless of whose past




                                    4
increases are relevant to individuals



III. THE PHILLIPS CURVE AND THE NAIRU

           This section embeds our ideas about wage aspirations in a

canonical model of wage- and price-setting and derives a Phillips

curve.            Specifically, the model follows Blanchard and Katz (1997)

and Katz and Krueger (1999) except for our treatment of

productivity and aspirations.

           A. Deriving the Phillips Curve

           We denote inflation by π and wage inflation by ω, so real

wage growth is ω-π.                              We assume that wage setters have a target for

real-wage growth given by

      (1)         (ω-π)* = α - γU + δθ + (1-δ)A + η ,                             α,γ>0, 0≤δ≤1 ,

where U is unemployment, θ is labor-productivity growth, A is an

aspiration wage increase, and η is an error term.                                       This equation

makes the conventional assumption that higher unemployment reduces

target real-wage growth.                                       The target also depends on an average of

productivity growth and the aspiration wage increase, which is

given by

                                        − β       ∞
      (2)                A      =
                                         β

  Note we assume that ideas about fairness concern wage increases rather than
wage levels. This seems natural because, with productivity increases and life-
cycle wage growth, workers are accustomed to fairly steady increases rather than
steady levels. We have, however, explored a version of our model in which
workers care about levels as well as growth rates. In this case, the Phillips
curve includes an “error-correction” term, the lagged difference between the
levels of productivity and real wages. This variable is never significant in
our regressions.



                                                                           5
           To interpret equations (1)-(2), consider first the special

case of δ=1.                    This is a neoclassical benchmark in which

productivity growth feeds one-for-one into wages, and aspirations

are irrelevant. At the other extreme of δ=0, productivity is

irrelevant and wage increases are based on aspirations.                                This

period's aspiration for a real-wage increase is a weighted average

of past increases, with exponentially declining weights.                                The

aspiration real-wage increase can also be written recursively as A

= βA-1 + (1-β)(ω-π)-1.                             As this shows, aspirations adjust over time

in response to the most recent wage increase.                                The adjustment is

fast if β is small and slow if β is close to one

           Our model nests the two special cases, allowing both

productivity growth and past real-wage growth to influence wage

setting.               Note we assume that these two variables have

coefficients that sum to one.                               This implies that the target

depends one-for-one on productivity growth in a steady state with

real-wage growth equal to productivity growth.

           Wage setters must choose nominal wages one period in advance.

    They choose a nominal increase ω equal to their target real wage

increase, (ω-π)*, plus expected inflation.                                Expected inflation

equals last period's inflation, π-1.                               Combining these assumptions

with equation (1) yields a "wage Phillips curve":

      (3)                ω       =      α + π-1 - γU + δθ + (1-δ)A + η .


  In our empirical work, we have experimented with alternatives to the
exponentially-declining weights in equation (2). For example, we have
defined A as a simple moving average of past real-wage changes. These



                                                               6
Wage inflation depends on past price inflation, unemployment, and

an average of θ and A.

         We complete the model with a standard equation for price

inflation:

    (4)                π      =      ω - θ + ν ,

where ν is another error.                                    Price inflation depends one-for-one on

the increase in unit labor costs, which is wage inflation minus

productivity growth.                              Substituting the wage Phillips curve into

(4) yields a "price Phillips curve":

    (5)                π = α + π-1 - γU - (1-δ)(θ-A) + ε ,

where ε=η+ν.                 This Phillips curve will be the centerpiece of our

empirical analysis.

         B. Discussion

         To interpret our Phillips curve, we again start with the case

of δ=1: target real-wage increases depend on productivity growth

but not on aspirations.                                  In this case, the θ-A term drops out of

(5), and the equation reduces to a conventional Phillips curve.

For δ=1, productivity growth has a negative effect on price

inflation given wage inflation, but it has a fully-offsetting

positive effect on wage inflation.                                                 Thus productivity growth has

no role in the Phillips curve.                                            Since δ=1 is a natural neoclassical

baseline, this result explains why research on the Phillips curve

does not usually emphasize productivity growth.

         Productivity growth does matter if wage growth is partly tied

                                                                               7
to past wage growth, i.e. δ<1.                                           Productivity growth is still

irrelevant in a steady state with θ=A.                                                       But if productivity growth

accelerates or decelerates, A does not adjust immediately, and θ-A

moves in the direction of θ.                                         A productivity acceleration causes a

favorable shift in the unemployment-inflation relation and a

slowdown causes an unfavorable shift.                                                      The shift can last a long

time if wage aspirations adjust slowly -- if β is close to one.

         While the aspiration variable A can differ from productivity

growth, the actual growth of real wages cannot.                                                                    Inverting the

price equation (4) gives a formula for actual real-wage growth: it

equals θ + ν.                   In equilibrium, this fact is reconciled with the

behavior of wage setters by movements in unemployment or

inflation.                During a productivity slowdown, target wage growth

rises relative to productivity growth for given unemployment, but

higher unemployment offsets this effect or accelerating inflation

reduces actual real-wage growth below the target.                                                                      Thus the model

captures the stylized fact that U.S. wages are closely tied to

labor productivity, as shown by the near-constancy of labor's

share of income.

         We define the NAIRU in our model as the level of unemployment

consistent with stable inflation and θ-A=0, which must hold in

steady state.                    The NAIRU equals α/γ, the ratio of the constant in

the Phillips curve to the unemployment coefficient.                                                                         If a

productivity acceleration raises θ-A above zero, we will say that

unemployment can fall below the NAIRU temporarily without

accelerating inflation, not that the NAIRU itself has fallen.     In

other words, we treat movements in θ-A as "supply shocks" that

shift the unemployment-inflation tradeoff for a given NAIRU.

     Our measurement of inflation and unemployment follows

previous work, especially Blanchard-Katz (1997) and Katz-Krueger

(1999).    The data are annual.   The inflation rate π is the change

in the log of the consumer price index, and the wage-inflation

rate ω is the change in the log of compensation per hour in the

business sector.    Unemployment is the unemployment rate for all

civilian workers.   All of these series are produced by the Bureau

of Labor Statistics.

     The rest of this section describes construction of the two

key variables in our theory: the growth rate of labor

productivity, and aspirations for real-wage growth.

    A. Measuring Productivity Growth

    Our starting point for measuring productivity growth is the

change in the log of output per hour in the business sector, from

the BLS.   As shown below, this series captures both the

productivity slowdown of the 1970s and the speedup since 1995.

For our present purposes, the reasons for these productivity

shifts are not important.   For example, we need not take a stand

on whether the recent acceleration in productivity reflects rapid

TFP growth or capital deepening.



                                     9
     A practical issue in measuring productivity is cyclical

adjustment.   Output per hour is an imperfect measure of labor

productivity because labor input varies through shifts in worker

effort as well as measured hours.    In particular, productivity

growth is overstated in expansions because effort rises.     In our

underlying theory, price- and wage-setting depend on true rather

than measured productivity, so we need to adjust our productivity

variable to eliminate the effects of cyclical movements in effort.

     Our approach to measuring true productivity follows Basu and

Kimball (1996), who build on Bils and Cho (1994).    Basu and

Kimball assume that, over the business cycle, effort moves

proportionately with average weekly hours of employed workers.

This relationship follows from a model in which firms costlessly

adjust both effort and weekly hours when they need more labor

input (but adjusting employment may be costly).    Empirically, a

close link between effort and weekly hours is supported by time-

motion studies that directly measure effort (Schor, 1987).      Given

this link, we can use variation in weekly hours as a proxy for

variation in effort.   To purge productivity fluctuations of the

part caused by changes in effort, we regress measured productivity

growth on the change in the log of weekly hours.    We use the

residuals from this regression to measure true productivity growth

θ, adding a constant to make the mean of θ equal the mean of

measured productivity growth.

     For 1962-2000, regressing measured productivity growth on the
                                                         *
change in log hours yields a coefficient of 0.66.    The # 2 is only



                                    10
0.06, however, which means our cyclical adjustment removes a small

fraction of productivity fluctuations.                               As a result, the adjusted

and unadjusted series for θ, shown in Figure 1, are not very

different.                  Our results confirm previous findings that measured

labor productivity is only mildly cyclical (unlike total factor

productivity).

           The series in Figure 1 capture the broad phenomena of the

productivity slowdown and the recent acceleration.                               With

cyclically-adjusted data, θ averages 3.3% over 1962-1973, 1.4% over

1974-1995, and 2.7% over 1996-2000.                                However, these broad trends

do not fully explain the data.                               There is considerable year-to-year

variation in productivity growth, even after our cyclical

adjustment.

           B. Wage Aspirations

           The most novel variable in our analysis is A, which

determines workers' aspirations for real-wage increases.                                In each

period, A is an exponentially-weighted average of past real-wage

increases (equation (2)).                               Two issues arise in constructing A: the

choice of the weighting parameter β, and the need to approximate

the infinite sum in the definition of A.                               We begin with the second

issue.

           In principle, A depends on real-wage increases back to the

infinite past.                       In practice, our data on real-wage growth start in

1948.           To address this problem, we make a reasonable guess of the


  As this fact suggests, our results below do not change much if we use the
unadjusted productivity-growth series. Similarly, changing the coefficient of
0.66 in our procedure does not make much difference.


                                                              11
value of A in 1948.                              Given this value, we can derive A for 1949,

1950,... using the recursive definition, A=βA-1+(1-β)(ω-π)-1.                                 That

is, we assume an A in 1948 and update A in each year based on the

evolution of real wages.

           Specifically, we set A for 1948 equal to trend real-wage

growth in that year, as measured by the Hodrick-Prescott filter

over 1948-2000 with smoothing parameter 1000.                                  This yields A=4.2%.

The implicit assumption is that wage aspirations in 1948 were

close to the actual trend in real wages: 1948 was not a time like

the 1970s or late 90s when aspirations and actual wage-growth

diverged.                Fortunately, our results are not very sensitive to the

choice of A for 1948, because our regressions use data starting in

1962.           The 1948 value of A has a weight of only β14 in the A for

1962, and smaller weights in later A's.

           The exponential parameter β can in principle be estimated

from the data.                       Our estimates are imprecise, however, and so we

end up imposing values that are plausible a priori and not
rejected by the data.                                   Figure 2 shows the series for actual real-

wage growth from 1948 through 2000 and for A with various values

of β.          Real-wage growth fluctuates around a trend that is stable

until the late 1960s and then declines as a result of the

productivity slowdown.                                  For most values of β, A follows the

downward trend in real-wage growth with a lag.                                  Real-wage growth


  We add a constant to the series on real-wage growth to make its mean equal the
mean of productivity growth. That is, we impose the restriction that there is
no trend in labor’s share of income. The means of real-wage growth and
productivity growth differ in the raw data, mainly because these variables are
constructed from price indices with different trends.


                                                                  12
rises sharply and aspirations modestly at the end of the sample.

     Much of our analysis will focus on the case of β=0.95.     A

fairly high β captures Stiglitz's (1997) suggestion that the

adjustment of aspirations to the 1970's productivity slowdown

continued into the 1990s.   Moreover, values of β that are much

smaller than 0.95 or very close to one are unappealing.    As

illustrated in Figure 2, values of 0.8 or below imply that

aspirations fluctuate substantially in response to year-to-year

movements in real-wage growth.    It seems unlikely that concepts of

fair wages fluctuate so much.    At the other extreme, a β of one

implies that workers still want the wage increases they received

in the 1950s.   In this case, the real-wage growth of the last five

years falls short of aspirations, even though it is high compared

to the previous 25 years.

     For β=0.95, Figure 3 shows the difference θ-A, the new term

that appears in our Phillips curve, for 1962-2000.    To isolate

long-run trends, the Figure also presents a smoothed version of
the series based on the Hodrick-Prescott filter with a parameter

of 1000.   The recent "New Economy" can be seen in the high values

of θ-A for 1996-2000: the average value for this period is the

highest for any five-year period since 1948.    θ-A was high after

1995 because θ rose sharply and A reached low levels after finally

adjusting to the productivity slowdown.    θ was higher in the 1950s

and 60s, but then it was balanced by high wage aspirations.

V. ESTIMATES OF THE PHILLIPS CURVE

     This section estimates the Phillips curve from our model,

equation (5), with annual U.S. data.         We examine the general

performance of the equation by estimating it with data from 1962

through 1995.      We then perform out-of-sample forecasts to see

whether the equation explains inflation in the post-1995 New

Economy.

     A. A Conventional Phillips Curve

     As a benchmark, we first examine a Phillips curve that lacks

our new variable θ-A.     This is a simple textbook equation: the

change in inflation depends on a constant and unemployment. As

discussed above, this equation follows from our model if wage

growth depends one-for-one on productivity growth and aspirations

have no effect.

     For 1962-1995 -- the Old-Economy period -- ordinary-least-

squares estimation of the Phillips curve yields
                                    *
     ∆π    =   4.41 - 0.710U ,      # 2=0.34 ,

               (1.14) (0.161)

where standard errors are in parentheses.        These results look

reasonable.      One point-year of unemployment reduces inflation by

seven tenths of a percent.       The NAIRU -- the ratio of the constant

to minus the unemployment coefficient -- is 6.2%.

     Using these estimates, we next compute forecasts of inflation

over 1996-2000, given the actual evolution of unemployment.

Figure 4 plots the forecasts along with two-standard-error bands,

and compares them to actual inflation.        This Figure shows why many



                                        14
authors have suggested that a New Economy has arrived.                             Since

unemployment falls far below the NAIRU estimate of 6.2%, predicted

inflation rises rapidly and reaches 8.3% in 2000.                             In contrast,

actual inflation fluctuates mildly and ends at 3.3%.                             The

overprediction of inflation with a 6.2% NAIRU suggests that the

NAIRU has fallen for some reason.

           B. The Phillips Curve with θ-A

           We now estimate the Phillips curve from our model, equation

(5). This is the conventional Phillips curve estimated above with

the addition of the term θ-A.

           Our modification of the Phillips introduces the parameter β,

the weighting factor in the formula for A.                             Table 1 presents

Phillips-curve estimates for 1962-1995 with different values of β

imposed.               The Table also reports joint estimates of β and the

Phillips-curve coefficients obtained by non-linear least squares.

The NLLS estimate of β is imprecise: a two-standard-error

confidence interval runs from 0.01 to 1.03.                             This reflects the
                                                                                           *
fact that a wide range of β’s fit the data equally well: the # 2's

are close when different values of β are imposed.                             The point

estimate of β is 0.52, which is far from the value of 0.95 that we

suggested a priori.                              However, there is little evidence against

β=0.95: an F-test of this hypothesis yields F=2.24 (p=0.15).

    

  This F-test compares the sum of squared residuals with and without the
restriction that β=0.95. Following Staiger et al. (1998), we use this test
because it appears more accurate than a test based on the asymptotic standard
error.


                                                             15
     Fortunately, we can draw conclusions from the data without

knowing the value of β.   As illustrated in Table 1, the

coefficient on θ-A is significantly negative for all β’s from zero

to one.   Thus, as implied by our model, a rise in productivity
growth relative to wage aspirations has a negative effect on

inflation.   The coefficient on θ-A is usually near -0.6.    In terms

of underlying parameters, this means that the aspiration term A

has a weight of 0.6 in the formula for target wage-growth

(equation (1)) and productivity growth has a weight of 0.4.     The
*
# 2's for the various β’s lie between 0.5 and 0.6, compared to 0.34

for the equation without θ-A.   Thus our new variable explains a

significant part of inflation variation over 1962-1995.

     Figure 5 shows forecasts of inflation over 1996-2000 for

various values of β.   In most cases, adding θ-A to the Phillips

curve greatly improves the accuracy of forecasts.    For β’s ranging

from 0.5 to 0.95, predicted inflation stays close to actual

inflation throughout the period, and ends up lower by

statistically insignificant amounts.    For β=0.95, predicted

inflation in 2000 is 2.1%.   Thus our model eliminates the

overprediction of inflation that arises with the usual Phillips

curve.    Our equation predicts that inflation stays low despite low

unemployment because the productivity acceleration produces high

values of θ-A.

     The only qualification is that our equation overpredicts

inflation if β is very close to one.    As discussed above, β=1 means


                                   16
that wage aspirations over 1996-2000 are still tied to the rapid

wage growth of the 1950s.     In this case, θ-A is negative for most

of 1996-2000, so adding it to the model does not reduce inflation

forecasts.   Our story about the New Economy depends on the

assumption that β<1: there must be some adjustment of aspirations

over time.

     C. Short-Run and Long-Run Variation in θ-A

     Our results partly reflect broad trends in the data.       In the

early 1970s, the productivity slowdown reduced θ-A, and the

unemployment-inflation tradeoff worsened; these facts help produce

the negative coefficient on θ-A in the pre-1996 Phillips curve.

Similarly, the success of our model over 1996-2000 reflects the

fact that θ-A rose while the output-inflation tradeoff improved.

However, these broad trends are not the only reason for our
model's success.   As shown in Figure 3, there is considerable

year-to-year variation in θ-A because of fluctuations in θ.       These

movements also help explain shifts in the U/π relation.

     To make this point, we decompose the variable θ-A (for β=0.95)

into two components: a trend, given by the HP-filter in Figure 3,

and deviations from the trend.        For 1962-1995, entering these

components separately in the Phillips curve yields the regression

     ∆π = 3.19 - 0.719U - 1.080(θ-A)T - 0.568(θ-A)D ,

         (1.15) (0.210)     (0.412)         (0.174)

where (θ-A)T is the trend component of θ-A and (θ-A)D is the

deviation from trend.   Both components have statistically


                                       17
significant effects.   The point estimate is higher for the trend

component, but one cannot reject the hypothesis that the two

coefficients are equal (p=0.17).    Thus both long-term and short-

term movements in θ-A have the effects predicted by our theory.

     Researchers often give different interpretations of long-term

and year-to-year shifts in the U/π relation.    The former are

interpreted as shifts in the NAIRU, and the latter as "supply" or

"inflation" shocks.    This is the case, for example, in the Kalman-
filter approach to estimating time-varying NAIRUs (e.g. Gordon,

1998).   In contrast, our results suggest that parts of the short-

term and long-term shifts in the U/π relation have a common

explanation.

     D. Is Low Unemployment Sustainable?

     This paper is written for a conference on the

"sustainability" of today's low unemployment.     At first glance,

our analysis appears to have pessimistic implications about

sustainability.    The Phillips curve has shifted favorably because

a productivity acceleration has produced positive values of θ-A.

But when productivity growth stabilizes, aspirations for real-wage

growth will eventually adjust to the new trend.    In the long run

we must see values of θ-A that average to zero, implying a worse

U/π tradeoff than in the recent period of positive θ-A's.

     On the other hand, it will not be necessary for future

unemployment to rise back to the level thought to be the NAIRU in

the mid-1990s.    The apparent NAIRU has fallen in 1996-2000

relative to 1962-1995 both because θ-A has been positive in the


                                   18
recent period and because it was negative on average in the

earlier period.                         The average θ-A before 1996 was negative because,

as shown in Figures 1-3, A lagged behind the falling θ during the

productivity slowdown. In steady state, the economy must give up

the gains from today's positive θ-A's, but not the gains from

eliminating negative θ-A's.                             In other words, the true NAIRU is

higher than the apparent NAIRU of today, but lower than the

apparent NAIRU before 1996, when unemployment was raised by slow

adjustment of aspirations to the productivity slowdown.

           Specifically, recall that a Phillips curve for 1962-1995

without the θ-A term yields a NAIRU estimate of 6.2%.                            In contrast,

the equation with θ-A implies a NAIRU of 5.1% (for β=0.95).                            5.1%

is our estimate of the unemployment rate consistent with stable

inflation when θ-A equals zero.                            If the true Phillips curve has not

shifted since 1995, our equation implies that unemployment must
eventually rise to 5.1% from its 2000 level of 4.2%.                             But it need

not rise to the 6.2% level suggested by a conventional Phillips
curve.



VI. EXTENSIONS

           This section considers various extensions of our time-series

analysis.

           A. The Wage Phillips Curve

    

  Following Staiger et al., we can construct confidence intervals for the NAIRU
by performing a series of F-tests for whether the NAIRU equals various values. A
95% confidence interval is (3.5, 5.9). This confidence interval becomes (3.8,
6.1) when lagged inflation changes are added to the Phillips curve to eliminate


                                                            19
         So far we have focused on our model's implications for price

inflation.                To further test the model, we now turn to the wage

Phillips curve, equation (3).                                          Recall that wage inflation depends

on lagged price inflation, unemployment, and a weighted average of

θ and A.             We also consider the neoclassical special case in which

the weight on θ is fixed at one.

         Table 2 presents estimates of wage Phillips curves for 1962-

1995 (β=0.95).                     These estimates support the model.                                                     The estimated

weights on θ and A are 0.16 and 0.84; the weight on θ is smaller

than the weight implied by the price Phillips curve, but the

difference is not statistically significant.                                                               The hypothesis of a

unit weight on θ is strongly rejected.                                                       When we relax the

restriction that the θ and A coefficients sum to one, it is not

rejected (p=0.76).

         Using the estimates for 1962-1995, Table 2 also reports

forecast errors for ω-π-1 after 1995.                                                   The results parallel those

for price Phillips curves.                                      The neoclassical equation overpredicts

wage inflation relative to π-1 by a total of 6.4 percentage points.

This equation assumes that wage growth rises one-for-one with the

productivity acceleration, when in fact the effect was much

smaller.             Our wage Phillips curve is more accurate: it

underpredicts wage growth by an insignificant amount.

         B. Additional Phillips-Curve Variables

         Most authors who estimate Phillips curves include additional

variables, in particular lags of unemployment and inflation

changes and measures of supply shocks (e.g. Gordon, 1998; Staiger

et al., 1997).                       Here we check the robustness of our conclusions to

adding such variables.                                  We experiment with two lags of the change

in inflation; unemployment lags are never significant, so we omit

results with these variables.                                 We measure supply shocks with three

standard variables: the change in the relative price of food and

energy, the change in the trade-weighted real exchange rate, and

for 1962-1995.                       We estimate equations with and without the three

supply shocks, with and without the two ∆π lags, and with and

without θ-A, in all possible combinations.                                  In all cases, we set

β=0.95 in calculating A. There are two robust conclusions.                                     First,

the three supply shocks are jointly significant and so are the two

∆π lags, regardless of whether θ-A is included.                                  The various

coefficients have reasonable signs and magnitudes.                                  Including all
                                                                      *
the variables (column (8)) yields an # 2 of 0.81.

           Second, the term θ-A remains significant in all the

specifications.                         However, the magnitude of the coefficient falls

when additional variables are included.                                   In the most general

specification, the coefficient is -0.32 (t=3.3), compared to -0.62

  The change in the relative price of food and energy is the log change in the

to make their means equal zero. The Nixon dummy equals 0.5 in 1972 and 1973, -

                                                                 21
when the supply shocks and ∆π lags are excluded.

         Figure 6 shows forecasts of inflation for 1996-2000 based on

the 1962-1995 estimates.                              The four panels give results with and

without the supply shocks and with and without inflation lags.                                In

each case, we show actual inflation and forecasts that arise when

θ-A is included and when it is excluded.                             The forecasts vary across

specifications, but again broad conclusions emerge.

         First, if one leaves θ-A out of the Phillips curve, accounting

for supply shocks reduces the overprediction of inflation by only

a moderate amount.                           When supply shocks are included, predicted

inflation stays low through 1998, because the dollar appreciates

and energy prices fall in 1998.                             But predicted inflation rises

sharply in 1999-2000 as the appreciation slows and energy prices

rise.         In the most general specification without θ-A, predicted

inflation reaches 6.4% in 2000, compared to 8.3% in the simplest

Phillips curve.

         Second, including θ-A always reduces predicted inflation by a

large amount.                    In most cases in Figure 6, adding θ-A turns an

overprediction of inflation into a fairly accurate prediction.                                In

one case, it turns a moderate overprediction into a moderate

underprediction.

         Finally, our most general specification – the one including θ-

A, supply shocks, and ∆π lags -- produces remarkably accurate

  The proper interpretation of the lower coefficient is not clear. According to
our model, it implies a lower coefficient on A in the target-wage equation and a
higher coefficient on θ. However, estimating these coefficients from wage-

forecasts throughout the 1996-2000 period.                                                             In the first three

years, the combination of the productivity acceleration and

favorable supply shocks more than offsets the effect of falling

unemployment, and inflation is predicted to fall modestly.                                                                                   In

1999 and 2000, when productivity growth stays high but the supply

shocks reverse, inflation is predicted to rise modestly. Actual

inflation follows a path very close to this predicted one.

         C. Time-Varying NAIRUs

         The recent behavior of unemployment and inflation has

suggested to many observers that the NAIRU has fallen.                                                                             This idea

has increased interest in estimating Phillips curves with time-

varying NAIRUs (e.g. Staiger et al. and Gordon).                                                                     So far this

paper has estimated constant-NAIRU models.                                                             However, our idea that

such a model forecasts inflation better when θ-A is included can be

turned around to say there is less time-variation in the NAIRU

once θ-A is included.                               In particular, the NAIRU falls less since

1995 if we account for the anti-inflationary role of the

productivity acceleration.                                      Here we explore this version of our

story.

         We estimate time-varying NAIRUs in the following way.                                                                               We

start with the simple Phillips curves we have already estimated.

Shocks to these equations cause fluctuations in the level of

unemployment consistent with stable inflation. For example, in
1974 it would have taken very high unemployment to offset the OPEC

shock and keep inflation stable.                                               As discussed earlier, economists

  
rather than price-Phillips curves yields an A coefficient above 0.7 regardless
of whether supply shocks and inflation lags are included.


                                                                              23
generally do not interpret such shocks as year-to-year

fluctuations in the NAIRU.       Instead, they assume the NAIRU changes

gradually, and interpret shifts in the U/π relation as NAIRU shifts

only if they appear persistent.      In this spirit, we define the

time-varying NAIRU as the long-term component of movements in the

U/π relation.

     Specifically, consider two Phillips curves:

   (6a)   ∆π    =   -γ(U-UN) ;

          ∆π
                          N
   (6b)         =   -γ(U-U ) + (1-δ)(θ-A) .

If UN is a constant, these reduce to the Phillips curves with and

without θ-A that we estimate above.        We impose values of γ and (1-

δ) obtained by estimating constant-UN equations over 1962-2000:

γ=0.636 in (6a) and γ=0.668, (1-δ)=0.550 in (6b).       Given these

coefficients and the data on ∆π, U, and θ-A, each equation defines

a series for UN over 1962-2000. In (6a), UN is the unemployment

rate that would produce stable inflation; in (6b) it is the

unemployment rate that would produce stable inflation if θ-A=0.

Finally, we extract a long-term trend from each UN series using the

Hodrick-Prescott filter with parameter 1000.        These smoothed

series are our measures of time-varying NAIRUs.

     Figure 8 presents the UN and smoothed-UN series for each

equation.      Note first that the average UN is 6.0% when θ-A is

excluded from the Phillips curve and 5.2% when it is included.

This result confirms our earlier finding that including θ-A reduces

the NAIRU when it is assumed to be fixed.        The new result is that


                                      24
adding θ-A also reduces the time-variation in the NAIRU. When θ-A

is excluded, the smoothed UN rises by 1.7 percentage points from

1962 to 1979, then falls by 1.9 points from 1979 to 2000.   This

hump-shaped path is similar to the NAIRU behavior estimated by

previous authors.   When θ-A is included, by contrast, the NAIRU

rises only 0.7 points from 1962 to 1980, and remains almost

constant thereafter.   The NAIRU fall from 1990 to 2000 -- a rough

measure of the New-Economy effect -- is 1.2 points without θ-A but

less than 0.1 points with θ-A.   Once our new variable is included,

there is no need to search for explanations for a falling NAIRU.

     The choice of a smoothing parameter for the HP filter is

arbitrary.   Reducing the parameter increases the time-variation in

both NAIRU series, but does not change the result that the NAIRU

is more stable when θ-A is included.



VII. THE CHILEAN MIRACLE

     So far we have focused on the United States.   It is natural

to ask whether our theory also explains apparent Phillips-curve

shifts in other countries.   The experience of the 1970s suggests

that it does.   Productivity growth slowed throughout the OECD

during the 70s, and the NAIRU appeared to rise in most countries.

Grubb et al. (1982) and many others discuss this experience.

     Unfortunately, it is difficult to produce international

evidence for our theory beyond a broad observation about the

1970s.   One might hope to find a cross-country relation between

the size of productivity slowdowns or speedups and the size of


                                  25
NAIRU shifts.   A look at OECD data suggests, however, that no

clear relation exists.   The problem is that the NAIRU has moved

sharply in many countries for reasons unrelated to our model,

involving labor-market institutions and long-run effects of

monetary policy (see Blanchard and Wolfers, 1999, and Ball, 1999).

These NAIRU movements usually swamp the effects of productivity

shifts that we would like to detect.

     The good news is that the cross-country data yield one useful

case study: Chile in the 1990s.   Chile experienced a major

productivity acceleration during this period, one which is usually

attributed to economic liberalization.    Figure 8 plots the growth

rate of labor productivity in Chile for 1976-1997 (measured as the

change in log output per worker, from World Development

Indicators).    Average productivity growth was 0.85 percent over

the ten years from 1977 to 1987 and 4.96 percent over 1987-1997.

The increase of 4.11 percent is much larger than the recent

productivity acceleration in the United States.

     Indeed, the Chilean episode is an outlier in international

data.    There are 40 countries for which 20 or more years of data

on productivity growth are available from either the World

Development Indicators or the OECD.     (The starting dates range

from 1961 to 1977 and the ending dates from 1992 to 2000.)    For

each of these countries, we compute the largest productivity

acceleration, defined as the largest difference between average

productivity growth in a ten-year period and the previous ten

years.    For Chile, the largest acceleration is the 4.11 percent

increase between 1977-1987 and 1987-1997.    This is the largest



                                   26
acceleration for any country in the sample.   The country with the

next largest acceleration is Jamaica, with 3.27%, but this

reflects an increase from -4.39 percent to -1.12 percent.    After

that comes Thailand, with an acceleration of 2.96 percent from

1976-86 to 1986-96.   Only three other countries have accelerations

above 2% starting from positive initial growth rates.    Thus

Chile's productivity acceleration is more than twice the largest

one experienced by most countries, and more than a full point

above the second-best in the sample (ignoring Jamaica).

     If productivity shifts affect the Phillips curve, there

should have been a favorable Phillips-curve shift in Chile. And

there was.   The shift took a different form than the recent shift

in the U.S.: it showed up mainly as falling inflation with stable

unemployment rather than vice-versa.    That is, Chile had the rare

experience of a costless disinflation.   Research has shown that a

substantial reduction in inflation almost always reduces output

and raises unemployment in the short run.   For example, Ball

(1994) examines 28 disinflations in OECD countries and finds

output losses in 27 of them.   Dornbusch and Fischer (1993) find

that disinflations from moderate levels reduce output in middle-

income countries as well.

     Chile is a stark exception to this stylized fact.    Figure 9

plots inflation, unemployment, and output growth from 1985 through

1997 (after which the miracle was interrupted by the world

financial crisis).    As shown in the Figure, inflation peaked at

26% in 1990 and then fell steadily, reaching 3% in 1997.    But one

can see no adverse effects on the real economy. Unemployment fell



                                   27
from 9.6% in 1990 to 6.6% in 1997.                        Output growth was 3.7% in 1990

and exceeded 5% in every year from 1991 through 1997.

        Thus the Chilean episode combined an unusual productivity

acceleration with an unusual shift in the Phillips curve.                        It

stands out from the cross-country data on both counts.                       Of course

the Phillips curve might have shifted for some other reason, but

we doubt it.                 A leading view within Chile is that inflation

expectations shifted because the central bank introduced a

credible inflation target (e.g. Corbo, 1998).                       However, other

countries have adopted inflation targets, and research has not

detected a favorable effect on the Phillips curve.                       Disinflations

usually cause recessions even under inflation targeting (Bernanke

et al., 2001).



VIII. MICRO EVIDENCE

        So far we have examined aggregate relations among

productivity growth, unemployment, and wage and price inflation.

We now turn to micro evidence on wage changes for individual

workers to corroborate our aggregate findings and to explore the

formation of wage aspirations in more detail. Our model assumes

that workers use lagged wage increases to form their wage

aspirations, but at an individual level we must be more specific

about which lagged wages are relevant. In the language of

Kahneman et al. (1986), we are interested in who forms the

“reference group” that a worker compares himself to in judging the

fairness of his wage.

 The data on inflation and output are from the Bank of Chile.             The data on


                                                     28
         We consider two alternative assumptions about reference

groups.           The first is that workers form aspirations based on the

lagged wages of workers who have the same level of skill and

belong to the same birth cohort.                                               This idea generalizes the

concept that workers use their own, individual lagged wages to

form aspirations.                         (The idea that a worker examines only his own

past wage and nobody else’s seems overly narrow, and also requires

panel data that are not available. )                                                   Our second hypothesis is that

workers form aspirations based on lagged wages of other cohorts at

the same age and skill level; that is, a worker of age a in year t

bases his aspirations on the wages of workers of age a in years t-

1, t-2, and so on.                           The difference in these two hypotheses relates

to the familiar demographic distinction between “cohort” and

“period” effects.

         Following Katz and Krueger (1999), we use individual data

from the Current Population Survey (CPS).                                                           The May CPS is

available from 1973-1978 and data for the Outgoing Rotation Group

are available from 1979-1999.                                          We use both hourly wage and weekly

wage measures, for the latter are measured more reliably.                                                                                  Like

Katz and Krueger, we measure skill by education level and consider

four education groups: less than high school, high school, some

college, and college degree or more.                                                    We use data on workers aged

25-64 over the 1973-1999 period, and group workers by five-year

birth cohorts ranging from 1916-20 to 1971-75.                                                                  Our data cover a

total of 888 year-education-cohort cells.

  One might use the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), but its
sample is too small to allow disaggregation by skill group.


                                                                              29
     The equation we estimate is a micro version of the wage

Phillips curve presented earlier:

  (7)     ω(e,c,t) - π(t-1) = a(e) + b(t) + τ1(age) + τ2(age)2

                                   - γU(e,t) + (1-δ)A(e,c,t) ,

where ω(e,c,t) is wage inflation for education group e and cohort

c in year t; π(t-1) is price inflation at t-1; U(e,t) are

BLS-published unemployment rates by education group; and A(e,c,t)

is an average of past wage growth.       A is constructed in the same

way as before, using a β of 0.95 and an HP-filtered value for the

start of the process in 1974 -- but using, in one case, a cohort's

own lagged-wage-growth profiles and, in the other, the wage growth

of workers of the cohort’s current age in past years. We include a

quadratic in age to capture life-cycle patterns in wage growth,

and dummies for education groups and for years.      Including these

variables means that the coefficient on A is determined by the

cross-sectional relation between year-to-year changes in A for

different education and birth-year groups and changes in real-wage

growth.

     The major difference between equation (7) and the aggregate

equations estimated earlier is the absence of a productivity

variable.    Unfortunately, productivity data are unavailable for

education groups and other disaggregate portions of the labor

force, and hence it must be omitted.       The education and year

dummies and the age variables capture productivity growth that is

common to all groups in each year (i.e., aggregate) as well as

productivity growth that is common to each education and age group


                                    30
in all years.   It omits the portion of productivity growth that is

specific to different education groups in different years.

However, productivity shocks of this kind should be orthogonal to

lagged wages and hence to A, and thus should not bias the

coefficients.

     The top panel of Table 4 shows our initial estimation

results.   We denote the aspirations variable by AC when it is

constructed from a cohort’s own lagged wages, and by AA when it is

based on wages of workers of the same age.     The unemployment

coefficients in the regressions are significantly negative, as

expected, albeit smaller than in the aggregate results.       Most

important, the aspirations variables are all positive and

significant.    Thus the micro data corroborate our aggregate

finding that wage growth is tied to lagged wages.     The effect is

significant when aspirations are measured by either AC or AA.

     While significant, the coefficients on aspirations are

smaller in our initial micro regressions than in our aggregate

regressions.    However, a common problem with micro data is that

regressors based on lagged dependent variables are noisy and

contain large random fluctuations.      It is unlikely that

individuals change their aspirations in response to these

fluctuations and, indeed, a certain fraction represents sheer

measurement error.   The consequence of this problem, which is

formally equivalent to an errors-in-variables problem, is

downward bias in the coefficients.      To remedy the problem, we

replace the raw aspirations variables with variables that are

smoothed over year, education, and age.      The results are shown in



                                   31
the lower panel of Table 4.                              The coefficients on A rise

substantially, and reach magnitudes close to those obtained with

aggregate data.                          This result strongly suggests the presence of

errors-in-variables bias in the raw data.

            Table 5 shows the results of including both aspirations

variables, AC and AA, in the model at the same time.                             The two

coefficients are both smaller than in Table 4, but they are both

significant and they are close to each other in size.                             This result

suggests that, in forming ideas about fair wage increases, workers

put roughly equal weight on their own past experience and on the

wage growth of similar workers in the past.

            Tests reveal no significant differences across the four

education groups in the coefficients on unemployment and

aspirations.                     That is, while unemployment and lagged wages move in

different ways for different groups, the effects of given

movements on wage growth are the same.

            Further inspection of the data reveals that A has been

drifting upward for the more educated groups and downward for the

less educated groups, thus producing very different patterns of

wage growth.                        Note that A represents real-wage growth in the

past, not the level of the wage, so this is not necessarily to be

expected from the well-known increasing dispersion of wages by

education level.                           Instead, it implies that the spreading out

accelerated over most of the period we examine.                             Because A has

declined so severely for the less educated group, the average A

less-educated groups experienced above-average real-wage growth in

the second half of the 1990s, which slowed the decline in A for

those groups.



IX. CONCLUSION

     This paper proposes a new variable for the Phillips curve:

the difference between productivity growth and an average of past

real-wage growth.   Theoretically, this variable appears if

workers' aspirations for real-wage increases adjust slowly to

shifts in productivity growth.   Empirically, our new variable

shows up strongly in the U.S. Phillips curve.   Including it

explains the otherwise-puzzling shift in the unemployment-

inflation relation since 1995.

     Our theory contributes to a parsimonious interpretation of

macroeconomic history.   It yields a unified explanation of why

unemployment rose during the productivity slowdown of the 1970s

and why it fell after 1995.   The theory also explains part of the

year-to-year fluctuations in the unemployment-inflation tradeoff

as arising from fluctuations in productivity growth.   Finally, our

story links two features of the post-1995 New Economy.     The

Phillips curve shift was caused by the productivity acceleration

rather than happening to occur at the same time for some other

reason.

     In the mid-1990s, the consensus estimate of the NAIRU was 6%.

Since then, unemployment has fallen near 4%, and inflation has not

risen substantially.   Our results suggest that the non-



                                  33
inflationary fall in unemployment is partly but not entirely

sustainable.   The economy has moved from a regime in which wage

aspirations exceed productivity growth, raising unemployment, to

one in which aspirations are below productivity growth.

Eventually the economy must move toward a steady state in between.

We estimate the NAIRU in this steady state to be around 5.1%.
