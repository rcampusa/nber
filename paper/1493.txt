       In this paper, a vector autoregression model (VAR) is proposed in order

to test uncovered interest parity (UIP) in the foreign exchange market.

Consider a VAR system of the spot exchange rate (yen/dollar), the domestic

(US)    interest rate and the foreign (Japanese) interest rate, describing the

interdependence      of the domestic and international        financial   markets.

Uncovered interest parity is stated as a null hypothesis that the current

difference between the two interest rates is equal to the difference between

the expected future (log of) exchange rate and the (log of) current spot

exchange rate.     Note that the VAR system will yield the expected future spot

exchange rate as a k—step ahead unconditional prediction.        Henceç the null
hypothesis is    stated   as nonlinear cross—equational restrictions for the three—

equation VAR system. Then UIP is tested by the Wald test between the
unrestricted and restricted systems.          A test of UIP with a maintained
hypothesis of covered interest parity, becomes a hypothesis test of efficiency

without risk premium, that is,         the forward exchange rate is   the unbiased
predictor    of the future spot exchange rate, and information is efficiently

used in its prediction.       Our results are compared to the efficiency test with

a single equation using the Hansen—Hodrick procedure for the same data set.

I. Introduction
        In        this paper, a vector autoregressions (VAR) model is proposed as a

framework conducive to a new way of testinq uncovered interest parity in the

foreign exchange market.          Uncovered interest parity is a hypothesis that the

current difference between the interest rates of two countries is equal to the

difference between the expected future <log—) exchange rate and the current

spot <log—) exchange rate. That is, a gain from investing in an asset denorni—

nated        in    a foreign currency is equal to an expected depreciation loss.     A

difficulty in obtaining the expected future spot exchange rate is an apparent

stumbling block in testing this hypothesis.            This paper proposes to use a

vector autoregressions model, which includes as endogenous variables at least

the interest rates of the both countries and the exchange rate.            Considering

the interdependence among domestic and international financial variables, the

use of a VAR mode1 to describe the dynamic movement of the exchange rate is

most appropriate.1           Note that such a VAR system yields the expected future

spot exchange rate as a k—step ahead unconditional prediction.            Hence, the

null hypothesis of uncovered interest parity can be expressed as nonlinear

cross—equational restrictions for the VAR system,              if   the observational

frequency is finer than the length of forward contracts.            Uncovered interest

parity is tested using the Wald test which is asymptotically the same with the

likelihood ratio test of unrestricted and restricted systems.

    A test of uncovered interest parity has been a popular topic of investi-

gation, partly because uncovered interest parity <UIP) becomes a hypothesis of

market efficiency without risk premium in the foreign exchange market, when

covered interest parity (CIP) is holding true.            In the absence of capital

controls, covered interest arbitrage must equalize net yields of assets

denominated          in differrent currencies taking into account the forward premium

or discount. The combination of UIP with CIP implies that the forward rate is
the unbiased predictor of the future exchange rate, one of the conditions for

the market efficiency.

     The efficiency hypothesis, or uncovered interest parity (given covered

interest parity), has been studied extensively for many currency and asset

coinbinat ions.   Most existing studies on a test of the efficiency hypothesis

use a single equation involving the forward and spot exchange rates.               See

Cumby and Obstfeld (1982), Frenkel (1981), Gregory and McCurdy (1984), and

Hansen and Hodrick (1980), to name a few.                 The test consists of the

unbiasedness of the forward exchange rate as a predictor of the future spot

exchange rate and the orthogonal ity of deviations with other information such

as the past forecast errors.             It is well—known that when the observational

frequency is finer than the length of forward contract, the error term has

serial correlation which invalidate the usual t—test.             It is notable that

Hansen and I-1odrick established a method to test the unbiasedness in such a

case in the single—equation hypothesis test.

        The test proposed in      this   paper is quite different from existing tests.

In this paper, a vector autoregressions model with the spot exchange rate, the

domestic interest rate and foreign interest rate is considered.                    The

(rationally) expected future spot exchange rate is calculated a; the k—step

ahead prediction of the vector autoregressions model, while the forward

exchange    rate is calculated from the current interest rates and the exchange
rate.      Thus, equivalence of the forward exchange rate and the future spot
exchange rate      is      stated as cross—equational constraints in        the vector
autoregressions model. The proposed method has several                advantages over

existing    methods with    a   single equation.
        First, the cross—equational constraints as a testing hypothesis does not
suffer from a problem of serially—correlated          disturbances even when the obser—



                                             2
vational frequency is finer than the contract frequency, since the vector

autoregressions model     is constructed such that     it has white noise as
disturbances.     Second, an in4orrnation set on which the expectation is condi-

tioned is fully spelled out by the choice of variables for the VAR system.

Thus the cross—equational costraint represents not only the unbiasedness of

the forward rate but also the efficient use of information in the linear

system.    Third, the proposed test       in this paper is a test of uncovered

interest parity which is theoretically separate from a test of unbiasedness of

the forward rate, unl ike the conventional way of testing uncovered interest

parity (cf. Curnby and Obstfeld (1982)) by the test of unbiasedness of the

forward rate.      In other words, we can test UIP by the method in this paper

even    in the absence of CIP.   The proposed method could test UIP even without

observing forward rate.     If financial investments are freely permitted but if

formation of the forward market is somehow prohibited or distorted,          the

                                                                         2
traditional method could not test UIP, while the proposed method could.

       Remarks on related works are in order.         There are a few vector

autoregressions studies     in the foreign exchange market.   Meese and Rogoff

<1983:) studied predictive powers of various structual models as well as vector

regressions models, but did not test the efficiency hypothesis.        Baillie,

Lippens and McMahon (1983) tested efficiency using a bivariate autoregression

model including the forward and spot exchange rates.      However, they had to

take first differences to obtain covariance stationarity.       In this paper,

using two interest rates and the spot exchange rate, covariance stationarity

is obtained without taking the first differences. This makes the test in this

paper stronger than the one by Gaul le, et. al (1983).

       The proposed test of the efficiency hypothesis as cross—equational

restrictions in a VAR model        is reminiscent of the test of (rational)

expectations hypothesis, proposed by Sargent (1979), in the term structure of


                                      3
interest rates.3      The similarity is not surprising considering the common

feature in that the expectation is calculated as a k—step ahead prediction in

the VAR system.       However, the hypothesis of uncovered interest parity is

formed quite differently from the expectations hypothesis of the term

structure.

     Sect ion 2 describes the proposed test.      In section 3, we check whether

covered interest parity is holding for the data we use, so that whether the

test of uncovered interest parity can be regarded as the test of efficiency

hypothesis. It will be shown that covered interest parity is holding between

in the Euro—yen and Euro—dollar deposit rates for the period from 1975 to

1983, and also between the Japanese domestic interest rate and Euro—dollar

deposit rate from 1979 on.     Therefore, a test of uncovered interest parity is

equivalent to a test of efficiency for those period.       The proposed test of

uncovered interest parity is carried out in section 4. Monthly data of three—

month interest rates of various assets for various subperiods between 1972 to

1984. For the interest rates, both onshore and offshore rates are used. The

result is mixed.     IAith a full sample involving the onshore interest rate, the

hypothesis is rejected. However, in the Euro market, the hypothesis cannot be

rejected.      In section 5 results according to the proposed test is compared to

results obtained from applying Hansen—Hodrick procedure involving the single—

equation of the spot and forward exchange rates.      There is no evidence that

one test favors the acceptance of the hypothesis.


II. A Test of Uncovered Interest Parity

     It      is widely accepted that a VAR model is a powerful method to form

forecasts without imposing "incredible identification restrictions. Although

we know that financial variables, in particular the exchange rates and

interest rates, are interdependent, the exact "structural" relationship is not


                                       4
a priori determined. Moreover, there is no evidence that an of the variables

is strictly exogenous to the others.                           In such a framework the use of a VAR

model to obtain the forecast of a variable of a concern is a natural solution.

        Consider a system of the logarithm of the spot exchange rate,                                     the
domestic interest rate, RUSt, and the foreign interest rate, RJAt, which                                      is

estimated to study the interdependence of the domestic and international

financial markets:


        x = d     + E A.x              + e
         t
                      j=l J t—J           t                                                           (2.1)


where      x, =           RUSt,
                                       RJAt)', d =    (d,      d, dJ)' being a deterministic factor,
and       et being white noise.                  Ito (1983b) studied the causality among the

variables and dynamic responces to a shock in such a system.                                 In this paper,

the same VAR system is used as a framework for testing a hypothesis.                                          In

particular, uncovered interest parity will be derived as nonlinear cross—

equational constraints in the VAR system.

      Now let us take the case of monthly observations of three—month forward

exchange and interest rates, and illustrate how to derive the cross—equational

constraints.

where the exchanQe rates are measured n yen per dollar, and the interest

rates are expressed in annual yield (X).                                      Therefore, the hypothesis,


            Etst+3 =               +     (1./400)(RJAt —                                                   (2.4:)

can be expressed in terms of cross—equational restrictions implied by equating

the coefficients cf the first row of the right—hand—side coefficient matrix

(2.2) to the one                        n (2.3>.

Let us now assume that the deterministic component consists of only constants

and that the lag length of the system is 7 (m7).                                        Then we can write explici-

tly the three—step ahead prediction for the VAR system (2.1) with 7 lags.

        Let us now recall that a joint hypothesis of covered and uncovered

interest parity is equivalent to the unbiasedness of the forward rate.

Covered interest parity states that the difference between the forward and

current spot exchange rates is equal to the difference in the interest rates:


               —        =                      —
                                                                                                    <2.6)
           3       St           (1/400)<RJAt        RUSt).

Combining uncovered and covered interest parity, (2.3) and (2.6), the

efficiency hypothesis is implied:                                 Est =         Note that the expectation

should be conditional on all the relevant information available in system

(2.1)     in period t.                 In particular, the past interest rates and the spot

exchange rate are included in the information set in our system.

        Uncovered interest parity will be tested in the yen—dollar relationship

for various subperiods between 1972 and 1984.                                 vector autoregressions model

with the spot exchange rate,                   a yen—denominated interest rate, and a dollar—

denominated interest rate has to be constructed.                                   The end—of—month spot

exchange rate ts defined in terms of yen.                                 For the yen—denominated interest

rate, both an onshore rate (three month Gensaki ,                              i.e.,   repurchase agreement,

and an offshore rake (three month Euro—yen deposit rate:) are examined. The

choice of the Gensaki rate is a natural one, because the Gensaki rate is one

of    the few interest rates in Japan which have always been free from                 various
domestic regulations.            For the dollar—denominated interest rate, the Euro-

dollar deposit rate is chosen.             Although this is not the U.S. on—shore rate,

it    is shown by Kreicher (1982) that covered arbitrage is holding true between

the Euro—dollar deposits and the U.S. domestic CDs, taking into account the

difference     in reserve requirements of the two different CDs. Questions

concern ing the Granger—causal ity between the interest rate and the exchange

rate, forecast errors of variance decompositions and the impulse responce

functions in the three—variable VAR system is found in Ito (1983b).



UI.       Covered Interest Parity


        As a preliminary investigation, we are interested in whether covered

interest parity is holding.                If so, our test can be interpreted as the

efficiency test. Ito (1983a) and Otani and Tiwari (1981) investigated whether

covered interest parity represented by (2.6> was holding for a yen—denominated

asset and the Euro—dollar deposit taking into account transactions costs and

the bid—ask spread. The following is a summary of                Ito's   (1983a) findings about

covered interest parity.

        Let us define the degree of deviations from covered interest parity by


                              RUS   F               RJA
        Deviation =   [(1   + ———) ——— —          + ———n X 400                         (3.1)
                               408     S            400


where     F and S is the forward and spot exchange rates: the value of dollar

in terms of yen.        The Figure 1 shows that the deviation has been decreasing

throughout the sample period.              In 1973,    an investment shift from an onshore

yen—denominated        asset         to Euro—dollar deposits with a covered forward


                                              8
 transaction would have earned a difference up to nearly a 30 percentage point

 (annualized yTelds of three—month) in yield. This violation to covered

 interest parity is due to strict Japanese capital controls then in place.         As
 capital controls being qradually lifted throughout 1970's, the deviation from

 the parity has decreased.        After 1974, there was no deviation more than 5
 percentage point in either direction.        Most important changes from our view-
 point took place in 1979 and 1980.        In May 1979, Gensaki assets became availa-

 ble for non—residents. Moreover, in December 1980, the new Exchange Trade and

 Foreign Exchange Control       law deregulated most capital flows in and out     of

 Japan.     The largest deviation since 1981 has not exceeded a one percentage

point, within the neutral ity band considering the bid—ask spread only.


                             INSERT FIGURE    1   ABOUT HERE


      Covered interest parity between Euro—yen and Euro—dollar was also
examined       in Ito (1983a). Covered interest parity between Euro—yen and Euro-

dollar has been holding since 1975, when the              data of Euro—yen became
avail abi e.



JI) Emp   inca] Results

     The test is conducted for two combinations of interest rates. First, the

three—month Euro—dollar and Euro—yen deposit rates are used as the dollar—

denominated and yen—denominated interest rates.           Since there is no capital
controls, the test of UIP is readily interpreted as the            efficiency test.
Second,    the three—month Gensaki (repurchase agreement) rate is used for the

three—month interest rate for an onshore yen—denominated asset. Then the test

is conducted between the Gensaki and the Euro—dollar           rate. As commented
before, the Euro—dollar rate is closely related with the on—shore CD rate.

Results of the t4ald test are summarized in Table 1.

      The null hypothesis of uncovered interest parity (efficient market

 hypothesis with no risk premium) is accepted in all cases except one with a

 full sample for the onshore—offshore combination.           Since results about the

 hypothesis    in the literature (cited in Introduction) are mixed,     we did not
have any strong prior conjectures.         What obtained in this paper should lend

 support evidence to the efficiency hypothesis with risk premium, or combined

covered and uncovered interest parity.

      it    is natural that the hypothesis with Euro—market rates from      1975 to
1983 is accepted with a lower X2 value than the one with the onshore rates.

The Euro—market      is bel ieved to require lower transactions costs and assets

there are comparable, so that covered interest parity, a part of maintained

hypotheses, has been considered to hold very tightly.            Since the Japanese

capital controls were relatively effective until December 1980, the test          is

conducted in three separate time periods for the onshore case. The hypothesis

with the onshore rates after 1975 was accepted at the level conparable to the

Euro—market case.

     it     is not puzzling that the hypothesis was rejected when the        sample
period is extended to include periods between 1972 and 1975.           Recall that
there were dramatic deviations from covered interest parity.          The order of
deviation     in 1973 was in the 30 percentage points in the annual      yield, as
opposed to the deviation at maximum 6 percentage points between 1975 and
                                                                              1980,

and at maximum a less than one percentage point deviation after December 1980.

From 1973 to 1974q Yen was depreciating rapidly, while capital controls preve-

nting foreigners from purchasing Japanese securities and Japanese from purcha-

sing the dollar—denominated assets.        With strict controls in financial flows,

neither CIP nor UIP did not have a chance to be satisfied during this period.

DATA SOURCE:

All the data are monthly series observed at the end of month.   Time series of
the Euro—dollar and Euro—yen three—month deposit rates are taken from Morgan
Guaranty Trust, World Financial Markets.     The series of three—month Gensaki
(Repurchase Agreement) rate in Japan is taken from the Bank of Japan for
1972:1  to 1974:12 and from the Morgan Guaranty Trust for 1975:1 to the
present.   (Note that the short—term interest rate of Japan in World Financial
Markets before 1979:1 was not the Gensaki rate, but a regulated deposit rate.
Therefore, the data in this paper are obtained from the Morgan Guaranty Data
bank which has backdated the series.) The dollar—yen spot exchange rate is
taken by picking the last business day of the month in the DRI daily data
series after 1977, and the IMF monthly data from 1972 to 1976.
V. Comparison with the Results obtained by the Conventional Method


       If the market is efficient and traders are risk neutral, then the forward

exchange rate is equal to an expected future spot exchange rate.                               This

hypothesis has been examined in a series of studies.                       The test     is usually

reduced to showing that the deviation of the k—step forward rate at period t,

Ftk,     (or its logarithm) from the real ized spot rate,                                 (or its
                                                                                Stfk,
loqarithrn.    has mean zero and that the deviation is uncorrelated with

information available at the end of period t.                     Earlier works (for example,

Cornell (1977), Frenkel (1977, 1978, 1979, 1981), Geweke and Feige <1979),

Levich (1978), and Longworth (1981)) used data with a nonoverlapping frequency

(monthly data for one—month forward rates).                       Frenkel (1981) tested the

hypothesis using the following equation.


         = a + b


where s =               and                 =
              log(St)               k           log<F k The market efficiency with no risk
premium is expressed as a test of (a, b) =                  (0,   1) and no serial correlation

in residuals. However, the test nay suffer from the unit root problem, if the

exchange rate follows a random walk as suggested in Mussa (1979).                        Moreover,

if   the observational frequency is finer than the forward contract length,

serial correlations in the residuals would make asymptotic properties of the

OLS estimates inappropriate. In order to cope with the unit root problem,

Curnby and Obstfeld (1982) proposed to test (a, b) =                (0,   1) in the equation


                 =a                     —
     5t+k —             +
                            b(ftk                 + vt+k.

Hansen and Hodrick <1980:> proposed to modify the asymptotic covariance matrix

to obtain a test of the hypothesis which is applicable when the observational

frequency is finer than the forward contract length.                      Using weekly data of

The market efficiency hypothesis is (a b1, b2) =                                   0, 0, 0).
     Most existing methods, as summarized above1 test the market hypothesis by

showing that deviations of the forward rate from the actual future spot rate

are not correlated with information at period t.                                   That is, 5t4k —
                                                                                                          t,k
uncorrelated with any variables in the information set at period t,                                         . This

is impi ied from                 =                  0t ]. However, if we can form the k—step ahead
                                     ELst+k
forecast of the spot rate from the model, we can directly test the hypothesis

that the forward rate is equal to the conditional forecast of the future spot

rate. This is exactly what achieved in the proposed test in this paper. Note

that the information set which the VAR forecast is based on is spelled out by

the choices of variables and the lag length in a VAR model.

     Being presented the results in Table 1, those who believe in risk premium

wonder whether the proposed test is not strong enough to reject the hypothesis

of uncovered interest parity.4                            Since a comparison of testing the same

hypothesis with the same data set by different econometric methods might

reveal that one method is more likely to reject the hypothesis than the other

we tested the efficiency hypothesis by the Hansen—Hodrick procedure, modifying

(4.1) to accomodate monthly instead of weekly observations:5

                                                                              tt-4,3    +

Table 2 summarizes the test statistics.                              The efficiency hypothesis is not

VI. Concluding Remarks

     The objective of this paper was to propose a new way of testing uncovered

interest parity   in a vector autoregressions model.        The hypothesis of

uncovered interest parity is interesting partly because it, combined with

covered interest parity,    is equivalent to the efficiency of the market, which

was extensively studied with a single—equation technique.

     The proposed method is used to test uncovered interest parity between

yen—denominated assets and dollar—denomina assets between 1975 and 1983.     We

have accepted the hypothesis both a combination of offshore assets and a

combination of onshore—offshore assets. These results are in contrast to some

of recent works in the literature on the efficiency market hypothesis.6

Therefore, it is desirable to carry out testing procedures proposed by others,

in particular the Hansen—Hodrick procedure because of the observation interval

being finer than the forward—contract interval, for the same data and to

compare the results.       This was done in the preceding section.   Since the

Hansen—Hodrick procedure using our data accepted the efficiency hypothesis,

there was no evidence that one method is more restrictive than the other

regarding the efficiency hypothesis.

    An efficient markt hypothesis tested as cross—equational restrictions in

a VAR model has already been used in the term structure literature. <See, for

example, Sargent (1979) and Mel mo (1980).) Although the basic idea in     this

paper parallels studies in the term structure literature, the derivation of

the cross—equational constraint of a null hypothesis in this paper is quite

different from that of the term structure model.    In particular, the present

technique uses one important side condition (covered interest parity) to

derive the efficiency hypothesis.    However, the similarity in the frameworks

of this paper and of testing expectations hypotheses in the term structure

literature suggests that recent developments in the term structure literature


                                     13
are also applicable to our technique.   Computational burden may be reduced by

using a frequency domain method proposed by Hansen and Sargent (1981).    The

frequency domain technique will be especially attractve when the prediction

steps become large (such as 13—step ahead prediction of the weekly series

against the three—month deposit rates).     it is left for future reserch to
translate the time—domain VAR method described in        this paper into the
frequency domain techique a la Hansen—Sargent method.7

1.    App ications of VAR systems to macroeconomic models have        been popular

since Sims' works (1980, 1982).           Recently VAR models have been appl ed to

investigate interdependence and co—movements of international         and domestic

financial variables (Branson (1983) Bail] ie et. a]. (1983) and Ito (1983b))

Some app] ications of VAR models, in particular in the direction of forming

policy recommendations, are somewhat controversial. (See,          for example, a

controversy between Sims (1982) vs. ticCaflum (1983) and Sargent (1983)).

However,     it is a widely—accepted view among its users and critics that a VAR

is a useful          tool   in the "reducedform0 description,     forecasting, and

predict ions.


2.   The forward foreign exchange market in Japan is still regulated in the

sense that one has to have "real demands' for the forward exchange in order to

participate it. For example, a Japanese resident holding export contracts, or

maturing securities or deposits denominated in dollar is permitted to purchase

forward yen, so that the exchage rate risk is hedged.         Hovever, the resident

would not       be    allowed to "speculate" in the forward market taking a short

position.

the term structure literature.        See also Hakkio (1981) for risk prernia in the

4.        It has been suggested by Angelo Melino that the proposed test might tend

to accept the hypothesis if the true lag length is much shorter than the

 assumed one.        Hotever, if we assumed the lag length shorter than the true lag

 length,     then disturbances would lose whiteness and a framework would fall

 apart.

5.   I have used the RATS program, Doan and Litterman (1981: section
                                                                       12.12),
for calculating relevant covariance matrices based on the General Method of

Moments, proposed by Hansen (1979)(1980). It was not necessary to "damp the

covariances.
