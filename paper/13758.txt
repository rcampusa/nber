                                              ABSTRACT

One of the major social policy issues facing the U.S. in the first decade of the 21st century is the large
number of Americans lacking health insurance. This article surveys the major economic issues around
covering the uninsured. I review the facts on insurance coverage and the nature of the uninsured; focus
on explanations for why the U.S. has such a large, and growing, uninsured population; and discuss
why we should care if individuals are uninsured. I then focus on policy options to address the problem
of the uninsured, beginning with a discussion of the key issues and available evidence, and then turning
to estimates from a micro-simulation model of the impact of alternative interventions to increase insurance
coverage.

       One of the major social policy issues facing the U.S. in the first decade of the 21st century

is the large number of Americans lacking health insurance. While other industrialized nations

guarantee universal health care for their citizens, in the U.S. 47 million persons, or 18% of the

non-elderly population (the elderly are universally covered under the Medicare program) lack

health insurance. As a result, the problem of the uninsured has been front and center in public

policy debates and political campaigns for many years. The (failed) centerpiece of the early

Clinton presidency was a plan for universal health coverage; 15 years later, each of the major

Democratic candidates for President is proposing a plan for universal health coverage.

       Of course, health insurance is not the only “merit” good which is not universally

consumed by the American public: a larger number of U.S. households do not own their own

homes, for example, than the number of households that contain uninsured individuals. While

homeownership is viewed as a valid goal for families, there is little demand for universal

ownership. With health insurance, however, a number of arguments are used to justify universal

coverage: financial and physical externalities to others, inefficiencies in labor markets from

limited job-related coverage, myopia among the uninsured, and income redistribution to lower

income groups that tend to be uninsured. Regardless of the validity of these arguments, strong

advocacy for universal insurance coverage is here to stay.

       If public policy makers are to take on the problem of the uninsured, however, they must

understand why individuals are uninsured, and what the government can do about it. Not that the

U.S. government hasn’t been heavily involved in insurance markets. The U.S. government

currently accounts for almost half of all spending on health care in this nation. The regulatory
role of the government is pervasive. And an enormous tax subsidy of over $200 billion per year

encourages the provision of health insurance through a particular form, the employer, which may

not be optimal. Ex ante, it isn’t clear if the right answer for improving health access in the U.S.

is more government, less government, or just different government.

       Economic insights and past research has an enormous amount to say about this crucial

debate. The purpose of this paper is to review the lessons and implications of those insights and

research.

       I do so in several steps. I begin by reviewing the important facts on the insurance market

in the U.S., and the nature of the uninsured. I then focus on explanations for why the U.S. has

such a large, and growing, uninsured population, and I highlight the strange dichotomy between

the apparent “overinsurance” of the majority of Americans with the “underinsurance” of a

substantial minority. I then turn to the question whose answer has long been assumed by policy

makers: should we care if individuals are uninsured? I review the various arguments for public

policy intervention in this area, and conclude that externality-based arguments are unlikely to be

significant enough to warrant major new interventions (or even the current level of intervention).

Rather, arguments based on either irrationalities or redistribution are required to justify an

expanded government role.

       The remainder of the paper focuses on policy options to address the problem of

uninsurance. I begin with a discussion of the key equity and efficiency issues that must be

addressed by any government intervention. I turn next to discussing the available evidence that
can guide policy-makers as they try to meet these sometimes conflicting goals.

            I then use a micro-simulation model of the health economy to estimate the impact of

alternative reforms to provide health insurance. I begin by considering incremental reforms of

the type favored by the left (expanding public insurance) and the right (tax subsidies to private

insurance). I then turn to more fundamental reforms to insurance markets designed to raise

insurance coverage, including mandates on individuals to obtain insurance. I also discuss the use

of the existing tax exclusion of employer-provided health insurance as a financing mechanism

for these reforms.




                            Part I: The Insurance Market in the United States1

            Health insurance markets are straightforward in principle. Individuals, or firms on their

behalf, pay monthly premiums to insurance companies. In return, the insurance company pays

the providers of medical goods and services for any goods and services used by the individual

(the individual's medical claims). Under most health insurance plans, the patient pays part of the

costs of medical goods and services, and the insurance company pays the remainder. There are

three types of patient payments: deductibles (under which individuals face the full cost of their

care, but up to some limit); copayments (under which individuals make some fixed payment

when they get a medical good or service); and coinsurance (under which the patient pays a

percentage of each medical bill).




1
    Much of this section follows the discussion of health insurance markets in Gruber (2005a) and Gruber (2002).
Private (Mostly Employer) Insurance

        The distribution of insurance coverage in the U.S. is shown in Table 1.2 The most

important source of health insurance in the U.S. is private insurance; 80% of the insured, or

177.8 million persons, have private health insurance. Within that group, the predominant source

of private insurance is employer-provided health insurance. Only 10% of those with private

insurance purchase insurance on their own, through the nongroup insurance market; nine of

every ten privately-insured persons get their health insurance through their employers.

     Employers offer insurance to qualified employees in the firm, typically those who work full

time and have completed some minimal service requirement (such as 0-6 months of employment

at the firm). Employers also typically charge employees some share of the costs of insurance,

averaging 16% of insurance cost for single plans and 27% for family plans (Gruber and

Washington, 2005). As a result, take-up of health insurance by employees offered that insurance

is incomplete, with enrollment rates averaging roughly 75% among those offered. Partly, this

reflects the fact that individuals may be covered by other family members, so that overall only

7% of those offered insurance are actually uninsured (Gruber and Washington, 2005).3

     There are two reasons why employers are the predominant source of insurance. The first is


2
  There are three large nationally representative sources of data on insurance coverage in the U.S. The most
commonly used source is the March Current Population Survey (CPS), which asks about insurance coverage in the
previous year; that is the data used throughout this paper. Insurance coverage information is also collected by the
Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), for a smaller sample but on a more frequent (every four
months) and longitudinal basis, and by the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), which collects more detailed
data on insurance arrangements on a longitudinal basis as well.
3
  There is an interesting set of issues around the decision of employers to pay premiums versus charging employees
for those premium costs; see Gruber and Washington (1995) for a review of those issues.
risk pooling. The goal of insurers is to create large insurance pools with a predictable

distribution of medical risk. Predictability of medical risk is increased when groups are large and

are constructed for reasons independent of health (or at least independent of unobserved

components of health). Employees of firms constitute a risk pool that has a good chance of

meeting these two conditions. Individuals, on the other hand, do not; even if individuals are

pooled together into a large group, insurers still can’t be sure that those individuals didn’t come

to the insurer specifically because they are sick. The preference for large groups by insurers is

reinforced by another aspect of insurance provision, administrative costs. Many of the costs of

administering insurance are fixed; for individuals or small groups, these fixed administrative

costs can amount to a large share of the premium.

       These issues are reflected in the pattern of private insurance coverage in the United

States. Large employers in the U.S. almost universally offer health insurance to their employees;

98% of firms with more than 200 employees offer health insurance. Among smaller firms,

however, health insurance offering rates are much lower; only 55% of firms with fewer than 10

employees offer insurance, and only 76% of firms with 10-24 employees offer insurance.

     The second reason why employers are the predominant providers of health insurance is that

the tax code subsidizes health insurance purchase through the firm by excluding employer

insurance spending from an individual’s income, for both income and payroll tax purposes. This

leads to a very large effective subsidy to the cost of health insurance for workers. The result of

this subsidy is that there is a lower “tax price” of insurance:
        TP = (1 - Jf - Js - Jss - Jmc)
                   1+ Jss + Jmc
where τf is the federal income tax marginal rate; τs is the state income tax marginal rate; τss is the

marginal payroll tax rate for the OASDI program (the 6.2% tax rate that is levied equally on

employees and employers); and τMC is the marginal payroll tax rate for the Medicare HI

program.4 I differentiate the latter two programs because, beginning in the early 1990s, the

taxable maximum for the HI program was increased above that for the OASDI program (and was

eventually removed altogether); the marginal rate is zero above the taxable maximum for payroll

taxation. For a typical worker in the 15% tax bracket, facing a 5% state tax rate and a 15.3%

combined payroll tax rate, this tax price is roughly 0.65; a dollar of health insurance costs 35

cents less than a dollar of other goods purchased with after-tax wages.

         In addition, there are also tax subsidies available to employees for their spending on

employer-provided health insurance, under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section

125 generally provides that an employee in a cafeteria plan will not have an amount included in

gross income solely because the employee may choose among two or more benefits consisting of

cash and qualified benefits. A qualified benefit generally is any benefit that is excludable from

gross income under the Code, including health insurance, group-term life insurance, 401(k)

plans, child care, and adoption assistance.

         Perhaps as a result of these inherent advantages of the group insurance market, the


4
  The reason that the payroll tax rate is additive in the denominator is that the employer is indifferent between
purchasing one dollar of benefits or paying wages of 1/(1+ τss + τmc), since each dollar of wages requires a payroll
tax payment as well.
nongroup insurance market has not provided a very hospitable environment for insurance

purchase. Load factors in this market are high, and the generosity of the typical policy is much

lower than in the group market (Gruber and Madrian, 1996). A recent study by the Kaiser

Family Foundation found that, for those individuals in less than perfect health, it was often not

possible to get coverage that was fully comprehensive, with the particular illness of the

individual often being excluded from coverage by the policy. Prices were also very variable in

this market, making it difficult to effectively anticipate the cost of insuring oneself.

        There is an existing tax subsidy to the nongroup market itself, for a particular group: the

self-employed. Beginning in 1986, the self-employed were allowed to deduct 25% of their

insurance premiums from their taxable income. This share has grown over time and is now

100%.




Public Health Insurance

        There are two major public sources of health insurance. The first is the Medicare

program, which provides health insurance for all people over age 65 and disabled persons under

age 65. This federal program is financed by a payroll tax. After a two-year waiting period,

Medicare insurance is also available to those receiving disability insurance.

        The other major public health insurance program in the U.S. is the Medicaid program

which provides health care for the poor.5 The federal and state governments share the financing

 Eligibility for the medicaid program was enhanced by the Children’s Health Insurance Program, enacted in 1997; I
describe both here under the rubric of Medicaid. Details of the Medicaid program are provided in Gruber (2003).
of this program which is paid for out of general tax revenues. Medicaid benefits are targeted at

several groups: those who qualify for cash welfare programs, mostly single mothers and their

children; most children in the U.S. who are poor (typically below 200% of the federal poverty

level); most poor pregnant women (for the expenses associated with their pregnancies); and the

low-income elderly and disabled (for non-Medicare health costs and long-term care costs for

facilities such as nursing homes). Medicaid is best known for its coverage of the young poor

population, particularly mothers and children, who make up nearly 70% of program recipients.

However, over two-thirds of the cost of the program is accounted for by the medical costs of the

25% of program recipients who are receiving long- term care, either from home health care or

from institutions.

       Another large source of insurance in the U.S. is health insurance for those currently or

formerly in the military and their dependents. Tri-Care is a program administered by the

Department of Defense for military retirees and the families of active duty, retired, or deceased

service members. CHAMPVA, the Civilian Health and Medical Program for the Department of

Veterans Affairs, is a health care benefits program for disabled dependents of veterans and

certain survivors of veterans. Together, these two programs provide health coverage for nearly 7

million Americans.




The Uninsured

     Finally, there are the 47 million in the U.S. without any insurance coverage at all. Who are
they? According to the CPS data used this far, the uninsured have lower-than-average incomes;

nearly two-thirds of the uninsured are in families with incomes below twice the poverty line.

Not all the uninsured are poor, however: 20% of the uninsured are in families with incomes

above $50,000 per year. Seventy percent of the uninsured are in families where the family head

is a full-time, full-year worker, but is either not offered health insurance or doesn't take it up to

cover himself or his family members. Thus, the modal uninsured person is a member of what

might be called the “working poor class”: below median income, but not among the poorest in

the nation.6

        In addition, there are important dynamics within the uninsured population that are missed

by this point-in-time estimate. A problem with the CPS estimate is that it is a strange hybrid of a

point-in-time estimate and a backwards look at the previous year.7 Other surveys which are less

widely cited provide different perspectives on the uninsured, as reviewed in CBO (2003). The

CBO finds that other surveys that ask about uninsurance at particular point in the year provide

estimates very similar to the CPS. But they also find that estimates of uninsurance over an entire

calendar year are only about one-half to two-thirds as large as point-in-time estimates;

correspondingly, estimates of the number of individuals uninsured at any point in the last year re

on the order of 40-50% higher than point-in-time estimates. These findings highlight the

dynamic nature of uninsurance.



6
 These facts are all derived from EBRI (2006).
7
 Technically, the CPS question asks respondents each March about whether they were uninsured during the entire
previous year. In fact, most analysts suspect that respondents are replying about current insurance status, a
contention supported by the discussion below.
                   Part II: Why Are People Uninsured - and Overinsured?

       To design sensible policy to address the problem of the uninsured, we must first

understand why individuals are uninsured. Medical risks are the type of large and unpredictable

risks for which full insurance would be optimal in a first best world. In a standard model with

concave utility individuals would be willing to pay an actuarially fair premium to fully insure

their medical risks. Clearly this is not the case for many Americans today. Why is that?




Actuarial Unfairness in the U.S. Insurance Market

       Individuals may be unwilling to purchase insurance if it is not available at an actuarially

fair price to the individual. This can occur for several reasons. The first is the administrative

costs of insurance (along with the profit earned by insurers). Private insurance in the U.S. has

administrative costs that average roughly 12% of premiums paid. In a standard expected utility

model, such a deviation from actuarial fairness can cause individuals with a low level of risk

aversion to forgo insurance.

       The second is irregularities in the insurance market. For example, even for very large

groups of insured, insurance is not available on a per person basis. Traditionally, in fact,

insurance was simply offered for singles and for families, regardless of family size. Under such

a model, small families cross-subsidize large families, leading to actuarially unfair pricing. Even

in today’s insurance market, most insurance groups are offered policies for singles, married with

no children, and married with children, so that such cross-subsidies still exist. The reasons for
this discreteness in insurance pricing are not clear, given the profits that could be made by finer

pricing patterns and the relatively low (presumably) administrative costs of such patterns. This

question is an interesting one for future research.

       A third reason for actuarially unfair pricing is adverse selection in the insurance market.

As noted above, insurers operate with less than full information about those seeking insurance.

This raises the cost of insurance in two ways. First, some share of the administrative costs of

private insurance are the costs devoted to screening potential applicants to identify the costliest

cases. Unfortunately, there is no good data available on the share of administrative costs

absorbed by this function; gathering such data would be quite useful.

       The second way that adverse selection raises the cost of insurance is though the standard

lemons pricing effect (Akerlof, 1970): prices will be higher to reflect the (presumably sickest)

subset of individuals who choose to insure. There is very clear evidence of adverse selection

within health insurance markets; see Cutler and Zeckhauser (2001) for a review of the literature

and Cutler and Reber (1998) for a particularly compelling example. There is less clear evidence,

however, on adverse selection into health insurance coverage. Indeed, there is surprisingly little

work on the general question of whether those who choose to be insured are adversely selected;

the two studies on this topic reviewed in Cutler and Zeckhauser (2001) reach mixed conclusions.

       Clearly, high prices of insurance are a major cause of uninsurance. Indeed, Chernew et

al. (2006) estimate that two-thirds of the increase in the number of uninsured over the past

decade can be traced to rising health insurance costs. Literature on this point, however, has not

been able to distinguish rises in the underlying cost of medical care from changes in the value of
insurance against risk. In a standard model, while rising insurance loads will lead to less

insurance, a pure rise in the costs of treating medical illness should lead to fewer uninsured, not

more. If individuals have a constant coefficient of relative risk aversion, then as medical costs

rise they are effectively poorer. Being poorer should make them less likely to want to undertake

the risk of being uninsured.

       Thus, the literature showing a negative correlation between insurance costs and insurance

coverage is either uncovering a strong response to the non-actuarial piece of insurance costs, or

capturing some non-standard mechanism through which higher medical costs affects insurance

demand. One such mechanism could be liquidity constraints, with individuals (particularly

young individuals, who make up a large share of the uninsured) unable to finance current health

insurance purchases to a desired level by borrowing against future income. If the rise in income

over the life cycle is faster than the rise in medical risk (or if individuals have access to non-age

rated group insurance), then these liquidity constraints may ease later in life. Another

mechanism could be problems of time inconsistency (Laibson, 1997; O’Donoghue and Rabin,

1999) whereby individuals overvalue short run insurance costs relative to downstream medical

expenditure risk. Yet another mechanism could be failures in the insurance market which do not

allow individuals to purchase the type of insurance they want against rising costs, forcing them

to include aspects of insurance that are valued at below their costs. This last point is developed

further below.
Implicit Insurance Through Uncompensated Care

        Even at an actuarially fair price, individuals may not be willing to purchase insurance if

their medical risks are primarily catastrophic, due to the implicit insurance provided through

hospital uncompensated care. Under federal law, any hospital that accepts reimbursement from

Medicare must treat individuals who arrive in an emergent state, regardless of their ability to

pay. Hospitals can try to collect the costs of such care from uninsured patients, but they can be

avoided (in the limit through personal bankruptcy), becoming “uncompensated care” costs to the

hospital. Such uncompensated care amounted to roughly $30 billion for hospitals in 2005.8

        The existence of free care for catastrophes provides a valuable option to primarily healthy

individuals whose only likely medical concerns are emergencies. Whether this effect is

quantitatively important in driving insurance decisions is unclear, however. Findings in Rask

and Rask (1995) and Herring (2000) suggests that individuals are more likely to be uninsured

where more free care is delivered (although causality is somewhat difficult to interpret in this

context), but LoSasso and Meyer (2006) find no effect of hospital uncompensated care on

insurance status. If uncompensated care does deter insurance purchase, it can have a multiplier

effect through adverse selection as well: if the (unobservably) healthiest individuals choose not

to insure and instead to rely on free care, then insurers will have to raise prices above actuarially

fair levels for the remaining individuals demanding insurance.




8
 This fact is from Gruber and Rodriguez (forthcoming), who document that physicians, on net, provide no
uncompensated care in the U.S.
Overinsurance and Limited Choice

       Even in a world without adverse selection, full insurance is not optimal due to another

informational imperfection: moral hazard. Under the theory of insurance outlined in Arrow

(1963) and Pauly (1970), optimal insurance trades off the gains from consumption smoothing

against the cost of moral hazard from distorting medical consumption. The result is a middle

ground plan with some moral hazard and some risk spreading.

       The deadweight loss of excess medical consumption due to insurance is clearly

documented by the results from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (Manning et al., 1987).

This experiment randomly assigned individuals to different levels of patient coinsurance and

deductibles. The findings were striking: higher patient payments led to significantly less use of

medical care with no adverse medical outcomes on average (although some adverse effects for

low income and unhealthy individuals). Overall, the elasticity of medical care use with respect

to its price was modest, at -0.2, but significant. Even at this small elasticity, Feldman and Dowd

(1991) estimate the deadweight loss of insurance in the U.S. to be $125 to $400 billion in today’s

health economy.

       The finding of significant deadweight loss from moral hazard in the health insurance

market suggests that the optimal health insurance policy is one in which individuals bear a large

share of medical costs within some affordable range, and are only fully insured when costs

become unaffordable. This structure is optimal because coverage for all medical expenditures

(what is often called first dollar coverage, since all dollars of medical spending, starting with the
first dollar, are covered) has little consumption smoothing benefit, but a large moral hazard cost.

       The consumption smoothing benefit from first dollar coverage is small because there is

little utility gain to risk averse individuals from insuring a small risk (relative to income). At the

same time, this first dollar coverage has substantial moral hazard cost because it encourages

individuals to overuse the medical system, demanding care for which the social costs exceed the

social benefits.

       While first dollar coverage is clearly not optimal, the optimal level of coverage will

depend on the nature of risk preferences and the medical risk profile. An example of an optimal

insurance plan would be Feldstein's (1971) "Major Risk Insurance" plan, in which individuals

would face a 50% copayment on all services until they spent 10% of their income on medical

care, beyond which there would be no more copayments.

     Feldstein's proposal is much less generous than the typical private insurance plan in the

U.S., however, which features relatively low copayments for enrollees. The typical insurance

plan in the U.S. has a deductible of $200-$600, a copayment for physician visits of $15-$20, and

a copayment for hospital stays of $0-$240 (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2005). As a result, the

insurance coverage distribution in the U.S. is best described by a line such as that in Figure 1,

from Gruber (2005a). On the horizontal axis is the population of the U.S., arrayed from least

generous insurance (uninsured) to most generous, and on the vertical axis is the generosity of

health insurance products. Forty-five million Americans have no health insurance, so they lie at

zero on the vertical axis (no insurance = zero generosity). The line then jumps up, and there is an

increasing generosity of insurance for the remainder of the population.
       This discontinuity has the potential to explain a share of uninsurance in the U.S. If there

is a large share of individuals who would value some insurance, but not the (close to) first dollar

coverage provided by most insurance plans, then they may choose to be uninsured instead. So

why does this discontinuity arise? Why are people either uninsured or "over-insured"? There

are five possible reasons.




The “Offset” Hypothesis

       One explanation could be that if individuals are not covered for minor expenditures, this

will raise their major expenditures: less use of the doctor leads to more use of the hospital. This

is a common liberal criticism of high patient-cost plans. But this contention is not supported by

the RAND experiment, which found total costs to be falling as copayments rose. Indeed, RAND

indicated an anti-offset result: more use of primary care led to more, not less, use of hospital

care, once again with no overall health benefit.

       There is one exception to this fact, however, as highlighted by Gruber (2006): primary

care for low-income chronically ill patients does seem to be important to their health – and even

cost effective in reducing ultimate health care costs. The research reviewed in Gruber (2006)

suggests that the optimal insurance policy should cover maintenance care for chronic illness with

smaller cost sharing than other care. A limiting case of such an approach is suggested by

Fendrick et al. (2001), who promote patient copayments targeted to specific patient diagnoses

and related treatments (such as zero copayments on diabetes maintenance drugs for diabetics). It
is not clear whether this is feasible in the short run, but this “value based insurance design”

approach holds promise as a future means of targeting demand-side incentives.




The Tax Subsidy

     As noted above, health insurance expenditures by employers are tax subsidized: payments

to employees in the form of wages are taxed, while payments in the form of health insurance are

not. As emphasized by Feldstein (1973), this leads to overconsumption of health insurance.

Indeed, recent evidence suggests that tax subsidization leads to a large rise in health care

spending among those firms that do offer insurance, with an elasticity of spending with respect to

the tax subsidy of -0.7 (Gruber and Lettau, 2004). This cannot be the full explanation, however:

there is not a robust catastrophic (or, even better, Feldstein MRI-like) insurance market even in

the non-tax subsidized nongroup market.




Regulation

       Another reason for this discontinuity could be minimum standards regulations in the

insurance market. If the government mandates that insurance plans contain certain features, then

indviduals who do not value those features at their cost may find it unattractive to purchase

insurance, while those who continue to purchase insurance will have a generous policy.

       In fact, however, the regulatory requirements on insurance policies in the U.S. are fairly

modest. Some benefits, such as coverage for the expenses of pregnancy and continuation

coverage for those who lose insurance, are mandated at the federal level. Many others are
mandated at the state level: for example, most states mandate coverage of mammography and

substance abuse treatment, while some states have mandates for benefits such as invitro

fertilization and chemotherapy. States also in some cases impose premium taxes on insurance,

which would explain underinsurance but not overinsurance.

       Existing evidence suggests, however, that these state mandated benefits are not a major

cause of uninsurance - or overinsurance. Indeed, Gruber (1994) finds that virtually all insurance

plans voluntarily cover mandated benefits even in states where they are not mandated. As a

result, this article finds that when states add these mandates, it does not affect the rate of health

insurance coverage in the state. Moreover, a number of states have passed “barebones”

insurance laws which allow insurers to offer “mandate-free” or “mandate-lite” benefits packages

to certain groups of insured (e.g. small firms), yet there has not been much demand for such

policies. Thus, overinsurance appears to be the result of choice and not state regulation.




The Access Motive

     A fourth reason why insurance may be so generous is that the traditional analysis overstates

the costs of moral hazard. In traditional models of insurance, the additional medical care used

because of subsidized costs is all due to moral hazard. Nyman (1999) highlights a problem with

this view: some of the additional medical care used because of insurance is not due to moral

hazard, but rather due to the fact that individuals can now afford better treatments (income

effects). That is, moral hazard technically arises only through substitution effects, but the
estimates of Feldman and Dowd referenced above reflect both substitution and income effects.

     Unfortunately, it is difficult to decompose the increase in use of medical care into access

and moral hazard effects. The access motive is a more important consideration for very

expensive treatments, and not for everyday treatments such as physician's visits. Thus, the

access motive may explain the strong demand for catastrophic limits on spending out of pocket

but it is unlikely to explain why individuals don't face higher copayments for more minor

medical procedures, such as physician office visits.




Psychological Motivations

     Finally, there may be motivations for holding insurance that go beyond the simple expected

utility model that underlies the welfare calculus used here. For example, individuals with self-

control problems (a la Laibson (1997) or O’Donoghue and Rabin (1999)) may use insurance as a

commitment device. Alternatively, it may be that individuals simply don't like associating

financial transactions with medical care. They would rather pay higher insurance up front to

avoid dealing with the difficult decisions about whether they want to pay at the time of care.




Summary: Still a Mystery

       In summary, there are a variety of hypotheses for why so many individuals are uninsured,

but no clear sense that this set of explanations can account for 47 million individuals. Moreover,

an equally important and related mystery is why insurance is so much more generous for most

individuals than would be suggested by optimal insurance theory. That is, a unified theory of
insurance coverage in the U.S. must therefore explain not only why so many individuals don’t

have coverage, but also why those who do have coverage are over-insured. This should be a top

priority for future research in health insurance markets.




                     Part III: Why Should we Care About the Uninsured?

       The public debate over the uninsured takes as a given that this is a major social policy

problem, with 18% of the non-elderly population an unacceptably high share of the population to

be without insurance. As highlighted earlier, however, the simple fact that so many are without

insurance is not necessarily a cause for public policy intervention; many more individuals don’t

own their own homes or are obese. So why should we care about uninsurance in the U.S.?




Externalities

       The classic argument for increasing insurance coverage is the externalities associated

with underinsurance. For example, there are physical externalities associated with

communicable diseases; uninsured people are less likely to receive vaccinations and care for

communicable diseases. Since such a small share of medical expenditures are related to

communicable disease, however, this is not a major rationale for universal health insurance (as

opposed to universal vaccination). There is also significant financial externality imposed by the

uninsured on the insured through uncompensated care; when the uninsured don't pay their

medical bills, those costs are passed on to other users of the medical system. As noted earlier,
however, such uncompensated care amounts to $30 billion each year, which is quite small

relative to the $2 trillion health economy.




Labor Market Inefficiency

       Another potential inefficiency associated with uninsurance, however, is distortions to the

labor market caused by partial employer-based coverage. It is possible that many individuals are

afraid to search for or move to jobs where they would be more productive because they are afraid

of losing their health insurance coverage. This reluctance to change can lead to a mismatch

between workers and jobs that can lower overall U.S. productivity. This is often referred to as

“job lock”, the unwillingness to move to a better job for fear of losing health insurance (see

Gruber, 2001 for a discussion of the theory of job lock).

     The problem of job lock is a potentially important welfare cost of the employer-based

private health insurance system in the U.S. Empirical studies, reviewed in Gruber and Madrian

(2004), confirm that mobility from job-to-job is reduced by job lock. The central estimate, in

Madrian (1994), suggests that mobility may be reduced by as much as 25%.

       At the same time, the fact that mobility is reduced does not necessarily have major

welfare implications. As highlighted in Gruber and Madrian (2004), while there is a large

literature documenting the problem of job lock, there is no work that focuses on the welfare

implications of this phenomena. Gruber and Madrian offer some back of the envelope

calculations which suggest that the welfare cost is unlikely to be large, on the order of 0.1-0.2%

of GDP. But these are very rough calculations and this is an area of considerable uncertainty.
Paternalism

           The major motivation for caring about the uninsured is paternalism: the concern that

individuals may be harming themselves by not buying insurance. There is a clear belief among

the public and policy-makers that being uninsured is bad for your health. A recent Institute of

Medicine (IOM) study reviewed hundreds studies documenting the health problems associated

with uninsurance. The IOM estimated that uninsured individuals use only half as much medical

care as the insured, and have a mortality risk that is 25% higher, with over 18,000 people dying

each year because of lack of insurance.9 The studies reviewed by the IOM, however, were

mostly observational analyses documenting a correlation between a lack of health insurance and

poor health, perhaps controlling for other correlates of insurance and health. Few, if any, of

these studies dealt with the endogeneity of health insurance coverage with respect to health

status.

           Several other studies have used careful empirical methods to more carefully document a

causal impact of health insurance on health. Hanratty (1996) studied the impact of the staggered

introduction of national health insurance in Canada across the nation’s provinces, and found that

it was associated with a 4% decline in the infant mortality rate and an 8.9% decrease in the

incidence of low birth weight among single mothers. Lurie et al. (1984) studied the removal of

eligibility for public insurance for a large group of individuals in California (due to a fiscal crisis

in that state in the early 1980s that forced the state to cut back its insurance coverage), and found

9
    http://www.iom.edu/Object.File/Master/17/748/0.pdf, accessed October, 2005.
that health deteriorated significantly after losing public insurance. For example, blood pressure

rose among hypertensive patients, leading to 40% increased risk of dying: overall, 5 of the 186

patients who had lost insurance had subsequently died, compared to zero of the 109 patients in a

comparable group of individuals who did not lose insurance coverage. Currie and Gruber

(1996a, b) studied the expansion of public insurance across and within the U.S. states in the

1980s and 1990s. They found that this expansion led to an 8.5% reduction in infant mortality

and a 5% reduction in child mortality.

       Note that these findings do not contradict the conclusions of the RAND Health Insurance

Experiment, which found that varying the extent of insurance (through the coinsurance rate) had

no impact on health. This is because the HIE made no one uninsured; all individuals were fully

insured for expenditures above an out-of-pocket limit of $1000.

       Putting these two pieces of evidence together suggests the structure of a “medical

effectiveness curve” for the U.S., as shown in Figure 2 from Gruber (2005a), which graphs the

relationship between medical spending and the associated improvement in health, or the "health

effectiveness curve." The horizontal axis in this figure measures the level of medical spending.

The vertical axis measures the marginal health benefit from the next dollar of medical spending.

Health benefits in this stylized figure are represented in dollar terms, or the monetary value of

improving one's health; that is, an improvement of $1 means that this improved health is worth

$1 to the individual. Each point on this curve is the marginal improvement in health for

spending the next dollar on health care.

     Initially, health spending is very productive in terms of improving health status, because
there are a series of very cost effective medical interventions (e.g. vaccination against influenza

for the elderly). Point A, for example, measures the marginal health benefits to spending another

dollar of health care once one has spent $1000 on health care. This next dollar of spending

improves the individual's health by $5 (vertical axis), or 5 times the increase in health spending.

This situation appears to represent the case of the uninsured, where some health care provision is

very important for health.

       As health spending rises, however, we move from clearly cost effective interventions to

less clearly cost effective interventions. At point B, moving from $2000 to $2001 of health care

spending improves the value of health by $1, equal to the spending increase. At point C, moving

from $5000 to $5001 in health care spending improves health by 10 cents, or one-tenth the

spending increase. Eventually, additional spending does no good in terms of improving health

and the effectiveness curve flattens out; some claim that overuse may actually reduce one's

health. This appears to be the case as we move from less to more generous insurance coverage,

as in the RAND HIE. Once again, this suggests an optimal insurance configuration where there

is broad coverage by insurance, but that insurance is relatively spare, in contrast to the insurance

situation in the U.S. today with joint under and overinsurance.



Redistribution

       The final reason for caring about the uninsured is redistribution. As discussed earlier, the

uninsured are a disproportionately low income group, and insurance is very expensive relative to
their incomes; therefore, they may be a group to whom we want to redistribute health care

resources. Of course, this raises the important question of why we would choose this form of

redistribution rather than cash. One rationale could be paternalism: many feel that health care is

a basic right, like food or shelter, and individuals are more willing to distribute to ensure these

“rights” than simply to raise the utility of the poor. Another could be failure of intra-household

utility maximization, whereby providing health insurance to poor children offsets the failures of

their parents to sufficiently provide for their care.




                         Part IV: Covering the Uninsured: Background Issues10

            Solving the problem of the uninsured poses no great mystery. There are a variety of

ways in which the government could achieve universal insurance, or even just significantly

reduce the number of uninsured. But different approaches pose different tradeoffs, both

economically and politically. In this section, I discuss the set of background economic and

political issues relative to covering the uninsured, before discussing specific policy options in

Part V.




Political Considerations

            There are two political constraints in particular which appear to be tightly binding on

fundamental health insurance reform at this point. First, it is difficult to envision a solution to



10
     This section draws heavily on Gruber (2005b).
the problem of the uninsured which does not involve in some way the private insurance industry.

A common complaint about the private-based health insurance system in the U.S. is its high

administrative costs; private insurance administrative costs average 12%, while those of

Canada’s National Health Insurance (NHI) system only amount to 1.3% (Woolhandler, et al.,

2003). Removing this gap would provide an attractive means of saving a large amount of

money, money that could be recycled to cover the uninsured.

       But this is easier said than done. The health insurance industry in the United States has

revenues of over $500 billion per year, making it a very concentrated interest that would have to

be defeated to move to nationally provided health insurance. Likely for this reason, efforts at

national health insurance in the U.S. have never gone far, even when they included a large role

for private health insurance, such as the Clinton health reform plan of 1994. Moreover, the

majority of Americans, particularly those working for large firms with choice of plans, are quite

content with their private health insurance. Telling them that they have to give up that insurance

so that a minority of Americans can get covered will be a very difficult political sell (as

witnessed by the attacks on the Clinton plan based on fear of restricting insurance choice).

In recent years, as a result, even major health reform proposals work off the existing private

insurance market model.

       The second constraint is the fiscal situation of the U.S. government. Except for a brief

window at the end of the 20th century, the U.S. government budget has been in significant deficit

for thirty years, and this deficit shows no sign of abating. Moreover, the government faces
enormous unfunded liabilities under the Social Security and (especially) Medicare programs as

the population ages. Given these pressures, major new expenditures to cover the uninsured are

likely to engender a major political battle. This highlights the importance of the budgetary

considerations discussed next.




Bang for the Buck

       Given the budgetary limitations on any public approach to expand health insurance

coverage, a key concept that drives reform is the bang for the buck (BfB) of the policy. There

are several different means of defining BfB, which I will review below, but the basic concept is

the extent to which new public spending is directed to those who would otherwise be uninsured,

as opposed to “buying out the base” of existing insured individuals. The issue that is central to

all of these definitions is targeting. If individuals were indelibly labeled as “insured” or

“uninsured”, then the government could easily target new tax subsidies to those labeled

uninsured, with no spending on those labeled insured. In fact, this is not the case: insurance

status is a choice of the individual, and can respond to government policy in a way which causes

the policy to have lower budgetary efficiency.

       It is useful to think about the uninsured as tuna and those who already have insurance as

dolphins. The goal of environmentally conscious fishermen is to catch as many tuna as possible

in their nets, while minimizing the number of dolphins who are caught by those nets (which

happens since tuna and dolphins swim together in the ocean). If the uninsured tunas were

swimming in a separate ocean than the insured dolphins, the problem would be minimized. And
if the uninsured tunas greatly outnumbered the insured dolphins, then there would also be a

minimal dolphin catch. But, in reality, the 47 million uninsured tunas mostly swim in a part of

the ocean where there are 190 million privately-insured dolphins, making it difficult if not

impossible for policymakers to design insurance nets to capture the tuna without pulling in the

much more numerous dolphins.

       This point is emphasized in Table 2, which is tabulated from the March 2006 Current

Population Survey (CPS). This table shows, for various income groups in the U.S., the number

of the group which is uninsured, the number which is publicly insured, and the number which is

privately insured. One-third of the uninsured have incomes below $20,000 per year. In this

income range, the uninsured make up over one-third of the total population. Another 40% of the

uninsured have incomes between $20,000 and $50,000 per year, and in this income range the

uninsured make up about one-quarter of the total population. But one-seventh of the uninsured

have incomes between $50,000 and $75,000 per year, and in that range they make up less than

one-seventh of the total population; another one-seventh of the uninsured have incomes above

$75,000 per year, and in this range they make up only 7% of the total population. Thus, the vast

majority of the uninsured reside in parts of the income distribution where they make up less than

one-quarter of the population, making targeting of the uninsured a challenge.

       There is another important sense in which the uninsured tuna and the insured dolphins

swim together: most insurance is provided through firms, and take-up of employer-provided

insurance is only partial. Indeed, roughly one-quarter of the uninsured work in firms that offer
insurance. But these are very costly tuna to collect, because those uninsured who are offered

insurance represent only about 7% of the total pool that is offered. So targeting this 7% of

uninsured within firms without providing government subsidies to the other 93% already insured

is very difficult.




Measuring Bang for the Buck

        Three sources of inefficiency potentially plague any policy designed to cover the

uninsured with a high bang for the buck. First, if the government subsidizes a particular form of

insurance coverage, it might spend money on those who already have coverage through that

subsidized form. The group that will benefit most clearly from tax credits for non-group

insurance, for example, is those already holding non-group insurance. Yet the use of subsidies

by this group raises costs while doing nothing to reduce the number of the uninsured.

        Second, government subsidies to a particular form of insurance coverage may “crowd-

out” other forms of insurance coverage. For example, when the government subsidizes non-

group insurance, it can lead those with group insurance to move to the non-group market, either

by their decision (switching out of employer-provided insurance) or by their employer’s decision

(dropping the offering of insurance at the firm). This can lead to more government spending as

individuals move from a non-subsidized form of insurance (or less-subsidized, such as employer

insurance) to a more subsidized form of insurance.

        The third source of low BfB is the possible reduction in coverage for those who are

insured before the policy is put into place. For example, suppose that a firm has a workforce that
is predominantly, but not universally, eligible for a non-group credit. This firm might decide to

stop offering health insurance, since the majority of its employees can use the credit instead. The

minority of employees that cannot use the credit is then out of luck, however, since they have

lost their employer insurance with no subsidized alternative, and these individuals may become

uninsured. This rise in uninsurance offsets the reductions in the ranks of the existing uninsured,

reducing the BfB of the program.

       Based on this discussion, there are several different means of measuring bang for the

buck – or its inverse, the “buck for the bang”. The traditional measure is dollars of public

spending per person newly insured. Another measure of interest is the extent of crowd-out: the

reduction in employer-provided insurance when other forms of insurance are subsidized (or

when the existing subsidies to employer-provided insurance are reduced). A third measure of

interest is the (gross) rise in the uninsured, due for example to firm dropping. A fourth measure

is the share of beneficiaries of any intervention that were previously uninsured, as opposed to

receiving subsidies to remain insured.

       A final measure incorporates the type of uninsured who are impacted by reform. Simply

counting the dollars per newly insured is not satisfactory when different reforms may appeal to

very different populations. For example, a reform which significantly increases insurance

coverage among children will have much lower costs than one which has the bulk of its impacts

in the much higher cost adult population. But this is an unfair comparison because the latter

reform is essentially extending more valuable insurance coverage than is the former. So a better
measure of buck for the bang is the spending per dollar of insurance value provided, which

incorporates both the numerical increases in coverage and the cost of the individuals provided

coverage.




Relation to Social Efficiency

       As economists, we typically don’t care about budgetary concepts such as bang for the

buck, but rather social efficiency. Socially, if an individual was formerly covered by employer-

provided insurance and switches to identical coverage through a government-subsidized product,

then the only direct financial efficiency consequence is the deadweight loss of raising the

additional funds necessary to finance the net cost to the government. There are indirect

efficiency consequences as well that are not directly financial, such as the fact that moving from

an employer-based system to a non employer-based system might raise labor market efficiency.

       The numerical simulations below, however, will touch only indirectly on these larger

social efficiency issues. I will present results on the financial consequences for the government

and the amount of redistribution that is inherent in each of the policy options. But I will not

endeavor to undertake a full social welfare analysis. Such an analysis would extend these results

by estimating not just government spending but all changes in spending across various groups in

society, and weighting the well-being of each group (insured and uninsured) and thereby valuing

the transfers across them. Such an exercise would be a very useful extension of this work.
                      Part IV: Covering the Uninsured: Behavioral Responses

        Policies designed to reduce the number of uninsured come in four (non mutually-

exclusive) varieties: policies that expand entitlement to free (or very low-cost) public insurance;

policies that expand access to private pooling mechanisms for purchasing insurance; policies that

subsidize the purchase of private insurance; and policies that mandate insurance coverage. For

each of these types of policies, we would ideally like to know the impacts on the distribution of

insurance coverage, on the distribution of income, and on public sector costs. Uncovering these

effects requires modeling the behavioral responses to intervention in insurance markets.

        In this section, I review what is known about those behavioral responses. In doing so, I

draw on a large literature that has emerged in health economics over the past 20 years to study

this important set of issues.




Take-Up of, and Crowd-Out by, Public Insurance

        The first set of relevant issues is the effect of public insurance expansions on insurance

coverage. Expanded public insurance entitlement can raise public insurance coverage through

two channels. The first is take-up of the public insurance by those who would be otherwise

uninsured. As documented in a variety of social insurance contexts, take-up of public

entitlements of this type is far from certain.11 The reasons for incomplete take-up of free benefits

is unclear, likely reflecting some mix of mis-information about eligibility and stigma about

11
  See Remler, Rachlin and Glied (2001) for a discussion of take-up of social insurance programs and its implications
for public health insurance.
taking a public handout. Take-up has been shown to be at least partly rational in a variety of

social insurance contexts, however, with higher benefits entitlements or more extreme risks when

not publicly insured leading to higher take-up rates.12

           The second channel is crowd-out, or movement from other forms of insurance to public

insurance. The extent of crowd-out of private insurance by public insurance is unclear ex ante.

On the one hand, leaving private insurance for public insurance might be attractive, because the

Medicaid insurance package is much more generous than that provided by the typical private

insurance plan and it doesn't cost anything. In terms of benefits, many employer-provided

insurance plans don't include the "optional" benefits covered by virtually all state Medicaid

programs, such as dental or vision care. In terms of costs, the typical employer who offers health

insurance charges families over $200 per month, or almost $2500 per year, to enroll in an

insurance plan. Moreover, while copayments are low in employer-provided insurance relative to

the optimal level recommended by economic theory, they are much higher than those paid in

Medicaid, which has close to zero copayments mandated by law. Indeed, based on its benefits

package, the Medicaid program provides the “best insurance money can’t buy”!

           On the other hand, there are disadvantages to moving from private insurance to Medicaid

as well. First, while Medicaid provides generous benefits, in many states the program

reimburses physicians quite poorly, making it difficult in some areas to find a physician who will

accept Medicaid reimbursement. Second, Medicaid is an uncertain entitlement, subject to both

the vagaries of the political process and the uncertainty of income; if income rises too much,

12
     For example, in the context of unemployment insurance, see Anderson and Meyer (1997).
individuals may find themselves disqualified from the program. Given potential difficulties in

re-enrolling in private insurance, individuals may be wary of leaving that insurance in the first

place for a public entitlement.

       A large body of empirical research has investigated the degree of take-up and crowd-out

of expanded public insurance, as reviewed in Gruber and Simon (forthcoming). It is clear from

this past work that overall take-up of public insurance expansions is low; for example, Gruber

and Currie (1996b) estimate take-up of Medicaid expansions over the 1984-1992 period at only

23%, while Gruber and Simon estimate take-up of the S-CHIP expansions of the 1996-2002

period at only about 10%. Low overall takeup is not surprising, however, given that the large

majority of individuals made eligible for public insurance through these expansions already had

private health insurance.

       This raises the question of the degree of crowd-out of private insurance. The earliest

work on crowd-out, Gruber and Cutler (1996), suggested that crowd-out was quite large, with

private insurance coverage declining by half as much as public insurance enrollment was rising.

Subsequent work has been mixed. This work is summarized in Gruber and Simon

(forthcoming), who estimate that crowd-out is about 60%.



Firm Reactions to Changes in the Insurance Environment

       A second set of behavioral reactions that are crucial for modeling the impact of insurance

market interventions is firm reactions to changes in the insurance environment. In theory,
subsidies to employer spending on insurance should raise the odds that employers offer

insurance, increase the share of the insurance burden financed by employers, and lead employers

to choose more generous insurance plans. At the same time, subsidies to non-employer

insurance options (such as non-group insurance and Medicaid) should lead employers to do the

opposite.

       There is a sizeable literature that estimates the reaction of employers to changes in after-

tax insurance prices, as reviewed in Gruber (2002). Most of this work has focused on estimating

the elasticity of firm offering with respect to the after-tax price. Studies using variation in tax

prices in a cross section have yielded large estimated elasticities in the range of -0.6 to -1.8, but

these studies suffer from omitted variables that contemporaneously determine tax prices and

insurance offer decisions. Other studies have overcome this difficulty by using changes in tax

subsidies over time that vary across firms (e.g. due to state tax changes). These studies have

yielded more modest estimates of -0.3 (Gruber and Lettau, 2004, for the U.S. context) to -0.5

(Finkelstein, 2002, for supplemental benefits in Canada). Gruber and Lettau (2004) highlight

that the response of employer offering to tax price variation is concentrated in small firms; the

elasticity of offering for small firms was -0.69, while it was close to zero for medium and large

size firms.

       There is also a sizeable literature on the impact of after-tax prices on employer insurance

spending. Once again, the most convincing estimates come from tax changes over time.

Woodbury and Hammermesh (1992) analyze all fringe benefit expenditures around the Tax

Reform Act of 1986 in a panel data set of colleges and universities. They conclude that tax
reform substantially reduced the demand for fringes, with an estimated elasticity in excess of -2.

But this is not focused on health insurance spending per se, so it is difficult to disentangle the

impact on health insurance. Gruber and Lettau (2004), in the study described above, also

examine the impact of tax subsidies on employer-provided insurance spending, using similar

variation across states in their tax systems to Woodbury and Hamermesh. And they also find a

quite large elasticity of insurance spending of -0.7.

       A particularly important margin of response to tax subsidies is how employers change

their contributions to health insurance for employees. This response would be subsumed in the

spending elasticities cited above, but it is important to break it out distinctly due to the potential

impact of changing contributions on employee takeup. Gruber and McKnight (2001) use the

Current Population Survey to study the impact of tax changes on the decisions of employers to

pay all of the cost of their health insurance plans. The share of employers paying all those costs

fell from 44% in 1982 to 28% by 1998. They model this variable as a function of a variety of

factors, including the tax subsidy to employer-sponsored insurance. They find that for each 10

percentage point reduction in the tax subsidy, the share of employers paying all of the costs of

health insurance falls by 1.7 to 3.8%.



Individual Reactions to Insurance Price Changes

       A central parameter for evaluating the effects of tax subsidy policy is the elasticity of

employee takeup of employer-provided insurance if it is offered. As highlighted earlier, takeup
among those offered is fairly high for all firm sizes and average firm wage levels. But does

takeup respond to the prices charged to employees for insurance?

       The answer, to date, appears to be no. Two articles have studied the response of

employee takeup to the price charged for insurance (Chernew, Frick and McLaughlin, 1997;

Blumberg and Nichols, 2001). Both papers find that firms that charge more for insurance have

no lower takeup of their insurance policies. These papers do run into the potential problem that

firm premium decisions are endogenous to employee tastes. The direction of bias here is

unclear, and depends on whether firms set low employee premiums when there are tastes for

insurance, or when there are not (because of paternalism or to satisfy insurance company

conditions for high employee takeup). Gruber and Washington (2005) surmount this problem by

examining the “natural experiment” provided by the Federal government’s action, first for postal

workers in 1994 and then for other workers in 2000, to make employee premiums tax deductible.

This move to tax deductibility, which significantly lowered the net premium cost of insurance,

had no effect on the odds of taking up insurance by individuals or by families.

       At least three-quarters of the uninsured are not offered health insurance. Thus, in

focusing on the impacts of tax subsidies to nongroup insurance, the key question is how price

sensitive this group will be in their takeup decisions. Unfortunately, we have essentially no

evidence on this critical question. The one relevant paper is Marquis and Long (1995), who

estimated the demand for non-group insurance coverage among workers not offered employer-

sponsored coverage as a function of the area-specific price of non-group coverage. They

estimate an elasticity of non-group coverage of -0.3. The problem with this approach is that the
price of insurance reflects not only true price differences in insurance (differences in the load

factor, or the premium cost relative to expected claims expenses), but also differences in medical

costs, and differences in underlying tastes for insurance. Both of these latter two factors will bias

downward any estimate of the impact of area insurance prices on demand. Thus, we are left with

only a lower bound on the elasticity of insurance takeup among those not eligible for employer

coverage.




                       Part V: Covering the Uninsured: Policy Impacts

       The large literature reviewed in Part IV provides a valuable set of insights about how

changes in the insurance market can affect individuals and firms. But it is not straightforward to

translate these insights into policy conclusions, particularly when multi-faceted policies affect

several margins at once (e.g. simultaneous subsidies to employers and expansions of public

insurance). To move from these behavioral estimates to policy impacts requires a modeling

framework.

       Typically, academics have played the role of providing the inputs to this framework,

behavioral elasticities of the type reviewed above, while leaving to others (such as the

Congressional Budget Office) the problem of how to incorporate these elasticities into outcome

effects of policy interventions. Over the past decade, however, I have developed a micro-

simulation model similar to that used by government scoring agencies, incorporating the best

evidence from health economics to predict policy outcomes. This section reviews briefly the
structure of this model, and then uses it to assess alternative reforms to cover the uninsured.




The Micro-Simulation Model

        The micro-simulation model that I use is described in detail in Gruber (2005b), so I just

summarize the key elements here. The model takes as its base data from the February and

March, 2001 Current Population Survey, updated to 2006. These data are matched to

information on health insurance premiums and health costs. Data on the premiums for employer

insurance, and the distribution of premiums between employers and employees, comes from the

2004 MEPS, updated to 2006. For non-group insurance, a premium for a healthy 40 year old

male is assigned based on analyses from the Community Tracking Survey and the Medical

Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), and data on premiums collected by the Commonwealth

Fund, the Health Insurance Association of America, and e-health insurance.com. This premium

is then adjusted by age, sex and health status using factors provided by an actuarial consulting

firm.

        These data are used to develop a micro-simulation model that computes the effects of

health insurance policies on the distribution of health care spending and private and public sector

health care costs. This model takes as inputs both the data sources described above and the

detailed parameterization of reform options. The model first turns these policy rules into a set of

insurance price changes; for example, if the policy intervention is a tax credit for non-group

insurance, then the model computes the implied percentage change in the price of nongroup

insurance for each individual in the model. These price changes are then run through a detailed
set of behavioral assumptions about how changes in the absolute and relative price of various

types of insurance affect individuals, families, and businesses.

       The key concept behind this modeling is that the impact of tax reforms on the price of

insurance continuously determines behaviors such as insurance take-up by the uninsured and

insurance offering by employers. The model assiduously avoids “knife-edge” type behavior,

where some critical level is necessary before individuals respond, and beyond which responses

are very large. Instead, behavior is modeled as a continuous function of how policy changes (net

of tax) insurance prices.

       In doing this type of analysis, a number of assumptions must be made about how

individuals will respond to tax subsidies, through their effect on the price of insurance. These

assumptions have been developed based on the available empirical evidence reviewed above,

although there are many holes in this literature that must be filled in order to fully simulate

policy effects. These assumptions are reviewed in detail in Gruber (2005b).

       A key aspect of modeling health insurance policy is appropriately reflecting the decisions

of firms, since 90% of private health insurance is provided by employers. Economists tend to

model firm decision-making as reflecting the aggregation of worker preferences within the firm.

The exact aggregation function is unclear, as reviewed in Gruber (2002); in my model I assume

that the mean incentives for the firm (e.g. the average subsidy rate for non-group insurance) is

what matters for firm decision-making.

       The fundamental problem faced by individual-based micro-simulation models is that data
on individuals does not reflect the nature of their co-workers, so that it is impossible to exactly

compute concepts such as the average non-group subsidy in a worker’s firm. I address this

problem by building “synthetic firms” in the CPS, assigning each CPS worker a set of co-

workers selected to represent the likely true set of co-workers in that firm. The core of this

computation is data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that show, for workers of any given

earnings level, the earnings distribution of their co-workers, separately by firm size, region of the

country, and health insurance offering status. Using these data, I randomly select 99 individuals

in the same firm size/region/health insurance offering cell as a given CPS worker in order to

statistically replicate the earnings distribution for that worker’s earnings level. These 99 workers

then become the co-workers in a worker’s synthetic firm.

       These synthetic firms then face three decisions about insurance: offering (whether to

offer if now not offering, or whether to drop if now offering); the division of costs between

employer and employees; and the level of insurance spending. I model each of these decisions

as subject to “pressures” from government interventions. In particular, subsidies to outside

insurance options (non-group insurance or public insurance) exert pressures on firm’s offering

insurance to drop that insurance and to raise employee contributions; subsidies to employer

spending on insurance cause firms that don’t now offer insurance to be more likely to offer,

causes firms to pick up a larger share of the cost of insurance, and causes a rise in employer

spending on insurance; and subsidies to employee spending on insurance also raise the odds that

firms offer insurance, and raise employer spending on insurance, but they lower employer

contributions to insurance.
       Finally, a key assumption for this type of modeling is the assumption on the wage

incidence of changes in employer-insurance spending. Gruber (2001) reviews the literature on

incidence, and concludes that there is strong evidence for full shifting to wages of firm-wide

changes in insurance costs, with some evidence of shifting to sub-groups within the workplace as

well. I make a mixed incidence assumption for this model. Any firm-wide reaction, such as

dropping insurance or lowering employee contributions, is directly reflected in wages. Yet any

individual’s decision, such as switching from group to non-group insurance, is not reflected in

that individual’s wages; rather, the savings to the firm (or the cost to the firm) is passed along on

average to all workers in the firm.

       Mine is far from the only approach to modeling the impact of health reform on

individuals, firms and the government. Modelers such as the Lewin Group and the Urban

Institute (through their TRIM model) have been working on these issues for years. They have

well developed models which provide interesting alternative scenarios for policy-makers. I rely

on my model for this paper since these alternatives are not readily available to me for

comparable runs. But a critical issue for policy makers is to “get under the hood” of all models

of this type and to consider the implications of key sensitivity checks of the models’

construction.




Modest Reforms

       I first consider two examples of modest reforms to insurance markets. These reforms
provide a benchmark for the kind of health policy changes that are most likely in today’s fiscally

constrained environment13 I consider both a typical “liberal” incremental reform (expanding

public health insurance entitlements) and “conservative” incremental reform (offering tax credits

for the purchase of nongroup insurance). To compare these alternative reforms, it is useful to put

them on an even footing in terms of coverage impacts. I do so by comparing alternative policies

that cover either 5 or 10 million new persons.




Public Insurance Expansion

        The first approach that I consider is expanding our existing public insurance entitlement.

Currently, that entitlement is fairly generous for children (extending at least to 200% of poverty),

but not at all for non-children who don’t then become pregnant. This has the strange feature that

individuals are covered quite generously until they turn 19, then covered not at all. This implies

that extending public insurance to the lowest income adults would be a much better targeted

expansion than would further extensions to middle class children.

        Table 3 considers two such expansions. The first column shows the effects of extending

free public health insurance to all individuals under 100% of the poverty line. In this range,

children and many parents are already eligible for public insurance, but single adults and most

parents are not.

        This policy reduces the number of uninsured in the U.S. by 5.1 million. This is only a net



13
  This subsection updates some of the estimates in Gruber (2005b) for incremental reforms. See that paper for a
richer discussion of these options and other alternatives.
figure, however; there is a gross reduction in the number of uninsured of 5.2 million, but an

offsetting very small increase in the number of uninsured of 0.1 million from firms dropping

insurance in reaction to this increase in outside insurance opportunities. Roughly 85% of the

individuals receiving the benefit of this expansion were previously uninsured; the remaining 15%

were individuals who had private insurance but who chose to move to public coverage (crowd-

out). As a result, there is a reduction in the number of employer insured of 0.6 million. Overall,

the number of persons on public insurance rises by 6.2 million, so that the total amount of

crowd-out (1 - change in uninsured/change in public insurance) is about 17%.

       This expansion has a total cost to (federal plus state and local) government of $26 billion

per year. This amounts to about $5000 per person newly insured. This reflects not only the cost

of paying for the previously uninsured who sign up for public coverage, and also the cost of

paying for those previously insured who sign up (which increases the numerator but not the

denominator). This cost also includes some (relatively small) tax incidence effects from changes

in wages due to the policy.

       The next row of the table focuses on the targeting of the policy, in terms of which types

of formerly uninsured individuals are helped by this intervention. The average age of those

newly insured by this policy is over 33 years, and 21% of those who were newly insured by the

policy were in fair or poor health. For comparison, among all uninsured persons, the average

age is 31 years old, and 9% are in fair/poor health. Thus, the set of individuals getting covered

by these expansions are in much worse health, and therefore more costly to insure, than are the
set of uninsured individuals not affected by the policy.

       This point is summarized by the next row in the table, which shows the average cost

associated with insuring the uninsured who gain coverage through these initiatives. For this

calculation, I have imputed to each person in the data the cost of insuring them through non-

group insurance, which varies by age/sex and by health status. I then discount this figure by

33% to approximate the cost in a group environment. I then add up across all newly insured, and

subtract it for those newly uninsured, to get a total “value” of insurance provided. This is a

somewhat arbitrary normalization but provides a useful means of comparing different policies.

For the public expansion this cost is almost $5400; by way of comparison, for all uninsured

persons, the average cost is less than $3400.

       The next row shows government spending per dollar of insurance value provided, which

is the ratio of government spending to the sum of the insurance value provided to the uninsured;

this is the “buck for the bang” measure described earlier, for this arbitrary normalization of

insurance value. For this expansion the figure is $0.93; that is, relative to providing those newly

insured with coverage at an age/sex/health specific group-level price, this policy spends 7 cents

less per person. As emphasized earlier, this is not a measure of deadweight loss or social

efficiency; it is simply a convenient proxy for capturing the targeting of this approach versus

alternatives that we consider below.

       The final rows in the table show the redistributive impact of this policy by documenting

the share of government spending going to different income groups. In this case, the result is

simple: 100% of the benefits go to those below the poverty line, with no benefits for those above
the poverty line. This is a highly redistributive policy.

       The second column of Table 3 shows the effect of a much larger expansion in public

insurance, making all individuals with incomes below 185% of the Federal poverty line eligible

for public insurance. This expansion covers 10 million persons, although Medicaid rolls rise by

13.5 million, for a net crowd-out of one-quarter. The cost of this policy is much larger, at $47

billion per year, or $4700 per newly insured. Thus, despite the much larger expansion, the cost

per newly insured is quite similar to column 1.

       The set of individuals newly insured by this more generous expansion is somewhat

healthier than in column 1, and the typical person newly insured has an average cost of $4690.

The bang for the buck is somewhat lower than in column 1: spending per dollar of insurance

value provided is roughly $1. This is a common feature of most health policies: as they are

expanded more broadly, the value of insurance coverage per dollar of spending falls. This is

because more generous expansions are less well-targeted, leading to a bigger problem of crowd-

out.

       Moreover, the spending is somewhat less redistributive with this policy. In this case,

55% of spending goes to those below the poverty line, and 45% to those between 100% and

200% of the poverty line.




Non-group Tax Credits

       Table 4 considers an alternative popular incremental reform: tax credits for the purchase
of non-group insurance.14 Individuals and families are eligible for a credit of one size for single

coverage, and another size for family coverage. This eligibility is restricted on income in one of

two ways. First, I consider a “tightly targeted” non-group credit, which is fully available to

single persons with income below $15,000, or families with income below $30,000, and which

phases out as income rises, with eligibility ending at $30,000 for singles and $60,000 for

families. Second, I consider a “loosely targeted” non-group credit, which is fully available to

single persons with income below $25,000, or families with income below $50,000, and which

phases out as income rises, with eligibility ending at $50,000 for singles and $100,000 for

families. The required magnitude of these credits is shown in the second row of the table; for

each level of targeting, I choose a credit amount sufficient to hit the targets of 5 and 10 million

newly insured persons.

         Several differences in the effects of nongroup tax credits and public insurance

expansions are immediately apparent. First, there is a much larger gross increase in the

uninsured offsetting the gross reduction in meeting our targets of 5 and 10 million. For example,

to hit the target of a 10 million person reduction with tight targeting requires take-up by 13

million persons, since there is a 3 million person rise in the uninsured from firm dropping.

Second, there are very large reductions in the number of employer insured, due both to employee

switching and firm dropping; roughly 20% of this reduction comes from switching, and the

remaining 80% is due to firm dropping. Moreover, a much smaller share of the recipients,



14

of the uninsured do not pay taxes, so any non-refundable tax policy will have very limited impact.
between 37 and 50%, were previously uninsured; the majority are using this subsidy while

retaining insurance coverage.

        This may seem like a lot of firm dropping in response to (in particular in the first column)

fairly small non-group credits, but it is important to remember that this reduction in employer

insured is off of a very large base of 180 million employer-insured. The 5.5 million reduction in

employer-insured in the first column, for example, represents just 3.5% of the employer-insured

in the U.S. Even with the enormous non-group credit shown in the second column, $6000 for

singles and $15,000 for families, only 6.6% of those with employer-provided insurance drop that

insurance. This is partly because the credits are targeted to only a subset of employees, so that

on average the pressure on employers to stop offering insurance (due to the erosion of the

employer tax advantage) is small. When the credit is more loosely targeted, in the final two

columns, the reduction in the employer-insured is much larger, rising to almost 13% of the

employer-insured in the final column.

        Third, this approach is by and large more expensive than public expansions. For the 5

million target, with the tightly targeted credit, the cost is fairly similar to the public expansion.

The other approaches, however, are much more expensive, both overall and (by definition) per

person newly insured. Indeed, a loosely targeted credit designed to cover 10 million persons

costs almost $80 billion per year, or about $8000 per person newly insured.

        Another striking difference between public expansions and non-group credits is the

targeting of the spending. In contrast to public expansions, the set of uninsured who gain
coverage through non-group credits are much healthier than the average uninsured person, with

an average age of 27-28 years, and only 5-7% in fair or poor health. The average cost of

insuring the newly insured is only $2400-$2700 per year.

       The reason for these low costs is that these types of partial subsidies to non-group

insurance are much more attractive to the healthy individuals for whom the lower cost of non-

group insurance makes these a larger percentage subsidy. As a result, the value of insurance

provided by these policies is much less than for a public expansion. Indeed, as the last row

shows, it takes $2.40 to $4 of government spending to provide just $1 of insurance coverage

through these policies. Thus, by this measure, non-group tax credits are much lower bang for the

buck than public insurance expansions.

       Another lesson is that the BfB of non-group credits is much higher if they are tightly,

rather than loosely, targeted. This is because, given the low incomes of the uninsured, more

tightly targeted credits spend a higher share of their costs on those who would otherwise be

uninsured. This highlights the value of tightly targeting health care interventions, but it is not

clear how politically realistic such targeting will be, given the broad reach of recent tax policy

changes. For example, the child tax credit, originally introduced as a benefit for low income

families with children, now extends to families with incomes over $100,000 per year.

       Because of the less stringent targeting than for public insurance, non-group credits also

embody less redistribution, as shown by the distribution of net spending in the final rows of the
table.15 The credits that extends coverage to 5 million persons distributes benefits to those up to

300% of poverty; the credits that extend coverage to 10 million persons distributes significant

benefits up to 400%, and some even beyond that level.

        In order to combat the erosion of nongroup tax credits, many have suggested extending

tax credits to the employee portion of employer-provided insurance as well. While this does to

some extent mitigate the erosion of the employer market, however, it significantly raises costs.

This follows directly from the observations made earlier: 93% of those offered already have

insurance, so most of the dollars from credits to employees will flow to those already covered,

and those who don’t take up employer offers are very price insensitive, so there will be relatively

few newly insured from such a policy. Moreover, employers would react to such a policy by

raising employee contribution levels to some extent, so that the incidence of the tax credit would

not be fully on lowering health insurance costs. Indeed, if the government attempted to newly

insure 5 million persons through a tightly targeted credit to employees to purchase employer-

provided insurance, it would require a credit of $1200 for individuals and $3000 for families, for

a total cost of $55 billion per year. Costs rise exponentially as the credit is more loosely targeted

or attempts to cover more individuals.




More Fundamental Reform

        If politicians decided to consider more fundamental reforms to address the problem of the

15
  The spending distribution here incorporates both the spending through non-group tax credits and the savings
through lower public insurance payments to these groups for those leaving public insurance.
uninsured, there are a number of directions that could be considered. A more comprehensive

plan to deal with the uninsured must address three issues. The first is pooling. Insurance is most

efficiently provided through a pool, and a key goal of fundamental health care reform must be to

provide some type of pooling mechanism through which individuals can buy their insurance and

avoid the harsh non-group market. The second is affordability. The largest single private

insurance pool in the U.S. today is the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP),

which insures almost 3 million federal employees. Employees face a variety of choices in this

pool, but all are fairly generous and subject to mandated restrictions such as mental health parity

(mental health expenses must be covered as generously as other expenses). The cost of

insurance under the most frequently chosen Federal plan, the Blue Cross plan, is very high: for

2006 this plan cost $5125/year for individuals and $11750/year for families. For a family of four

at 200% of the poverty line, this would represent more than one-quarter of their family income!

       The final issue is mandates. A key issue that must be faced by policy makers as they

address the uninsured is whether the goal is universal insurance access, or universal insurance

coverage. As will be clear from the estimates below, there is no way to design a public policy

that gets close to universal coverage without mandating that individuals are insured. But

mandates are politically unpopular, so politicians may want to focus instead on ensuring that

everyone who wants insurance can afford to have it.

       To give some sense of the cost and consequences of fundamental reform, I consider three

options that take as given the constraint that private insurance provision must be a centerpiece of

any reform plan.
Universal Access

       The first option is to ensure universal access of individuals to an affordable insurance

product. Here I follow the proposal for national universal coverage developed in Gruber

(2007a). This proposal shares many features with the ambitious health care reform passed in

Massachusetts in 2006 (and considered by other states as well, most prominently California), as

well as many of the proposals of the leading Democratic candidates in the 2006 Presidential

election.

       Public insurance entitlements would be frozen at their current level, which is typically

around 200% of poverty for children in most states, and 100% of poverty for parents in many

states. The remainder of low income individuals in the U.S. who do not have access to

employer-sponsored insurance would be enrolled in new state-specific pools. Insurance

companies would be eligible to offer insurance in these state-specific pools on a guaranteed issue

basis. Within these pools, insurance prices would be completely community rated.

       The benefits packages within the pools would vary based on income group. For the

lowest income individuals (below the poverty line), coverage would be complete, with minimal

cost-sharing. As income increased, modest cost sharing would be introduced, reaching levels

typical of new employer-sponsored insurance offerings for the highest income members of the

pool (e.g. $20 copayment for physician visits or generic prescriptions). There would be other

cost controls in place, such as selective networks, to offset the more generous benefits provision
for lower income groups. In my modeling I assume that the cost of insurance in this pool would

equal the typical cost of insurance to large firms in each state, and that this would fall to 95% of

that level for those between 100 and 200% of poverty, to 90% of that level for those between

200% and 300% of poverty, and to 85% of that level for those between 300% and 400% of

poverty through cost-sharing. There would also be redistribution across plans within this pool to

offset very high cost cases, with all insurers contributing to a fund going to offset part of the

highest cost patients.

          Insurance would be subsidized in this pool by setting a limit as a share of income that

individuals must pay for their insurance. These limits would be:

    •     2% of income between 100 and 150% of the poverty line

    •     4% of income between 150% and 200% of the poverty line

    •     6% of income between 200% and 250% of the poverty

    •     8% of income between 250% and 300% of the poverty line

    •     10% of income between 300% and 350% of the poverty line

    •     12% of income between 350% and 400% of the poverty line

For comparison purposes, median income in the U.S. is between 3 and 4 times the poverty line,

depending on family structure, so this schedule would subsidize insurance up to median income

levels.

          This approach leaves one low income group without subsidies, however: low-income

individuals who are offered employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) but who cannot afford the

premiums. As highlighted earlier, the vast majority of low-income individuals who are offered
ESI take it; for example, 87% of those between 100% and 200% of the poverty line offered ESI

are insured (Gruber, 2007b). Thus, it is very expensive to try to insure the remaining individuals.

At the same time, there is a major horizontal equity concern with allowing subsidies only to

those who aren’t offered ESI (particularly once, as described below, the tax subsidy to ESI is

removed).

       Gruber (forthcoming) reviews the options for addressing this inequity and suggests that a

middle ground may be the “voucher” option that is present in the recent Massachusetts

legislation: low income individuals offered ESI can come to the low-income pool, but must bring

their employer contribution with them (e.g. employers must contribute their share to offset the

state’s pool cost). While expensive, this approach reduces costs by forcing individuals to move

to the pool if they want to get the subsidies, rather than just subsidizing their status quo ESI

choice. I include this option in the modeling here.

       For middle and high income families (above 400% of poverty), states would set up a new

pooling mechanism which would replace the existing non-group insurance market. This new

pool would be guaranteed issue (insurers cannot reject any applicants), and there would be no

health rating, although insurers could age-rate on a 2:1 basis (e.g. the premiums for the oldest

enrollees can be no more than 2 times the premiums for the youngest enrollees). Any insurer

participating in the pool would contribute towards a risk pool that offset part of the costs of the

very highest cases, to deal with adverse selection within the pool.
       While the new pooling mechanism would replace the non-group market, firms would also

be allowed to buy into that pool, although if they did so they could not offer their employees any

non-pool source of insurance (to avoid sending the worst risks to the pool). If an employer

offered the pool to its employees, the employer would be list-billed for the individual costs of

each enrollee.

       The results of introducing a plan of this nature are shown in the first column of Table 5.

This policy would increase the number of newly insured by 23 million, slightly less than half of

the total stock of uninsured, despite these very generous subsidies and comprehensive reform.

This reflects the fact that many uninsured are uninterested in obtaining coverage even at very

high subsidy rates. Although this is clearly an out of sample prediction, this result is consistent

with the large number of uninsured who are eligible for free public insurance but do enroll as

well as the large number of uninsured who are eligible for highly subsidized employer-provided

insurance but do not enroll. Universal access does not lead to anywhere near universal coverage.

       This policy is also very expensive, with a cost of $102 billion, or almost $4500 per

person newly insured. This reflects the fact that the vast majority of those taking up the new

subsidies were already insured; only 25 million of the 52 million persons using these subsidies

were formerly uninsured. There is a sizeable erosion of employer provided insurance, with 16

million persons losing employer coverage, which represents about 10% of the existing stock of

employer-insured individuals. Most of those move to the new pool, but over 2 million become

uninsured as their firms drop insurance but they don’t find the new pool option attractive.

       This policy attracts individuals who are slightly sicker than the average uninsured person,
with average costs per person of $3430 (about $70 higher than the typical ex-ante uninsured).

Overall, this policy spends $1.10 per dollar of insurance value provided. It is quite striking that

the BfB of this policy is better than for non-group tax credits. In other words, compared to a

broad tax credit designed to cover 10 million uninsured, this policy covers more than twice as

many individuals for only 25% more in spending, and delivers almost four times as much

insurance value.




Individual Mandate

        The second option is to move from the universal access approach in the first column to a

universal coverage approach. This can be accomplished by adding an individual mandate, a

requirement that all individuals obtain insurance coverage, to the universal access option. This is

similar to what is required for auto insurance in many states, and was a centerpiece of the recent

Massachusetts reform plan. We have no experience to date with such a mandate, so it is hard to

predict the success of enforcement. But, if penalties are strong (as they are in Massachusetts,

where individuals are liable for half of insurance premiums even if uninsured), the mandate is

likely to be close to universal. For simplicity here I assume that the mandate provides close to

universal coverage, although in practice some individuals are likely to “slip through the

cracks”.16

        The results of adding this mandate are shown in the second column of Table 5. By

16
  In particular I assume that 95% of those who would not voluntarily choose to insure are forced to insure through
the mandate.
assumption, 97% of the uninsured are covered. What is striking about these results, however, is

the incredible gain in budgetary efficiency relative to the universal access plan. Total public

sector costs have risen only 25%, while the number of newly insured has increased by 100%.

There is less displacement of employer insurance than in the universal access plan, as individuals

use their employer coverage to meet this mandate. With the mandate, 52% of those using the

new pooling mechanism were formerly uninsured. As a result, the cost of this option per newly

insured falls to $2732, and the government spends only $0.81 per dollar of insurance value

provided.17

         This is a striking set of findings, which suggest that besides any moral/paternalism

argument for universal coverage, there is a budgetary efficiency argument as well. The logic of

this result is quite clear: relative to a universal access plan, moving to universal coverage

involves mandating those who would be uninsured to sign up for insurance. This is the ultimate

form of targeting; these individuals are only tunas, so there is no money wasted on dolphins.

         This result in particular highlights the important difference between bang for the buck

and social efficiency. The higher bang for the buck in this case comes from mandating that

uninsured individuals spend money they would prefer to spend elsewhere on their health

insurance coverage (above and beyond subsidies). Yet there is no gain in social efficiency unless

there are externalities from this increased insurance or other gains through paternalism.




17
  This estimate is below 1 because I value insurance at the typical group insurance cost, while I assume that
individuals enroll in less generous plans at higher income levels in the pool.
Universal Coverage Financed By Removing the Tax Exclusion

       A natural source of financing for this initiative is the tax subsidy to employer-sponsored

insurance. While employer expenditures on wages are taxed, employer expenditures on health

insurance are not. This large subsidy to ESI is regressive, since it is worth the most to the higher

income individuals with the highest tax rates, and induces inefficient insurance purchase, since

individuals can buy excessively generous insurance with pre-tax dollars. Of course, in the

absence of any other pooling mechanism for workers, the ESI tax subsidy may be a necessary

price to pay to keep the employer-sponsored insurance market intact. With a new pooling

mechanism, however, reductions in ESI are not problematic: it doesn’t matter whether

individuals obtain insurance through employers or not, so long as they have access to some

group insurance mechanism. That is, introducing a new pooling mechanism can facilitate reform

of the regressive and inefficient existing subsidy to ESI.

       Moreover, the employer tax expenditure has a natural advantage as a source of financing:

the tax savings grow at the rate of health insurance premiums, matching the growth in

expenditures under a universal coverage plan. Since health insurance premiums grow faster than

incomes, supporting universal coverage through an income tax would require a constantly rising

tax rate. Limiting the exclusion, however, would provide a stream of revenues that grows at the

same rate as program costs.

       I therefore consider the impact of funding the national plan by removing this tax subsidy.

More specifically, employer expenditures on health insurance would be included in taxable
wages for individuals. An important issue to resolve with such a policy is whether ESI

expenditures would be included for both income and payroll tax purposes and, if included for

both, whether the resulting revenues would be dedicated to the social insurance programs

financed by these payroll taxes or “recaptured” for use in funding the universal coverage plan. I

assume that revenues would be recaptured from the payroll tax.

        The next column of Table 5 shows the implication of using this financing source for the

mandate plan. Strikingly, this source is sufficient to move than pay for the national plan, with

$50 billion in excess government tax revenues.18 That is, the current tax exclusion is so large

that by rededicating it in this fashion the U.S. can have universal coverage with a $50 billion

surplus. This $50 billion is much less than the amount lost through the tax exclusion ($200

billion) minus the cost of the individual mandate in Table 5 ($120 billion), because the removal

of the employer exclusion significantly erodes the employer-provided insurance base. Whereas

employer-provided insurance fell by only 7 million before removing the exclusion, it now falls

by 24 million, or 15% of the base, when the exclusion is removed as well. Of course, with the

individual mandate, this is simply a shift of insurance coverage from employers to the new

pooling mechanism. Indeed, the cost per dollar of insurance provided is negative, since the

government saves money yet provides insurance.
      Of course, such a policy would have enormous distributional consequences, as the

spending would be targeted to the lower parts of the income distribution, while the higher taxes

would be borne by higher income groups. In fact, while there would be substantial gains for


18
  This estimate understates the total gain in revenues from removing the tax exclusion because it does not count the
revenues collected on employer-provided insurance to retirees.
those below 2 times the federal poverty line, there would be losses at 3 or more times the federal

poverty line; median income in the U.S. is between 3 to 4 times the poverty line depending on

family structure. Thus, such a policy would be a net loser for more than half the families in the

U.S.

       The surplus revenue of $50 billion can be used to reduce the net losses from the proposal

experienced by those with income above about three times the poverty line. For example, these

funds are sufficient to provide a credit equal to $380/individual and $950/family for those

between 300% and 400% of the poverty line, falling to $120/individual and $340/family for

those between 400% and 500% of the poverty line. The final column shows that adding such a

credit would lead to no net losses between three and four times poverty, and would reduce by

25% the losses between four and five times poverty. Thus, by recycling revenues, we could

finance universal coverage in the U.S. in a way where there are net gains to all income classes

below median incomes in the U.S.




                                      Part VI: Conclusions

       There is a standard health policy joke that goes like this. Health policy expert X dies and

goes to heaven. When there, he is greeted by God himself, and the Lord says that the health

expert can ask one question of Him before entering heaven. The health expert chooses to ask

God "Will we ever have universal health insurance coverage in the United States"? To which

God answers "Yes, but not in my lifetime".

       This joke summarizes the prospects that policy experts see for universal health coverage
in the United States. Over the past few years, however, significant coverage expansions have

started to percolate up from the U.S. states. Maine's "Dirigo" program, enacted in 2003, gained

national attention for its bold structure and large subsidies to individuals and employers. More

recently, the state of Illinois announced plans to cover all uninsured children in the state. Most

dramatically, the state of Massachusetts recently enacted legislation that transforms the nature of

the insurance market, subsidizes a large share of the low-income population so that they can

afford health insurance, and mandates that all residents be covered by health insurance. This is

truly a comprehensive reform that brings the state as close to universal coverage as anywhere in

the United States. This effort is being replicated in other states, most notably in debates in

California.

       These recent episodes have brought the issue of the uninsured back to the forefront of

policy debates in the U.S. In this article, I have reviewed the issues that must be addressed as

policy makers consider further expansions in insurance coverage at either the state or national

level. There are many routes to expanded insurance coverage in the U.S., and economic analysis

has a lot to offer in terms of guiding us towards the correct path.

       Of course, this essay has focused on only one of the two major problems facing the U.S.

health economy. The other is the rapid rise in health care costs. Health care spending has more

than tripled as a share of GDP since 1950, and by current projections will reach almost 50% of

health care over the next 75 years (Congressional Budget Office, 2007). What has driven this

rapid rise in health care costs? A large health economics literature has studied this question, and

the general conclusion is a simple one: the rapid rise in health care costs has been driven by
quality-improving technological change.

       The focus of the current article (as well as most recent policy proposals) is to focus on

covering the uninsured, and to pay only lip service to fundamental cost control. This is by

design. The solution to problems of low insurance coverage is clear, and there is an emerging

consensus path to addressing this concern in a politically feasible fashion. But the science of

cost control is much less advanced, and at this point we have no way to fundamentally control

health care costs which does not deny American consumers (and their health providers) care that

they value.

       Measures that are being discussed today under the guise of cost control are very modest.

Initiatives such as medical electronic records, increased preventive and maintenance care, and

reduced medical errors will at best reduce health care costs by only a few percentage points, and

are just as likely to raise costs (with increasing quality). With health care costs rising at 7-10%

per year, this is not enough. To fundamentally control health care costs we need to actually be

willing to deny care that does little for health – but which consumers now want. This would be

accomplished either through government technology policy, medical standards, or global

provider budgets.

       There remains considerable controversy, however, over the appropriate level of such

government interventions – or whether they are necessary at all. Some argue that past health

care spending advances are well justified by improvements in population health (Cutler, 2004).

Others argue that there are huge variations in health care practices across the U.S. with no
tangible benefits (e.g. Skinner, Staiger and Fisher, 2006). These two views are not mutually

inconsistent: the first speaks to the average value of medical care over time, the second to the

marginal value of additional health care at a point in time. But until we can resolve these

discrepancies and understand more fully which health care spending is justified and which is not,

we are not prepared to take on the American public on cost control. The fundamental insight of

this round of reform is therefore to not hold the attainable goal (universal coverage) hostage to

the (currently) unattainable goal, fundamental health care cost control.
