Time to Eat: Household Production Under Increasing Income Inequality
Daniel S. Hamermesh
NBER Working Paper No. 12002
January 2006
JEL No. J22, Q11

                                           ABSTRACT


Eating requires the food materials that make up meals and also time devoted to buying food,
preparing meals and eating them, and cleaning up afterwards. Using time-diary and expenditure data
for the U.S. for 1985 and 2003, I examine how income and time prices affect time and goods input
into this household-produced commodity. Focusing on these two years, between which income and
earnings inequality increased, allows examining how household production is affected by changing
economic opportunities. The results demonstrate that both inputs into eating increase with income,
and that higher time prices at a given level of income reduce time inputs. Over this period the goods
intensity of producting this commodity increased, especially at the lower oart of the income
distribution, and the eaverage time input dropped substantially. The results are consistent with
goods-time substitution in eating being relatively difficult and with substitution becoming relatively
more difficult as production expands. This is confirmed by direct estimates using matched time-use
and food spending data on the same households for 2003 and 2004. The findings imply that
projecting food expenditures alone overestimates the amount spent on food in a growing economy.

I. Introduction

        There are two activities that every person must do to survive: Eat and sleep. While the latter is

amenable to economic analysis (see Biddle and Hamermesh, 1990), with the exception of an infrequent

purchase of bedding and mattresses the production of sleep is a decision solely about time use. Not so for

eating: Generating meals requires decisions about money expenditures on the capital required to engage

in this activity and on the non-durable good food itself, as well as about the time spent in obtaining food,

preparing it, consuming it and cleaning up the detritus from the meal. How people combine expenditures

on the goods and time that make up the production of the commodity “eating” is the major focus of this

study, and I will present evidence on these combinations and their changes over the past two decades in

the United States.

        Essentially no attention has been paid to analyzing how the production of eating takes place in the

household. The only relevant literature includes Gronau and Hamermesh (2006), who provide measures

of the relative goods intensity of “eating” (and other commodities) in the U.S. and Israel, and Lecocq

(2001), who examines food spending and (only) meal preparation time (from recall data) in France.

Crossley and Lu (2004) study the details of food spending and meal preparation time using two separate

surveys, while Aguiar and Hurst (2005) examine time and goods inputs into eating at a point in time using

data on older Americans from two separate surveys, one of expenditures on goods, the other a time-diary

study. Vernon (2004) has data on food spending and (recall data) on time use for samples of Russian

households in the 1990s. No study tries to combine the spending and time use measures to infer how the

goods-intensity of household production varies with full income.

        Because decisions about how to generate “eating” depend on choices about how time is spent in

the activity, and because the value of time differs across individuals (and for the same person at different

times of the day, week, year and lifetime), they are inherently economic. Thus even though we all may

face the same price of the goods that are inputs into “eating,” we will choose different combinations of

goods and time to generate the same amount of “eating” (Becker, 1965) even when our household

incomes are equal. A second purpose here will thus be to analyze how household members’ choices of

the amounts of time and goods to devote to eating are affected by differences in economic incentives.
          Gronau’s (1980) pioneering work considered inter alia the role of income in affecting household

production. Given the potential importance of income effects, it seems sensible to examine the dynamics

of this relationship, since arguably the most important change in the American economy (and to a lesser

extent in many other industrialized economies too) in the last quarter century has been the rise in

inequality in earnings and incomes (see e.g., Gottschalk and Smeeding, 2000). Among its many potential

impacts rising income inequality, and the relative changes in time prices that constitute the source of

much of the increased inequality, may also have altered the incentives for generating commodities in the

household, including “eating,” that face people at different points of the distributions of earnings and

incomes. The extent of changes resulting from these changed incentives, and therefore the distributional

impacts of rising inequality on how Americans generate “eating,” is the third central focus of this study.1

          In the next Section I provide a brief motivation for the analysis. Section III discusses the large

variety of data sets that are used in this study and outlines ways to overcome a number of complex

estimation problems that are thrown up by difficulties with the available data, including the likely

endogeneity of variations in wages and incomes. Section IV presents the empirical results that shed light

on the first two foci of the study. It also analyzes changes in the inputs into eating over the two decades

from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s and what they imply about the household production function for

eating.

II. Theoretical Motivation

          The discussion of household production for eating is fairly standard and stems directly from

Becker (1965). The typical household chooses to supply its members’ labor to the market, and to use its

remaining time in a variety of activities that it combines with the income generated by its members’ labor

market time and any non-labor income it may receive. Among these activities are those related to eating;

and among the goods purchased are food and the capital necessary to convert that food into meals. Given

the household’s preferences, it will thus determine its utility-maximizing production of the commodity

eating. It will generate demands for time and goods inputs into eating as:

1
 Gottschalk and Mayer (2002) examine the general question of how changing household time use affects inferences
about changing inequality by valuing several (recall) measures of time spent in household activities and adding the
total to household income.

                                                        2
(1a)    T = T(WM, WF, I; Z);

and

(1b)    X = X(WM, WF, I; Z),

where T is its time input into eating, X its dollar expenditures on food, WM and WF are the husband’s and

wife’s value of time, I is unearned income, and Z is a vector of demographic characteristics that might

shift the demand functions for time and goods. We have written the model for a two-adult household,

since the data require us to use such households in the empirical analyses; but a similar, simpler model

could be written down for a single-adult household.

        The economically interesting questions have to do with the expansion paths of the demand for

inputs into eating and their changes as incomes and the prices of time change. The effects of exogenous

changes in the economic variables on the choices of T and X are fairly standard: 1) Because the total

endowment of time is fixed, in (1a) a higher price of time may or may not cause a shift away from using

time in producing eating. The outcome depends on the relative time intensity of eating compared to other

commodities and on the relative substitutability of goods and time in eating. There is some evidence

(Gronau and Hamermesh, 2006) that eating is relatively goods-intensive. If so, as the price of time

increases people would expand their production of eating, although they would surely attempt to do so in

an increasingly goods-intensive way.     As their non-labor income increases, they will expand their

production of eating, perhaps using more time (again, depending on the relatively substitutability of

goods and time in producing this commodity compared to others). In the end the directions of the effects

of WM, WF and I on T depend on a variety of characteristics of the production of eating and of eating

relative to other household-produced commodities; but we do expect that I will have a more positive

effect on T than will WM or WF. 2) For most commodities, including probably eating, increases in

income, whether due to a higher price of time (as reflected in higher wages per hour of market work) or

higher non-labor income will increase total goods expenditures. We thus expect each of the three

economic variables in (1b) to have positive effects on X.




                                                      3
III. Data and Measurement Issues

        Sadly there are no single data sets that combine information on households’ goods expenditures

and time actually spent (as recorded in time diaries) by all household members in the production of

eating. One data set does make it possible to combine such information for one household member’s time

use and the household’s food spending, and I return to that later. Both for the U.S. and for other countries,

however, we do have detailed consumer expenditure surveys covering large samples of households. We

also have detailed time budgets that typically cover smaller samples. In this study we use the 1985 Time

Use Survey (TUS85) for the United States, a relatively small privately conducted survey that obtained one

day’s time diaries from single individuals and from both spouses in a married household and collected

some demographic information on both spouses and other household members (Robinson and Godbey,

1999). The 1985 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES85) contains detailed categories of spending as well

as a set of demographic variables that are similar in scope to those included in the TUS85.

        Because I am interested in comparing how rising wage and income inequality affects the

production of eating in the household, I estimate the same models on data from 2003, when income

inequality was greater than in 1985.2 The year 2003 is chosen because it is the first year in which the

Bureau of Labor Statistics collected data in the American Time Use Survey (ATUS03), which offers for

that year a sample of one-day time diaries from nearly 21,000 individuals who had recently been Current

Population Survey (CPS) respondents (see Horrigan and Herz, 2005). I analyze these data along with

information on goods expenditures from households in the 2003 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES03).

Particularly in the TUS85 there are too few single individuals to allow a useful analysis to be conducted,

so I restrict the study to married individuals with spouse present. I further restrict the analyses to married

persons ages 18-64, as I wish to avoid issues related to the well-known unexpectedly large drop that

occurs around the normal retirement age (Hamermesh, 1984).

        One of the reasons why there have been so few efforts to estimate household production functions

may be because of the necessity of classifying activities and expenditures into commodities. Any


2
 In 1985 the Gini coefficient on household incomes in the U.S. was 0.425, and the 80/20 ratio was 4.25. In 2003 the
same statistics were 0.464 and 4.83.

                                                        4
classification is necessarily arbitrary; and the difficulty is exacerbated if we wish to compare household

production across time, since the list of activities included in time diaries I use changed between the two

surveys. I thus arbitrarily classify certain time and expenditure categories as representing inputs into

eating.

          The exact classifications used in extracting information from the four samples, the TUS85, the

ATUS03, and the CES85 and CES03, are listed in Appendix Table 1. For the time-use surveys I include

the exact codes identifying the categories treated as constituting food activities. The goal in classifying

activities is to include as time inputs into eating those activities that are described as eating at home and

away from home (including at work), meal preparation and clean-up, and grocery shopping and travel

related to grocery shopping. I thus try to include all time spent at meals no matter where they are taken or

what the purpose. Nonetheless, some people may classify an activity such as drinking at a bar as part of

their leisure activities, so that it may not be and perhaps should not be included as a time input into this

commodity. Because it is not separately classified in both the TUS85 and ATUS03, I do not include travel

to eat away from home, in order to maintain comparability across the two years. Because the TUS85

collected no information on secondary activities (things done simultaneously with the activity that is

reported in the survey), and the ATUS03 only reported secondary childcare activity, there is nothing we

can do about the possibility that food preparation or clean-up might have been done as an activity

secondary to something else and might thus have been under-reported.3

          Expenditures on food and alcohol (the latter counted only as half) are the main components of

goods inputs into eating; but I also include spending on small appliances (presumably for the kitchen) and

arbitrarily treat one-third of expenditures on major appliances as inputs into eating (on the assumption

that some of these items represent kitchen appliances such as refrigerators, stoves and dishwashers).

While these classifications are arbitrary, they are identical for all households. Moreover, since in the

3
 Evidence from the 1991/92 German Zeitbudgeterhebung, which includes reports of secondary activities, suggests
that this is not a problem. Only 5 percent of all eating time was reported as secondary, far less than the average
incidence of secondary time reported. Cleaning, cooking and shopping (for all items, not just groceries) accounted
for only 9 percent of all secondary activities, less than their representation among primary activities. When people
report eating, shopping, food preparation or clean-up, it is the primary activity, with television-watching, radio-
listening or childcare often being secondary to them. The small extent of secondary time spent in the commodity
“eating” suggests that our necessary neglect of it here is unimportant.

                                                         5
empirical analysis I shall essentially be differencing patterns of household production across income

levels and across years, so long as the full-income elasticity of demand for the various inputs is constant

across the years much of any misclassifications will be differenced out. Finally, I replicated the analyses

of the determinants of expenditures using only the narrowest CES definition of expenditures on eating,

namely spending on food alone, and found no qualitative differences from the results presented here.

        The TUS85 has only extremely broad classifications of household income and spouses’ hourly

earnings. While the ATUS03 provides good information on earnings, good information on incomes is

available for the fewer than one-third of ATUS03 respondents who were also included in the March 2003

CPS Income Supplement.            Even if the data sets had better and more extensive measures of these

economic variables, however, using them would introduce biases into estimates of household production:

An individual’s earnings, and his/her household income, are generated by the wage rate. But the latter in

turn depends on the time that the individual chooses to devote to market work (Biddle and Zarkin, 1989);

and that choice in turn is determined simultaneously with choices of time inputs into producing different

commodities, including eating, in the household. In order to obtain unbiased estimates of the household

production function we must somehow find instrumental variables for the wage and income measures that

are central to the analysis.

        Write the estimating equations for time and goods expenditures into eating as:

(2a)    Tit =   Yit +   it,


and

(2b)    Xit =   Yit +   it,   t = 1985, 2003,

where i is an observation (couple), t is a year (1985 or 2003) and Y denotes a vector of economic

variables consisting of the spouses’ wage rates and household income in (2a) and perhaps the same

variables or a subset of them in (2b). There are no satisfactory instruments for the variables in the vector

Y in these data sets. The data sets do, however, provide information on a set of variables Z that are

reasonably viewed as determinants of the Y and as exogenous to goods and time use by adults.

Moreover, information on both the Z and the Y variables is available from other sets of data that also



                                                      6
sample randomly from the U.S. population at the same times as the 1985 and 2003 time-use and

expenditure surveys that we use.

        I use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for 1986 (PSID86), which has information on 1985

household net (after federal taxes) income, Y1, to estimate:

(3a)    Y1it = Z1it +    it,


where Z1 is a vector of exogenous variables. I then take the estimates of the vector of parameters * to

create instruments Y1* using the Z1it in the TUS85 and the CES85. Similarly, I use the Panel Study of

Income Dynamics for 2003 (PSID03) to create instruments for net income using the Z1it in the ATUS03

and CES03.4 Included in the vector Z1 are a vector of indicators of the educational attainment of each

spouse, quadratics in each spouse’s age, and the number of children under age 6 and ages 6-17.

        For each spouse’s wage rate I estimate:

(3b)    Wjit= Z2jit +    jit,   t = 1985, 2003,

where Wj (j=M,F) is the usual weekly earnings of workers in the Merged Outgoing Rotation Groups of

the 1985 and 2003 CPS. For each married person age 18-64 (the same age group that we use in the main

data sets), the wage is predicted from a vector Z2 describing their education, reported usual weekly hours

and a quadratic in their age. In describing the earnings of married women we account for Gronau’s

(1974) wage selectivity into the labor force by using Heckman’s (1979) two-step method. The

imputations of both net income and hourly earnings using this two-sample instrumental variable approach

(Angrist and Krueger, 1992) circumvent both the potential endogeneity of these variables in the time use

and CES data sets and the absence of good information on earnings and incomes in the TUS85 and on

incomes in the ATUS03.

        The absence of information on both time use and goods expenditures in the same sample presents

difficulties for generating estimates of how these are combined to create the commodity eating. We

simply do not observe time and goods expenditures on eating in any particular household. One solution

would be to aggregate the measures in each sample into age-education cell averages. The difficulty with


4
 Only information on gross income is available in the PSID03. To derive analog to the data for 1985 I subtract the
standard deduction and personal exemptions from gross income and apply the 2002 tax tables.

                                                        7
this solution, at least for 1985 because the TUS85 sample is quite small, is that the cells would either be

very few in number or very sparsely populated. A better solution is to recognize that both the time-use

survey and the CES for each year sample from the same underlying population.                         Similarly, the

instruments for income and hourly earnings are also based on the same populations. Each sample’s

imputed values of the variables in the vector Y thus represent unbiased estimates of the underlying

distributions of the variables in the vector. We can thus use them as if they were measuring income and

time prices in the household to which they are imputed and treat the estimates of equations (2) as

reflecting the demands for goods and time inputs into eating.5 To maintain comparability across the two

years, and to allow concentrating on the impacts of changing inequality, we transform the instrumental

estimates into percentile points (so that, for examples, in the TUS85 the household with the median

imputed net income would be assigned a value of 50 for imputed net income, the wife in the household in

the CES03 with an imputed hourly earnings at the 75th percentile of wives’ earnings would be assigned a

value of 75 for this variable, etc.).6

            The central estimates are of the equations:

(2a’)       ln(T)it =   ’YPit +   it,


and

(2b’)       ln(X)it =   ’YPit +   it,   t = 1985, 2003

where the YP are the percentile points of the distributions of imputed net income and hourly earnings

measures.7 The estimated ’ and ’ measure the percentage impacts of one-percentile increases in

household incomes or hourly earnings (time prices) on the representative household’s total time and

goods inputs respectively into the production of eating.

            A final difficulty is that, while we have time diaries for both spouses in the TUS85, the ATUS03

only collected a time diary for one household member. For 2003 we thus cannot obtain T simply by
5
 These input-demand equations leave out the prices of goods under the assumption that they are identical for all
individuals at a point in time.

    Appendix Table 2 presents a concordance of all the data sets used in this study.

 The equations were also estimated with linear forms of the dependent variables with little qualitative difference in
the results.

summing up spouses’ time spent on food. Because the ATUS03 households have been in the CPS,

however, we do have information on all the variables Z characterizing ATUS03 respondents and their

spouses that we used to create the instruments for the variables in the vector Y. I thus generate

predictions of food time for husbands and wives on whom the ATUS provides time diaries, with the fitted

values based on each spouse’s age, education, reported weekly hours of market work, race, ethnicity, and

age distribution of children. I then use the same equations to generate fitted values for husbands for

whom no diary is available, and use nearest-neighbor matching on the fitted values to impute the missing

time spent on food for those husbands whose wives provided time diaries. Similarly, I used the fitted

values for wives to impute the missing food time for wives whose husbands’ time diaries are included in

the ATUS03.

IV. Income, Wages and the Production of Eating, 1985 and 2003

        A. Some Descriptive Statistics

        While the ultimate focus of this study is on the changing relationship between choices of

household production technique and household income and time prices, an initial examination of the raw

amounts of time and goods devoted to generating eating is itself inherently interesting. The final columns

of Table 1 show the means and their standard deviations of various components of time and goods spent

generating eating, and they break the time inputs down into those of the husband and wife. Of the 2880

minutes available to a couple in a day, the average couple spent 332 minutes, roughly 5-1/2 of its 48

available hours, in the activity eating in 1985, and 235 minutes, not quite 4 hours per day, in 2003.

        The time input of the median couple is less than the average time input—the distribution is

skewed rightward. In 1985 time spent actually eating meals comprised 47 percent of all time inputs into

generating eating, but it had grown to 58 percent of the total by 2003. Wives’ time accounted for 63

percent of the total time input into eating in 1985, but only 59 percent of time inputs in 2003. Since the

average spouse spends 70 to 80 minutes per day actually eating, with little difference between husbands

and wives, the information on husbands’ and wives’ time inputs shows that husbands spent only 32

percent as much time as wives on shopping/preparation/clean-up in 1985 and only 37 percent as much in



                                                     9
2003.

        An interesting question is why the total time inputs into eating appear to have declined by nearly

30 percent between 1985 and 2003. One explanation might simply be that the aggregation processes that

created the total eating time measures differ across the two surveys. This is possible, but the basic

categories (see Appendix Table 1) seem very similar. Another possibility is that the survey methods

differed and generated substantial differences in how activities are classified. This too is possible, but it

is hard to believe that something as basic as eating, food shopping, and cooking and cleaning up could be

classified so differently in the two sets of time diaries.

        Table 1 shows that the larger decline in time use in this commodity is among wives: Their time

input declined by 31 percent, husbands’ by only 20 percent. The Table also shows that by far the bigger

decline among wives was in the time they spent shopping/cooking/cleaning that is an input into the

production of eating. Food shopping and cleaning-up especially are the kinds of secondary activity (one

for which purchased inputs could be substituted—see Reid, 1934) that yield little utility and for which

technical change has caused market substitutes to decrease in relative price. With rising real incomes

households have become able to purchase market substitutes, which in turn have fallen in price because of

substantial technical improvements (e.g., microwaves, dishwashers, etc., that spread from upper-income

families across the population over this period). The substantial decline could simply reflect optimizing

behavior by households in the face of rising time prices of wives and households’ rising real incomes.

        Table 1 also presents the order statistics of time spent on eating. What is intriguing is the great

heterogeneity in the amount of time input into eating: Going from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the

distribution of time that couples spend generating eating involves nearly quadrupling the time input, from

2 hours 40 minutes per day to 9 hours 20 minutes per day for a couple in 1985, and from 1 hour 45

minutes per day to 6 hours 35 minutes per day in 2003. Whether this heterogeneity is related to the

economic determinants that affect inputs into eating is the major focus of this Section.

        The average food expenditure of $4,874 for these married couples in the CES85 constituted about

19 percent of their total expenditures, while that of married couples in the CES03 accounts for only 16



                                                       10
percent of total expenditures. Like that of time inputs into eating, the distributions of goods spending are

skewed to the right. The Table also breaks food expenditures down into spending on food consumed at

home and that on food consumed away from home. (These figures sum to less than the total expenditure

on goods inputs into eating because the total includes the other food-related purchases, mostly on capital

goods, as Appendix Table 1 shows.) Food consumed away from home constitutes about one-fourth of

total spending on food, and its distribution unsurprisingly exhibits much more inequality than that of food

consumed at home.

         Finally, Table 1 lists statistics (means and order statistics) describing total expenditures on all

goods and the share of food spending from the CES85 and CES03 data. Inequality in total expenditures

increased, with the coefficient of variation rising from 0.71 to 0.77 (a smaller increase in inequality of

consumption than the increased income inequality over the same period, thus mirroring the relation of

inequality of expenditures and incomes in the cross section shown by Dynarski et al, 1997). The

increased inequality in total expenditures was concentrated entirely above the median expenditure.

Indeed, while there were essentially no changes in total spending (relative to the median) at the lower

percentiles, the relative change was positive above the median, with the biggest relative increase

occurring at the 95th percentile.8

         B. Estimating the Determinants of Goods and Time Inputs

         The first step in estimating the demand functions is the creation of the instrumental variables for

household income and the prices of the spouses’ time. I use household net income, thus creating an

instrument for the actual amount of income at a household’s disposal. The results for instrumenting net

income are based on estimating regressions using the PSID86 and PSID03 data and are presented in

Columns (1) and (4) of Appendix Table 3. The estimates make very good sense in light of the vast

literature on income determination. Households’ net incomes rise with education, especially so for

husband’s education (since men’s age-earnings profiles rise more rapidly with education than women’s,

 This corresponds perfectly to the distribution of changes in inequality in the upper tail of the distribution of men’s
earnings. Data from the Outgoing Rotation Groups of the CPS show that between 1979 and 2003 the 90/50 ratio
rose by 25 log points, but the 95/50 ratio rose by 34 log points.


                                                          11
and because wives are less likely to participate in the labor force); they are quadratic in each spouse’s age

(again reflecting the shape of age-earnings profiles); and they are lower if young children are present,

presumably indicating the impact on wives’ labor-force participation.

        The equations underlying the creation of instruments for husbands’ and wives’ values of time are

the earnings equations whose estimates are shown in Columns (2), (3), (5) and (6) of Appendix Table 3.

The regressions reported in Columns (2) and (5) are simple log-earnings equations including indicators of

educational attainment, a quadratic in age and hours of work. Those for women also include an auxiliary

selectivity equation in which the probability of working is affected by the presence of pre-school and

young children, who are assumed not to affect earnings directly. The results, and the estimation itself, are

completely standard and merit no further comment.

        The results of the imputations in the TUS85, ATUS03 and CES85 and CES03 are presented in

Table 2. For each imputation I present various order statistics and the mean and standard deviation (just

as was done for the distributions of time and goods inputs in the two years in Table 1). Each imputation

was made using the coefficient estimates shown in Appendix Table 3 and each observation’s values of the

vector of variables Z1 and Z2. To standardize the wage rates and avoid endogeneity I assume that hours

of work equal 40 for all observations. (Any number could be chosen, so long as it is identical for all

sample members.)

        The distributions of imputed wage rates look fairly standard: Women’s average imputed hourly

wage rates are 64 percent of men’s in 1985 and 77 percent in 2003, reflecting the well-documented

increase in women’s relative wages and approximating fairly closely the actual increase that occurred

(Blau and Kahn, 2004).

        The coefficients of variation of imputed net incomes, husband’s wage rates and wife’s wage rates

were 0.28, 0.24 and 0.21 respectively in 1985; in 2003 they are 0.32, 0.33 and 0.25 respectively. All of

them have increased, with the greatest increase in inequality in husband’s imputed earnings. The 50/10

ratio of imputed husband’s hourly wage rates was 1.40 in 1985, but fell to 1.35 in 2003; the 90/50 ratio

rose from 1.42 to 1.50. Since Autor et al (2005) show that the biggest increase in inequality in men’s



                                                     12
actual earnings over this period was in the upper part of the distribution of earnings and that wage

inequality in the lower half of the distribution may even have narrowed, the changing inequality in the

distribution of imputed earnings accords with the facts and enhances our confidence in the instrumental-

variables approach used here.

        While the distributions of imputed earnings are skewed slightly to the right, the distributions of

net incomes are not skewed rightward. That there is relatively little skewness in all of the distributions of

the imputed variables is the result of the fact that the distributions of returns to the unobservable

determinants of wage rates and incomes, which we cannot account for, are more right-skewed than the

distributions of returns to their observable determinants. Finally, it is comforting to note that the shapes of

the distributions of imputed net income look quite similar across samples within years, as do the

distributions of imputed wage rates.

        Columns (1) and (4) in Table 3 show the results of estimating equations (2a’) and (2b’), the

demand functions for the inputs into the household production of eating. These relate time and goods

spending to a household’s position (percentile) in the distributions of imputed household net income and

the spouses’ imputed wage rates. While these are the central equations in the model, in the other columns

I present estimates of the determinants of some of their subcomponents, including husbands’ and wives’

time inputs separately, and goods expenditures on food consumed at home and away from home. All of

the equations include a vector of variables indicating the age distribution of children in the household.

The time-demand equations also include a vector of indicators for the day of the week for which the time

diary was kept.9 That the fractions of variance explained in these equations are not very high is the result

of our excluding idiosyncratic variation in incomes and time prices when we necessarily use imputations

for these for each household.

        The estimated parameters in equation (2a’), the demand for time inputs into eating, accord

completely with what we know about the relative time-intensity of the demand for eating. Higher prices

of husbands’ and wives’ time lead them to economize on their time used in producing this commodity,

 The estimates from the ATUS03 are weighted to account for the over-sampling of weekend days, so that the results
reflect a representative day.

                                                       13
although in the estimates for 2003 the coefficients are nowhere nearly significant statistically. Moreover,

we cannot reject the hypothesis that the impacts of equal-percentile increases in their time prices generate

the same impact on the total time input into eating in both years. Holding time prices constant, however,

a movement up the distribution of net incomes increases the time used in generating eating.

        In estimating the goods-demand equations I assume that the only economic determinant is the

household’s net income. The results suggest that the demand for food increases with (imputed) net

income, and that the demand for food eaten away from home is much more income elastic than that for

food consumed at home. The income elasticities of total goods expenditure into eating (calculated around

the medians) average about 0.40, quite similar to estimates for food spending in a now-hoary literature

(e.g., Houthakker and Taylor, 1966). The coefficients on income percentiles are smaller in 2003 than in

1985; given that the income distribution widened over this period, that change guarantees that the income

elasticity of demand for food-related goods fell during this period.

        One might be concerned that my measure of goods expenditures, which includes more than just

food, may be too broad. I re-estimated the equations in Columns (1) and (4) using narrower measures, the

logarithms of total food expenditures, in each year. The parameter estimates on the percentile of imputed

net income are 0.00590 (s.e. = 0.00017) for 1985, 0.00497 (s.e.=0.00014) for 2003. The estimates are

unsurprisingly smaller than those describing eating expenditures that include part of alcohol and

appliances, but they reproduce the qualitatively similar result that the goods expenditure elasticity is

lower in 2003 than in 1985.

        C. Inferring the Household Production Function

        One of the major purposes in estimating these demand equations is to examine how the relative

goods intensity of eating varies along the expansion path at a point in time. Figures 1a and 1b show how

the amounts of goods and time used in producing the commodity eating increase as we move up the

income distribution. Treating goods expenditures by the lowest-income household in the sample (at

nearly the 0th percentile of the distribution of imputed net income) as 100, the calculations simply take the

parameter estimates from Column (4) of Table 3 and move up the distribution of incomes by percentiles.



                                                     14
        The calculation of the indices of demand for time inputs into eating is more complex, as we need

to account for the relationship between income and wage rates, and for the possible correlation of

spouses’ wage rates. To do so I estimate regressions of I on WM, of I on WF and of WF on WM. (Since

these variables are percentiles and thus have the same means and standard deviations, the estimated

dI/dWM = dWM/dI, and similarly for the other two relationships.) We can thus calculate the effect of a

one-percentile increase in a household’s income as:

(4)       ’I[1 + dI/dWM + dI/dWM] + ’WM[1 + dWM/dI + dWM/dWM] +

                   ’WF[1 + dWM/dI + dWM/dWM] .

Again letting the index equal 100 at the 0th percentile of income, I apply the changes implicit in (4) as we

move up the distribution of income.

        Figure 1a shows that goods spending roughly doubled (increased 101 percent) over the range of

the distribution of (imputed) net incomes in 1985. Time expenditures barely increased as a household

moved up the distribution of imputed net income, rising 10 percent from the bottom to the top of the

distribution. Even though the three correlations that underlie the calculation in (4) are very high, a

general increase in income did increase time spent in producing eating.

        The results for 2003 shown in Figure 1b differ substantially from those in Figure 1a. By then the

increase in goods spending as one moved up the (less equal) distribution of net incomes was relatively

smaller, with an increase of only 72 percent. The gradient on time spent in eating was much steeper than

in 1985, however, so that a household at the top of the distribution of imputed income spent nearly 60

percent more time on eating than one at the bottom.10

        For both years the figures show that there are positive relationships between imputed net income

and time and goods used in generating eating. While these suggest numerous conclusions (see below),

they ignore the idiosyncratic relationship between time and goods that could exist across different

households. The ATUS03 provides a unique opportunity to examine this idiosyncratic variation, as some

10
  If we use the narrower measure, spending only on food, the gradient for 1985 shows an increase of 81 percent
from the lowest to the higher percentile of imputed net income, while that for 2003 shows an increase of 64 percent.
None of the conclusions in this Part is changed in any important way if we base them on the response of this
narrower concept of expenditures on eating.


                                                        15
of the respondents in that survey can be linked to the December 2002 CPS in which a Food Security

Supplement was included. That supplement included questions eliciting the amount the respondent’s

household spent on all food last week (the reference week), and the amount usually spent in a week. A

match between the ATUS03 and the December 2002 CPS was possible for 2511 of the 9324 respondents

used in the estimates presented in Table 3. The same measure of time devoted to eating was included;

and for each respondent I calculated annual household spending on food based on the reference-week and

usual weekly expenditures that were reported.

        Because the number of matched observations was much smaller than in the other estimates for

2003, I expanded the sample by performing the same match for married couples with both partners

between the ages of 18 and 64 using the 2004 American Time Use Survey and the December 2003 Food

Security Supplement to the CPS. All the variables are defined and calculated as in the match for 2003,

except that, absent a new round of the PSID, net income is imputed for the ATUS04 couples using the

same method that generated imputed incomes in the ATUS03.               This additional year of matched

respondents added another 1674 couples to this data set.

        Figures 2 present a view of the relationship between goods and time spending in these households

using these matched data. They show the results of fitting food expenditures, first for reference-week and

then for usual expenditures, to a quadratic in time use after trimming the tails of the distributions of the

time and goods variables. While the confidence bands at the extremes of couples’ time inputs are very

wide, the sample is very sparse there: For 90 percent of the households the logarithm of food time is

between 4.5 and 6, where the confidence bands are much narrower. The relationships implicit in these

figures corroborate the conclusions from the estimation and Figures 1: Those households in which the

couple spends more time in eating-related activities are also those in which more money is spent on food

(where in these data food no longer includes prorated amounts of spending on food-related appliances)..

        To separate out the idiosyncratic part of the relationship from the part due to variations in

observables (in imputed net income), in Table 4 I present estimates of equations describing the logarithms

of the expenditure measures (again for the trimmed samples).          Columns (1) and (4) of the Table



                                                    16
corroborate the results in Figures 2, as they show positive and nearly statistically significant relationships

between time spent and goods expenditures on food.            Columns (2) and (5) merely replicate the

unsurprising finding in Table 3 that expenditures on food increase with imputed net income. Columns (3)

and (6) show that, even accounting for differences in imputed net incomes, those couples that spend more

time in eating activities also spend more money on food. The idiosyncratic components of goods

spending and time use are positively related. Taken together, Figures 2 and Table 4 suggest that the

implied positive relationship between time and goods spending on eating is not an artifact of our

imputations that necessarily base the relationship only on observables.

        With data on the same households’ goods and time inputs into eating we can estimate a simple

formal household-production relationship to infer the ease of substitution between goods and time.

Assuming that the household production function for eating is CES, we can write the relative demand

function as:

(5)     ln(X/T) = Constant + ln( WM + [1- ]WF) ,

where    is the elasticity of substitution between goods and time, and       is the weight on the husband’s

price of time that is implicit in the household’s decisions about goods-time substitution. I estimate (5) by

nonlinear least squares and present the parameter estimates in Columns (4) and (8) of Table 4. We cannot

reject the hypothesis that    = .5—that the household weights both spouses’ prices of time equally in

choosing goods and time inputs. This is an anomalous result, although given that relatively little of the

time input into eating consisted of the wife’s food shopping/cooking/cleaning by 2003, it is less surprising

than it might appear at first glance. Most important, the elasticity of substitution is quite low and

consistently so whether one uses reported reference-week food expenditures or usual food expenditures.

Clearly, this direct evidence on household production suggests that for this particular commodity the

substitution of goods for time is not easy.

        In Table 5 I summarize the results underlying Figure 1. The top part of the table shows the real

goods (dollars per year) and time inputs (converted from minutes per day to hours per year to increase

comparability to the annual expenditure measures). It also presents the goods/time ratio at various



                                                     17
percentiles of the distribution of imputed net incomes for each year, and it lists the percentage changes in

this ratio over the eighteen-year period. To make the expenditure data comparable across years the

spending data for 1985 are converted by the PCE deflator for food to 2003 dollars.11 The bottom part of

the table lists the same information at the actual means and medians of net incomes, goods spending and

time use. These latter correspond fairly closely to the ratios and changes at the measures of central

tendency based on our calculations of imputed net income and wage rates.

        The statistics in Table 1 and the estimates presented in Figures 1 and 2 and in Tables 3 and 4

suggest the following central conclusions:

        1. In both 1985 and 2003 both goods expenditures and time inputs into eating rose with
             income.
        2. Between 1985 and 2003 total time spent in eating fell sharply while goods spending
             declined relative to all expenditures and stayed essentially constant in real terms.
        3. Consequently, over this period the relative goods intensity of eating rose at the mean
             and at all other points of the distribution of net incomes.
        4. The relative goods intensity of eating rose most sharply in the lower part of the
             distribution of net income, with the rate of increase declining steadily as one moves
             up the distribution.
        5. The direct evidence for 2003-04 implies that goods and time inputs into eating are
             positively correlated within households.
        6. The direct evidence also suggests that substitution between goods and time in
             producing eating is not easy.


        What does this combination of findings tell us about the nature of the household production

function for eating? What minimal reasonable set of inferences about the nature of that production

function is suggested by the results? The two sets of cross-section results match expectations: Those

households with higher full incomes produce this commodity more goods-intensively than those in which

the spouses’ time prices and full incomes are lower. While the results in Table 3 demonstrated that a

higher price of time (especially the wife’s time) leads to substitution against time used in producing


11
 Using the CPI Food and Beverages price index lowers the percentage increases in X/T, with the increase at the 5th
percentile of the distribution of imputed income becoming 47.9 percent and that at the 95th percentile becoming -8.3
percent.

                                                        18
eating, the positive income effects lead higher-income couples to devote more time to eating (in

combination with their greater goods purchases). This result suggests that it is relatively difficult for

people to substitute goods for time in the production of this commodity compared to the composite of all

other commodities, an inference that is corroborated by the direct estimates for 2003-04. Despite the

common use of the production of eating to illustrate goods-time substitution, it appears that by the early

21st century households had taken advantage of most of the opportunities for such substitution.

        The changes in the relative goods-intensity of production across the changing income distribution

are more difficult to reconcile. If, however, the household production function for eating is heterothetic,

and goods-time substitution becomes more difficult moving out along the expansion path, then we would

expect to observe the greater cut in time inputs into eating in lower-income households that we have in

fact seen between 1985 and 2003.          Implicitly the difficulty of substituting goods for time in the

production of the other, composite commodity does not increase as rapidly as production expands.

Higher-income families, which experienced the largest increases in income over this period, thus found it

increasingly difficult to expand the production of this commodity by increasing its goods intensity.

        One could also explain the results by technical change in the production of meals (preparation,

shopping and cleaning). Indeed, even the relative decline in time inputs at the lower end of the income

distribution might be explicable if one could demonstrate that there was more rapid time-saving technical

change in the sub-aggregates of those categories that are used particularly by lower-income households.

In the end, both biased technical change and heterothetic production without biased technical change are

consistent with the findings.12

        The results on goods used in producing eating suggest a weakening positive relation to net

incomes over this period.     Even though the distribution of income became less equal, the results show

very clearly that that the effect of a one-percentile increase in income diminished over the two decades.

Rising income inequality did not lead to rising inequality in food consumption. However, time inputs


12
  Taking an approach outside the theory of household production, one might also interpret the steeper food-time
income gradient as reflecting the conjunction of a positive income elasticity of demand for family time together
(spent eating) and the rise in income inequality. This consumption-based interpretation cannot, however, explain
why the goods-income gradient has become flatter and, indeed, seems inconsistent with it.

                                                      19
into eating became more positively correlated with net income over this period, so that changes in the use

of time added to the inequality in the amount of this commodity that was produced. It is thus unclear

whether inequality in production/consumption of the commodity “eating” increased or decreased, since

we can infer the general shape of the production function only for 2003-04 and cannot observe how it

may have changed over the two decade.

VI. Conclusions

        In this study I have examined the determinants of the household production function

characterizing eating, a commodity whose production involves using purchased food and some capital

goods in conjunction with time spent preparing the food, eating it and cleaning up afterwards. Particular

attention has been paid to ensuring that the economic variables that determine how different households

produce this commodity are truly exogenous—uncontaminated by the simultaneous determination of time

spent in producing the commodity and time spent in generating earnings. The results show a large

decrease over time in the time inputs into eating—a rise in its goods-intensity. Eating appears to be a

relatively goods-intensive commodity, one in which the substitution of goods for time as incomes and

time prices rise is relatively difficult and becomes even more difficult as more is produced.

        Taken together the results in Section IV offer some insights into likely changes in the demand for

goods used in producing the commodity eating as incomes and time prices rise—most important, in the

demand for food. In particular, if, as the findings indicate, goods-time substitution is difficult and

becomes increasingly difficult as production of the commodity expands, we should expect spending on

food to rise even more slowly than a simple consideration of the income elasticity of demand for

expenditures on food would suggest. If the growing inequality in incomes and time prices that we have

observed for the past three decades ceases and even begins to reverse, the cost of substituting services (of

lower-wage workers) for time (by higher-wage consumers) will rise, making it even harder to increase the

goods-time ratio and even less likely that spending on goods that are q-complementary with time in

producing eating will rise.      Taken together, these considerations suggest that Americans’ food

expenditures will rise more slowly than might be indicated by standard forecasts based solely on the



                                                     20
demand for goods.

        Beginning with Altonji (1986) economists have used spending on food, which is readily available

in household surveys that concentrate on measuring income, such as the PSID, as a proxy to identify

inter-temporal substitution in labor supply. While some difficulties with focusing on food spending

because of its income inelasticity have been pointed out (Attanasio and Weber, 1995), the approach here

shows that the problems go deeper. In particular, because the commodity eating apparently is full-income

inelastic, and because the household production function for eating exhibits less substitutability between

goods and time than is true for household production generally, goods expenditures on food are

systematically related nonlinearly to the prices of time. Using any measure of goods expenditures in this

context will induce biases unless it describes spending on goods that are used in the household production

of a representative commodity.

        I have implicitly treated the household in the context of a unitary model of decision-making.

That is undoubtedly a restrictive assumption, as evidence for goods expenditures and time use separately

suggests that their use is often better described by a collective model (Pollak, 2005). A profitable,

although far from trivial extension of this study would consider the joint demand for goods and time in

the context of a model of household production based on collective decision-making.

        The exercise conducted here could (and should) be done (with varying amounts of effort) for

other commodities that are produced at home to examine how their production has changed over time and

as distributions of earnings and income have changed. Indeed, one can envision a complete system of

demand and household production equations that defines commodities a priori, accounts for all goods

expenditures and all uses of (non-market) time and examines how each is affected by incomes and time

prices. With the development of a comprehensive and continuing time-use survey in the United States

(the ATUS) there is every reason to begin estimating household production technologies using

methodologies similar to those that have been used for so long in describing the production of goods.

*The estimating equations all include measures of the number of children under age 6, and between ages 6 and 17.
The samples are trimmed to remove 2.5 percent tails of eating time and eating expenditures. In Columns (1)-(3) and
(5)-(7) the dependent variable is the logarithm of food expenditures; in Columns (4) and (8) it is the logarithm of the
ratio of food expenditures to time spent on food.

*Standard errors in parentheses. The estimates describing net income are based on data from the PSID. The
estimates of male weekly earnings are least-squares coefficients from regressions using CPS-MORG data. Those
describing female weekly earnings are also based on CPS-MORG data and are from a selection model in which the
presence of children ages 0-5 and 6-17 identifies the labor-force participation decision.
