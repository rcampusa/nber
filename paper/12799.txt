                                                 ABSTRACT

This paper examines the relationship between the share of employment potentially affected by offshoring
and economic and structural factors, including trade in business services and foreign direct investment
(FDI), using simple descriptive regressions for a panel of OECD economies between 1996 and 2003.
It tests whether there are differences in the factors driving the shares of potentially offshorable "non-clerical"
and clerical occupations in total employment. The results show a positive statistical association between
the share of both "non-clerical" and clerical occupations potentially affected by offshoring and exports
of business services, and a negative association with imports of business services. However, the results
also show important differences between different types of occupations as they behave differently
over time, and are affected differently by variables included in the model. In particular, net outward
manufacturing FDI, ICT investment, and the relative size of the services sector all have a positive
association with the share of potentially offshorable "non-clerical" occupations, but are negative with
clerical occupations. Union density has a positive statistical association with clerical occupations but
negative with "non-clerical" occupations. These results have important implications for policy, as
they clearly suggest that different factors are driving the performance of different occupational groups.

1. Introduction

Services now account for around two-thirds of output and foreign direct investment in most developed
countries, and for up to 20-25% of total international trade. The importance of services in international
trade remains comparatively modest because many services have only recently become tradable, and many
others remain non-tradable. Many services are also delivered in a ways that would not be captured in the
trade flows measured in the Balance of Payments, for example through FDI or the temporary movement of
persons. Rapid advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the ongoing global
liberalisation of trade and investment in services have increased the tradability of many service activities
and created new kinds of tradable services. Many service sector activities are thus becoming increasingly
internationalised, especially since ICTs enable the production of services to be increasingly location
independent. This has led to the globalisation of services activities and facilitated the ICT-enabled
offshoring1 of services, with associated changes in trade and cross-border investment in service activities
and employment patterns.

This paper builds on earlier work that attempted to quantify the share of employment potentially affected
by the ICT-enabled offshoring of services (van Welsum and Vickery, 2005a, van Welsum and Reif,
2006a,b). At present there are no official data measuring the extent of offshoring of services, so it is
necessary to use indirect measures such as data on trade in services, employment data, input-output tables,
and trade in intermediates. Evidence from company surveys can also be a useful complement. This paper
combines the information from both trade and employment data to examine the relationship between the
share of employment potentially affected by offshoring and other economic and structural factors using
some simple descriptive regressions for a panel of OECD economies between 1996 and 2003. Initial
estimates of the statistical association between the share of employment potentially affected by service
sector offshoring, trade in business services and foreign direct investment are provided by van Welsum and
Reif (2006a,b). In this paper the model is extended to test whether there are differences in the factors
driving the shares of potentially offshorable clerical and non-clerical occupations in total employment.
Separate indicators for manufacturing and services foreign direct investment are now also included.

It is important to take care with the interpretation of the results though, as they are not drawn from the
empirical testing of a formal theoretical model of the underlying structural relationships. Thus, it is not
possible to separate out completely the effects from demand and supply side developments. However, the
results provide guidance on the statistical associations that are found to exist between the variables
included in these descriptive regressions.

The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows. A number of different measures of the extent to which
services activities have become globalised are discussed in Section 2. Section 3 then summarises the work
undertaken at the OECD to obtain estimates of potentially offshorable ICT-using occupations in a number
of OECD economies. The fourth section contains the new empirical analysis of the factors associated with
the evolution over time of the share of these potentially offshorable occupations in total employment.
Indicators of international trade and investment, national economic structure and economy-wide
framework factors are all found to be important influences.

  Under the definition of offshoring adopted in this paper, offshoring includes both international outsourcing (where
activities are contracted out to independent third parties abroad) and international insourcing (to foreign affiliates).
The cross-border aspect is the distinguishing feature of offshoring, i.e. whether services are sourced within the
domestic economy or abroad – not whether they are sourced from within the same company or from external
suppliers (outsourcing).

2. The globalisation of ICT-enabled services

Trade in ICT-enabled services

The extent of international trade in ICT-related services and business services can be approximated by
summing the IMF Balance of Payments categories “computer and information services” and “other
business services” (see Appendix Table 1 for details on which services are included in these categories).
Data on computer and information services are not available for all countries. For some, such as India, they
are included under “other business services”, along with other services.2 The “other business services”
category may have variable shares of IT and ICT-enabled services in different countries. We will refer to
this category as “business services” from hereon. The data are reported in current USD and can be affected
by currency movements.
Most exports of business and computer and information services still originate in OECD countries, close to
80%, although their share is slowly declining. The 20 countries that accounted for the largest value shares
in 2003, as well as some selected other economies, are shown in Figure 1. OECD countries had the top
seven shares of these services exports in 2003. Hong Kong, China, India, Singapore and Israel are the six
non-OECD countries in this Top 20. Nevertheless, some countries often mentioned as receiving offshored
services activities are experiencing rapid growth in exports (Figure 2), although most are starting from very
low levels. This reflects, in part, their economic development, but could also be an indication of their
confirmation as an “offshoring location”.




2.
 For India, the category “other business services” includes all services except travel, transport and government
services. However, Indian firms are now extensively exporting ICT-enabled services and business process services
and the remaining services included in the category are likely to be small in comparison. The data may also include
the earnings of Indian working abroad. There are some data quality concerns though, not only for India, but also for
China for example (OECD, 2006). Some large discrepancies have been observed in the exports data reported by
India, and the imports data from its main trading partners (OECD, 2004, GAO, 2005). Some of the problems with
data on trade in services can be explained by factors such as reporting difficulties, collection methods (company
surveys rather than customs records for goods), varying timelines of implementing Balance of Payments (BPM5)
methodology and rules, the treatment of certain services categories, and the complexity of the structures and
operations of multinational. These issues are being addressed.

1. The reported total for all countries does not necessarily correspond to a world total. For some countries, such as India, it is not
possible to isolate other business services and computer and information services. As a consequence, for India, the category includes
total services, minus travel, transport and government services (i.e. including construction, insurance and financial services as well as
other business services and computer and information services). The data are in current USD and may therefore be affected by
currency movements.

The increasing importance of trade in services, and of trade in business services and computer and
information services in particular, for most countries is also illustrated in Table 1 below. In most countries
the share of services trade in total trade increased between 1995 and 2003. Business services and computer
and information services also tend to account for a relatively large and increasing share of services trade.

Where: S in T = services trade in total trade, BCIS in T = business and computer and information services in total
trade, and BCIS in S = business and computer and information services in services trade. Services trade (S) also
includes royalties and licence fees. Some of the large shift in (S in T) for Ireland may be explained by changes in this
category which is thought to reflect tax minimisation strategies rather than real activity.

Trade in business and computer and information services accounts for a relatively modest, but increasing,
share of GDP in most countries (Table 2). The share tends to be somewhat larger in smaller countries than
in larger countries. There was a particularly large increase in the share in Ireland between 1995 and 2003,
reflecting Ireland’s rapid shift into service activities over that period (Barry and van Welsum, 2005).

The trade balance (in current USD) in the sum of business and computer and information services as a
percentage of GDP for selected countries in 1995 and 2003 is shown in Figure 3. The United States have a
relatively large and still increasing surplus in trade in these categories, although it is relatively small as a
percent of GDP. The United Kingdom also has a large and growing surplus, and the share in GDP is also
increasing, in spite of the impression that may be given by the many (media) reports on the extent of
offshoring and related imports. Ireland has a surplus looking at the category “computer and information
services”, but a deficit for the sum of the two ICT-enabled trade categories. More recently released data
show that Ireland moves into surplus in 2004. Of the countries shown in the graph, Denmark and the UK
have the largest surplus as a percent of GDP.

FDI in services

Another indicator of the extent of globalisation of services is given by the stock share of services in total
FDI (Table 3). In most countries, the share of services has increased between 1995 and 2003, and the stock
of services tends to account for more than half of the total stock, and up to 88% in Germany for inward
investment, and up to 82% in outward investment in France in 2003.

A further indicator of globalisation of services is given by the share of this type of FDI in GDP. In all
countries, both the total share of FDI (inward and outward) and the share of services FDI in GDP have
increased between 1995 and 2003 (Table 4).

However, most of this FDI in services is not in services that can necessarily be traded with the help of
ICTs. The sectors distinguished in the OECD FDI data base are listed in Appendix Table 2. It is difficult to
know which category would be most suitable to match the categories used as proxies for ICT-enabled trade
in services,3 but probably the best approximation would be given by “business activities”, which can be
obtained by subtracting “real estate” from “real estate and business activities”. Unfortunately, this
breakdown is not widely available (8 countries in the sample, and not necessarily for all years considered),
but “real estate” tends to account for a relatively small share of that category.

  "Real estate and business activities" represents section K of ISIC 3 (minus if available "of which real estate"), but
the connection is loose between service products and service activities determined for large enterprises. Business
services can be provided internally within multinationals with main activities elsewhere, e.g. in manufacturing.

3. Employment potentially affected by offshoring

To get an idea of the “outer limits” of employment potentially affected by offshoring, van Welsum and
Vickery (2005) calculate the share of people employed who are mainly performing the types of functions
that could potentially be carried out anywhere, using data on employment by occupation by industry. The
classifications were not harmonised internationally, but the same methodology and rationale were applied
to the individual country data sources.4 As this analysis was carried out in order to obtain an order of
magnitude on the share of people employed performing tasks that could potentially be carried out
anywhere, no additional assumptions were made as to what proportion of each occupational group was
actually likely to be affected by offshoring in practice. Thus, the whole of each selected occupation was
then included in the calculations.

Occupations were selected by examining detailed occupational and task descriptions on the basis of the
following four criteria, or “offshorability attributes”: (i) intensive use of ICTs, (ii) an output that can be
traded and transmitted in a way that is enabled by ICTs, e.g. via email or the Internet, (iii) high content of
codifiable knowledge, and (iv) no face-to-face contact requirements. The occupational selections that
resulted from this exercise are reported in the Appendix Tables 3 - 6. For further details on the
methodological background see van Welsum and Vickery (2005), and OECD (2004a). This analysis, using
occupational data for several OECD countries, suggests that around 20% of total employment carries out
the kinds of functions that are potentially geographically footloose as a result of rapid technological
advances in ICTs and the increased tradability of services, and could therefore potentially be affected by
international sourcing of IT and ICT-enabled services. Services sectors (such as computer and related
activities, financial services, insurance services, and R&D services) tend to have large shares of this type of
employment (see van Welsum and Vickery, 2005, for rankings of industrial sector by the she of
employment potentially affected by offshoring).

Other studies have taken a similar approach. Blinder (2005), and as quoted in Mankiw and Swagel, (2005),
finds a similar estimate of around 20% of total employment potentially affected by offshoring in the United
States in 2004. He uses the concept of “personally deliverable services” and “impersonally deliverable
services”. However, the estimates of employment potentially affected by offshoring vary widely. For
example, Bardhan and Kroll (2003) produced estimates of 11% of total employment in the United States in
2001 as potentially affected by offshoring, and Forrester Research, as reported by Kirkegaard (2004) up to
44% of total employment. The differences in these estimates can be explained by the selection criteria that
are applied to the occupational data. Thus, Bardhan and Kroll (2003) only included occupations in which at
least some offshoring was already known to have taken place or being planned, yielding a more
conservative estimate of the share of employment potentially affected, whereas the Forrester study used
less detailed occupational categories resulting in a larger estimate of jobs potentially affected. A different

  The European data are Labour Force Survey data provided by Eurostat. The occupational classification system in
those data is the ISCO – International Standard Classification of Occupations, and NACE – the industrial
classification system of the European Union – is used for sectoral classification. For the US, data from the Current
Population Survey were used. The Current Population Survey collects information on both the industry and the
occupation of the employed and unemployed. However, beginning with data from January 2003, the 1990 Census
Industrial Classification System was replaced by one based on the North American Industry Classification (NAICS),
and the 1990 Census Occupational Classification was replaced by one derived from the U.S. Standard Occupational
Classification (SOC). Further information is available on the Web site of the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics at:
http://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/pdf/homch1.pdf (accessed November 2004): Chapter 1: Labor Force Data derived
from the Current Population Survey. For Canada Labour Force Data provided by Statistics Canada were used. The
occupational classification is in SOC91. For Australia data from the Labour Force Survey provided by the Australian
Bureau of Statistics were used. The occupational classification is in Australian Standard Classification of Occupations
(ASCO) second edition.

but related approach was taken by Jensen and Kletzer (2005) looking at tradable versus non-tradable
occupations based on Gini coefficients. The list of tradable occupations they find for the United States
overlaps with the list in van Welsum and Vickery (2005a) and used in this paper, but the methodology of
Jensen and Kletzer (2005) identifies a larger set of tradable occupations. According to their methodology,
around 30% of employment in the United States can be considered as “tradable”. They find little evidence
of slower employment growth in tradable occupations (and activities).

The evolution over time of the share of employment potentially affected by offshoring is illustrated in
Figure 4 below. Even though the levels of these shares are not directly comparable, the evolution of the
trends is interesting. The share of occupations potentially affected by offshoring in the EU155 increased
from 17.1% in 1995 to 19.2% in 2003. For Canada it was more or less flat around 19.5% until 2001, after
which it declined to 18.6% by 2003. For the USA the share declined by more than a percentage point from
19.2% in 1995 to 18.1% in 2002.6 In Australia, the share increased between 1996 and 2001 (except in
1999) but started to decline in 2001.

While it is difficult to draw inferences from these trends without further analysis, since the trends are
affected by a multitude of factors, the evolutions shown are consistent with some casual observations on
the ICT-enabled offshoring that is taking place. For example, Canada serves as an offshoring location,
mainly from the USA, but may have become comparatively less important a location recently as other
countries such as India have started to emerge. Similarly, Australia possibly also experienced competition
for attracting, or keeping, activities that can be sourced internationally from India and other emerging
locations in the region. Thus, the declining share in the USA, Canada and Australia towards the end of the
period could be consistent with the offshoring of IT-related and back-office activities (with some “potential
offshoring” having become “actual offshoring”), for example, even though this is unlikely to account for
all of the decline. Another possible explanation could be a differential pace of technological change with a
relatively more rapid adoption and integration of new technologies, leading to relatively more jobs
disappearing sooner as they become automated and/or digitised.7 The increasing share for the EU15 is
compatible with an overall increase in services employment as well as the finding from surveys that
European firms tend to offshore within Europe (see Millar, 2002, and Marin, 2004, for example). The
upward trend is broadly similar across the individual countries that make up the EU15 (see van Welsum
and Reif, 2006b), but at different levels. At least one EU15 country, Ireland, is also a major destination
country of offshoring activities from the US (IT-related activities in particular). And between 2002 and
2005, more jobs were created as a result of activities offshored to Denmark than were eliminated because
of offshoring from Denmark to other countries (Jensen et al, 2006). Other factors, such as cyclical
developments and changes in labour supply and labour quality, could also be important..

  A parallel can be drawn here with some of the work undertaken by Autor et. al. (2003) and Levy and Murnane
(2004). These authors argue that the tasks most vulnerable to being substituted by technology are those where
information processing can be described in rules. If a significant part of a task can be described by rules, this
increases the likelihood of the task being offshored, since the task can then be assigned to offshore producers with
less risk and greater ease of supervision.

The offshoring phenomenon does not necessarily have to result in a decline in services employment,
though.8 Many existing services sectors have expanded, new services have emerged, and with ongoing
technological developments and services trade liberalisation it is likely yet more are to be created.
Furthermore, with the income elasticity of demand of internationally traded services greater than one (e.g.
Pain and van Welsum, 2004; van Welsum, 2004; Mann, 2004), rapid growth in countries such as India and
China should also lead to reinforced exports from OECD countries. The offshoring phenomenon itself will
also create new jobs in the domestic economy. However, it is likely that certain types of occupations will
experience slower growth than they otherwise might have done.

As the trends in Figure 4 are expressed as shares, there are several possibilities to explain changes in these
trends. For example, a decline in the share could be explained by an absolute decline in the number of
people employed in the categories identified as potentially affected by offshoring. Alternatively, it could be
that this selection of occupations is grower at a slower pace than total employment. The relatively slower
growth of employment potentially affected by offshoring is in fact what explains most of the declines
observed in the trends, except for the US where the absolute number of people employed in the categories
identified as potentially affected by offshoring has declined (see Box 1 in the Appendix). These
observations would therefore tend to support the idea that offshoring may lead to slower growth of
employment in occupations potentially affected by offshoring and not necessarily to actual declines in
employment.



8
  The cost savings from offshoring will raise the real income of consumers (who will pay lower prices) and of
business owners in countries that import the relatively cheaper offshored services; this higher income will result in
some extra demand. External demand is also likely to increase as income in countries providing the offshored services
increases. These sources of growing demand will create new jobs that will help to offset the jobs originally offshored.

                                                                 10
Disaggregating employment potentially affected by offshoring


As offshoring and technology may have a different effect on workers with different types of skills (e.g.
Autor et al, 2003), the share of employment potentially affected by offshoring is broken down into two
sub-categories: clerical and non-clerical occupations potentially affected by offshoring (Figures 5 and 6).
This is important as the clerical group includes the types of jobs that can be substituted for by ICTs
(through the digitisation and/or automation of certain tasks and types of codifiable knowledge) so a
differential pace of adoption and integration of technology can have a different effect across countries.

Looking at the share for each country at the beginning and end of the respective available data periods, it
can be seen that for the US and Australia, and Canada to a lesser extent, there is an obvious decline in the
share of potentially offshorable employment. This is consistent both with the destruction of these types of
jobs as a result of technological advances and with the offshoring of back-office activities. For the EU15
countries the evidence is more mixed. In some countries a decline in the share can be observed (Austria,
Belgium, Germany, Finland, France, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal), but in other countries there is an
increase (Denmark, Spain, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg Sweden and the United Kingdom). It is likely that
there are different explanations underlying these evolutions, for example the varying importance of the size
of the public sector and the services sector in the economy, and the differential pace of technology
adoption and integration. However, it also means that while there are many reports about clerical type
occupations being offshored, in some countries at least more still are being created at home. For example,
in the UK employment growth in IT and call centre occupations potentially affected by offshoring over the
period 2001-2005 was 8.8% compared to 3.2% for total employment, in spite of many media reports of
these kinds of jobs being offshored. Nevertheless, Computer Weekly (February 2006 issue) reports that the
effects of offshoring are now being felt in the IT job market in the UK with more and more IT employers
offshoring and outsourcing basic development and programming work.

Even though technology may account for at least some of the relative decline in the occupations potentially
affected by offshoring, the possibility that some of these jobs have already been offshored cannot be ruled
out. For example, Baily and Lawrence (2005) argue that at least some of the declines in low-wage ICT-
enabled occupations in the US, a concept close but not equivalent to the group of clerical workers
identified above, took place as a result of activities being shifted overseas. Looking at IT specialist
occupations, they also find that the net loss of computer programmers in the US was most likely the result
of offshoring. Nevertheless, even the largest projections of jobs to be offshored, as often reported in the
media, are in fact relatively small compared to annual job churning in OECD labour markets.

Appendix tables 3-6 illustrate the occupations which have been included as “potentially affected by
offshoring”, and which of those are considered as “clerical” occupations. The following two graphs
illustrate the evolution over time of the share of these clerical occupations and non-clerical occupations in
total employment.

4. Empirical analysis

The empirical work in this paper extends and refines the models estimated by van Welsum and Reif
(2006a,b), in an attempt to identify the key factors associated with the share of economy-wide employment
that is potentially offshorable in the US, Canada, Australia and nine European Union member states9 over
the period 1996-2003.

In the empirical model the share of employment that is potentially offshorable is related to a set of factors
controlling for international openness, the national economic structure, and economy wide framework
influences. The controls for openness include indicators of exports and imports of business services and a
number of different measures of foreign direct investment (FDI) stocks. The controls for economic
structures are the shares of services and high-tech industries in GDP, and the share of ICT investments in

9
  The EU15 countries excluding Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal. The choice of countries
is determined by the availability of the necessary data.

                                                                 13
total gross fixed capital formation. Finally, economy-wide framework factors are controlled for by the
inclusion of the OECD product market regulation indicator, trade union density and an indicator of human
capital. Each of these series is described in greater detail below.10 The choice of variables is motivated by
findings from a vast background literature, including studies of the factors determining the overall share of
the service sector in the economy, studies of services sector employment, and studies of the effect of trade
and technology on employment. See van Welsum and Reif (2006b) for details.

The empirical work in this paper extends and improves the model used by van Welsum and Reif (2006a,b)
in two ways. First, the dependent variable is disaggregated into potentially offshorable clerical and non-
clerical occupations (see Figures 5 and 6 above), permitting a test of whether there are common influences
on both. Secondly, there is an improved treatment of the FDI data used in the regression analysis. In the
earlier papers use was made of only the aggregate stocks of inward and outward FDI. In this paper more
disaggregated data are used for FDI, allowing tests to be undertaken of whether FDI in manufacturing has
similar effects to FDI in market services.

Ideally, it would be appropriate to begin with a simple structural model of the factors affecting the relative
demand for all potentially offshorable ICT-using occupations. Using the first order marginal productivity
conditions from a (unknown) production function with two types of labour (ICT and non-ICT using
labour), such a model might be expected to include measures of the relative output and relative wages of
ICT-using occupations. Control variables might also be included to pick-up possible differences in the
extent of (labour-augmenting) technical progress in the two broad types of occupations. As in the literature
on the demand for skilled and unskilled labour, possible controls are indicators for both trade and
technology.

Unfortunately, while it is possible to control for output and technology effects directly, data on
occupational wages are not readily available in most countries at the level of detail required. Their effect
can be captured only indirectly by including a number of variables that can be expected to have an
influence on real wages. It should be noted that although it is not possible to estimate a full structural
model, the estimates we show are not a pure reduced form model either, since potentially endogenous
current dated terms in output and/or trade and technology remain in the model.

Description of the data

Trade effects are approximated by including both imports and exports of other business and computer and
information services as a share of GDP.11 The idea of trade related displacement would suggests that
imports may have a negative association with the share of potentially offshorable occupations (“exporting
jobs”), while exports should have a positive relationship (increase in demand). The FDI measures used in
this paper are the net outward stock of FDI in manufacturing and in services as a share of national GDP.12
The predictions from the literature are ambiguous about the overall direction of the relationship between

10
   Even though GDP per capita was found to be associated with the share of services sector employment (Messina,
2004) it is not included in the regressions in this paper. In a time series context it does not make sense to include the
level of GDP per capital in a regression of an ultimately bounded variable. The first difference of GDP per capital was
tested at an early stage of the empirical analysis, but was found to be insignificant and is thus dropped from the model
reported in this paper. This is not necessarily surprising as the countries in sample all have relatively high levels of
GDP per capita. Nevertheless, with the exception of Austria, the countries with a relatively low share of potentially
offshorable employment are also those with a comparatively lower level of GDP per capita. Time dummies pick up
common cyclical effects
11
   The trade data are from IMF Balance of Payments statistics and GDP is taken from the OECD ANA database.
12
   The foreign direct investment data are taken from the OECD Direct Investment Statistics Database. For Denmark
and Sweden it was necessary to interpolate missing stock data using the available information on the composition of
investment flows.

FDI and the share of employment potentially affected by offshoring, and it is quite possible that the effects
may vary according to the characteristics of particular types of potentially offshorable employment and the
sectors in which FDI takes place, just as the relationship between trade and FDI depends on the level of
aggregation (Pain and van Welsum, 2004; van Welsum, 2004).
The share of services sector13 value added in total value added and the share of high-tech industries14 value
added in total value added are included as indicators of the industrial structure of the economy.15 Other
things being equal, the larger the share of the services sector in the economy, the larger the aggregate
demand for ICT-using occupations can be expected to be. The share of ICT investment16 in total national
gross fixed capital formation is also included in order to approximate technology adoption and integration.
The ICT investment data are from an unpublished OECD database based on national account sources.
It is possible that the intensity of product market competition may influence the speed at which new
technologies are adopted and the subsequent use made of them to adjust employment and labour tasks. An
OECD indicator of anti-competitive product market regulations is thus included as a control in the
regressions. This measure is an average of separate indicators of regulation in selected non-manufacturing
industries.17 A lower value of the aggregate indicator suggests that regulations are less restrictive and that
there is a higher degree of competitive pressures in the economy. Other things being equal, there should be
a negative relationship between this variable and the share of potentially offshorable employment. Messina
(2004) includes a measure of entry-barriers to the creation of new firms in the economy as an indicator of
product market regulations and finds a significant and negative effect on the share of services sector
employment.
Two additional economy-wide structural variables are included to capture institutional and supply-side
influences on (unobserved) real wages – union density and human capital. Trade union density indicators
may of course provide information about the degree of flexibility in national labour markets, as well as the
relative strength of workers in wage bargaining.18 A number of existing papers suggest that union density
rates are related to the growth of service sector occupations. For example, Messina (2004) finds that a fall
in union density rates is associated with an increase in services sector employment.19 Similarly, Nickell et
al (2004) find evidence that countries with higher levels of employment protection were slower in
reallocating resources from declining sectors (agriculture, manufacturing, and other production) into the
services sector, possibly because stronger employment protection makes labour shedding in declining

   The data on trade union density rates come from OECD Labour Force Statistics Indicators and OECD 2004c
(Table 3.3). Factors other than union density rates, including union coverage and hiring and firing restrictions, may
also be important but are not included here.
19
   The interpretation of this result is that lower union density rates facilitate the reallocation of labour between sectors.
An alternative explanation is that union density rates are simply lower in the service sector.

sectors more costly. The analysis in the present paper does not consider employment at the sectoral level,
but an analogy can be drawn as labour market inflexibilities are likely to affect occupational shifts as well
as sectoral changes. The a priori effect of this variable is ambiguous though, as it can both prevent a
reallocation of resources into ICT-intensive using occupations, and hinder the speed at which existing ICT-
intensive using jobs can be transferred abroad. In the latter case, the share of potentially offshorable
occupations in total employment will be at a higher level than it would otherwise have been.
Human capital is approximated by the average years of education per person in the population of working
age20 (de la Fuente and Doménech, 2002a,b, and OECD, 2003). It is expected that this variable should be
positively related to the share of potentially offshorable occupations, since higher levels of human capital
are positively correlated with the supply of ICT-literate people in the workforce. Such increases in supply
should help to restrain the growth of real wages of workers in ICT occupations and hence support demand.
Nickell et al (2004) find a strong positive effect of increases in educational attainment on the output share
of the “other services” sector in the economy in Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Netherlands,
Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.21

where the dependent variable is the share of potentially offshorable employment of type j in total
employment in country i, X and M are exports and imports of business and computer information services,
NETMFDI and NETSFDI are the net outward stocks of manufacturing and services FDI, ICTRAT is the
share of ICT investments in total investment, SERVICES and HITECH are the share of service sector
output and hi-tech sector output in GDP, PMR is the product market regulation indicator, UNIONS denotes
union density and HK denotes human capital. All the GDP share variables use data at current prices. The
reported regressions also include country-specific fixed effects, capturing otherwise unobserved factors
specific to each country that do not vary over time, and annual time dummies, capturing otherwise
unobserved effects that are common to all countries in each year.

This model is estimated using three different measures of the dependent variable – total potentially
offshorable employment, potentially offshorable clerical employment and potentially offshorable non-
clerical employment. The equations for the two sub-categories are estimated jointly to improve the
efficiency of the estimates by allowing for potential correlations in the respective equation variances. Joint
estimation also allows tests to be undertaken for common parameters in both equations.

As the two sub-categories sum to total potentially offshorable employment, and the same explanatory
factors are used in all three equations, the coefficients in the jointly-estimated clerical and non-clerical
equations will sum to those in the equation for the aggregate measure. The main advantage of estimating
the equations for the individual categories is thus to establish whether different factors affect the different

   But in the sector “business services” they found a greater role for changes in relative prices.

types of occupations. It does not provide an alternative picture of the factors driving the evolution of total
potentially offshorable employment.


Results

The results from using fixed effects, simultaneous equation and instrumental variables estimation
techniques are shown in Table 6. Estimation for the basic fixed effect single and multivariate regression
models is for a sample of 12 countries over 1996-2003. The multivariate instrumental variables estimates
(by 3SLS) are for the same countries, but over 1997-2003.

An initial set of results using total potentially offshorable employment as the dependent variable is shown
in column [1]. The results from simultaneous estimation of equations for the clerical and non-clerical
components are reported in column [2]. Although a joint test for common parameters in both equations is
strongly rejected [p-value = 0.00], the imposition of common parameters on four explanatory factors –
product market regulation, imports of business and computer services, human capital and the share of hi-
tech industries in GDP cannot be rejected [p-value=0.42]. The results from imposing these restrictions and
discarding one highly insignificant variable are shown in column [3].

The final column of Table 6 shows the results obtained from estimating the simultaneous equation model
in [3] by three-stage least squares (3SLS). This combines an instrumental variable approach to produce
consistent estimates and generalised least squares to account for the correlation structure in the
disturbances across equations. A year is dropped from the estimation period to allow higher order lagged
variables to be used as instruments. All current dated terms, with the exception of the product market
regulation indicator, are instrumented in column [4], as is the lagged ICT investment ratio, to allow for the
possibility that it is acting as a proxy lagged dependent variable. The 3SLS model results have a similar
pattern to those from the simultaneous equation models, though there are some differences in the
magnitude and significance of the coefficients.

The following subsections discuss the estimation results for the international openness variables, the
economic structure variables and the economy-wide framework variables in turn.

International Openness

International trade and the FDI measures are both found to be significant. In contrast to earlier findings, the
coefficient on imports of business and computer and information services is negatively signed, implying
that increasing imports are associated with a reduction in the share of potentially offshorable occupations at
the aggregate level, with similar sized effects on both types of potentially offshorable employment. Exports
of business and computer information services are found to have a positive and significant association with
the share of employment potentially affected by offshoring – as expected. The impact on potentially
offshorable non-clerical employment is significantly larger than that for potentially offshorable clerical
employment, as can be seen from the results in columns [2] to [4]. Although the trade variables may be
endogenous, especially if companies’ decisions about international sourcing and employment are made
simultaneously, the basic findings remain even in the 3SLS estimates in which the trade variables are
treated as endogenous.

The results for the two net outward FDI measures vary across the different occupational categories and the
different econometric techniques. In the single equation for total potentially offshorable employment
(column [1]) only the net services FDI variable is significant, with a higher net outward stock of services
FDI being positively associated with the share of potentially offshorable employment. The simultaneous
equation estimates show that this effect largely arises from a positive association with potentially


                                                      17
offshorable non-clerical occupations. The impact on clerical occupations is significant only in the 3SLS
estimates, and even then the coefficient is significant only at the 10% level. This result is consistent with a
scenario where skill intensive headquarter services (e.g. management, R&D, marketing, design) continue
to be provided from the home country, at least initially, while there is a reduced need for administrative
support functions when relatively more of the activity is located abroad.

The net outward manufacturing FDI stock does not have a significant overall impact on the aggregate share
of potentially offshorable employment. The simultaneous equation estimates show that this arises because
there are offsetting effects on clerical and non-clerical occupations. In particular, an increase in the net
outward manufacturing FDI stock is associated with a decline in the employment share of potentially
offshorable clerical occupations. In contrast, such a change in the manufacturing FDI stock is associated
with an increase in the employment share of potentially offshorable non-clerical occupations. This latter
effect is significant in the simultaneous equation estimates in [2] and [3], but not in the 3SLS estimates.
The same type of scenario of a relative increase in the need for highly skilled headquarter services
combined with a reduced need for clerical type occupations could again explain this result, with the
negative effect on the latter stronger in this case.

A common element of the findings for both FDI variables is that they are associated with a rise in the share
of non-clerical occupations relative to the share of clerical occupations. This is consistent with other
studies that have found that outward FDI is positively associated with a rise in the relative demand for
skilled labour in the home economy (see, for example, Head and Ries (2002)).

There are many different factors that might be reflected in the coefficients on the FDI variables. It is also
the case that FDI data can, at times, be a poor measure of the actual scale of activities that multinational
companies undertake. However, as shown in van Welsum and Reif (2006a,b), the inclusion of FDI
variables does not significantly bias the coefficients on the other explanatory factors.

Economic Structure

The share of ICT investment in gross fixed capital formation, the share of services in GDP and the share of
high-tech industries in GDP are all significantly positively associated with the share of employment
potentially affected by offshoring (column [1]), as might be expected. However, there are noticeable
differences in their effects on clerical and non-clerical ICT-using occupations.

The ICT investment term has a significant positive association only with non-clerical occupations – as
shown in [2] the coefficient on this term in the clerical occupations terms is not significant and is thus
discarded in [3] and [4]. This means the share of non-clerical to clerical is rising. However, there is no sign
that, overall, ICTs are having a destructive effect on ICT-using clerical occupations.

The service sector share has a significant positive association with non-clerical occupations, but a small
negative association with ICT-using clerical occupations. The latter effect is statistically significant in the
simultaneous equation models shown in columns [2] and [3], but not in the 3SLS estimates. The initial
estimates also suggest that the share of high-tech output in GDP matters mainly for the non-clerical
employment share (see [2]), but it is not possible to reject the imposition of a common coefficient in the
clerical and non-clerical employment equations, with the resulting estimate being statistically significant,
as shown in [3].

Economy-wide Framework Factors

A reduced level of anti-competitive product market regulations and a higher level of human capital are
both found to be positively associated with the aggregate share of potentially offshorable occupations in
total employment .Both of these factors encourage the adoption and usage of ICT technologies. Subsequent

                                                      18
tests indicated that both also have similar effects on the two types of ICT-using occupations, with common
coefficients being imposed on these terms in the estimates shown in column [3] and column [4].

Union density is not found to be significantly related to the aggregate share of potentially offshorable
occupations in total employment. However, it does appear to affect the composition of this share, having a
negative association with the share of non-clerical occupations and a positive association with the share of
clerical occupations, although the latter effect is not significant in the 3SLS estimates. These results
suggest that higher levels of union density act to slow the general adjustment that is taking place from
clerical to non-clerical occupations in all the economies included in the sample used in this paper.

Finally, the impact of a one standard deviation change in the statistically significant explanatory factors on
the non-clerical and clerical employment shares is illustrated in Table 7 using the coefficient estimates
from the results reported in model [3] in Table 6.22 It is important to note that such changes are only partial
effects, with all other factors being held constant. Use of standard deviation changes enables the effects of
changes in different factors to be more easily compared. The standard deviations are the average of the
individual within-sample standard deviations for each of the 12 countries.23




22
   The findings when using model [4] in Table 1 are generally similar, but the effects of changes in the explanatory
factors are usually a little larger.
23
   The use of average within-country sample standard deviations is necessary because of the scale of differences in
some factors across countries and the feasible extent to which some policies may be changed. Calculations with the
cross-country standard deviation, whether evaluated using the full sample of observations or a cross-section at a
particular point in time, can also be especially problematic when using indicator variables whose upper or lower limit
is bounded.

Conclusion

This paper extends and improves previous models (van Welsum and Reif, 2006a,b) by distinguishing
between different types of employment potentially affected by offshoring and by disaggregating the FDI
variable into manufacturing and services sectors. The results suggest it is important to make these
distinctions. Contrary to the results in previous work, we now find a negative association between the share
of imports of business and computer and information services in GDP. The effects of four of the
explanatory variables (net outward manufacturing, ICT investment, the comparative size of the services
sector, and trade union density) also vary according to the type of potentially offshorable employment.

The analysis suggests that the share of exports of business services in GDP, the share of ICT investment in
total investment, the share of the service sector in GDP and improvements in human capital have all been
especially important factors behind the general upward tendency in the share of employment in potentially
offshorable non-clerical occupations. The remaining variables considered also help to raise the
employment share, with the exception of the share of imports of business services in GDP.

The exports to GDP ratio and human capital also help to raise the share of employment in potentially
offshorable clerical occupations, as does the share of hi-tech output in GDP and reductions in product
market regulations. However, these factors have been offset by rising imports of business services, the
decline in trade union densities and the rising share of services in GDP.

Overall, the principal findings appear to be robust to changes in estimation techniques and specifications of
the model. Indicators of international trade and investment, the structure of national economies and
economy-wide framework factors are all important for understanding the cross-country pattern of the share


                                                                21
of potentially offshorable occupations in total employment. Although the development of corresponding
data sources for the relative wages of the various types of occupations would help to separate out demand
and supply-side influences more clearly, the results from the descriptive regressions in this paper provide
useful guidance for both policy development and for further work in this area.

Further work in this area could follow a number of paths to improve understanding of the effects of
international sourcing. A major area would be to strive to improve the occupational selections, for example
by co-ordinating with work undertaken in the United States (e.g. Blinder, 2005, and Jensen and Kletzer,
2005). Controlling for differences in ICT-content of occupations, over time and across countries, would be
another extension. Further separating out the effects of technology on occupations from those of offshoring
should also be explored. Finally, the impact of variables such as the size of the public sector and the
importance of SMEs in the economy should also be examined.

International harmonisation of the definition of offshoring and the data classifications, as well as data
collection itself, would greatly enhance the scope for the formulation of consistent and sound policy
recommendations and would enhance the scope for comparison of the various studies on the effects of
offshoring.

    •    45 out of the 67 occupations included in the US selection experienced an absolute decline
         between 2001 and 2002, as did the overall selection of occupations potentially affected by
         offshoring and total employment.

    •    The overall selection of occupations potentially affected by offshoring experienced 3 absolute
         declines between 1995-2002; to compare the individual occupations against the overall selection,
