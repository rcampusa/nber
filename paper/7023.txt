       This paper investigates forecasts of U.S. inflation at the 12-month horizon. The starting point
is the conventional unemployment rate Phillips curve, which is examined in a simulated out of
sample forecasting framework. Inflation forecasts produced by the Phillips curve generally have
been more accurate than forecasts based on other macroeconomic variables, including interest rates,
money and commodity prices. These forecasts can however be improved upon using a generalized
Phillips curve based on measures of real aggregate activity other than unemployment, especially a
new index of aggregate activity based on 61 real economic indicators.

                                    1. Introduction


   The Phillips curve has played a prominent role in empirical macroeconomics in the U.S.

over the past four decades. As a tool for forecasting inflation, it is widely regarded as stable,

reliable, and accurate, at least compared to the alternatives; Alan Blinder, when Vice Chair of
the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, called it the "clean little secret" of

empirical macroeconomics.

   This paper reassesses the use of the Phillips curve for forecasting price inflation. We focus

on three questions. First, has the U.S. Phillips curve been stable? If not, what are the
implications of the instability for forecasting future inflation? Second, the Phillips curve is

conventionally specified in terms of unemployment, but at a conceptual level other measures of
economic activity could be used instead. Do these alternative Phillips curves provide better

forecasts of inflation than the unemployment rate Phillips curve? Third, these variables are, of

course, a small subset of the many macroeconomic variables that are potentially useful for

forecasting inflation. For example, monetary theories of inflation and the theory of the term
structure of interst rates suggest alternative frameworks for forecasting inflation. How do

inflation forecasts from the Phillips curve stack up against time series forecasts made using

interest rates, money, and other series? Put baldly, is it time for inflation forecasters to move

beyond the Phillips curve?

   The focus of this paper is on forecasting price inflation using monthly data for the U.S.
from 1959:1 to 1997:9. Attention is restricted to forecasts of inflation over a twelve-month

horizon. All forecasting comparisons are performed using a simulated out-of-sample
methodology, that is, all models are estimated with data that is dated prior to forecast period.

This empirical analysis suggests some answers to these questions.



                                        —1—
   First, we find that there is statistical evidence that the parameters of the Phillips curve, as

conventionally specified, have changed over this period. The major source of instability seems
to be changes in the contribution of lags of inflation in the Phillips curve. While this instability

is statistically significant, it appears to be quantitatively small.1

   Second, Phillips curves specified with alternative measures of real economic activity can
provide forecasts with smaller mean squared errors than those from unemployment-based

Phillips curves. For example, Phillips curves that use housing starts, capacity utilization or the
rate of growth of manufacturing and trades sales produce forecasts that are generally more

accurate than forecasts constructed from Phillips curves using the unemployment rate.

   Third, it is possible to improve upon traditional Phillips curve forecasts by using alternative
economic indicators to forecast inflation. The investigation here casts a wide net: we consider
forecasts of inflation based on 189 additional economic indicators. Several conclusions emerge.

Although there are theoretical reasons to expect interest rates and interest rate spreads to be

useful for predicting inflation, forecasts based on these variables fail to improve on Phillips

curve forecasts, at least at the one year horizon. The evidence on nominal money is less clear
cut: models that add indexes of the money supply to the Phillips curve provide marginal

improvements for some sample periods and some measures of inflation, but they lead to a
serious deterioration in accuracy for forecasts of inflation based on the consumer price index

during the 1970's and early 1980's. Commodity prices do not improve inflation forecasts at the
12-month horizon. The only variables that consistently improve upon Phillips curve forecasts
are measures of aggregate activity, and the best of these is a new index of 61 indicators of

aggregate activity. These alternative forecasts, when combined with Phillips curve forecasts,

produce forecasting gains that are both statistically and economically significant.
   These results lead us to conclude that the unemployment rate Phillips curve can play a

useful role in forecasting inflation, but that relying on it to the exclusion of other forecasts is a


                                         -2-
mistake. Forecasting relations based on other measures of aggregate activity can perform as
well or better than those based on unemployment, and combining these forecasts produces still

further improvements.

   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we examine the stability

of standard specifications of the Phillips curve. In section 3, Phillips curves based on
alternative measures of aggregate activity are considered. In section 4, forecasts of inflation

from the Phillips curve are compared with forecasts based on our full set of 189 economic
indicators. Section 5 considers multivariate forecasts of inflation that use all 189 indicators.
The results in sections 2-5 maintain the conventional assumption that inflation is integrated of

order 1 (is 1(1)), and the robustness of our results to this assumption is investigated in section 6.
Section 7 concludes.




                    2. Stability of the U.S. Phillips Curve, 1959-1997


   Conventional specifications of the Phillips curve relate the change of inflation to past values

of the unemployment gap (the difference between the unemployment rate and the NAIRU), past
changes of inflation, and current and/or past values of variables that control for various supply
shocks.2 Because we are interested forecasting, we adopt this framework with two

modifications: the dependent variable is the change in the inflation rate over periods longer than

the sampling frequency, and supply shocks measures are not included in the equation. The first
modification allows us to use the estimated equation directly for multiperiod (12-month-ahead)

forecasting. Supply shock measures are omitted because preliminary results (not reported here)
indicated that the forecasting performance of models that included these variables (the relative

price of food and energy and the Nixon price control variable as in Gordon (1982, 1997)) is


                                        -3-
worse, on a simulated out of sample basis, than the corresponding models in which these

variables are excluded. This is not surprising: although the supply shock variables are

statistically significant in full-sample specifications with unemployment, in a simulated out of

sample setting their coefficients are poorly estimated for much of the sample and this produces

poor out of sample forecasts. This is consistent with these supply shock measures being

identified as useful in unemployment-based Phillips curves based on ex-post analysis.

   The Phillips curve specification used in this paper is,



(1)      t+ht = + 13(L)ut +                       + et+h


where      =
               (1200/h)ln(PtIPth) is the h-period inflation in the price level P, reported at an
annual rate;          =l2OO*ln(Pt/Pt1) is monthly inflation at an annual rate; u is the

unemployment rate; and j3(L) and 'y(L) are polynomials in the lag operator L.
   This specfication imposes two important restrictions. The first is that inflation is integrated

of order one (is 1(1)). The specification (1) is equivalent to a specification with +h as the
left hand variable and replacing y(L)iirt with, say, ,.L(L)lrt, subject to the restriction that L(1) =1.

Thus, for h= 12, this specification can be thought of as predicting inflation over the next twelve

months using a distributed lag of current and past inflation, subject to the restiction that the

distributed lag coefficients sum to one. Modeling U.S. price inflation as 1(1) is standard in this
literature, and as we discuss below, is consistent with recursive unit-root tests of various

inflation series over most of the sample period. The robusmess of the main substantive results
to relaxing the unit root assumption is examined in the penultimate section of this paper.

   The second restriction imposed in (1) is that the NAIRU is constant. To see this, note that
the Phillips curve is conventionally written as




                                         -4-
(2)       t+ht = 13(L)(ut-iit) +                + et+h


where u is the NAIRU. When Ut is time invariant so that                then (2) can be written as

(1) with the constant term 4=-/3(1)u. There is a large recent literature on the constancy of the

NAIRU, and the constancy of the Phillips curve more generally (see Gordon (1997a, 1998),

King and Watson (1994), Shimer (1998), Staiger, Stock and Watson (1997a, 1997b), Stock
(1998)). This research documents instability in the coefficients of specifications like (1) using

postwar data for the U.S. Instability in (1) has obviously important implications for
forecasting, and thus we will examine stability of the coefficients in (1) before discussing the

forecasting performance of the Phillips curve.

   Our estimates use monthly data for the U.S., 1959:1-1997:9. Figure 1 plots annual inflation

rates, 7rF, for two closely watched U.S. monthly price indexes: the consumer price index
(CPI-U; the mnemonic in the figure is PUNEW3) and the personal consumption expenditure

(PCE) deflator (GMDC in the figure). Although the two measures of inflation are generally
similar, there are marked differences in 1975 and 1980 (when CPI inflation was much higher

than PCE inflation) and in 1983 and 1985 (when CPI inflation was much lower than PCE
inflation). The causes of the differences in the series are well known: the CPI is essentially a

Laspeyres index which uses a fixed basket to weight its constituent prices, while the PCE

deflator uses chain weighting; the CPI data are not historically revised when methods or data

change, while the PCE deflator is subject to revision. Because a major change in the CPI

occurred in 1983, when the owner-occupied housing component was changed, results will also
be presented for CPI inflation with housing services eliminated (PUXHS). Two unemployment

rates are considered: the total civilian unemployment rate (LHUR), and the unemployment rate

for males ages 25-54 (LHMU25). The latter series is included to control for potential
demographic shifts that could affect the stability of the coefficients, in particular the large
increase in female labor force participation rates over this period.

                                        -5-
   Several tests for the stability of the parameters in (1) were performed. All are variants of

the Quandt (1960) likelihood ratio (QLR) procedure, which tests for a single breakpoint in the

regression. The tests were implemented as the maximum of HAC-robust Wald statistics for
shifts in the coefficients over all possible break dates in the middle 70% of the sample; p-values

for the statistics are computed using the approximation given in Hansen (1997). Results are
shown in Table 1 for regressions estimated over horizons h= 1 and h= 12. The first statistic

(QLR1) tests for the constancy of all the parameters in (1), The next statistic (QLR 13) tests
for stability of the constant term (and hence the NAIRU) together with the coefficients on the

lags of the unemployment rate (13(L)) assuming that the coefficients in y(L) are constant.

Similarly QLR tests for the stability of the coefficients on lagged changes in inflation (y(L))
assuming and 13(L) are constant. For each combination of price and unemployment rate data,

the number of lags in j3(L) and y(L) were chosen separately by the Bayes information criterion

(BIC) over the full sample, where in both cases the number of lags was permitted to be between
0 and 11.

    The QLR statistics in Table 1 indicate statistically significant evidence of instability in

these empirical Phillips curves. This instability appears to be concentrated in the coefficients
on lagged inflation: while the QLRall and QLR7 statistics are statistically significant, the

QLR statistics provide far less evidence of instability in the NAIRU and in the effect of
unemployment on future values of inflation. Importantly, while the instability in y(L) is

statistically significant, it does not seem to be quantitatively large, particularly in its effect on

12-month ahead forecasts. Figure 2 plots estimates of the accumulated values of [1-Ly(L)i
(the impulse responses from et to future values of       holding the unemployment rate constant)
estimated over the first and second half of the samples for the CPI and PCE deflator using

LHUR. These impulse responses are broadly similar across the two sample periods, and most of
the differences occur for horizons less than 12 months. This evidence is consistent with results



                                         -6-
presented in King and Watson (1994), who found statistically significant shifts in the

coefficients of a bivariate VAR fit to postwar U.S. inflation and unemployment data, but found
that these shifts had little effect on the forecasts produced by the VAR.

      In the forecasting experiments that we carry out in later sections we will ignore this

instability, except to the extent that it is captured in recursive estimates of the regression

coefficients, We do this for two reasons. First, figure 2 shows that the instability is small, so
that gains from incorporating this instability are likely to be modest at best. In fact, when

instability is small, existing statistical forecasting methods that incorporate parameter instability
(rolling regression, TVP models, etc.) perform no better than recursive least squares, and in

many cases perform significantly worse (for some empirical evidence, see Stock and Watson
[1996]). Second, this instability has been identified in a full-sample analysis, and incorporating
it into the models is inconsistent with the simulated real-time methodology of the forecasting
exercise.




              3. Inflation Forecasts Based on Measures of Aggregate Real Activity


      Although the Phillips curve is typically specified in terms of the deviation of unemployment
from its natural rate, more generally it is a relation between inflation and aggregate real

activity. This section compares the forecasting performance of the conventional unemployment

rate Phillips curve to generalized Phillips curves that use other measures of aggregate activity.

      The forecasting models used here are analogous to (1) except that the alternative indicator,

x, replaces unemployment:


(3)         +ht =           +   (L)xt + 7(L)t + et+h.

                                          -7-
In (3), it is assumed that   has already been transformed so that it is 1(0). This assumes that
inflation and the alternative demand measure are not cointegrated, an assumption that is

theoretically and empirically plausible for real activity measures (robustness to this assumption is

examined in section 6.) Specification (3) mirrors specification (1). The constant intercept
implies that, under (3), the "natural rate of xi" is constant.

   Seven alternative measures of aggregate activity are considered: industrial production (IP),

real personal income (GMPYQ), total real manufacturing and trade sales (MSMTQ), the number

of employees on nonagricultural payrolls (LPNAG), the capacity utilization rate in

manufacturing (IPXMCA), and housing starts (HSBP). We also consider the unemployment rate
for males ages 25 to 54 (LHMU25). The data source and full definitions of each series are

sunmiarized in the appendix.

   The last three activity variables (IPXMCA, HSBP, LHMU25) are approximately 1(0)
variables and can be used directly in (3). The first four variables (IP, GMPYQ, MSMTQ,

LPNAG) contain significant trend components so that (3) applies when x is interpreted as
deviations from trend. There is a large literature on methods for detrending these variables so

as to construct estimates of an "output gap." Familiar approaches include methods that use

segmented trends with break points determined by historically dated business cycles, methods

based on estimates of aggregate production functions, time series filtering methods, and

combinations of these methods; see Kuttner (1994) for a brief survey. An important limitation

of many of these methods is that they estimate x using both future and past values of the

series, making them unsuitable for forecasting. We experimented with several methods that are
suitable for forecasting and report results for estimates of x based on a one-sided version of

the Hodrick-Prescott (1981) (HP) filter. This procedure produces plausible trend and gap
estimates for each of the variables analyzed here. The one-sided HP filter is convenient and


                                        -8-
preserves the temporal ordering of the data. Of course, improved forecasting performance
might obtain if alternative, possibly multivariate, one-sided estimates of the trend components
of these series were used.

      The one-sided HP trend estimate is constructed as the Kalman filter estimate of Tt in the
model:



(4)



(5)                 (1-L)2rt
                               =


where yt is the logarithm of the data series, r is the unobserved trend component and {} and

{} are mutually uncorrelated white noise sequences with relative variance q=var(n)Ivar(e).
As discussed in Harvey and Jaeger (1993) and King and Rebelo (1993), the HP-filter is the

optimal (linear minimum mean square error) two-sided trend extraction filter for (4)-(5).
Because our focus is on forecasting, we use the optimal one-sided analogue of this filter, so that
future values of     (which would not be available for real time forecasting) are not used in the

detrending operation. We use a value of q for our monthly data (monthly = .75*106) that
approximately matches the spectral gain for the HP-filter typically applied to quarterly data

(which uses quarter1y = .675*1 0-i). We also report forecasting results using xt =        to gauge the

robustness of our results to this choice of detrending.

      The empirical analysis examines the forecasting performance of the candidate series x in a

simulated out of sample forecasting exercise. This entails making forecasts using only data

dated before the forecast period. For example, consider the forecast of the (twelve month)

inflation rate from 1980:1 to 1981:1, made in 1980:1. To compute this forecast, all the models

are estimated, information criteria are computed, and lag lengths are selected using data through



                                         -9-
1980:1, at which point the forecast of inflation over 1980:1 to 1981:1 is made. Moving forward

one month, all the models are reestimated (and information criteria computed and models

selected) using data through 1980:2, and the forecast of inflation over 1980:2 - 1981:2 is

computed. For each series x, this produces a single series of forecast errors based on simulated

out of sample (also termed recursive) estimation and model selection. The data set begins in
1959:1, and the first observation used in the regressions is 1960:2 (earlier observations are used

for initial conditions in the regressions). The period over which simulated out of sample

forecasts are computed and compared is 1970:1 through 1996:9.

   The dependent variables in this and subsequent sections are based on the CPI and,

alternatively, the PCE deflator. The results using the CPI without housing are similar to those

for the CPI and are not reported.

      Several statistics are computed to summarize the performance of the simulated out of sample

forecasts. One is the mean squared error (MSE) of forecasts based on x, relative to the MSE
of forecasts based on the unemployment rate (LHUR). A HAC standard error of this relative

mean squared error is also reported. (See West (1996) for an asymptotic justification of this

procedure using recursively estimated models.)
      The remaining statistics assess whether the candidate variable makes a useful forecasting

contribution, relative to unemployment. A forecast combining regression provides a simple
device for comparing the simulated out of sample performance of the two non-nested models

(the model incorporating xt and the model using the unemployment rate). This is done in the

forecast combination regression,


                     h             x + (l-X)Lt
                                            41
                                               +
(6)                 t +ht — Xft

where f is the forecast of +ht based on the candidate series x, made at date t, I is
the corresponding forecast based on the unemployment rate, and Et+h is the forecast error
                                         -   10   -
associated with the combined forecast. If X=0, then forecasts based on xt add nothing to

forecasts based on unemployment; if X =1, then forecasts based on the unemployment rate add
nothing to forecasts based on x.

   The results are summarized in table 2. Results are shown for two forecast sub-samples:
1970-1983 and 1984-1996. The last row of the table, labeled LHUR RMSE, shows the root

mean square error for the benchmark Phillips curve specification. The other entries in the table
show the relative mean square error of the alternative models and the OLS estimates of X.

   Several findings emerge from the table. There are important differences in the
forecastability of inflation across price series and over time. PCE inflation forecasts are more

accurate than CPI forecasts: over the entire sample period the RMSE for the PCE is
approximately 25% smaller than for the CPI. Forecast errors are much smaller in the second

half of the forecast period (1984-96) than in the first half (1970-83): the RMSE drops by over
40% for both inflation measures. There is considerable forecastable variation in inflation

changes: the relative MSEs of the "No Change" forecast (i.e., the model that forecasts no change
in the inflation rate) are much larger than the relative MSEs of any an other forecasting models.

Forecasts using the unemployment rate generally outperform univariate autoregressions (the
relative MSEs for the univariate autoregressions are greater than 1 .0), but the forecasting gain is
quantitatively large only for CPI inflation in the 1970-83 subsample.

   Two variables (capacity utilization (IPXMCA) and manufacturing and trade sales (MSMTQ))

outperform the unemployment rate uniformly across series and sample period. Many of the
estimated values of X are significantly greater than 0, suggesting that these alternative activity

measures contain useful information not included in lags of the unemployment rate or past

inflation. Finally, specifications using the first difference of the activity variables produce

more accurate forecasts than specifications using "gaps" for the early sample period, but this
reverses in the later sample period, when gaps perform better than first differences.

             4. Bivariate Inflation Forecasts Using Other Economic Indicators


   We now turn to the broader question of how these activity-based forecasts of inflation

compare with forecasts based on other economic indicators. Some of these series are suggested

by theory. For example, the expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates
suggests that spreads between interest rates of different maturities incorporate the forecasts of

inflation made by market participants. Similarly, the quantity theory of money predicts that, in
the long run, the rate of inflation is determined by the long run growth rate of monetary

aggregates. In addition, we also consider series that are not necessarily identified by a

macroeconomic theory but which represent various aspects of the macroeconomy and/or have
previously been used as leading indicators.

   In all, 189 candidate series are used to generate simulated forecasts of inflation that can be

compared with forecasts based on unemployment and on the alternative activity measures. The
series are listed and described in the appendix. The methodology for assessing the performance
of the candidate indicator is identical to that of section 3.

   The results are contained in table 3. The first panel of the table gives results for interest

rates (first difference form) and yield curve spreads (all relative to the three month Treasury

bill rate). Bivariate models with these interest rates perform worse than the benchmark Phillips

curve model, and indeed their performance is typically inferior to the univariate autoregression.

With only one exception, the relative mean square errors exceed unity for all of interest rate

variables, for all sample periods and for both price series. (The exception is a value of 0.97 for
the one year yield curve spread for the CPI in the 1984-96 sample period.) Some of the

estimating combining weights are positive and statistically significant, which suggests that


                                         - 12 -
including interest rates may improve the forecasting performance of the benchmark model.

However, it is important to note the estimated combining weights for the univariate model are

also greater than zero in the second subsample (although not statistically significant), suggesting

that the benchmark model relies too heavily on the unemployment rate.

  The next panel shows results for measures of the nominal money supply. Included are

results using money growth rates and their first differences. These models do not perform

well. The best performing money supply models are comparable to the univariate
autoregressions, presumably because the estimated coefficients on money are very close to zero
in these specifications.

   Results for 152 additional indicators are also included in the table. Models incorporating

exchange rates do not perform as well as the benchmark Phillips curve model or the univariate

autoregression. Models incorporating different price indexes, including commodity prices,
produce forecasts that are very similar to forecasts produced by the univariate models. Lags of
nominal wages do not seem to add information beyond that contained in lags of prices. The

conclusion that emerges from looking across all of the variables in Table 3 is that many of the

models that use real activity variables dominate univariate autoregressions and the benchmark

Phillips curve (for example, see the rows labeled PMI, HSFR, LP, LHELX), but models that use

other variables (asset prices, money, commodity prices, etc.) do not perform this well.
Moreover, many of these indicators appear to have unstable forecasting relations. For example,
the National Association of Purchasing Managers' new orders index (pmno) significantly

outperforms the unemployment rate during the first subsample, but has a relative MSE

exceeding one during the second half for both CPI and PCE inflation; the reverse is true for
the index of consumer expectations (hhsntn).

                 5. Multivariate Inflation Forecasts Using Leading Indicators


      In this section we move beyond the bivariate models of Sections 3 and 4 to compare the

benchmark Phillips curve to forecasts constructed using multiple predictors. Moving from

bivariate to multivariate models raises the important problem of parsimony. On a-priori
grounds, many of the variables listed in Table 3 would be expected to provide useful

information about future inflation. However, including more than just a few of these variables

in unrestricted regressions like (3) would result in over-fitting and poor forecast performance.

One approach is to estimate a large number of relatively simple models (say, all possible models

that use no more than three leading indicators) and then use a model selection criterion to

choose one of these for forecasting. However, the large number of possible models makes this

statistically suspect: serious overfitting would likely spoil the resulting forecasts.
      In this section we therefore consider two alternative approaches for constructing multivariate

forecasts. The first approach is to treat as data the bivariate forecasts constructed in the last
section and to combine them using various forecast combination procedures that are designed to

handle large numbers of dependent forecasts. The second approach is to construct a small

number of composite indexes from larger groups of variables, using recent methods in dynamic

factor analysis, and then to use these indexes (estimated factors) to construct small multiviarate

forecasting models.
      The forecast combination methods begin with the forecasting models (3), now written as



(7)         +ht =           + I3(L)xj + y(L)7rt + e+h


where a subscript i= 1,... ,n has been added to denote the model constructed using the leading

indicator Xj. Let                                   denote the time "t" forecast implied by this


                                         - 14 -
model, where       (etc.) are coefficients estimated using data through date t. The combined
forecasts are constructed as



(8)         =


      Three different procedures are used for choosing the weights {wt}. The first sets =1/n, so

that ct is the sample mean of the date t forecasts. The second uses the sample median instead
of the mean. In the third, the weights are determined from the regression



(9) s+hs = Ei=i''itfi,s + s+h' s=1,...,t,

estimated using data through period t. Because n is large, OLS estimation of (9) generally

produces poor results. However, alternative estimators, better suited to the problem at hand,
are available. In particular, if the forecasts have an approximate dynamic factor structure, then

the problem of minimizing out of sample forecast error from the forecast combining regression

(9) has similarities to the problem that leads to James-Stein (1961) estimation and to ridge

regression, modified so that they shrink towards equal weighting (this argument is spelled out in

Chan, Stock and Watson [1998). The third forecast combination procedure therefore is the

ridge regression estimator of t=1t                nt)' which can be written as


(10)        ,RR. =   (cIa   +       lFSF)(ElFS(7r+h-7rS) + c/n).


where F=(fi ...                 and c=kxTR(n1 E1F5F). The parameter k governs the amount
of shrinkage. When k=0, t,1R=t,OLS and as k grows large                          Results were

computed for k= .25, .5, 1 and 10; the forecasts constructed using k= 1 generally were most


                                         - 15 -
accurate, so to save space only results for k= 1 are reported. Loosely speaking, k= 1 corresponds
to shrinking the OLS estimator half way to the equal weighted value of 1/n.

   The second approach to multivariate forecasting in this high-dimensional setting utilizes

estimated factors (or indexes) constructed from the set of predictor variables. Let X denote

the set of predictors at date t. Then the factors are constructed as the principal components of
X. A theoretical justification for this estimator, provided in Stock and Watson (1998), is that
it produces consistent estimates of the factors under fairly general conditions in an approximate

factor model when the number of elements in X grows large. This approach is applied here

mainly when the number of predictors is large (all of the variables in Table 3), although in

some cases the number of predictors is moderate to small (e.g. the 9 money supply variables in

Table 3). The rationale in the latter case is simply that the estimator provides a simple

procedure for summarizing the data. Let D, s = 1,... ,t, denote the rn-vector time series of
factors extracted at date t. Then forecasts are constructed from the regression model:



(11) +hs = + 13(L)'D + y(L)zir5 + es+h, s=1,...,t.

   The recursive design used in this section parallels the design used in the last two sections.

Specifically, at date t, the coefficients in (7) are estimated for each x by OLS using only data

through date t. The orders of the lag polynomials 3(L) and y(L) are determined separately by

BIC for each date over orders 0-11. The recursive model selection also allows y(L)=0. With
the coefficients of (7) estimated, the forecasts   are   formed. For the ridge regression
combined forecast, ridge regression estimates of cL are computed using the set of forecasts and

inflation data for dates t and earlier.

   Similarly, at date t, factors are constructed as principal components using data on the

various indicators from dates t and earlier. These estimated factors are then used in regression


                                          - 16 -
(11), which is estimated by OLS using data on inflation and the factors dated t and earlier. BIC

model selection is recursively carried out over the number of factors and the orders of the lag

polynomials. Two factor models are estimated. The first model allows several underlying

factors to help forecast inflation, and recursively chooses models with 1-6 factors, each entering
with 0-5 lags. The second model uses a single factor (representing, say "activity" or "money")

and allows from 0-11 lags of the factor to enter (11). Both models allow up to 11 lags in 'y(L).
   Results for four categories of variables are summarized in table 4. The top panel of the
table shows results constructed from all of the variables shown in Table 3 together with the

variables in Table 2 and the unemployment rate (LHUR). The row labeled "Mul. Factors"

shows results from the multiple factor model; the next row shows results from the single factor

version of the model. The following three rows show forecasts constructed from the forecast

combining equation (8), the mean forecast, the median, and the ridge regression combination
forecast. The next panel of results, labeled "Real Activity Indicators" include all of the

variables shown in Table 2 (using the first differenced values of the trending variables) and the

variables under the categories labeled Output, Employment (except the unemployment duration

variables), Sales, Consumption, and Inventories and Orders. The results in the panel labeled
"Interest Rates" are constructed using all of the interest variables in Table 3 (including the

interest rate spreads). The results labeled "Money" use the variables in the Nominal Money
section of table 3 transformed as the second difference of logarithms. Results using the first

differences of the money variables are similar to the second difference results and are not

reported.
   Three conclusions emerge from Table 4. First, single factor models either using all of the
indicators or using only the real activity indicators produce the best overall forecasts of

inflation. The real activity single factor model performs best in the first sample period; in the

second sample period the all indicators single factor model performs marginally better. These


                                       - 17 -
single factor forecasts are significantly better (economically and statistically) than the

benchmark unemployment rate Phillips curve model. They also dominate forecasts constructed

from any of the bivariate models. For example, only one bivariate model (PMI) has a smaller

mean square error than the all indicator single factor model in the first sample period for both

price indexes, but its MSE is larger than the real activity single factor model, and it performs

significantly worse than both of these factor models in the second sample period. No bivariate

model outperforms these factor models for both price indexes in the second sample period. The
second conclusion is that there is little if any improvement in the interest rate and nominal

money combination forecasts over their bivariate analogues in table 3. The variables continue

to perform relatively poorly. Finally, the ridge regression forecasts outperform unemployment
in both subsamples for both inflation variables (both economically and statistically) using either

the real activity indicators or the full set of indicators. The ridge regression forecasts typically
improve upon the mean and median forecasts. However, none of the combination forecasts

perform as well as the single factor models.

   The final issue addressed in this section is whether forecasts based on a Phillips curve,

reinterpreted as a relationship between inflation and the single real actitivity factor, can be

improved upon by including additional variables (money, interest rates, commodity prices, etc.)
To answer this question the analysis of table 4 is repeated, except that the benchmark model

uses the single real activity factor rather than the unemployment rate. We then ask whether

more accurate forecasts can be constructed by combining this new benchmark Phillips curve

forecast with the forecasts constructed from the interest rate, money or all-indicators factor

models. These combined forecasts are computed from (8) using OLS to recursively estimate the

coefficients wj.
   The results are sumarized in Table 5. There is no evidence suggesting that any of the other
models dominate the new benchmark model for predicting CPI inflation over this period. As


                                        - 18 -
expected from the results in Table 4, the interest rate and money models are dominated by the

benchmark model. More interesting are the results shown in the bottom of the table, where

these forecasts are combined with the new benchmark Phillips curve forecast: all the resulting

combined forecasts are worse than the new benchmark model. In summary, table 5 indicates

that it is difficult to improve upon forecasts made using the single activity factor.

   Figure 3 plots the real activity factor used to construct the benchmark forecast in Table 5

together with the unemployment rate. Both series are expressed in standard deviation units and

the unemployment rate has been multiplied by -l so that peaks in both series corresponds to

expansions in real activity. To facilitate interpretation, the real activity factor has also been

smoothed using the filter (1/3) x(L + 1 +L) to eliminate some of its high frequency variation.

Two features of the figure are particularly noteworthy. First, the estimated activity factor has

more cyclical variability than the unemployment rate. (For example, compare the series during
the 1967 growth recession and the two recessions of the early 1980's). Second, this factor tends

to lead the unemployment rate by several months, as can be seen by comparing the business

cycle peak and trough dates of the two series.

   Figure 4 plots realizations of CPI inflation with corresponding forecasts constructed 12

months earlier. (The series are aligned so that the vertical distance between the plot of
inflation and the forecast represents the forecast error.) Forecasts constructed using LHUR and

the single real activity factor are shown. While the two forecasts are usually similar, they differ
in some periods, and the single factor forecast is on average more accurate than the

unemployment rate forecast over the entire sample period.

                 6. Robustness to the Assumption that Inflation is 1(1)


   The results reported thus far rely on a specification that imposes the restriction that

inflation is 1(1). In this section we study the robustness of the forecasting results by

respecifying (3) as



(12)     t+h = +                + (L)t + et+h.

Equation (12) reduces to (3) after imposing the restriction t(l) 1.
   Results are reported in table 6. The benchmark model in table 6 is the 1(0) specification

(12), with x equal to the single real activity factor. The first row of table 6 compares this

benchmark 1(0) model to the benchmark 1(1) model from table 5, in which         is the single real

activity factor. The remaining comparisons in table 6 are between selected forecasts, computed

using 1(0) specifications, and the benchmark 1(0) model.
   The relative performance of the 1(0) and 1(1) specifications that use the single real activity

index vary across sample periods: imposing the unit root restriction leads to more accurate

predictions in the first sample period but less accurate predictions in the second sample period.

These results are consistent with unit root tests applied to the inflation rate. Recursively
computed unit root tests (DFGLS from Elliott, Rothenberg and Stock (1996)) have p-values

larger 10% for both inflation series through 1982 and p-values less than 10% after 1982 for CPI

and after 1985 for the PCE. Of course, these univariate tests are merely suggestive: a formal

unit root pretest strategy for the models considered in this paper would involve multivariate unit

root and cointegration tests.

   The results for the other variables are generally consistent with the results presented earlier,

The 1(0) single real activity index model produces more accurate forecasts than the 1(0) model


                                        - 20   -
that uses the unemployment rate (LHUR) as the activity indicator, particularly in the first half

of the forecast period. This specification allows inflation and the unemployment rate to be

cointegrated as in Ireland (1999). The 1(0) single factor model that includes all of the indicators

performs better than the benchmark in the second half of the sample and worse in the first half

of the sample. Looking at the individual real indicators, there is only one relative mean square
error that is less than unity: capacity utilization provides a more accurate forecast for CPI
inflation in the 1984-96 sample period.

   The other entries in the table rely on transformations of the indicators consistent with the

levels specification for inflation. Thus, interest rates are allowed to enter in levels, and the

interest rate factors are constructed using the levels of interest rates. Letting interest rates enter
(12) in levels introduces an important variant: inflation and interest rates could be 1(1) and

cointegrated, where the cointegrating vector is implicitly estimated by recursive nonlinear least

squares. A further variant is to impose that these series are cointegrated and have a

cointegrating vector of (1, -1), consistent with the hypothesis that real interest rates are 1(0).

This is done in the rows labeled fygm3-CI and fygtl-CI. Nominal money enters in growth
rates. Finally, the price indexes, pmcp and psm99q are entered as first difference of

logarithms.
   Even though these models introduce richer low frequency dynamics than the 1(1) models of

the earlier sections, they produce poor forecasts. Although M2 improves upon the benchmark
model in the second sample period for the CPI, this improvement is slight. There is also some

evidence that the index of sensitive material prices (psm99q) helped to forecast inflation during

the 1970's. However, no other forecast outperforms the benchmark model for either inflation
series in either sample period. The models that impose 1(0) real rates do particularly poorly,

especially in the 1970-83 sample. Comparison of the corresponding entries in tables 5 and 6
indicates that the single activity model does relatively better than the alternative forecasts when

comparisons are made among 1(0) specifications, than among 1(1) specifications.
                                        - 21 -
   In summary, these results suggest that the forecasts with 1(1) specifications of inflation are

generally (but not always) preferred to those with 1(0) specifications; that in some cases the 1(0)

forecasts perform extremely poorly; and that the results of the previous section are robust to

specifying inflation as 1(0) rather than 1(1).




                              7. Discussion and Conicusion


   Some caveats are in order. First, the approach in this paper has been to evaluate forecasting

performance using a simulated out of sample methodology. This methodology provides a degree
of protection against overfitting and detects model instability. However, because a large
number of forecasts were used, some overfitting bias nonetheless remains. This suggests that

some of the best-performing forecasts produced using individual economic indicators might

deteriorate as one moves beyond the end of our sample. Because the pool of forecasts is larger

for the individual indicators considered in section 4 than for the composite indexes considered

in section 5, overfitting is arguably more of an issue for the individual indicator forecasts than

the composite forecasts. Second, we have considered only linear models. To the extent that the
relation between inflation and some of the candidate variables is nonlinear, these results

understate the forecasting improvements that might be obtained, relative to the conventional

linear Phillips curve. Finally, our analysis has been limited to a 1 year ahead forecasting

horizon. As documented in Staiger, Stock and Watson (1997), unemployment rate Phillips curve
forecasts fare worse when evaluated using 2 year ahead forecasts.

   The major conclusion of this study is that the Phillips curve, interpreted broadly as a

relation between current real economic activity and future inflation, produced the most reliable

and accurate short run forecasts of U.S. price inflation across all of the models that we


                                         - 22    -
considered over the 1970-1996 period. This conclusion will come as no surprise to applied

macroeconomic forecasters in business and government, where the Phillips curve plays a central

role in short run inflation forecasting. The conclusion is also consistent with the recent

academic literature on short run inflation forecasting. For example in a comparison of 71

potential leading indicators of inflation, Staiger, Stock and Watson (1997) report that the

unemployment rate ranks 7th over the 1975-84 forecasting period and 10th over 1985-1993.

The only variable which dominates the unemployment rate over both periods is another

indicator of real activity, the rate of capacity utilization.

   The conventionally specified Phillips curve, based on the unemployment rate, was found to

perform reasonably well. Its forecasts are better than univariate forecasting models (both

autoregressions and random walk models), which in many situations have proven to be

surprisingly strong benchmarks . Moreover, with few exceptions, incoporating other variables
does not significantly improve upon its short run forecasts. Specifically, there are no gains

from including money supply measures (consistent with results in Estrella and Mishkin (1997)),

interest rates and spreads (consistent with the "short-end of the term structure" results results

reported in Mishkin (1990)), or commodity prices (in contrast to the "price puzzle" rationale for

including commodity prices in VARs first suggested in Sims (1992)).
   The few forecasts that do consistently improve upon unemployment rate Phillips curve

forecasts are in fact from alternative Phillips curves, specified using other measures of aggregate
activity instead of the unemployment rate. These measures include the capacity utilization rate

and real manufacturing and trade sales. Interestingly, combining the forecasts produced by 61

separate generalized Phillips curve specifications, each with a different activity measure, also

improved upon forecasts made solely using the unemployment rate.
   Perhaps the most intriguing result is that the best-performing forecast is a Phillips curve

forecast that uses a new composite index of aggregate activity comprised of the 61 individual


                                          -   23 -
activity measures. The forecasting gains from using this index are economically large and
statistically significant over the 1970-1996 sample period, and we were unable to improve upon
this forecast by combining it with other forecasts. This conclusion is consistent with the

findings of the most recent studies of the apparent breakdown of the unemployment rate

Phillips curve during 1997-1998. As is discussed in Gordon (1998) and Stock (1998), this poor

performance seems to be associated with the specific use of unemployment rate as the activity

indicator; they find that Phillips curve forecasts using alternative real activity measures

perform much better than unemployment rate Phillips curves over this sample period.

1. For the past few years, inflation has consistently been below the forecasts made by
conventional Phillips curve specifications. This has raised the possibility of a large decline in
the NAIRU in the mid 1990s or possibly a broader breakdown of the Phillips curve altogether;
see Gordon (1998) for a discussion. Although they are important, these developments are, we
believe, too recent to make a clear assessment about stability given the available data. We
therefore focus on stability in larger subsamples and defer the issue of instability in the mid-
1990s to future work.


2. This framework is due to Gordon (1982) and forms the basis for estimates of the NAIRU
(see for example, Congressional Budget Office [1994], Fuhrer [1995], and Council of Economic
Advisors [1998]).

Notes: QLRa11 tests all of the regression coefficients over all possible break
points in the middle 70% of the sample. The other statistics test subsets of
the coefficients under the maintained assumption that the other coefficients
are constant. QLR tests       and the coefficients of 3(L), and QLR test the
coefficients of t lag polynomial y(L) . The Wald form of the QLR statistics
using a HAC covariance matrix for the estimated parameters (constructed using
a Bartlett kernel using h lags); p-values are computed using the
approximation given in Hansen (1997) . The sample period is 1960:2-1996:9.

Notes: All results are for simulated out-of-sample forecasts as discussed in
the text. The first row of the table shows results for the lNochangeTl
(martingale) forecast of inflation and the next row, "TJnivariate," shows
results for a univariate autoregression. LHUR RMSE denotes the root mean
square forecast error constructed using recursively estimated coefficients in
equation (3) using xt=LHtJR and a forecasting horizon of 1 year (h=12) .    a

(DT) where    is the one-sided HP trend component of ln(yt) described in the
text. The entries Rel. MSE show the mean square forecast error (MSE) using
the variable given in the first column and computed from recursively estimated
coefficients in equation (3) relative to the MSE using LHTJR. The column
labeled X shows OLS estimate of X from equation (6) . HAC robust standard
errors (estimated using a Bartlett kernel with 12 lags) are shown in
parentheses. The forecasts were computed over the sample period period
1970:1-1996:9. The first sample period used for the using recursively
estimated regressions was 1960:2.
