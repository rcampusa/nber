                                             Abstract



           The Medicare trust funds face huge prospective deficits by the end

of this decade.        This paper discusses trends in six areas that bear on the

Medicare    problem:       the number of the elderly, their health status, use of

medical    care,   labor    force    participation,     income,   and    living    arrangements.

Among the most important findings are: 1) a very large increase since 1965

in life expectancy at age 65;            2) a very large increase since 1976 in real

per capita health care expenditures on the elderly relative to expenditures

on persons under age 65;            3) a cross-sectional increase with age in per capita

health care expenditures that is primarily attributable to very large expendi-

tures in the last year of life;              4) a sharp decrease in labor force partici-

pation and a sharp increase in relative income of the elderly since 1965.

The paper concludes by raising questions about the need to reconsider the

definition of the elderly, the need for more flexible labor market arrangements

for older workers, and a need for a social consensus concerning appropriate

care of dying patients.

          Less than one score years ago this nation brought forth a new

system of financing health care for the elderly--Medicare. This system,

conceived as part of a broad thrust toward a "Great Society" and dedicated

to the proposition that high quality medical care should be freely available

to all persons 65 and over, is now the subject of intense re-examination.

The rapid rate of growth of health care expenditures, the growing

resistance to further increases in governmental taxes or deficits, and

the changing circumstances of the elderly make this an appropriate time

to ask (and attempt to answer) basic questions about the economic and

social forces that affect this age group and this program.



          Projections of Medicare outlays and revenues indicate very large

future deficits in the Hospital Insurance trust fund and the Supplementary

Medical   Insurance     trust   fund.     A wide range of possible solutions to this

problem   have   been    proposed,      including   modification   of   benefits,   changes

in methods of reimbursement, and discovery of new sources of funds. The other

papers in this volume examine these proposals in detail. This paper attempts

to place the Medicare issue in a broad context by identifying major economic

and social trends that concern the elderly and by briefly considering the

causes and consequences of these trends.                I do not discuss Medicare directly,
                                                2



but the questions. raised and the data presented will, I hope, contribute

to the formulation of improved public policies regarding health care for

the elderly.

           I begin by supposing that a policy maker with a strong interest in

the elderly had disappeared in 1950 and had only recently returned. What

would he or she most need to know about the elderly with respect to their

current situation and the changes of recent decades? In my judgment there

are six areas that are of critical importance:               the number of elderly, their

health status, use of medical care, labor force participation, income, and

their     living    arrangements.    I discuss the most dramatic changes in these

areas during the past three decades, indicate how current policies may have

contributed to these changes, and suggest the need for reconsideration of

those     policies.




The Number of Elderly

           Almost every article and book about the elderly begins by noting

that the percentage of the population over 65 has grown appreciably over

time.     Why is there so much interest in this percentage? First, it is

assumed that most men and women aged 65 and over are not at work; therefore,

part of the working generation's output must be transferred to the elderly

through    social     security   payments,   private   pension   plans,   direct   provision

of services, or other means.           The higher the percentage of elderly, the

greater the amount that must be transferred. Second, it is assumed that

health deteriorates with age and that the consumption of medical care

increases.     Furthermore, it is argued that even though the decline in

labor income, the deterioration in health, and the increased use
of medical care are, for the most part, foreseeable, many elderly cannot

or do not adequately provide for old age by saving or by acquiring

a health insurance policy when young that would protect them later in life.

(Imperfections     in   insurance   markets,   problems    of    adverse   selection,     and

high administrative and sales costs are said to contribute to this outcome.)

Finally, the rise in the number of elderly increases their political power.

This increase, coming at a time when economic resources are often allocated

through the ballot box rather than the market place, raises the possibility

of bitter political conflict between the elderly and other groups in society.

         The definition of old age--that is, the age of eligibility for

retirement   and   Medicare   benefits--is     a   critical     variable   in   the    development

of viable programs for the elderly.            Consider,      for   instance,   a     hypothetical

population in which the birth rate equals the death rate and everyone dies at

80 years of age.        If every man and woman works from ages 20 to 65 and then

retires, the ratio of workers to retirees will be three to one.                        If. however,

the retirement age is 70, there will be five workers for every retiree, thus

permitting a substantial increase in benefits or decrease in taxes, or both.

         It is conventional to define the elderly with reference to the

number of years since birth, but this is largely a concession to administrative

convenience rather than the logical result of a closely reasoned argument.

Individuals "age" at very different rates and, in theory at least, the elderly

could be defined in terms of years until death, e.g., those men and women

who will die within some specified time.              For instance, we could look at the

proportion of the population that will die within one year (the crude death

rate).   According to this measure the proportion has decreased since 1950.

To be sure, it doesn't make much sense to define infants, children, and
                                          4



young   adults   as   "elderly," even if they are close to death. But a count

of persons 65 and over who will die within the next several years is

informative because much of the interest in the elderly revolves around

their need for medical care and other special services. From a different

perspective, a count of persons 65 and over who are not in the labor force

is revealing because it shows the portion of the population that must live

on transfer payments, income from capital, or dissaving.

           These alternative views of who is old yield different trends in

the relative importance of the elderly, as may be seen in Table 1. The

first row shows the familiar increase in the proportion of the population

65 and over, from 8.2 percent in 1950 to 11.3 percent in 1980. The second

row, however, shows that if we define the elderly as persons 65 and over who

will die within five years, this number as a percent of the total population

has increased relatively slowly since 1950 and has hardly grown at all since

1965. Sharp declines in age-specific death rates at ages 65 and above have

offset the effect of the increase shown in the first row.       On the other hand,

if we define the elderly as persons 65 and over who are out of the labor

force (row 3). that proportion has grown even more rapidly than the percent

over 65.

decline in the percent of the population 65-74 with systolic pressure of 160

or more or diastolic pressure of 95 or more [NCHS 1981 and 1982a]. Taking

all the available mortality and morbidity data into account, I conclude

that the health status of the elderly at any given age has improved in

recent decades and that this improvement is primarily the result of lowered

incidence or severity of heart disease and cerebrovascular disease.

          .Death    rates from all other causes at ages 65-84 were virtually the

same in 1980 as in 1965.              This relative stability presents a major puzzle.

During those years Medicare substantially improved access to health care

for the elderly, especially the poor.                 Also, there were many significant

medical    advances      including    new   drugs, improved    surgical   procedures,    and

enhanced     diagnostic       techniques.     It is difficult to believe that these

achievements       had   no   beneficial    effect.    Age-adjusted   death   rates   from     malignant

neoplasms (cancer) actually rose between 1965 and 1980 among the elderly,

possibly as a result of increases several decades ago in cigarette smoking

and     environmental      hazards.     It is encouraging to note that cancer mortality

has declined for males 35-44; perhaps similar declines will begin to show up

at older ages as the cohorts with fewer cigarette smokers reach that point

in the life cycle.

           Will life expectancy at older ages continue to increase at a rapid

rate?     Some experts say 'no," arguing that there is a biologically determined

average limit for the species of about 85 years [Fries 19801. Other observers

contend that recent large declines in the death rate for the 85+ group is

evidence against the existence of that limit [Schneider and Brody 19831.

Both groups agree that additional declines in mortality at ages 65-84 are

possible or even likely; it would, therefore, be prudent to consider the

possibility of such declines in planning future programs for the elderly.

Health   Care     Utilization

         The role of additional medical care in improving the health of

the elderly is a matter of some dispute.                        What is beyond dispute

is the increased consumption of medical services by the elderly. Between

1965 and 1981 there was a large increase in health expenditures at all age

levels, but the share accounted for by persons 65 and over jumped from

23.8 percent to 32.7 percent.               This shift has helped to fan the Medicare

financial crisis; it is, therefore, important to examine it in some detail.

Two factors are responsible and they have been about equal in importance:

first, the number of elderly grew more rapidly than the rest of the population;

second, the change in per capita health expenditures by the elderly outpaced

the rate for persons under 65 (see column 1 of Table 4). The relative

importance of these factors was not the same among the subperiods, however,

as may be seen in columns 2-4.               Not   surprisingly,   per   capita   expenditures

among the elderly rose rapidly in the years immediately after the enactment

of   Medicare     (1965-70).    From 1970 to 1976 per capita expenditures rose at

about the same rate for both age groups; divergent                 trends   in    population

accounted for nearly all of the differential change in expenditures.

During 1976-81, however, a large~differential                 in the growth of per capita

expenditures      again   emerged.        This gap, combined with a continuing difference

in population trends, resulted in a total differential change in expenditures

of 3.8 percent per annum.            This was larger than the difference between the

elderly and the rest of the population in the five years immediately

following   the    introduction      of    Medicare!

         The last eight rows of Table 4 provide additional detail regarding

the surge of spending on the elderly.                   We see that there was a very sharp

deceleration in public spending on persons under 65, while the trend

increased slightly for the elderly. Private spending, on the other hand,

held steady for persons under 65 and accelerated sharply for those over

that age.      With respect to type of expenditure, it was physicians' services

that experienced the most rapid increase among the elderly.

         What accounts for these divergent trends? One possibility is that

increasing competition among physicians for patients led more of them to

concentrate on the older men and women in their practice. Another possibility

is that the new medical and surgical interventions have been particularly

applicable     to   older   persons.   These speculations indicate why it is so

difficult to predict expenditures on medical care, either in the aggregate

or for particular age groups or particular types of service.                      Sudden    advances

in   medical    technology--new    drugs,   new     diagnostic    techniques,    new   surgical

procedures--can dramatically alter utilization. In addition, modifications

in insurance coverage, or in reimbursement methods, or in the number of

physicians can alter the balance of demand and supply, thus inducing changes

in the way physicians treat patients and the way patients use physicians.

Whatever the cause, the upsurge in per capita expenditures of the elderly

is a major factor in the prospective deficits in Medicare.

         Does utilization rise with age?               Analysts   interested     in    projecting

future health care utilization by the elderly have frequently noted that

the age distribution within the 65-and-over group is shifting toward the

older ages and that utilization (as reflected by Medicare reimbursements)

rises steadily with age (see first three columns of Table 5). Under the

assumption     that   the    cross-sectional      age-spending    relationship    holds    constant

over time, the effect of the change in age distribution is estimated by

applying      the    cross-sectional    data      on    age-specific     expenditures      to    the

change in the age distribution.

             Although this procedure is widely used, implicitly if not explicitly,

it is incorrect.            TO the extent that the change in the age distribution is

the result of rising life expectancy (i.e., falling                         age-specific        death    rates),

the     cross-sectional      differences     in    expenditures     by     age    overestimate     the

changes that would result from an aging population. Health care spending

among the elderly is not so much a function of time since birth as it is a

function of time to death.             The principal reason why expenditures rise with age

in cross-section (among persons 65and over) isthat the proportion of persons near

death increases with age. Expenditures are particularly large in the last year

of life, and, to a lesser extent, in the next-to-last-year of life. Among

Medicare enrollees in 1976, the average reimbursement for those in their

last year of life was 6.6 times (and in their next-to-last-year of life 2.3

times) as large as for those who survived at least two years [Lubitz and

Prihoda 19821.         As age-specific death rates fall over time, there will be

fewer people in the last year of life in any age category, and this will

tend    to    reduce    age-specific    health         care   expenditures.

             Age-sex-specific      expenditures         adjusted   for     age-sex      differences      in

death rates can be calculated by a method analogous to the indirect method

of     calculating     age-sex    adjusted     death     rates.    Suppose       that   each    person's

expenditures depended only on their survival status, e.g., last year of life,

next-to-last        year,    or   "survivor."      We     can   estimate    a    "predicted"     expenditure

for each age-sex group by multiplying the proportion in each survival                                    status
by the all-group average expenditure for each survival status and summing

across the three statuses.             The higher the death rate of the group, the
                                               15



higher would be its "predicted" expenditures. The ratio of actual to

"predicted" expenditures for a group tells us whether expenditures are

relatively high or low after adjusting for its death rate. This ratio

multiplied by the average expenditure for all groups yields the adjusted

expenditure for the gr0up.u

         As may be seen in the last three columns of Table 5 and in Figure 1,

adjustment for age-sex differences in survival status eliminates most of

the   age-related    increase    in    expenditures, especially   the   very   high   expenditures

in the S-and-over group.             It also eliminates the excess of male over female

expenditures   at    given   ages.    The only reason why older men       use more medical
care than older women at any given age is because a higher proportion of the

men are in their last year of life.

         I do not claim that there is no effect of aging on health care

utilization apart from the proximity to death, but much of the apparent

effect is attributable to the relationship between age and mortality. This

observation would be of little consequence if mortality rates were constant

over time, but they are not.              Between 1965 and 1978 the age-adjusted death

rate of persons 65 and older fell from 65 per 1,000 to 53 per 1,000.

If age-specific death rates continue to fall at this rate, 75-year-olds

in 1987 will face the same probability of death as 71-year-olds faced in

1965.

            How much health care will 75-year-olds              utilize in 1987? The answer

will depend upon many factors, including changes in medical technology,

the strengthening or weakening of family support systems, and revisions in

Medicare     reimbursement     policies.      But to the extent that fewer 75-year-olds

will be in the last or next-to-last year of life, a simple extrapolation

from past utilization of 75-year-olds               is inappropriate.

            Kenneth G. Manton [1982] reaches a similar conclusion from a model

that emphasizes the distinction between the hypothetical age trajectory of

mortality risk for individuals and the age trajectory for a cohort.                           He writes

"As mortality rates decline at a given age, there would be some compensating

decline in the rate of utilization of certain health services (e.g.. nursing

home care) before that age.              In fact, such models might be used as the basis

for    improving     projections    of   health   service    utilization     by   providing    estimates

of    the   likely   change   in    health-service-utilization       rates    associated    with     a

given mortality reduction" [Manton 1982, p. 2051.

            The   relationships     between   utilization,    age,   and     survival   status     will

depend on the reasons for the lower death rate. If mortality falls because

people are living healthier lives or because of more effective preventive

measures,     the    conventional    extrapolations    will    over-estimate       health     care

utilization. as demonstrated above. On the other hand, if the lower death
                                                  18



rates are the result of ever more complex technological interventions, the

rising cost of such interventions will tend to offset the fact that fewer

persons are in the last year of life.




Labor    Force     Participation

           Between 1950 and 1980 the labor force participation rate of men 65

and over fell from 46 percent to 19 percent.                   Participation rates of men 55-64

have also dropped sharply in recent years, from 83 percent in1965 to 72 percent

in 1980.      What accounts for these striking declines? Many explanations have

been    offered,    including   poor    health,    mandatory    retirement   rules,    age

discrimination,      rising     wages, and      improved    social   security   benefits.

           Health.      When older men are surveyed about their,labor                 force status,

those not participating frequently cite ill health as the reason. These

replies have been viewed with some skepticism because ill health may be

offered as a socially acceptable reason for not working when the true

explanation      lies   elsewhere.      A    longitudinal    analysis   of   retirement      patterns,

however, revealed that poor health is a good predictor of which men currently

at work will not be working four years later [Fuchs 19821. This relationship

does    I&,      however,   explain    why   participation
                                                  19



by older men is so much lower now than it was 30 years ago. As noted, the

health of the elderly has probably improved, and the occupational structure

has shifted away from         blue collar jobs requiring heavy physical exertion.

Thus, at any given age probably fewer men are compelled to leave the labor

force for health reasons now than in earlier decades. Therefore we must

look to other factors.

          Mandatory     retirement    and   age    discrimination.    According   to    some

popular discussions, men stop working because of mandatory retirement or

because they are victims of age discrimination. In my judgment neither of

these explanations has been a significant factor in the long-term downward

trend   in   labor    force   participation.      First, about half of all currently

retired men were never subject to mandatory retirement rules [Schulz 19761.

Furthermore,,many       workers retire before the mandatory age, many retire

willingly at the mandatory age, and some are not working for other reasons

such as ill health.

          Mandatory retirement rules are usually part of a total labor contract,

either explicit or implicit, that provides workers with stable or even rising

wages   until   retirement,    even   though   their   productivity   may   decline    during

their last years of employment.             If older workers are being paid more than

they're currently worth, when they lose their jobs through mandatory

retirement they obviously have difficulty obtaining a new job at their old

wage rate.

          The gap that develops between the wages of some older workers and

their productivity is one reason why we hear complaints about "age

discrimination."        It is obvious that many employers prefer younger to older
                                                                                                         1

workers, but this his not "discrimination" in an economic sense if age affects

productivity      or    labor       costs.     For instance, the older worker may expect a

higher wage even though his productivity does not justify the wage differential.

Even if there is no wage-productivity gap, the fringe benefits of older

workers are often relatively high, especially for health insurance, life

insurance,     and      pension      benefits.     As the share of fringe benefits in the

total    compensation            package     increases , it becomes increasingly uneconomic for

firms to hire older workers.                   If.there       appears to be more age discrimination

now than there was 30 years ago, it is probably because of the changes in

wages and fringe benefits that make it less attractive to hire older workers.

          Decline           of    self-employment.       One factor that probably does contribute

to the downward trend in participation by older men is the declining

importance       of     self-employment.         Self-employed men are more likely to continue

working at older ages than are wage-and-salary workers, holding constant

education, age, health, wages, and other relevant variables [Fuchs 19821.

Wage-and-salary workers typically face more rigidity in hours and wages,

while the self-employed find it easier to reduce their hours of work without

changing their occupation or job.                    The proportion of workers who are

self-employed         has    declined      drastically    throughout    the   20th   century   because

of the shift of employment from agriculture to industry and service. Even

within each sector, self-.employment                  has declined in relative importance as

small farms and small businesses find it increasingly difficult to compete

with    larger    enterprises.

          Real wages.             Some economists argue that the growth of real wages

in the economy as a whole is a major reason for the decline in iabor force

participation of older men, although this conclusion does not flow directly
                                                     21



from     economic     theory.    An increase in participation would be equally

consistent with theory because the higher the wage, the higher the price

of not working.            But higher wages also mean higher income and the income

effect increases the demand for leisure.                     It is difficult to predict whether

the price or income effect will dominate.

            For women of prime working age higher real wages have resulted in

more     labor   force     participation,     not   less.     In the case of older men, however,

it appears that the income effect is larger than the price effect. This would

explain why the labor force participation of older men has declined in the

United States as real income has risen.                     One problem with this explanation

is that participation rates of older men in Europe are as low as in the

United States, even though real income is not as high. To be sure, these

countries typically have generous public pensionplans that facilitate

retirement.         But why do they have such plans? The increasing number of

elderly may be,the           answer, partly because of the political power that

numerical strength confers and partly because younger workers want the older

ones to leave the labor market.

           Number     of    elderly.      The growth in the proportion of elderly probably

contributes      to   their     low    participation      rate.   When there are relatively few

older people, the population has a pyramid-like age structure similar to the

hierarchical       structure     of    most   organizations; the relatively few older workers

can more easily progress up the organizational ladder. Currently in the

United States and in most European countries the age distribution is more

rectangular      in   shape,    but    organizations      still   have   a   pyramid-like   hierarchy

with fewer and fewer openings the higher up one goes. Thus if most older

workers stayed in the labor force, they would find it impossible to move up

within     their      organizations.
                                               22



          Social   Security.      Probably one of the most important reasons why

the labor force participation of older men has declined so rapidly is the

unusual growth of social security benefits. Between 1970 and 1980 average

retirement benefits (adjusted for inflation) increased by more than 3 percent

per annum, while hourly earnings did not even keep pace with inflation.

There is no doubt that public policy has made it increasingly attractive

for older people to stop work--by increasing retirement benefits relative

to wages, by offering an early retirement option at 62, and by withholding

benefits from eligible retirees at the rate of 50 cents per dollar of earnings

on earnings above a prescribed rate.

         The trend toward earlier retirement, combined with greater life

expectancy, will place a tremendous burden on those workers who remain in

the labor force (as noted on page 3).               To reverse this trend, however, wil 1

probably require major changes in the structure of jobs and labor markets

as well as changes in the structure of social security retirement benefits.




Income

         From a purely financial perspective, today's older Americans are

much better off than their predecessors.               They have more income and more

wealth (adjusted for inflation) than any previous generation of elderly.

Their real income has risen not only in absolute terms but also relative

to the income of the working population, primarily because of the rapid

growth   of   social   security   retirement   benefits.     It is true that household

income when the householder is 65 or over is only half of that in the

age range 45 to 64, but this figure must be adjusted for household size.
                                            23



In 1980 the households of the elderly had on average only 1.74 persons,

compared with 2.83 persons when the householder is 45-64. Taxes also make

a big difference.       The elderly's taxes (federal and state individual income

taxes, property taxes on owner-occupied housing, and payroll taxes) are

estimated to be only 13 percent of their income, while the 45-64 age group

pay taxes equal to about 25 percent of income [U.S. Bureau of the Census 19831.

Thus the after-tax income per household member of the elderly is almost equal

to that of the 45-64 age group.

         Not only does the average older person receive an after-tax income

comparable to that he or she received at younger ages, but income is more

analysis of incomes based on the Retirement History Survey, a longitudinal

study of approximately 11,000 individuals [Hurd and Shoven 19831. In 1968

when the respondents were 58 to 63 years of age and most were still in the

labor force, the wealthiest 10 percent of the sample had a mean income of

$65,363 (all figures in 1982 dollars), while the poorest 10 percent received

only   $1,838.   By 1978, however, at ages 68 to 73, with most of the sample

in retirement, the mean income of the wealthiest 10 percent had fallen to

$52,117 while the poorest 10 percent showed a rise in income to $4,070. The

principal reason for the narrowing of inequality after 65 is that social

security benefits become more important and labor income less important,

and the former is distributed much more equally than the latter.

         The improvement in the income position of the peer elderly has been

particularly     striking.    As recently as 1970 one out of four persons 65 and

over was below the poverty level, while the proportion among persons under 65

was about one in eight.         In 1982 the proportion was the fame for both age

groups--about    one   in   seven.
                                                   24



         To be sure. money income is only one measure of economic well-being, but

consideration     of   other     factors   tends    to   strengthen   the   impressionthatthe     elderly

are,on average,about as well-off as other age groups.                       For instance,, persons

over 65 are more likely to own a house free and clear of any mortgage. Also,

the elderly receive a disproportionate share of non-cash transfers such as

subsidized housing, transportation, and medical care. Because they are

typically not in the labor force they have more time for home production

activities    such     as    gardening,    repair, and     maintenance;     they   experience    fewer

work-related expenses such as commuting and meals away from home, and they

have the opportunity to move to a less costly area of the country.

           One disadvantage faced by the elderly is the small size of the

typical      household.       In 1980 44 percent of their households had only one

person, and 46 percent had only two.                Small households are usually not as

efficient as larger ones in the use of space, equipment, food, heat, and

light.     The difficulties and disadvantages of doubling up with another older

person in order to gain the economies of a larger household are, however,

apparently      considerable.         Fewer than 2 percent of elderly households include

members who are unrelated, despite efforts by social agencies to encourage

shared    housing.

           Although most of the elderly receive an after-tax income that compares

favorably with what they earned while at work, there is a dramatic change in

the source of income after age 65.                 From ages 25 to 54, earnings account for

more than 90 percent of the total, and between 55 and 64 they still account

for 78 percent of income.              For people over 65, however, earnings provide

only 20 percent.            Social   security   retirement   benefits     are   the   most   important

other source, with capital income such as interest and dividends next in
                                                     25



importance,        followed   by   government      employee   pensions,     private    pensions,    and

public        assistance.

              Does the source of income matter? I think it does. Social security

retirement benefits and other annuity-like income does not flow from assets

which the older person can pass on to children or consume at a pace that he

or she determines.            In an earlier era the aged had less total income relative

to younger people than they do today, but more of it came from farms or small

businesses or bits of real estate that they &.                             Ownership    usually

contributes to a sense of power and control and can affect intra-family

relationships.         A recent analysis of frequency of visits by children to their

elderly parents found that the number of visits was positively related to the

parents'       bequeathable      wealth    (e.g., stocks,     bonds,    bank   accounts,     real   estate),

but     not   to   non-bequeathable       wealth   (e.g., social       security,   private    pensions)

[Bernheim, Shleifer and Summers 19831.                    If seniors today are "doing better

and   feeling      worse," it may in part be because of this loss of control over

their     economic     assets.

possible for most of the elderly to live with their children even though

only a minority of children have elderly parents living with them. For

example,     if each woman has two daughters, and if half of the women survive

into old age, only one daughter in four would have her mother living with

her, even if every one of the survivors were living with a daughter. As

an indication of how longer life expectancy and falling birth rates have

raised     the     mother-to-daughter     ratio, the number of women 65 and over relative

to those 35-44 doubled between 1950 and 1980.

         In addition to these demographic changes, rising               real   income   contributes

to the decrease in the number of mothers who double up with their children

[Michael, Fuchs, and Scott 19801.             Americans of all ages have always put a

high value on autonomy; therefore, the rising income of recent decades and

the particularly rapid rise in, the income of the elderly have made it

possible for an ever higher percentage of them to maintain their own

households,        health   permitting.

           Health is also an important factor in living arrangements. In

earlier times, poor health was often the reason why older men and women

moved in with their children.             At present, poor health often results in a

move to a nursing home.            The number of elderly in nursing homes increased

at an astonishing 7 percent per annum between 1963 and 1977, to a total

of over 1.1 million. On any given day 5 percent of all elderly live in

nursing homes, and between 20 and 25 percent will do so at some point in

their     lives.     Of those who do enter, only one in four returns to a private

or   semiprivate      residence;   one-half   are    transferred   to   another   health   facility

(usually a short-term general hospital), possibly to die or to return to the

nursing    home.
                                                    28


             Why have nursing homes become so important? Rising income, the

increased propensity to live alone, higher                   mother-to-daughter        ratios,   and

higher labor force participation rates by young and middle-aged women are

all part~of       the answer.        There are many more elderly people who need care

and attention, and relatively fewer children who are providing it within

the home.       Public    policy     also   influences   the   decision      because    frequently

nursing home care is paid for by government (57 percent of the total in

1981), but the cost of home care is borne mostly by the family through

out-of-pocket      expenditures      and    the   foregone   earnings   of    the   caregiver.

             Economic and social factors also affect the location and manner

of death.       According to a report from the National Center for Health

Statistics(l982b), 62 percent of deaths of persons 65 and over occur in

a hospital or medical              center, often at great cost.              In some cases the

patient is hospitalized because there is a reasonable chance to postpone the

death through the kinds of medical intervention that are only possible

within   a     hospital   setting.      In other cases, however, the patient is taken

to the hospital to die because public and private insurance pays more fully

than if the dying person is cared for at home. And in still other cases,

there is no one close enough, either geographically or emotionally, to

offer    any    alternative     to    hospitalization.

             The cost of caring for very ill patients can vary enormously,

depending upon the patient and the physician [Garber, Fuchs, Silverman

forthcoming].        In some cases the intensive application of modern technology

can prolong life for one or two months or perhaps even more.                           This type of

decision has traditionally been left to the patient and his or her physician,

but exploding costs may lead to a reexamination of that position. At a

minimum, there will be a search for less costly alternatives, and a closer

examination of the factors that influence such decisions.

A Final Note

            The data presented in this paper and the accompanying discussion are

meant to be suggestive, not definitive.                  Large gaps in our understanding of

the aging process and of the determinants of labor force participation,

health care utilization, and other key variables make it difficult to draw

firm    conclusions.      It may be useful, however, to state explicitly some of

the major themes that are implicit in the preceding pages. Most important

is the need to recognize that the "Medicare problem" reflects the intersection

of two larger sets of issues.           First, there are a range of questions concerning

the elderly in general:          questions     of    retirement    benefits,   age   of    eligibility,

wages and        hours of work, and the like. Second, there are questions concerning
the financing, organization, and delivery of health care for persons of all

ages.      Any Medicare "solution" that fails to consider these larger issues

will probably turn out to be counter-productive.

           Also implicit in this paper is the need to recognize that resources

devoted to the elderly are resources that could be used to help children,

teenagers, minorities, and other groups with special claims to public attention.

To say this is not to deny that there are many elderly who are poor, sick,

lonely,     or    otherwise   disadvantaged.        But the growing political power of the

.elderly suggests the possibility of disproportionate attention to this group

at a time when many small children are neglected or abused, when the schools

are at a low ebb, and when teenage suicide is at epidemic proportions.

Twenty years ago the plight of the elderly was palpable. Today the most

pressing    social    needs   may lie   elsewhere.        The "good society" needs to balance

its efforts, to make hard choices            among       many   worthwhile   objectives.
                                                   30



           These considerations, and the data presented in this paper, lead me

to hazard three inferences that have direct relevance for policy. First,

we need to periodically revise our definition of who is old. One way to do

this is to focus on changes in life expectancy at older ages. For instance,

in 1935 when the age of eligibility for social security retirement benefits

was set at 65, life expectancy at that age was 12.5 years.                    In 1984 the

average    72-year-old   has       that   same   life   expectancy.   From that point of view

it is not unreasonable to say that if 65 marked the entry into old age in 1935,

in 1984 old age begins at 72.

           Second, we need to develop more flexible labor market arrangements

to facilitate the continued labor force participation of older men and

women.     Unless this happens, the ratio of workers to retirees will become

so small as to pose a grave threat to our economy and our society. Simply

passing laws against mandatory retirement and age discrimination will not

solve the problem.           We need to develop more flexibility in hours of work,

in wages (to accommodate              possible age-related declines in productivity),

and in amou'nt      of responsibility (to speed the movement of younger men and

women     into   positions    of    leadership    within    organizations).

            Finally, and this may Prove to be the most difficult task of all,

we need to reach a social consensus concerning what is appropriate care

for the dying. At present the United States spends about one percent of

the gross national product on health care for elderly persons who are in

their last year of life.             This is much more than the nation spends on

institutional care for the mentally ill and the mentally retarded of all

ages, more than private and public expenditures for basic and applied

research in all fields, and more than the total expenditures of all the
                                                      31



private colleges and universities in the country. On the other hand, it

is 1eSS than is spent on alcohol, and not much more than is spent on tobacco.

            HOW much should be spent on care for the 1.3 million elderly persons

who die each year? For most goods and services our society answers this

question by saying "Let the market decide." According to economic theory

the free choice of knowledgeable buyers paying with their own money for

services rendered by competitive suppliers should result in a socially

efficient      allocation     of     resources.      It will not necessarily be a "fair"

allocation, but this problem is supposed to be addressed through redistribution

of   income,    not   direct       subsidization     of    particular    services.

          This free market approach is not likely to work well for the

seriously      ill.   Patients and their families are often under great emotional

stress and they typically have little previous experience with the complex

technical choices that must be made.                   The hospitals and physicians who serve

them often have considerable monopoly power. Furthermore, even in the

absence   of    public    subsidies,      private     insurance    would    push     utilization    beyond

the point where benefits are equal to cost. The problem of distributive

justice   is    not    amenable      to   solution    through     conventional     income      redistribution

methods because the amount society would want to give to an individual would

depend on how much care they needed.                   Some economists would prefer an

indemnification       plan that,provides           old people with additional income when

they become sick and lets them decide how much to spend for medical care.

This plan may be a delight to some theorists, but it would be a nightmare

for most patients and physicians.

            It is possible to nibble at the edges of the problem by providing

more   information       to   patients,    by     fostering    more     competition    among    providers,
                                           32



by financing alternative modes of care for the dying, and by increasing

deductibles   and   co-insurance.   The   fundamental   problem,   however,   will   remain.

One of the biggest challenges facing policy makers for the rest of this

century will be how to strike an appropriate balance between care for the

dying and health services for the rest of the population.
