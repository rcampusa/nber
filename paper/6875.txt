1 Introduction
It is well understood by now that informational externalities may place special demands
on the organization of economic exchange. Simple price-mediated markets will frequently
fail in the presence of asymmetric information. In that case more elaborate contractual
arrangements have to be used as substitutes for the price system. Lately, considerable
e ort has been devoted to the analysis of contracting under incomplete information with the
objective to understand the range of economic institutions that emerge in response to the
failure of the price system.
    The analysis of moral hazard has played a prominent role in this development. Moral           1


hazard problems arise when, for some reason or another, transacting parties cannot contract
contingent on the delivery of the good. For instance, in buying labor services it may be
that the amount of labor supplied is not directly observable, precluding a simple exchange
of wage for labor. As a partial remedy to this problem, an imperfect, mutually observed
signal about the supply of labor can be used as a proxy in the contract. Frequently, output is
taken as such a proxy. The drawback is that output is often in uenced by other factors than
labor input, which induce undesirable risk into the contract. One is therefore faced with
a tradeo between allocating risk associated with incomplete observability and providing
incentives for a proper supply of labor. Gaining insight into this tradeo is important not
only for understanding contracting in the small (e.g. managerial incentive schemes), but also
because it is closely related to the fundamental tension between equity and eciency in the
society as a whole.
    While our understanding of moral hazard has advanced a lot in past years, it is clear
that much work remains. An important question that has received little attention until very
recently concerns the e ect time has on incentives. Intuitively, time should have a bene cial
impact on policing moral hazard, because it permits a longer series of observations and
thereby more accurate inferences about unobservable behavior. This intuition has been made
precise in work by Radner (1981) and Rubinstein (1981), who show that explicit long-term
contracts can be written, which reduce incentive costs to zero when there is no discounting.
Fama (1980) reaches this same conclusion using a conceptually di erent approach. He argues
that market forces alone will frequently remove moral hazard problems, because managers
will be concerned about their reputations in the labor market. Thus, there will be no need
to resolve incentive problems using explicit contracts, since markets already provide ecient
implicit incentive contracts.
  1 For some recent work on moral hazard the reader is referred to Mirrlees (1976), Harris and Raviv (1979),
Holmstrom (1979), Shavell (1979), and Grossman and Hart (1983).

                                                     3
    The purpose of this paper is to investigate in some more detail Fama's rather provocative
but interesting idea that career concerns induce ecient managerial behavior. Since Fama
does not provide an explicit model of moral hazard, I start by formalizing his intuition.
In the rst part of the paper I present a model, based on that in Harris and Holmstrom
(1982), which permits an explicit analysis of the manager's decision to supply labor. Under
some narrow assumptions I show that Fama's conclusion is correct. In general, however, it
is not. Risk-aversion and discounting place obvious limitations on the market's ability to
police incentives adequately. More interesting therefore is my analysis of transient learning
e ects and non-linearities in technology, which both lead to ineciencies even when there is
no discounting and the manager is risk-neutral.
    In the second part of the paper I consider the implications of reputation on managerial
risk-taking. I argue that so far there has been no good explanation for why there should
be an incentive problem with risk-taking in the rst place, although this is clearly perceived
to be an important issue in the real world. Using some simple examples I show then how
a basic incongruity in risk preferences between the manager and the rm arises from the
manager's career concerns. Although I do not analyze how the problem should be resolved
optimally, my analysis opens a new and promising direction for research on this question.
Since managerial risk-taking problems appear speci cally in a dynamic setting, this shows
that, contrary to common intuition, time need not always be a blessing when it comes to
incentive issues. It can create problems as well.

2 Work Incentives
2.1 The Basic Model
I will start by presenting the simplest model of reputation formation, leaving embellishments
for later sections. Consider the following scenario of a manager operating in a competitive
labor market. The manager is endowed with labor, which he sells in the market in exchange
for consumption. No contingent contracts can be made, so we may envision that the manager
is paid for his services in advance. In a one-period world he would have no incentive to work.
The same is true in a multi-period world if there were no uncertainty about the characteristics
of the agent. In order that there be some returns to the manager for good performance, it
must be that present performance acts as information about future performance. Logically,
this requires uncertainty about some characteristic of the manager. It is natural to take this
characteristic to be talent, though many alternatives would do as well.
    Let  be a quali ed measure of the manager's talent and assume initially that it is xed

                                              4
and incompletely known to the manager and the market. The market and the manager share
prior beliefs about ; speci cally, assume that this prior is normally distributed with mean
m and precision (equal to the inverse of the variance) h . Over time, learning about  will
  1                                                                   1

occur through the observation of the manager's output. In period t, this output is given by
the technology:


                                    yt =  + at + t ; t = 1; 2; :::                       (1)
where at 2 [0; 1] is the manager's labor input and t is a stochastic noise term. To be able to
make inferences about  from (1) requires a distribution on t ; I take t 's to be independent
and normally distributed with zero mean and precision h.
   The manager is assumed to be risk neutral with preferences given by an atemporal,
separable utility function:


                                   U (c; a) =
                                              X
                                              1
                                                    t 1 ,   [ct , g(at)]:                  (2)
                                              t=1


Disutility of labor is measured by g(:), which is increasing and convex. It is assumed that
U (:; :) is publicly known.
    In order to decide how much labor to supply, the manager has to calculate the impact
of present output on future wages. On the other hand, the dependence of future wages on
past output is a function of the manager's decision rule. Consequently, the decision rule and
the wage functions are determined simultaneously in equilibrium. In general, this interaction
may be quite complicated, but for the simple technology considered here, an explicit solution
is easily obtained.
    Let yt = (y ; :::; yt) be the history of outputs up to time t. This information is assumed
               1

known to the market and used as a basis for wage payments. Let wt(yt, ) be the wage in
                                                                                1


period t and at (yt, ) be the manager's labor supply in the same period, both functions of
                    1


the history. A competitive market, neutral to risk, will set:


                        wt(yt, ) = E [yt jyt, ] = E [jyt, ] + at (yt, ):
                               1                1                 1         1
                                                                                           (3)
This determines the wage in period t given that the manager's decision rule is known. On

                            fat (:)g t=1

The solution to (4) together with (3) determines equilibrium.
     Notice that even though the market is not able to observe the manager's actions directly,
it is able to infer them by solving (4). Therefore, observing yt will in equilibrium be equivalent
to observing the sequence:


                                      zt   + t = yt , at (yt, );            1
                                                                                                       (5)
where at (yt, ) represents the equilibrium decision rule. Through the observation of the
              1


sequence fzt g the market learns about . In fact, this learning process is well-known given
the normality and independence assumptions. The posterior distributions of  will stay
normal with means and precisions given by:

                                     h t mt + h zt h m + h    t
                                                                 zs
                                                                                    P

                                       ht = ht + h = h + th:
                                           +1                       1                                  (7)
Observe that the mean process fmtg is a random walk with incremental variance that declines
deterministically to zero. In the limit  will become fully known.
   Using (6), (3) can be written as:


                                    wt (yt, ) = mt (zt, ) + at (yt, );
                                            1               1                       1
                                                                                                       (8)
where zt = (z ; :::; zt ). Taking expectations in (8) (with actions xed and non-contingent)
                  1

yields:
  2 Since the manager is risk neutral and no contracts are considered, borrowing and saving can be ignored.

From (9) follows that for a non-stochastic equilibrium path of labor supply the marginal
return to a in period t will be t = h=ht independently of the past. The solution to (4) is
           1

then given by the rst order conditions:


                                            
                                              X
                                              1
                                                   ,
                                                   s t
                                                             = g0(at ):                     (10)
                                        t                s
                                             s=t


     Obviously, t is a declining sequence, and since the sum in (10) converges (because
  s ! 0), t ! 0. Consequently, the equilibrium sequence of labor inputs is declining and

goes asymptotically towards zero as t ! 1.
     The interpretation of this result is straightforward. As long as ability is unknown there are
returns to supplying labor, because output will in uence perceptions about ability. Indeed,
labor is a substitute for ability. By increasing its supply, the manager can potentially bias the
process of inference in his favor. Of course, in equilibrium this will not happen, because the
market will know what e ort level to expect and adjust the output measure accordingly (see
(5)). In other words, the manager cannot fool the market. Yet, he is trapped in supplying
the equilibrium level that is expected of him, because, as in a rat race, a lower supply of
labor will bias the evaluation procedure against him.
     Furthermore, the returns to labor supply are bigger the more there is uncertainty about
ability, as can be seen from (10). Early in the process, when there is less information, the
market puts more weight on the most recent output observation when revising its beliefs
about . Eventually,  is revealed almost completely and new observations will have very
little impact on beliefs. In the limit, therefore, there are no returns to trying to in uence
output and labor supply goes to zero.

2.2 The Stationary Case
The results above, of course, bear little relationship to ecient labor supply. Eciency
would require that at = a for all t, where a is de ned through:




                                                    7
                                          g0(a) = 1:                                     (11)
The problem is that reputation formation is valuable only temporarily. To get a permanent
reputation e ect one must prevent  from becoming fully known. This is accomplished by
assuming that ability is not xed, but uctuates over time. For instance, let ability progress
according to the following process:


                                        t = t + t ;
                                          +1                                             (12)
where t are independent and normally distributed with mean zero and precision h .
   The learning process will change in a slight, but important way. As before,


                                mt = tmt + (1 , t)zt ;
                                   +1                                                    (13)
where


                                         t = h h+t h :                                  (14)
                                               t     


However, ht will be di erent. Let ^ht be the precision on t before observing yt . We
           +1                                                 +1                    +1

have, as before:


                                         h^ t = ht + h:                                 (15)
From (12) follows (by independence):

                                         1 = 1 + 1;
                                        ht
                                         +1  h^ t h
which with (15) gives:



                                               8
                                      ht = h(h+t +hh+)hh :
                                        +1                                                   (16)
                                             t           


Thus, ht will still progress deterministically, but will not go to in nity with t (as before),
because the -shocks keep adding uncertainty. Instead, ht will approach a stationary state h
in which learning through output observations is just enough to o set the periodic increase
in uncertainty from the -shocks.
    It is somewhat easier to express the stationary state in terms of t 's, which, of course, are
in a one-to-one correspondence with ht 's through (14). Simple algebra gives the following
recursion for the t's:


                                      t = 2 + r1,  ;
                                         +1                                                  (17)
                                                    t


where


                                         r  hh =  :
                                                       2

                                                       2
                                                                                             (18)
                                                    


Stationarity requires t = t = . Solving for  from (17) yields:
                        +1




                                                      r1
                                    = 1 + 1 r ,
                                              2        4 r + r:
                                                           2
                                                                                             (19)
Notice that 0 <  < 1. If r = 0, so that  has high variance relative to , then  = 1. In
that case, the updating of mt occurs slowly (see (13)). The reverse holds true if r = 1.
   In terms of , the stationary level of the precision, h, is (using (14) and (19)):

                                                    
                                          h = 1h, :                                     (20)

    This settles the stationary learning process. Next, consider the rami cations on incen-
tives. Following the earlier reasoning, the optimal labor supply, at , is given by:




                                                  9
                                            X
                                            1
                                                     ,[   Y  ] = g0(a):
                                                            s

                            t  (1 , t )                                                   (21)
                                                    s t
                                                                  i   t
                                            s=t+1         i=t+1


In the stationary state s = . Substituting this into (21) implies that the stationary labor
supply, a , satis es:

                                       (1 , ) = g0(a ):                                  (22)
                                       1 , 
Notice that the left-hand side is between 0 and 1, so a < a, the ecient level of labor supply.
From (22) we also reach Fama's major conclusion: if = 1, then g0(a) = 1 , which means
that the stationary state is ecient. It is rather striking that this occurs as soon as we add
any amount of noise in the -process. With = 1, ecient labor supply is independent
of the degree of this noise even though the noiseless case leads to no labor supply as was
shown in the previous section. This discontinuity disappears as soon as < 1. Then a small
variance of t relative to t implies a  close to 1 and a stationary labor supply close to 0.
    The general implications of (22) can be summarized by the following:
Proposition 1 The stationary level of labor supply a is never greater than the ecient
level of labor supply a. It is equal to a if = 1 and 2 ; 2 > 0 . It is closer to a the bigger
is , the higher is 2 and the lower is 2.
    In words, the comparative statics results tell us that reputation will work more e ectively
if the ability process is more stochastic or if the observations on outputs are more accurate.
Both features will speed up learning and move forward the returns from labor investments,
reducing the negative e ects of discounting.

2.3 Transient E ects
Proposition 1 tells us how incentives depend on the discount rate and the degree of noise in
output and ability. Next I will consider incentives before a stationary state is reached. This
involves exploring the convergence to the stationary state, which in itself is important if the
results in the previous section are to be taken seriously.
    Again it is easiest to work with the t's. The dynamics of t is given by (17). From (17)
follows that t is an increasing function of t and from (19) follows that there is exactly
               +1

one stationary state within the interval (0; 1). These facts are recorded in Figure 1.

    From Figure 1 it is seen that if one starts with a value  < , t will converge from     1

below to  and if one starts with  >  , t will converge from above to . The system
                                                    1

is therefore stable. From the de nition of t (eq. (14)) it follows that the stability can be
cast in terms of ht as well. If h < h, ht " h, and if h > h, ht # h .
                                        1                                          1

    The dynamics of at will follow by studying (21). Let me show rst that is a decreasing                 1

by using (17), (18) and the de nition of t . By the inductive hypothesis, bs(:) is decreasing.
Since  is increasing in  by (17), it follows that bs ( ) is decreasing in  . Consequently,
              2                 1                                            +1        1                   1

 1  is decreasing as a function of  .          1

     It follows, by the de nitions of t and t, that,f tg is a decreasing (increasing) sequence
if ftg is an increasing (decreasing) sequence. Recalling then that t " (#) if h < (>)h,                           1

I have established the following stability result.
Proposition 2 The sequence of optimal labor supply fat g will converge monotonically to
the stationary state a . If the initial precision of information about ability, h1 , is less than
the stationary precision level h , the convergence of at is from above. Conversely, h1 > h
implies a " a . t


    The convergence result is illustrated in Figure 2. With the interpretation of  as ability,
it seems clear that h < h is the common case. Normally, we expect that the precision of
                          1

information about ability increases as time goes on. The picture shows that in that case
young people will overinvest in labor supply because the returns from building a reputation
are highest when the market information is most di use.
    This seems to accord nicely with casual empiricism (including introspection). There is
some scienti c evidence as well. Medo and Abraham (1981) conducted a study where they
measured the productivity of di erent age groups in various job categories. Though the
evidence was not overwhelmingly strong, the study pointed towards the fact that young
people are more productive. If one believes that equally able people are, roughly at least,
placed in the same jobs, their ndings imply that young people supply more labor.
    To the extent that convergence to a stationary state is slow, which again will be the case

                                                                12

if output is noisy relative to shocks in ability, the analysis above shows that there may be a
substantial transient ineciency even when there is no discounting.

2.4 Scale Economies
Next I turn to changes in technology. It is clear that the linearity in (1) and (12) is essential
for eciency. To show this in general seems both messy and uninteresting so I will only
discuss the matter via some illuminating examples. To reduce complexity, assume that there
is no noise in the observation of output, i.e., let t  0 . Nothing pathological is introduced
in this way. It merely implies that all returns from labor supply accrue in the next period
since  = 0 . Notice that with the earlier used linear technology, eciency obtains in all
periods in this special case.
    Now, suppose output is given by


                                                         yt = f (t) + at :                                                          (23)
I leave at outside f (:), because then eciency simply requires that at = a in all periods.
Instead of interpreting f (:) as a production function, one can view (23) as a way of making
the learning process non-linear (and output non-symmetrically distributed). Because of this,
there is no a priori reason to assume f (:) is concave.
    Let  be the ability level inferred from the last observation. The manager's wage today
              0

is w = Ef ( ) + a under the assumption that a = a. The question is, will he choose
      1           1                                                          1

a = a? To answer this, the returns from at have to be calculated. They will come from w
 1                                                                                                                                      2

only, since  = 0. For w we have the expression:
                                     2




     w = Ef ( ) + a = Ef (^ +  ) + a = E [f (f , (f ( +  ) + a , a) +  )] + a : (24)

Obviously, this expression will generally di er from 1 as eciency would require. For in-
stance, if f 0(:) is convex (i.e., f 000(:) > 0), then it is strictly greater than 1 (by Jensen's
inequality). Thus (strong) convexity points to oversupply of labor. The reverse holds for
(strong) concavity.
    Another, perhaps more natural, example of non-linearity is the following:


                                           yt = at t :                                     (26)
If g(at) = at , then eciency requires at = t . With this decision rule the marginal returns
           1
           2
               2


to today's e ort can be easily calculated to be t +  . The marginal return from output
                                                     2    2


is, however, t according to (26). Thus there will be overinvestment in labor when ability is
perceived to be high and underinvestment when ability is perceived to be low. Labor input
will vary more than eciency would dictate.
     A third class of cases with inecient outcomes arises when job matching is introduced.
Suppose managers are matched to jobs according to perceived ability. If output is linear
in ability in each task, then optimal matching of persons to tasks will yield overall returns
to ability which are convex (see Rosen (1982) for more on this point). This convexity will
result in proportionately larger returns to labor from reputation than are the actual returns
from production. Since this case is formally very similar to the previous example I omit a
more detailed argument. The idea can perhaps be most easily grasped if we think of the
returns from labor in a pure signaling model of schooling. In that case there is no productive
value from students working hard for better grades. Yet, students do work hard, because of
reputation e ects, even though it is entirely wasteful from a social pint of view.
     The general point illustrated by the examples above, is, of course, that the returns from
signaling need not be closely aligned with the returns to present output, unless the technology
is linear.

2.5 Discussion
Fama has argued that in a dynamic perspective reputation e ects will frequently be sucient
to police moral hazard problems without recourse to explicit output based contracts. The
exercises above were conducted to explore the generality of such a statement. Although
anything but general themselves, they suggest, to me at least, that quite restrictive conditions
have to be imposed to reach eciency.
   The mere observation that a number of factors reduce the eciency of market incentives

                                               15
is of limited interest. After all, there is plenty of empirical evidence that explicit incentive
schemes as well as implicit wage structures are important in the real world. Furthermore,
the most obvious reason for a need to contract has so far gone unmentioned: risk-aversion.
The market incentives discussed above do not protect the manager at all against risk and as
such they are clearly suboptimal.
    Thus, there is little reason to doubt that contracts will play an important part in a fuller
analysis of dynamic moral hazard. The value of the present analysis rests with the faith
that even when contracts are included, some of the qualitative conclusions reached here will
remain true; in particular, that the need for incentives which increase labor supply, is small
in the early stages of a manager's career and in the situations where returns to ability are
convex.

3 Incentives for Risk Taking
Providing work incentives is only part of the managerial incentive problem. To secure proper
behavior in the choice of investments is equally important. Firms frequently express a
concern over the way their management takes risks. Some think their managers take too
much risk; but perhaps more commonly managers, particularly the younger ones, are seen
as overly risk-averse.
    Wilson (1968) and Ross (1973) have addressed the problem of designing reward schemes
which induce correct incentives for risk taking. I would argue, however, that their models
do not capture the essential aspect of the problem. The reason is that in their models an
incentive problem arises only as a consequence of attempts to utilize the manager's risk
absorption capacity. This may be relevant in small, closely held rms. But in a rm of even
modest size or in a publicly held corporation, gains from having the manager carry some
risk are certainly negligible. The apparent solution (in their models at least) is to o er the
manager a constant wage and ask him to act in the rm's best interest. This will yield an
outcome that for all practical purposes is ecient.        3


    Thus in the Wilson-Ross model, there really is no incentive problem in the rst place.
So what can account for the common concern?
    I think a major reason for incongruity in risk preferences stems from the manager's
career concerns. A large part of managerial talent relates to projecting investment returns
                  4



   3 A similar point is made in Ross (1977).
   4 An alternative reason is that work incentives will require that the manager is paid as a function of rm
output and this in turn induces a di erence in preferences for risk. The model by Grossman and Hart (1983)
can formally account for this possibility, but they do not explore the consequences of such incongruity.

                                                    16
and choosing the good prospects. If talent is not fully known, investment decisions become
tests that provide information about talent. Perceptions about talent, in turn, determine
the manager's future opportunity wage and this is what makes investments risky from the
manager's perspective even if income is not explicitly tied to pro ts. The solution suggested
for the Wilson-Ross model (a constant income) is not feasible, because a manager whose
ability is perceived high will be bid away (see Harris and Holmstrom (1982)). I will elaborate
on this idea in two examples below.

3.1 An Incongruity in Risk Preferences
Consider a manager who is in charge of choosing investment projects for a risk-neutral rm.
He may be either talented or not. Talent is associated with the likelihood that investments
are successful. Presently, the probability that he is talented is assessed to be by the rm as
well as the manager.
    Investments can either fail or succeed. Let y, be the payo if a project fails and y if it          +

succeeds. The likelihood that a project succeeds is lT if the manager is talented and lN if he
is not. Obviously, lT > lN . The overall probability of success is then:


                                          p = lT  + lN (1 , ):                                           (27)
    In this set-up, investment projects are characterized by the vector I = (y ; y,; lT ; lN ) (or
                                                                                           +

equivalently by the vector (y ; y,; lT ; p)). The pool of potential projects is a collection of
                                   +

such I 's. The manager's expertise lies in observing this pool while others do not.
    From the pool the manager will choose at most one project and propose it for investment.                  5


Such a proposal involves presenting the information I in a veri able way to his superiors
who will make the nal decision. Thus, potential incentive problems are not associated
with misrepresenting information about a proposed project, but with the possibility that
the proposed project is not the best available alternative from the rm's perspective.
    I now show that hiding information will indeed be a problem. Let  (,) be the prob-
                                                                                      +

ability that the manager is talented given that the investment succeeds (fails). By Bayes'
rule:
   5 Assuming that at most one project is selected is without loss of generality if y, and y+ are the same for
all projects (and in a more general model with arbitrary investment outcomes).




                                                     17
                                               = lTp
                                               +


                                                                                                   (28)
                                          , = (11,,lTp)

The manager's opportunity wage will be a function of the updated assessments above. What
the exact relationship is depends on the exact speci cation of the investment pool. Shortly,
I will examine a case where the opportunity wage is linear in , so let me proceed with this
assumption. Without loss of generality, (28) then coincides with the payo for the manager.
The expected value of the manager's risk is therefore:


                                  p lTp + (1 , p) (11,,lTp) = :                                 (29)

The fact that the expected value coincides with the prior probability of talent is actually
more general. Since the manager's lottery forms a martingale with respect to beliefs, it will
be true whenever payo s are linear functions of the posteriors.
    If the manager is risk-neutral he is indi erent between all projects. He can therefore
be expected to propose the project which the rm prefers most. For a risk-averse manager
things are di erent. The expected return from undertaking an investment is no higher than
abstaining from investments altogether. Since investing carries risk it is then clear that
the manager would not like to invest at all. He will have an incentive to claim that no
worthwhile investment opportunity was present in the pool of potential investments. Under
the informational assumptions made, such a claim cannot be invalidated.
    The analysis above shows that career concerns induce a genuine incongruity in risk pref-
erences between the rm and the manager. To emphasize this point, notice that the risk
facing the manager is quite di erent from the risk that is of concern to the rm. A key
variable for the manager is the likelihood of success lT . The manager dislikes investments,
which will reveal accurately whether he is a talented manager or not, since these investments
make his income most risky. He prefers investments which leave him protected by exogenous
reasons for investment failure. The rm, however, has no interest in lT given p. Instead,    6


it is mainly concerned with the actual payo s (y,; y ) of the project and these again are
                                                            +


  6 This may not be generally true if the rm nds value in learning the manager's ability for purposes of
placement.

                                                   18
irrelevant for the manager.
    Evidently, the manager has to be given some stake in the real outcome if preferences
are to be brought closer together. Giving him a share of the rm may not be the best
strategy, however, since it carries both downside and upside risk. A stock option could be
a more valuable incentive, since it removes the downside risk. This would be an interesting
conclusion in view of the prominent role options have played in managerial incentive plans,
but veri cation of its validity has to await a more careful analysis.

3.2 A \Lemons" Problem
My nal example, an elaboration on the previous one, illustrates that if the manager cannot
communicate investment risks in a veri able way incentive problems get even more severe.
    Let the investment pool consist of only one project. The project characteristics are
I = (,1; +1; s; ). The manager's only private information is the likelihood lT = s that the
                1
                2

project succeeds if he is talented. One can view s as a signal about the likelihood of success,
which is relevant only if the manager has talent. From the rm's point of view, the manager
should invest if s  , since the expected value, conditional on s, is (2s , 1).
                     1
                     2

    The rm does not know what s is, but assesses a uniform distribution to it. Ex ante,
the value of the manager (i.e., his information) is then easily seen to be . If the manager
                                                                           1
                                                                           4

only lives for two periods, then no incentive problems arise in the second period and his
opportunity wage will be 0, where 0 is the revised talent assessment.
                          1
                          4

    The posterior beliefs about talent will depend on the manager's decision rule. Suppose
beliefs are updated under the assumption that the manager invests if z  2s , 1 > 0. The
posteriors on his talent will then be:


                                           = 2 3+ 
                                           +


                                                                                          (30)
                                          , = 2 ,  :

Of course, if no investment is made the posterior is 0 = . Will a risk neutral manager
actually use z  0 as his investment criterion? Simple algebra shows that he will invest if

                                 1
                                     (1 , z) (1 + z)
                                               3
                                 2
                                      2,
                                             + 2
                                               2+
                                                       > 1:                               (31)

                                               19
    The left-hand side is increasing in z and the value at z = 0 is less than 1 (for  6= 0; 1).
Consequently, the manager will use as his cuto rate some z > 0. Thus, if a risk neutral
manager is rewarded according to expected marginal product, computed based on the rule
to invest if z  0, he will not conform to this rule. He will take less risk, because of a concern
for the negative talent evaluation that follows upon failure. More speci cally, he realizes that
the rm will update beliefs about talent conditional on the general knowledge that fz > 0g
obtained (since an investment was made), which puts him in an unfavorable position if z is
actually close to 0.
    It is natural to ask whether there is another cuto value z such that the manager wants
to invest exactly when z > z given that he is paid his expected product in the second period
and given that this expected product is calculated based on the updating rules that apply
when z > z is the investment rule of the manager?
    The updating rules for talent, conditional on investment when z > z , are:


                                        = 2+(3++zz
                                        +
                                                    ) ;

                                                                                             (32)
                                       , = 2,(1,,zz
                                                     ) :

   On the other hand the manager invests whenever z is such that:


                                 (1 + z) + ,(1 , z)  2:
                                 +                                                           (33)
   Combining (32) and (33) gives the equilibrium condition for z :

                            (3 + z )(1 + z ) + (1 , z )(1 , z) = 2:                        (34)
                               2 +  + z          2 ,  , z
    Equation (34) can be shown to have no other solution in (,1; +1) than z = 1. As in
Akerlof's (1970) \lemons" model, the only equilibrium is the degenerate one where no in-
vestments are made. Thus, if the manager cannot have his investment information validated
it makes him more conservative. Even a risk neutral manager acts as if he is risk averse in
this example.


                                               20
3.3 Discussion
There are a number of reasons why the incentive problems described above may not be as
severe as stated. For the same reasons as in Section 2.4, it could be that payo s are convex
in talent, reducing the aversion to risk-taking. The manager may also know more about his
talent than the rm. An undervalued manager would then be willing to take risk in order
to prove himself implying that risk-taking in itself would be a signal of talent. The same
would be true if talented managers would receive higher signals on average than less talented
managers.
    Indeed, possibilities like these suggest a rich agenda for future research and indicate that
modeling risk-taking from a dynamic perspective is a fruitful approach. I note in passing
that such models may also help us understand the puzzle why investment procedures in rms
are so detailed and centralized. As the latter example showed, it may have as much to do
with securing a proper evaluation of managerial talent as it has to do with controlling what
projects get selected.

4 Concluding Remarks
This paper has explored some rami cations of the thesis that managerial incentive problems
are closely tied to learning about managerial ability. It implies a dynamic perspective on
incentive issues. The paper has raised rather than answered questions, but the awareness of
issues is a rst and important step towards resolving problems.
    Regarding work incentives I conclude that one can certainly not make any sweeping
arguments about moral hazard problems disappearing in the long-run. Contracts will clearly
play an important role still. The relevant question to address then is whether the insights
we have gained from studying one-period models will be signi cantly changed when looking
at multi-period models. This of course, will require an explicit dynamic of contracting.
    Regarding investment incentives, I note that dynamics is what seems to raise the problem
in the rst place, so in this case time appears to hurt rather than help reduce incentive
costs. Perhaps this is the most interesting aspect of dynamics in the context of managerial
incentives.
