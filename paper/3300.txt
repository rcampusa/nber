 PREMATURE LIBERALIZATION, INCOMPLETE STABILIZATION: THE OZAL DECADE IN TURKEY


                                   ABSTRACT

     In late 1979, Turkeystood in the throes of a foreign exchange crisis.
with widespread shortages, negative growth, and inflation into triple digits.
A decade later, Turkey has a comfortable balance-of-payments situation, and
sits atop considerable foreign exchange reserves. The economy has achieved a
remarkable transformation from an inward-oriented outlook to an outward-
oriented one. Yet, after some success in the early 1980s, inflation remains
unconquered and the public sector budget is out of control.
     This paper provides an interpretation of the Turkish experience in the
1980s. It is argued that foreign capital inflows in the early 1980s cushioned
the fiscal squeeze, and allowed a relatively painless reduction in inflation
alongside a process of export-oriented growth. In the best of all possible
worlds, the outward-oriented reforms would have taken sufficient root by the
mid-l980s to allow the public sector to undertake the delayed retrenchment as
the inflows came to an end, at no great cost to output. Instead, policy
followed a mix of liberalization with patronage politics detrimental to
monetary discipline. Financial liberalization reduced demand for base money
at the same time that fiscal balances came under increasing strain due to the
external transfer. Inflation was rekindled under the dual influence of fiscal
deficits and a shrinking base for the inflation tax.

1. Introduction

In late 1979, Turkey stood in the throes of a foreign exchange crisis, with

widespread shortages, negative growth, and inflation into triple digits. A

decade later, Turkey had a comfortable balance-of-payments position and sat

atop considerable amounts of foreign reserves. Exports and foreign exchange

receipts from tourism and other services were buoyant. The economy had

achieved a remarkable transformation from an inward-oriented outlook to an

outward-oriented one, and had undergone significant liberalization in the

areas of trade and finance.

     However, there remain some disturbing similarities with the late 1970s.

Despite a favorable external terms of trade, inflation is around 70 percent

and the public sector budget is out of control. While not as severe, a

recession grips Turkish industry. Perhaps most ominous, labor and business

groups alike have lost much of their confidence   in the ability of the

government to set things straight. A round of further trade and foreign-

exchange liberalization launched in the summer of 1989, and billed as the

government's new weapon against inflation, has alienated all but the rentier

groups and has had scarcely any effect on prices.

     In evaluating the Turkish experience of the 1980s, one has to   confront

 the apparent paradox of a tremendously successful external adjustment pitted

against severe internal imbalances. As is by now well recognized, dealing

with a debt crisis of the sort that Turkey was subjected to in the late 1970s

 requires two sorts of adjustment: an external adjustment entailing a net

 transfer of resources from the domestic economy to foreign creditors.    and an

 internal adjustment entailing a net transfer of resources from domestic
                                                                               2


residents to the public sector (which holds the external debt). Turkey was

considerably more successful on the former front than on the latter. As we

shall see, Turkey's inflation experience can be expained in large part by the

needs of public finance: public sector deficits haave been financed at the

margin by the inflation tax.

     Two aspects of the Turkish stabilization of the 1980s pose puzzles.

First, how was the initial reduction of inflation in 1981-82 accomplished at

no apparent cost to growth, and, in fact, at a time when growth picked up

considerably? Second, what accounts for the persistence of inflation and the

two jumps in its level in 1983-84 and 1987-88? The account that follows will

focus on these puzzles. Some remaining structural problems and policy

dilemmas are discussed at the end of the paper.



2. Background

Turkey's economic troubles date back to 1977, when a public-sector-led

investment boom collapsed as a consequence of a foreign exchange crisis. By

1978, Turkey had found herself mired in a severe debt crisis and an extended

series of negotiations with foreign creditors, for whom this would prove a

dress rehearsal for the more generalized outbreak of 1982. After two years of

muddling through, Turkey showed some signs of successful adjustment in the

first half of 1980s. But more than ten years after the crisis, Turkey is

deeper in debt and macroeconomic stability remains elusive.

     The reasons for Turkey's debt crisis of 1977 were essentially twofold.

First, expansionary fiscal policy in the wake of the first oil shock wreaked

its usual havoc on macroeconomic balances, at a time when restraint would have

been the more prudent policy. As Table 1 shows, public investment rose from

7.0 percent of GNP (in 1973) to 13.1 percent (in 1977), while di. 'tic savings
                                                                                3


stagnated.   The counterpart in the external balances was a turnaround from a

surplus of 2.2 percent on the current account to a deficit of 6.9 percent.

Yet the crisis could have been averted, or at least postponed, if the foreign

borrowing strategy in place had not been inherently destabilizing. After

1975, a major part of foreign inflows were attracted under the infamous

convertible Turkish lira deposits (CTLD) scheme. The scheme provided a public

exchange-rate guarantee to private borrowers, effectively ensuring that the

latter would pay Swiss or German interest rates on loans denominated in

Turkish liras, irrespective of Turkish inflation or devaluation. The mad

scramble for foreign borrowing lasted for about two years, until foreign banks

refused to roll over credits and the Turkish government ran out of foreign

reserves. By the end of 1977, the implicit subsidy on foreign borrowing was

costing the government on the order of 2 percent of GNP, and would rise even

farther as the subsequent, large devaluations entailed even greater capital

losses on the CTLD debt.1

                               PLACE TABLE I HERE

     Between mid-1977 and early 1980, a string of weak governments was unable

to arrest the deterioration of the economy. Two IMF stand-bys ended in

failure. The foreign exchange constraint led to shortages, which, together

with excess liquidity, resulted in rising inflation, reaching 120 percent

(annual) in early 1980. Nominal devaluations lagged behind domestic prices,

leading to real appreciation (see Figure 1). One positive outcome in this

period was a substantial restructuring of the external debt, including the

bulk of the CTLDs which were consolidated and converted into long-term

liabilities. A summary of this restructuring and th. political events

surrounding it is provided in Celasun and Rodrik (1989, chap. 9).

                              PLACE FIGURE 1 HERE
3. Early Results of the 1980 Stabilization

In January 1980, a clear break with the half-hearted measures of the past was

signalled by an economic package that went considerably beyond those that had

recently been undertaken. The package included a large devaluation (from TL

47.1 to TL 70 to the US$), export subsidies, an increase in interest rates,

and substantial price increases for state enterprise products and the promise

of abolition of most government subsidies. Perhaps more important than the

specific measures was the clear enunciation of a new approach favoring

exports, outward orientation, and liberalization. The program was the

handiwork of Turgut Ozal, the undersecretary to the prime minister in the

minority government of Demirel that had taken over in late   1979. So closely

was 8zal identified with the "January 24 package" that when the military

took over in a bloodless coup in September 1980 (in response to   the increase

in political violence) he was asked to continue overseeing the economy.

     With the exception of a 16-month interregnum in 1982-83,   8zal has

indeed remained at the helm. He became prime minister after the November,

1983 elections, following which he launched a second round of measures     aimed

at deepening the process of outward orientation.    These included a substantial

 import liberalization and a relaxation of controls on the capital account of

 the balance of payments. Domestic residents were allowed to establish foreign

 currency deposit accounts with domestic banks. The import liberalization has

 since suffered some setbacks, as revenue and protection requirements    have

 forced the government to impose and manipulate some highly discretionary

 specific import duties. Similar setbacks have occurred in financial

 liberalization, as interest-rate controls have alternately been lifted and re-

 imposed in response to financial crises.    After a long delay, the process of
                                                                                5

privatizing    state-owned enterprises was also launched in late 1988. In

November, 1989, and after having lost much popular ground in the general and

local elections of 1987 and 1989, respectively, Ôzal had himself elevated to

the presidency by a reluctant Parliament. The economic transformation that

Turkey underwent under his guidance identifies the 1980s quite clearly as the

Ozal decade.

     8zal's policies hinged on an exceptional restructuring of key relative

prices within the economy. The real value of the Turkish lira was kept on a

downward path, with a daily crawl on a PPP-plus basis. The initial real

devaluation of January, 1980 was therefore not only maintained but steadily

reinforced. Second, the weakness of labor unions in the aftermath of the

September 1980 coup was used to entrench (and exacerbate) the reduction in

real wages that had taken place in the preceding inflationary period. While

wage repression may not have been a direct policy goal, it facilitated

stabilization by taking cost pressures off the private and public sectors.

The considerable flexibility exhibited by the real exchange rate and of real

wages in the 1980s is a critical component of the account that follows.

     From the very beginning, 8zal put heavy emphasis on output recovery

alongside stabilization. The two prongs of the growth strategy in the early

1980s were public investment and export encouragement. As Table 2 shows, in

the first few years of the program, public investment took an uncharacteristic

turn for a stabilization episode: it rose by 2 to 3 percentage points of GNP.

Moreover, the structure of public investment was shifted away from

manufacturing (which might have simply crowded out private investment) and

towards infrastructure (which is possibly complementary to private capital).2

On the export side, the encouragement took several forms. First, as mentioned

above, the exchange rate was maintained on a depreciating path, with an
                                                                                6

implicit PPP-plus rule to provide a healthy margin of competitiveness to

domestic producers. Figure 1 shows the steady real depreciation of the

Turkish lira after 1980, an experience which has no parallel in modern Turkish

history. 3y 1988, the real lira had depreciated by more than 100 percent

relative to its level in 1979. Second, exporters were provided with a

dazzling array of subsidies, including credit at sub-market rates and tax

"rebates" only loosely linked to actual tax payments. The ad-valorem

equivalent of these subsidies amounted to 20-25 percent in the early 1980s,

with some reduction after 1984 (see Milanovic, 1986, Table VII.4).

                                 PLACE TABLE 2 HERE

      Exports responded quickly and, one would guess, beyond the wildest dreams

of Ozal himself. Jithin two years, exports had doubled (from $2.3 billion

in 1979 to $4.7 billion in 1981), and their value stood at $8 billion dollars

by 1985 (Table 2). Despite widespread allegations (and evidence) of

overinvoicing, the trend increase in exports remains spectacular even when one

adjusts for the "fictitious" component,3 and continues to baffle skeptics.

Thanks to exports and public investment, growth also recovered quickly. After

two   years   of negative growth in 1979-80, the Turkish economy settled on a

growth rate of 4-5 percent, with occasional dips and overshoots (see Table 2).

      As Table 2 shows, the stabilization program was successful in bringing

inflation down from its peak of 107 percent in 1980 to the more reasonable

level of 25 percent in 1982. In 1980, Turkey was still an economy with few

sources of inflationary inertia: real wages had proved flexible downwards in

1978.79, and they did even more so with the military at the helm. The trick

in bringing inflation down then was aggregate demand restraint, of which a

healthy dose was applied in 1980-82. As we shall see below, despite the rise

in public investment, the adjustment in public enterprise prices, real wage
                                                                                  7

cuts,   and output recovery allowed the public sector deficit to come down from

10 percent (of GNP) in 1980 to 5.4 percent and 6.0 percent in 1981 and 1982,

respectively. Konetary restraint took the form mainly of increases in

interest rates. With the liberalization of bank deposit rates in mid-1980,

depositors began to face something they were unaccustomed to: positive real

interest rates. Demand for broad money increased considerably as a result,

with the M2/GNP ratio rising from 15 percent in 1980 to 23 percent in 1982

(see Figure 5 below). This re-monetization of the economy played a crucial

role in controlling inflation, leading Rü$dfl Saracoglu, current Central

Bank governor, to comment that "interest rate policy ... was perhaps the

single most important factor in lowering the rate of inflation" (Saracoglu

1987). But other changes in relative prices also helped by reducing aggregate

demand: real wage cuts, deterioration in agriculture's terms of trade (as

price support programs were dc-emphasized), and public sector price increases

all implied a transfer of real income from the private to the public sector,

with a corresponding cutback in expenditures by the former and the deficits of

the latter (Celasun and Rodrik 1989).

        What then allowed Turkey to bring inflation down in such a short time,

and in the context of a growing economy, where so many other countries have

failed? Part of the answer necessarily has to do with the single-minded

dedication with which sharp changes in relative prices (exchange rates,

interest rates, public-sector prices, real wages) were imposed on a society

 rendered temporarily docile by military rule. These relative-price changes

were the counterpart to the fiscal and monetary contraction of 1980-82, as

 they allowed the public sector deficit to be cut and private absorption to be

reduced. And the military's role was not altogether malicious: the

alleviation of the intense cycle of political violence th.'r had prevailed
                                                                                   8


prior to September 1980 endowed the new regime with an initial period of

goodwill and public confidence. This breathing spell allowed Ozal to

implement a set of radical policies which would have been unimaginable in

normal times.

     But a large part of the answer has to do with the external balance.

Compared to other countries going through their crises after 1982, the Turkish

government was initially granted exceptionally favorable terms on the external

debt front. The foreign exchange constaint was alleviated practically

overnight in 1980, not only because of the government's policies, but also

because of generous inflows from official and multilateral sources. The

Turkish public sector consequently never experienced a sharp turnaround in net

resource transfers from abroad, and therefore had less need for inflationary

finance at home.

     Tables 3 and 4 show the net resource transfers (NRT) to Turkey during

the 1980s. In Table 4, estimates of the breakdown of the total NRT between

the public and private sectors are provided; due to the nature of the

assumptions made in calculating this breakdown, these numbers are less

reliable than the aggregate figures shown in Table 3. Nonetheless,

interesting conclusions emerge. First, in aggregate it is not really until
                                                                  transfers abroad
1985 that the Turkish economy starts to generate net resource

of any sizable magnitude; there are large net inflows especially in the first

 two years of the adjustment program. Note that 1985 comes five years after

 the start of the adjustment program, and eigtt years after the initial debt

 crisis. Other heavily-indebted countries did not have this luxury;     as   Table

 shows, they were forced to generate a NRT   of   4-5 percent (of GNP) almost as

 soon as their debt crisis hit in 1982.

                           PLACE TABLES 3 AND 4 HERE
                                                                                9


     Since the relationship between external debt service and domestic

inflation is intermediated by the public-sector budget, of more interest is

the RT undertaken by the public sector. Here, Table 4 shows a picture that

is once again quite favorable, especially in the early years of adjustment.

It is only in 1983 that the Turkish public sector first makes a positive NRT,

and the magnitudes thereafter are not particularly large. Over the 1980-87

period as a whole, the public sector is a net recipient of NRT from abroad (of

0.1. percent of GNP).

     We see now the key difference with other highly-indebted countries.

These countries had to substitute inflationary finance for external finance

when their debt crisis hit. In Turkey, this was also the case initially in

1978-79. But from early 1980 on, the za1 program coincided with an

alleviation of the external finance constraint. The requisite squeeze on

fiscal balances was correspondingly smaller, and the resort to the inflation

tax less pronounced. I will return to the budget-inflation nexus later on.

     What then accounts for the fact that Turkey was provided, in Lance

Taylor's (1990) words, a "long leash" by international finance institutions in

the early 1980s? Here the story once again gets political. Around 1979-80,

Turkey's geopolitical importance to the Western alliance was highlighted by a

series of crises: the Turkish threat to move closer to the Soviet Union, the

Iranian revolution, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The fragile

political situation within Turkey added to the worries. These prompted a

rescue operation to be launched by the leading OECD countries in early l979.

Turkey consequently became the recipient of medium and long-term loan

commitments in 1979-81 that were on average twice as large as in 1975-78 (the

latter covering mostly the period prior to Turkey's debt crisis, in which

capital was flowing in smoothly), and of public commitments three times as
                                                                               10

large (Celasun and Rodrik, chap. 9). The World Bank extended five consecutive

Structural Adjustment Loans, the largest number ever made to a single country.

The IMF helped out with a three-year stand-by in June 1980, rewarding Turkey

with 625 percent of Turkey's then quota--the largest multiple awarded by the

IMF until then. These flows were facilitated by the obvious re-direction of

economic strategy sought by zal. They were also easier to come up with in

an international environment in which Turkey was the only large country in a

debt crisis. But the significance of Turkey's renewed strategic importance

cannot be underestimated.

     To summarize this section, the fight against inflation was won in 1980-82

with considerable assistance from external creditors. Capital nf1ows from

public sources postponed the need for a drastic fiscal retrenchment and

reduced the recourse to the inflation tax. Some reduction in public deficits

did take place, mainly through relative price changes which benefited the

public sector at the expense of the private sector. Economic activity did not

suffer as the reduction in domestic absorption was counterbalanced by exports,

which received hefty and sustained encouragement.



4. Inflation in the 1980s

As the second column of Table 2 indicates, the success against inflation was

rather short-lived. Figure 2 provides more details on price developments

since 1980. After reaching the low 20s, the inflation rate rose again in

1983, reaching 50-60 percent. In 1985 and 1986, inflation slowed down again,

but only to pick up in 1987. Currently, inflation roams around the 60-70

percent range, a level higher than any since 1980. As the Figure makes clear,

there is some evidence of a political cycle at work. The sharp fall

inflation in late 1980 is, as discussed above, partly associated with ItiLlitary
                                                                                  11

rule.    The acceleration of inflation in 1983 and in 1987 coincides in both

cases with general parliamentary elections.

                                 PLACE FIGURE 2 HERE

        What accounts for   the inability to bring inflation down?   As noted above,

inertial factors were relatively unimportant in the early part of the decade,

and as the large variability of inflation would suggest have not played an

important role since then (with the possible exception of in the last year or

so). This would suggest that the monetization of public sector deficits is

the primary culprit.

                               PLACE TABLES 5 AND 6 HERE

        Tables 5 and 6 provide the relevant data for an analysis of seignorage

and the inflation tax in this period. Seignorage here refers to the revenue

raised by the monetary authorities by issuing non-interest-bearing

liabilities, i.e. base money (MB). On the Central Bank's balance sheet, the

increase in MB is the counterpart to the domestic credit extended by the

Central Bank to the Treasury (and public enterprises), once we regroup net

foreign assets of the Central Bank under public sector foreign borrowing.

Table S shows the computation of the monetary base, while Table 6 calculates

seignorage revenues (as a share of CNP) as given by the increase in MB in a

given year divided by that year's GNP. The inflation tax, in turn, refers to

the increase in nominal (base) money which individuals have to accumulate to

keep their real balances constant (see below). This is also calculated in

Table 6. Since part of money base (required reserves held by commercial

banks) pays interest, the revenues derived by the government by issuing money

should net these payments out, and this is also done in Table 6. The

difference between seignorage and inflation tax arises from changes in real

money demand, which in turn may be the consequence of financial liberalization
                                                                                 12

or changes in the inflation rate, real income, and interest rates. This

difference is sometimes referred to as the non-inflationary component of

seignorage, as it is the increase in money demand that is consistent with a

zero inflation rate.

       As these tables show, the Turkish public sector has consistently relied

on revenues from seignorage and the inflation tax on the order of 1.5-3.0

percent (of GNP), even in the low inflation years. Notice also that high-

inflation periods do not necessarily generate larger seignorage, as the higher

levels of inflation in these periods result in substantial erosion in the real

demand for money and reduce the base of the tax. For example, total

seignorage in 1981 surpassed the level in 1980 even though 1981 had an

inflation rate practically a quarter of that in 1980. A quick comparison of

the annual inflation rates with the consolidated public-sector deficit (the

latter shown in Table 4, col. [1]) will show a broad correlation between the

two.

       Now let us pursue further the logic of the public-finance view of

inflation. Assume that fiscal deficits are financed at the margin purely by

money creation (i.e., seignorage) and that other financing items do not

respond systematically to the deficit. Then the public-sector budget identity

can be expressed as:


(1) d — m(MB/MB),


where d is the deficit-to-GNP ratio, m stands for the share of base money in

GNP, and other financing items are ignored for notational simplicity. In any

given year, let the proportional change in demand for base money (Z4E/MB)

depend on inflation and real income in the following manner: NB/MB —        +   n,
where     is the inflation rate, n is the real growth rate of GNP, and     Is the
                                                                                        13

income elasticity of demand for base money. Then we can re-write (1) as

follows:


(2) d—m(i+pn).

This expression shows the combinations cf m, , and n which are consistent

with an exogenous level of the deficit. Note that m stands for the inflation

tax. Solving for , we get an explicit formula that captures the essence of

the public-finance view of inflation:


(3)   ,r —   (d/m)   -
                         n.
This highlights four important determinants of the inflation rate. First, and

most obviously, is the deficit. An increase in the deficit of one percentage

point of GNP will increase the inflation rate by 1/rn percentage points: given

the Turkish average for m in the l980s of around 0.10, this amounts to a 10

percentage point increase in                  A second important determinant, as this

example already illustrates, is the monetization of the economy, and more

specifically the ratio of base money to GNP. As we shall see, financial

liberalization during the 1980s has resulted in a considerable decline in m,

exacerbating the inflationary conseqence of a given deficit. Finally, real

growth of income and the income elasticity of demand have their predictable

effects on inflation via their effects on money demand.

      Can an equation like (3) explain much of the Turkish inflation in the

1980s? As a purely descriptive exercise, we can estimate a simple regression

of the following form:


(4)          —
                 + a1[(d/m)   -
                                  n]   + E.


Brushing a whole host of econometric and interpretation problems aside and
                                                                               1.4



limiting ourselves to a "naive" public-finance view, we can here think of

as the "trend" or "inertial" inflation rate. The prediction of the public-

finance view of inflation would be that a1 is statistically indistinguishable

from unity. The results of the regression are reported in Table 7, where

different values of    (ranging from 1 to 5) have been tried to generate the

right-hand side variable. Notice that period-average m's have been used here

(by taking the geometric mean of two year-end MB's) to correct for changes in

the level of base money during the relevant year.

                               PLACE TABLE 7 HERE

     The results are quite consistent with the public-finance view.

Regardless of the value of used, the intercept coefficient emerges as

statistically insignificant from zero. This would suggest that whatever

inertial forces may have been at work, they were insufficiently powerful over

the entire period. Moreover, while the point estimate for a1 is always less

than unity, it is statistically significantly different from zero but not

unity. On the basis of this simple-minded test, we cannot reject the

hypothesis of a one-for-one link between public-sector deficits (appropriately

scaled) and inflation. The clear implication is that at the margin deficits

are (nearly) completely monetized. Note also that the regressions do best

with relatively high income elasticities of demand for base money.6 Demand

elasticities of 4 or 5 are too high to be credible. Even if we rule these

cases out, the fiscal view, as captured by this regression equation, appears

to "explain" around 50 percent of the variation in inflation over the 1980s.

                              PLACE FIGURE 3 HERE

     Figure   3 compares the actual inflation rate with the inflation rate

predicted by the above framework. Since a1 is statistically indistinguishable

from unity, the predicted inflation rate is computed simply as    i din) -   nJ,
                                                                                  15

with     fixed at 3.0. We see that the simple-minded public finance view does

an adequate job of capturing some important turning points in inflation: the

sharp reduction in 1981, the increase in 1984, and the jump after 1986. It

does less well in some other respects: the predicted inflation is

significantly higher in 1981 and 1982, and significantly lower in 1984; the

actual inflation rate increases sharply in 1988 whereas the prediction is a

large fall.

       As emphasized above, two key variables that go into the public finance

view of inflation are the public-sector deficit (d) and the base money/GNP

ratio (m). Let us take a closer look at each.



5. Public Sector Balances

Table 8 displays the consolidated public sector accounts during the 1980s. In

Turkey, the two major components are the consolidated government budget and

the accounts of the State Economic Enterprises (SEEs). Since 1984, however,

Ôzal has also created a large number of special funds which disburse money

in a rather discretionary way and are largely beyond the purview of the

parliament. These funds are financed by special earmarked taxes (such as

specific import duties) and borrowing through so-called revenue sharing

certificates, and in aggregate have been running surpluses (see Table 8). The

importance of these funds can be gauged by considering that their revenues

amount to a quarter of the regular budgetary revenues.

                                    PLACE TABLE 8 HERE

       As   Table   8 shows, after an initial decline in 1981, the aggregate public

deficit has hovered around 5-6 percent of GNP during most of the l980s. The

magnitude of this deficit can be put in perspective by noting that this is

just about the same level of deficit that obtained during the pre-crisis, boom
                                                                               1.6



years of 1973-77. The considerably larger deficit of 1980 was in large part

attributable to the impacts of the second oil shock and the contraction of

real activity. Once allowance is made for the special factors that pushed the

1980 deficit up, the magnitude of fiscal adjustment in the 1980s emerges as

hardly exemplary.

     Several forces interacted to limit the magnitude of fiscal retrenchment.

As mentioned above, the presence of generous capital inflows in the initial

years of the program made a drastic retrenchment superfluous. In addition,

the adjustment of income tax brackets (in response to bracket creep) and the

lowering of tax rates in late 1980 led to a reduction in the direct tax intake

in the early l980s: direct taxes fell from 11.7 percent of GNP in 1980 to 6.5

percent in 1985. Some of this loss was made up only later with the

introduction of the value added tax in 1985.

     Third, revenue enhancement on the part of public enterprises relied

almost exclusively on price adjustments rather than on productivity increases,

adjustments which became politically more difficult as time went on. The

available evidence shows no discernible trend in labor productivity of the

SEEs (World Bank, 1988b, pp. 82-84). The price adjustments in turn were

typically delayed and bunched after elections, helping generate the political

inflation cycle displayed earlier in Figure 2. The acceleration of inflation

in late 1987 and early 1988 can be attributed in large part to the effect of

delayed increases in SEE prices (Central Bank 1989).

     The cycle is reinforced by the pressure on the Central Bank to provide

easy credit to popular sectors prior to elections. In 1987, for example, in

the second half of the year "the Central Bank was obliged to increase credits

extended to the public sector significantly, in particular to the Soil

Products Office, and to the state-owned Agricultural Bank, which extends
                                                                                 17

credits   to farmers" in preparation for the November general elections (OECD,

1987-88, p. 38). As John Waterbury has stressed, al's politics has two

faces: on the one hand it aims to enhance econoLlic efficiency and public

sector finances, and on the other it relies on the traditional mechanisms of

"coalition maintenance through state patronage". The first is what "zal

wishes to show the donor community, the EC, and international business"; the

second reflects the side payments he has to make to ensure the dominance of

his center-right coalition (Waterbury 1989, pp. 6-7).

                                PLACE FIGURE 4 HERE

     After 1983, the price of inadequate fiscal adjustment earlier began to be

paid in sharply rising debt-service. By the second half of the l980s,

interest payments on external        internal   debt became a major force pushing

deficits up. As Figure 4 shows, interest payments out of the consolidated

budget rose from one percent of GNP in 1981 to 5 percent in 1988. Interest

payments now amount to about a third of all current expenditures (inclusive of

transfers). Significantly, domestic interest payments have begun to outstrip

payments on the external debt since 1987. This reflects a conscious decision

after 1983 (as the official capital inflows started to slow down) to increase

resort to domestic debt finance as a non-inflationary alternative. Table 9

shows that new public debt issues took off after this date, to the point that

the public sector now completely dominates the capital market. Government

paper is now bought primarily by commercial banks, who can hold it as part of

their liquidity requirement. The bulk of public debt carries a maturity of

one year or less, so new debt is now issued primarily to roll over the old

debt. While the recent acceleration of inflation has pushed the interest

rates on public debt to negative levels in real terms, the real (after-tax)

return on public securities averaged around 10-20 percent in M5-86,
                                                                                18


generally above corresponding rates offered by the private sector (Akyuz

1990).

                                PLACE TABLE 9 HERE

     In Sargent/Wallace-esqUe (1982) fashion, then, earlier bond financing is

now threatening fiscal balances and rendering inflationary finance more

likely. And this in two ways: first, the interest burden adds on to the

deficit, and increases the pressure on the Central Bank to finance the public

sector; second, the presence of a large unindexed debt increases the

temptation to erode it by generating a sudden, unanticipated inflation. Since

maturities are short, however, the room for the latter is limited.



6. Trends in Money Balances

As pointed out above, the re-monetization of the economy played a    crucial role

in reducing inflation in the early 1980s. This can be seen clearly in Figures

5 and 6, which document the sharp increase in M2, both in real terms    and as a

share of GNP, between 1980 and 1983. The primary role was played here by

interest-rate reform, and the corresponding sharp increases in time deposit

rates after 1980. The reduction in inflation reinforced to some extent the

process of re-monetization. In a careful econometric study of money demand in

Turkey, Anand and van Wijnbergen (1988) document the sensitivity of time

 deposits both to nominal interest rates and to expected inflation. Notice

 from Figures 5 and 6 that MB and Ml were rather stagnant in this period,

 suggesting that a considerable portfolio shift from currency and demand

 deposits to time deposits took place as a consequence of the reform.

 Nonetheless, base money held its own    until   1983.

                              PLACE FIGIJRES 5 AND 6 HERE

         It is after 1983 that we see a definite erosion in the ratio of base
                                                                               19


money to GNP. This was a response to the substantial relaxation of foreign

exchange regulations in December 1983. Key in this respect was the decision

to allow residents (and non-residents) to open foreign exchange deposit

accounts in domestic banks, with no restrictions on the use of these funds.

It is hard to underestimate the psychological impact of this reform in a

country where for a long time individuals could be held criminally liable for

possessing even small change in dollarg. Indeed, &zal's aim was to de-

mystify the dollar and the Deutschemark. But the reform also had the

predictable consequence of setting into motion a portfolio diversification

away from domestic money balances and towards foreign currency. By the end of

1986, foreign exchange deposits by residents had grown from zero to almost

half of time deposits, and to 16 percent of the stock of fl financial assets

including government securities (Akyüz 1990, Table 6). Clearly, not all of

the growth in these deposits came at the expense of domestic money. But the

stagnation of (or decline in) the principal monetary ratios after 1983- -and in

the context of falling inflation until 1987- -strongly suggests considerable

substitution. Recent work at the World Bank (1988) uncovers evidence of a

structural shift in the demand for currency and sight deposits after 1983

which shows up mainly as a reduction in income elasticities.

     Indeed, the steady erosion in the base money-to-GNP ratio after 1983

 (Figure 5) is indicative of an on-going process of dollarization (or perhaps

more appropriately, DM-ization), rather than a one-time portfolio

 diversification. This is consistent with experience with dollarization in

 Latin American countries such as Mexico and Peru, where the process tends to

be spread out over time and cumulative (Dornbusch and Reynoso, 1989).      In the

words of Dornbusch and Reynoso, "the shift [into dollar deposits] can he well

 approximated by a combination of a traditional portfolio choice model          on
                                                                               20


relative rates of return and a dynamics that is represented by the logistic

process" (p. 26). In other words, diversification into foreign currency

deposits appears to be subject to a learning curve. A serious implication is

that a return to local-currency assets is no longer guaranteed (or complete)

once the macroeconomic environment stabilizes.

     The reduction in the stock of MB is disturbing from the standpoint of

inflation control for obvious reasons. The inflation cost of the financial

liberalization can be gauged by the following simple exercise. In 1988, the

average stock of MB stood at 6.6 percent of GNP, down from   11.2 percent in

1983. Had the public sector deficit remained constant at its 1983 level of

5.2 percent (of GNP), it follows from equation (3) that the inflation rate

would have been higher in 1988 than in 1983 by 32.3 percentage points on

account of the erosion in MB alone. This amount corresponds roughly to the

actual difference in the inflation rates in the two years, which is not

surprising since the deficit in 1988 was only slightly higher than that in

1983. In other words, the difference in the levels of inflation between the

two years is almost completely accounted for by the de-monetization brought

about by the capital-account liberalization. This would seem a high price foi

de-mystifying foreign exchange.



7. Some Additional Dileiias

Three further areas where policy has confronted serious dilemmas need to be

discussed. These are: (i) exchange rate policy; (ii) investment in

manufactures; and (iii) income distribution.



 a. Exchange-Rate Policy. On the exchange-rate front, the government's policy

until very recently has been to achieve a trend real deprecia i.n, which
                                                                                21

amounts to following a PPP-plus rule. The outcome for the real exchange rate

was shown earlier in Figure 1, and more detail is provided for the     period
since 1983 in Figure 7: an occasional real appreciation aside, the real

exchange rate has indeed steadily depreciated. The policy had an important

signalling effect on top of its direct effect of rendering exporting and

import-substituting more profitable: it clearly distinguisned the Ozal

administration from its predecessors by demonstrating commmitment     to outward-
orientation.

                             PLACE FIGURE 7 HERE

    It is difficult to see why a policy of real depreciation should have

continued to be necessary for almost an entire decade (Rodrik 1990). There

are many costs imposed by continuous (and therefore anticipated) real

depreciations. First, in an economy like Turkey's they tend to depress real

wages. Second, they tend to maintain domestic real interest rates higher than

abroad, thanks to arbitrage. Third, they tend to increase the real burden of

the public sector's external debt, necessitating a larger fiscal retrenchment

than otherwise. Finally, a PPP-style rule threatens to leave the economic

system without a nominal anchor, letting the inflation rate wander.

     Until recently, the Central Bank appears to have weighed these

considerations as less important than that of maintaining (and increasing)

external competitiveness. Since late 1988, the Central Bank has slowed down

the rate of crawl of the Lira. This appears to be linked to the sluggishness

of the inflation response to a considerable weakenening of demand in the

second half of 1988. A current account surplus to the tune of $1.5 billion in

1988 must have also provided some confidence for fighting inflation with the

nominal exchange rate. In any case, during the twelve months following

September 1988 the Turkish Lira has depreciated (in nominal terms) by 33
                                                                                    22

 percent against the dollar and by 23 percent against the DM. Since the

 inflation rate in this period stood at more than 70 percent, a considerable

 real reciation is involved (see the value for 1989:1 in Figure 7).

      Judging by the behavior of market participants, and the absence of a

 substantial premium in the black market, the current path of the nominal

 exchange rate appears sustainable in the short term. But as the Southern Cone

 countries discovered a decade ago, controlling inflation
                                                               via the exchange rate
 is a risky business over the medium- to longer-run. In the absence of a

 sufficient fiscal retrenchment that would be consistent with lower inflation,

 one of two things are likely to happen: (a) continued real appreciation with

 damaging consequences for the export drive and real activity; and (b) a sudden

 collapse of the exchange rate, putting further upward pressure on inflation.

One interpretation of the current Central Bank strategy would be that it is

aimed at achieving indirectly the retrenchment needed by forcing exporters to

agitate in favor of fiscal cuts.



b. Investment in Manufactures. One of the surprising features of the export

boom, which is largely based on manufactures, is the absence of an investment

drive that underlies it. Initially, that was to be expected, as the

industrialization of the 1960s and 1970s had put in place a substantial

manufacturing capacity, which the foreign exchange crisis had rendered idle.

This capacity had been heavily dependent on protected domestic markets, which

explains the substantial realignment of relative prices needed before Turkish

costs could be brought down to world levels. The subsequent export boom

relied on this capacity, leading to such anomalies as the iron and steel
sector- - the epitome of Turkish import-substitution- -
                                                          turning   itself into a

major exporter.
                                                                               23
                             PLACE FIGURE 8 HERE

     As Figure 8 shows, public investment in manufacturing steadily declined

after 1980. This was in line with the redirection of public capital formation

towards areas that do not compete with the private sector, such as

infrastructure. The expectation was that private manufacturing investment

would offset this fall once the economy started growing. Figure 8 shows

clearly that this expectation was not borne out. After a sharp fall during

the crisis years of 1977-80, private manufacturing investment was    very slow to

recover. Between 1980 and 1988 the trend in real capital formation in

manufacturing has been sharply downward in aggregate, and only moderately

upwards for the private sector. The rising trend in overall investment

displayed earlier in Table 1 reflects capital formation in other areas, mainly

housing and to a lesser extent tourism. In 1988, total manufacturing

investment still stood at only two-thirds its level in the peak year of 1977.

     The reasons for this disappointing performance are not entirely clear.

But an important part of the explanation must have to do with the prevailing

atmosphere of macroeconomic instability. As discussed above, both inflation

and the real interest rate have been quite variable, and Conway's (1988) work

demonstrates that manufacturing investment is quite sensitive to uncertainty

in these variables. In addition, the level of real interest rates have tended

to be higher than at any time in recent memory. This discourages investment

not only through its effect on the cost of capital, but also through its

negative impact on the balance sheet of highly leveraged firms. Trade policy

has aggravated the environment of uncertainty'by sending shifting and

contradictory signals: import duties and export subsidies have been frequently

and arbitrarily manipulated. Investors have found refuge 1r rhe comparatively

safe sector of housing, for which there is seemingly insati,,hI demand.
                                                                                 24




c. Income Distribution. No account of the Turkish stabilization experience

would be quite complete without some reference to its distributional

consequences. As we have seen, the early stabilization effort was heavily

based on relative-price adjustments. These adjustments have since been either

frozen, or further continued. The net result has been a regressive

redistribution of income from popular sectors (wage and salary earners and

farmers) to profits, rents, and interest income.

                              PLACE TABLE 10 HERE

     Table 10 shows the extent of the redistribution that has taken place

since the late 1970s, In 1988, the real wage and the agricultural terms of

trade both stood at barely over half their levels of 1973; aggregate per

capita income meanwhile had increased by more than a third. This has gone

alongside a rather striking realignment of factor shares in national income.

Agriculture's share has fallen from 24 percent (1980) to 16 percent (1988).

The share of wages and salaries has gone down from 27 percent to 14 percent,

Meanwhile, profits, rents, and interest income now constitute 70 percent of

national income, up from 49 percent in 1980. While these nominal factor

shares are no doubt distorted by inflation- -   only   a small part of the interest

payments represent real income gains to asset holders- -     they do reflect a
dismal reality with respect to distribution (see Boratav, 1990, and ztuucur,

1989, for more detailed information).

     While income distribution is important in its own right, it also has

implications for the likelihood of successful adjustment in the near future.

Fiscal retrenchment becomes more difficult when major popular sectors already

feel that they have paid more than their due. The pressure prior to elections

to direct resources toward rural areas has already been rnted. Public sector
                                                                               25

wage settlements have also come under similar pressures recently. It is

difficult to be optimistic about the capacity of the Turkish political system

to deliver the kind of social contract that will be teeded to conquer

inflation once and for all.



8.   Concluding Remarks
The early timing of her debt crisis, along with the geopolitical conjuncture,
provided Turkey with an opportunity in the early 1980s that no other large
country   has had the benefit of. Foreign capital inflows in these early years

cushioned the fiscal squeeze, and allowed a relatively painless reduction in

inflation at the same time that a process of export-oriented growth was

launched. The export expansion was in turn enabled by the temporary

suspension of normal politics, which allowed a substantial restructuring of

relative prices with scarcely any opposition. The capital inflows and the

military interregnum were, of course, not to last. In the best of all

possible worlds, the outward-oriented reforms would have taken sufficient root

by the mid-1980s to allow the public sector to undertake the delayed

retrenchment at no great cost to output.

      The Ozal government that took power in November 1983 instead pursued a

curious mix of liberalization with patronage politics. On the one hand, a

substantial amount of trade and financial liberalization was undertaken. As I

have argued above, the financial liberalization itself proved rather

disastrous for inflation and macroeconomic stability, while the jury remains

out on import liberalization. On the other hand, the scope of government

activity was considerably enlarged via extrabudgetary funds, which could be

used and abused for discretionary purposes. External finance was replaced by

domestic borrowing, at terms highly disadvantageous to the public sector.
                                                                               26

Somewhere down the line, the private sector's confidence in 8zal began to

erode. The low point was reached in August 1989 when, in a desperate move to

control inflation, 8zal reduced import duties on a wide range of consumer

goods. It is now clear that the opportunity afforded by the favorable

conjuncture in the early l980s was missed.

     Aside from the deeper structural problems mentioned at the end of the

paper, inflation remains the unsolved problem of the 1980g. As this paper has

shown, a simple-minded public finance view of inflation does a respectable job

of explaining why inflation has remained high on average, as well as

explaining the timing of its jumps. There is little evidence of systematic

cost-push or inertial influences during most of the 1980g. The experience more

recently, however, suggests that Turkish inflation may be taking on some Latin

American characteristics. For one thing, it has become more difficult to get

labor to accept real wage cuts. Second, inflationary expectations have become

seriously ingrained. Third, the severe squeeze on industrial activity since

the second half of 1988 has brought to the fore cost-push effects:

entrepreneurs react to reductions in demand by wanting to raise their prices

since their average costs rise in recessions. Finally, the feedback between

the exchange rate rule and prices tends to fuel inflation, something that the

current policy of slowing the crawl is attempting to tackle. These factors

may explain why inflation has continued to rise since 1987 despite the

prediction from the public finance view that it would fall (cf. Figure 2).

     Whatever the role of inertial elements, fiscal reform will have to be at

the core of any serious attempt to reduce inflation to reasonable levels. The

large role of interest payments in current expenditu..es does not allow much

room for reduction on the expenditure side (at least in the consolidated

government budget). But the tax intake is still too low (l€ss than a quarter
                                                                                27

of GNP, compared to 40 percent in Europe) relative to expenditures, arid that

is perhaps the area, next to the improvement of the performance of public

enterprises, where substantial gains can be made. There is a large pooi of

unreported income that could be brought into the tax base. With respect to

financial liberalization, unfortunately this cannot be undone: once the genie

of dollarization is out of the bottle, it is impossible to stuff it back in.

This leaves a credible, radical package of fiscal consolidation as the only

solution to continued economic instability. The alternative, as the

experience of the 1980s has demonstrated, is a series of successively higher

inflation plateaus, with accompanying deterioration in the performance of the

economy.

balance of payments, and debt statistics come from the annual reports or
quarterly bulletins of the Central Bank. Data on sectoral saving-investment
balances and the public sector accounts come from the State Planning
Organization, occasionally via the OECD Economic Surveys for Turkey. The real
exchange rate series is calculated as an equally-weighted geometric average of
the bilateral real exchange rates vis-a-vis the U.S. and W. Germany, using
WPI.

Celasun and Rodrik, 1989, chapter 2.

2. See the discussion in Anand, Chhibber, and van Wijnbergen (1990).

3. Overinvoicing results from the overt subsidies mentioned above. Using
partner-country trade statistics, it is possible to put some rough orders of
magnitude on the extent of overinvoicing. My calculations (Rodrik 1988)
suggest an overinvoicing rate of around 11 percent in the 1981-87 period. But
once one allows for the underinvoicing during the later 1970s (on the order of
4 percent), the growth rate of "real" exports is reduced only marginally.

4.  For a more detailed account of the international political background, see
Celasun and Rodrik, 1989, chapter 9.

5. Oni and Ozmucur (1989, p. 63) estimate an OLS regression linking
the inflation rate to the public sector deficit for the 1972-88 period. They
find that a one percentage point increase in the ratio of the deficit to GNP
is associated with a 5.67 percent increase in inflation (with a standard error
of 2.52).

6. The available econometric evidence on the structure of money demand in
Turkey suggests the presence of a structural break in the mid-1980s, with
higher income elasticities earlier than later. See World Bank (1988), Anand
and van Wijnbergen (1988) and Kopits (1987).
