                    Home Ownership Rates of Married Couples:
                           An Econometric Investigation

                                     ABSTRACT


      Ownership patterns for young (under 45) married couples are striking in
two respects. First, ownership rates rise dramatically with age: couples 35-
44 consistently have ownership rates nearly 50 percentage points higher than
couples under 25. Second, half of the sharp ownership gains of young married
couples in the l970s were reversed in the first half of the l980s. These
patterns do not hold either for single or other households or for married
couples over 44.

      To increase understanding of this variability by age and over time, we
analyze the tenure behavior of young married couples using aggregate
income/age—class data from the 1973—83 Annual (American) Housing Surveys (AHS).
The income of a household affects its tenure choice both directly (the taste
for ownership rises with income) and indirectly (the cost of owning declines as
income rises owing to the greater value of investment in a nontaxed asset for
investors in higher tax brackets). Age affects tenure choice because older
households have higher incomes, are less mobile (annual-equivalent transactions
costs are lower), have more wealth (portfolio diversification for owner—
occupiers is easier), and have more certain income (and are thus more willing
to commit to ownership).

      Price and income elasticities for tenure choice are computed, the rise in
ownership rates between 1973 and 1979 and the subsequent decline are
interpreted, and an impact of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 is predicted.

       Home Ownership Rates of Married Couples: An Econometric Analysis

           Donald R. Haurin, Patric H. Hendershott and David C. Ling


      Home ownership by younger married couples varies enormously with age:

the average ownership rate of couples age 35 to 44 has exceeded that of couples

under 25 by roughly 50 percentage points over the past quarter century, far

more than the differences between ownership rates of these two age classes for

single or other households. The ownership rate of married couples under 45 has

also varied markedly over time. During the 1970s, the ownership rate increased

by 9 to 11 percentage points for married couples under age 35 and by 7

percentage points for couples between ages 35 and 64. Half of these increases

were reversed in the l980s for couples under age 45; neither single, other, nor

older married households experienced significant declines.

      To increase understanding of this variability by age and over time, we

analyze the tenure behavior of young (under 45) married couples using aggregate

income/age-class data from the 197 3-83 Annual (American) Housing Surveys (AHS).

The income of a household affects its tenure choice both directly (the taste

for ownership rises with income) and indirectly (the cost of owning declines as

income rises owing to the greater value of investment in a nontaxed asset for

investors in higher tax brackets). Age affects tenure choice because older

households have higher incomes, are less mobile (annual—equivalent transactions

costs are lower) , have more wealth (investment in housing is more easily

diversified), and have more certain income (and are thus more willing to commit

to ownership).

      The paper is divided into five parts. The first is an examination of the

1973-83 Al-IS data on married couple ownership rates by age and income. The

second and third parts present a model for explaining tenure choice and report
                                      —2—




the empiricial estimates. Part IV uses the estimates to interpret the facts on

home ownership and to forecast the likely impact of the Tax Reform Act of 1986

on ownership rates. A short summary concludes the paper.


                          I. The Pattern of Ownership

      The ownership rate for married couples increases with both age and

income. To illustrate this point, we have plotted the ownership rate (from the

AilS) against real income for married households under 25, 25—29, 30—34, 35—44

and 45—64 for 1973 (Figure 1) and 1983 (Figure 2) .   The real income values are

based on midpoints of the nominal income ranges given in the AHS; where the

income range is unlimited (the highest class) , 125% of the lower end of the

range is used. The deflator is the CPI—U Xl (the rental equivalent

experimental measure that became the official method of calculating the CPI in

1983), equal to 1.0 in 1986. Thus the lowest income level plotted in 1973 is

$1500 (midpoint of the 0 to $3000 range) multiplied by 2.324, or $3486. The

1983 nominal income levels are multiplied by 1.095.

      The positive age—ownership relationship is indicated by lower—age

ownership-income curves systematically lying below higher-age curves. In fact,

only a handful of "crossovers" of these curves occurs in the entire ten years

of AilS data. The positive income-ownership relationship is indicated by the

general positive slope of the curves. Here, two persistent exceptions seem to

exist. First, the ownership rate for the lowest income class (sometimes the

lowest two income classes, but still under 10,000 in 1986 dollars) is generally

higher than that for the next income class. This tends to be true for married

households of all ages, although somewhat less so for the youngest age class.

Second, the ownership rate for the youngest married households usually declines

from the second highest income class to the highest income class.
                                         —3—



       The exceptions for the lowest income class are likely due to a

 mismeasurement of income. Some young, low—income married-couple households are

 in school and being temporarily supported by their parents or other relatives

 until the post-graduation increase in income occurs.    Moreover, some low-income
 married households of all ages are temporarily unemployed, either totally or

 partially. In both cases, current income would substantially understate

 permanent or expected future income. At the high income end, very young

 households may have only recently attained this income and thus may not have

 yet adjusted to it (become owners).

       The age-specific ownership rates for married couples for the different

 income ranges are the data to be explained in our econometric investigation.

 The above examination suggests that a number of potential annual data

observations need to be deleted from consideration.     Four types of deletions
are made:

      1. Low income classes are dropped because permanent income is likely
          greatly understated. We delete observations for income under 7,500
          in 1986 dollars, thereby removing the lowest income class in 1973—75
          and 1978 and the lowest two income classes in the other six years.

      2. The open—ended highest income class is dropped because the "mean"
          income, and thus relevant tax rate, of the household is unknown.

      3. Additional income classes above 56,000 in 1986 dollars for married
          couples under 25 are dropped because their incomes may be temporarily
          high and certainly have been only recently attained. This removes
          single additional observations in 1978, 1979, 1981 and 1983 and two
          observations in 1980.

      4. single high-income observations are dropped in 1978 for couples 25—29
          and 30-34 and in 1980 for couples 25-29 because too few observations
            were obtained in the AIlS.

The potential and actual observations (income classes) for each of the years

1973—83 are listed in Table 1. As can be seen, there are 60 total usable

observations for married couples under 25, 64 for those 25-29, 65 for those

30—34, and 66 observations for married couples 35—44.

          Why   do the systematic positive relationships between ownership and both
age and income exist? One explanation is that the annual rental price of

owner—occupied housing is lower for older, higher income households. Older

households are less mobile, on average, and thus the transaction costs of

buying and selling a home and the up-front points and fees paid on a mortgage

are less on an annual—equivalent basis than they are for younger, more mobile

households. Further, higher income households are in higher tax brackets and

thus pay lower after—tax property taxes and mortgage rates (and opportunity

costs on own equity invested in housing). Alternative explanations include

older households being wealthier, and thus less likely to be either "equity" or

"affordability" constrained (or better able to hold a diversified portfolio

with owner—occupied housing in it), and having more certain income streams, and

thus being more willing to commit to the ownership of housing than younger

households are.

          The income/ownership profiles in 1973, 1979 and 1983 are indicated in the

upper part of Table 2 for married couples in four different age classesJ For

1973 and 1983, these data are linear interpolations between the points plotted

in Figures 1 and 2. A similar procedure was used for 1979. As can be seen,

ownership rates for any given age/income household rose between 1973 and 1979

and then declined through 1983. These movements are consistent with changes in

the annual cost of owner housing relative to the cost of rental housing. The

annual costs of owner housing for the married couples considered in the upper

part of Table 2 are listed in the lower part (the computation of the costs is

discussed in the Appendix) .       Between 1973 and 1979, these costs fell by 3/4 to

2½   percentage    points for households with incomes of 22,500 (1986 dollars) to

$60,000. The greater declines at higher incomes reflect greater increases in

tenure choice tax rates; at $60,000, these tax rates rose sharply (0.32 to

0.40) ,    while   at $22,500, the rates actually fell (0.21 to 0.19) •2 Between 1979
                                           —5—




 and 1983, owner costs rose by 6½ to 7 percentage points. While real rents also

declined between 1973 and 1979 and rose between then and 1983, the movements

were much smaller (less than 10 percent). Thus the ratio of costs moved as

owner costs did.

      While    not   shown in Table 2, the variation over time in ownership rates of

married couples above age 44 has.been far less than that of younger married

couples. This is not surprising. Because older households are less mobile and

have greater wealth than younger households, they should be less sensitive to

short run changes in housing costs. For this reason, we restrict our analysis

to married couples under 45.


                                     II. The Model

      We assume that household is level of utility is derived from the

consumption of a composite good x, the flow of housing services h, and a vector

of unobservable preference shifters z that are related to tenure status.       Thus,

         =    U(x1,h1,z').                                                   (1)



Goods x and h are priced in the market at p and           We employ annual rental

costs as the measure of the price of obtaining housing services and denote them

by p for owners and p for renters. The z variables capture aspects of

ownership that affect utility even though the amount of the housing service

flow is held constant.

      Maximization of utility subject to the budget constraint yields a

household's demand equations, and further substitution into the direct utility

function yields the indirect utility function:


          =
              V*(p,    p', y1, z')                                          (2)
                                                            —6—



where j is the state of tenure, j =                       o,r,   and y is the after-tax income of the

household if it rented. A household compares V1 and V and decides whether to

own or rent.

      To develop an estimatable tenure choice equation, we assume that utility

can be represented as:



      V V'' +e1 for j                        o,r.                                               (3)
       J        J            J




The probability of ownership is then:



      o1 =     Prob(V'0 >            r
                                 1.7).                                                          (4)




substituting (3) into (4) yields:


           =   Prob[(e'          -   e')sC(V'*   -    V1*)).                                    (5)




We assume that both e and er have Weibull distributions yielding the familiar

logit form of estimation:



      logit 0           = ln     [o1/(l_o1)] =        V' V*.—
                                                                                                (6)




We further assume that                   has a translog functional form (as used by King,

1980, in his study of tenure choice) and that the impact of the tenure status

utility shifters is linear. Thus,


                    =        +                   +                    +
                        b0       b1ln(p±/y1)          b2ln(p/y1)          b3 [ln(p±/y')]2

                        +                            +
                             b4[ln(p/y')J2               b5ln(   p±/y')ln(          +
                                                                                        b6z.    (7)




Differencing the V±* as required by (6) yields:
                                                                 —7—

                                                                                                   z).   (8)




      In this formulation the natural log of the odds of owning a house is a

function of the cost of owning compared to that of renting, quadratic terms in

these costs, an interaction term composed of the relative cost and income, an

interaction term composed of the relative cost and the price of the composite

good, and the difference between the z variables. This derivation of the form

of the estimating equation imposes a constraint on the regression coefficients

(call them a1 to a5), specifically, a3 =                                   -
                                                                   —2a2        a4.
      Each tenure state generates a particular value for z,, and we hypothesize

that the difference z1 — z1 is a function of real after-tax income and
                     o    r

                                     ,   N
                                             I
                                                 ,   M
                                                         I
                                                             )                                           (9)




where A is the age of household head, N is the number of dependents, and N is

marital status. An example of a "z" variable is "privacy". The amount of

privacy is greater for owners than renters for two reasons. First, rental

premises are subject to inspection by the landlord, and alterations of the

premises are subject to the landlord's approval. Second, and probably more

important, most detached houses are available for ownership, while most

attached units are available for rent.

      One might anticipate that the value of privacy as an owner compared to a

renter differs by age of head, family size, the amount of the household's

income, and marital status. To test this hypothesis, we must control for the
                                        —8—




the estimating equation (8) and run separate regressions by age group. Then we

conduct pooling tests across age categories, thereby determining if the tenure

choice process differs significantly by age of head. We do not have data on

the number of dependents by age and income, but the number of dependents

increases monotonically up to age 44.    (In 1980, the averages for married

couples were: 0.75 for Couples under 25, 1.5 for couples 25—34, and 2.25 for

couples 35-44.) Finally, we limit the empirical analysis to married couples.

      We use real after—tax income of the household if it rented (the tax

saving from housing investment is captured in the owner cost variable) for the

measure of y (deflation is by the CP1-U Xl using 1985 as the base year). The

variable p is measured as the ratio of the nonhousing component of the CPI to

the entire CPI. The computation of owner cost variables follows Hendershott

and Shilling (l982a), with the tax rate calculation based on Hendershott and

Slemrod (1983). In these calculations, the assumed holding period should be

positively associated with age. We use 3 years for households under 25, 5

years for households 25—29 and 30—34, and 7 years for households 35—44. The

real rental cost is the Lowrey (1981) index, equal to 100 in 1977, deflated by

the CPI—U Xl, also equal to 100 in 1977. To convert this series to a

percentage analogous to the owner cost, we first compute the "equilibrium"

rental cost in 1977 (following Hendershott and Shilling), as c. The cost in

other years is then computed as the real rental cost times c. Details on the

cost calculations are contained in the appendix.

      Two and four year lagged responses to increases in owner costs are tested

(with two years mattering but four years not) .   Young married couples are

relatively mobile and thus might be expected to respond fairly rapidly to

declines in the cost of owning; renters have an incentive to switch quickly,

especially if they can lock-in fixed rate mortgage money. However, when the

cost of owning rises, owners with below—market fixed rate money can reasonably
                                            —9-




delay switching to renting. The variables added to the estimation equation (8)

are the difference between the current and lagged values of the natural log of

the price ratio, if postive, or zero. Thus we anticipate positive

coefficients, and the coefficient on the log of the current price ratio is the

long-run response.


                                     III. Estimation

      The empirical estimates are reported in this section, and the results are

interpreted in the next. Three estimates are discussed: the unpooled age-

class equations, pooled estimates with age-varying constant terms, and pooled

estimates with age-varying constant terms and linear income responses.3 The

latter are our preferred estimates.

      Table 3 contains the unpooled age class estimates of equation (8) with

the lagged price ratio term added. All variables are generally significant,

except for the price ratio term lagged four years.4 It is significant for the

youngest age group but insignificant (and with the incorrect sign in two of

three cases) for the other age classes. The adjusted R2s reveal that from

88.6% to 98.4% of the variation is explained. Lastly, the coefficient

restriction (a3 =          —
                    -2a2       a4) implied by the theory is not rejected by the data.
      Table 4 contains estimates for two equations pooled across the four age

classes. In the first equation, separate constant terms are estimated for the

four age classes but all other coefficients are constrained to be identical.

The t—statistics on the constants, which for the three age classes under 35—44

measure the significance of the difference between the constants for these

classes and that for the 35—44 age class, indicate that the differences in

constants are quite significant. Income and price elasticities have been

calculated at the bottom of the table for median income owners in the age

classes in 1973.     We choose 1973 because owner costs were then near their mean

values, being lower in the rest of the 1970s and higher in the 1980s, and real

after-tax incomes changed little over the 1973-83 decade. The income

elasticities decline sharply by age class, from 0.77 to 0.26. The price

elasticities are lower and also decline by age class, in absolute value, from

0.18 to 0.04.

      In the next equation, the income coefficients and the constants are both

allowed to vary by age class. As with the constants, the t-statistics on these

coefficients for age classes under 35—44 indicate the significance of the

difference between the respective coefficients and that for the 35—44 age

class. The coefficients for the two youngest groups are significantly

different from that for the oldest group. This equation suggests lower income

and higher price elasticities, especially for younger households. Using a

Chow-type F test on pooling the data, we find that the age classes cannot be

pooled unless we allow for the constant to vary by age group. We can

confidently pool the data (as in the second equation in Table 4) if we allow

both the constant and the income coefficient to vary with age class. The price

elasticities here are about double those from the first equation, while the

income elasticities are about the same, except for the youngest age group.

      Table 5 provides more detailed information on elasticities implied by the

second equation in Table 4. calculations are presented for the five income

levels used in the estimation for 1973. These incomes and their after—tax

levels in 1985 dollars are listed at the top of the table. Next are the income

and price elasticities followed by the estimated and observed ownership rates

for these income ranges by age class. The income elasticities decline by age

class, especially at high income levels; the elasticities tend to rise with

income for married couples under 30 but decline with income for older married

couples. The price elasticities approach minus unity for low income households
                                        —11—



and decline as incomes rise, reaching zero at before—tax income of about

$60,000. The 1973 data are well explained except for the highest income

married couples, where the equation substantially overpredicts ownership.

      These income elasticities are similar to the 0.47 obtained by Rosen

(1979) in a cross section analysis of families in 1970. However, our price

elasticities are far smaller in absolute value than the —1.4 he reported. Our

elasticities are also smaller than the —0.5 to —1.0 estimates of Hendershott

and Shilling (1982a), who analyzed AIlS data but only over the 1973—79 period.

Hendershott and Shilling did not distinguish an age—class impact, and they did

not allow an income effect. Each of these differences from the present study

likely contributes to their larger estimates. On the other hand, our current

elasticities are similar to the time series estimates of Rosen and Rosen (1980)

and Hendershott and Shilling (1982b).

      Much higher price elasticities estimates can be obtained from our data if

we allow the cross—section data to dominate. This is achieved by deleting the

income shifter, which effectively forces price to capture the positive

ownership—income correlation, and by allowing a four-year lagged response to

increases in the owner cost, which permits a high long-run price elasticity

without requiring a large decline in ownership between 1979 and 1983 (the

increase in owner costs since 1979 need not have an impact until after 1983).

The estimated elasticities for 1973 medium income owners in the four age

classes are —1.7, —1.4, —0.9 and —0.7, five to ten times greater than the —0.35

to -0.1 reported in Table 4. However, the unexplained variance doubles

relative to that of equation (2) in Table 4 due to a major worsening of the

time series fit: 12 percentage point increases in the ownership rate of median

income married couples in our three older age classes are predicted between
                                      —12—



1973 and 1983 versus the near constant observed aggregate ownership rates.6

This suggests caution in using price—elasticity estimates from cross-section

studies to make inferences about time series behavior.


                               IV. Applications

      The empirical estimates are applied in two ways. First, we use them to

interpret the facts about home ownership discussed above, Second, we analyze

the impact of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

An Interpretation

      The empirical estimates from equation (2) in Table 4 can be used to shed

some light on the ownership facts emphasized earlier, namely the sharp increase

in ownership by age class, the rise in ownership between 1973 and 1979, and the

decline in the l980s. The average ownership rates by age class for 1973, 1979

and 1983 are listed in the upper section of Table 6. As can be seen, these

data (from the AIlS) indicate a 22 percentage point rise in ownership between

under-25 married couples and those 25—29, a 17 point further rise by the early

thirties, and another 9 point rise by 35-44. In total, the ownership rate is

almost 50 percentage points higher for married couples 35-44 than for those

under 25. With the exception of a small relative rise in ownership for those

35—44 in the 1980s, the ownership spreads have been constant over the 1973—83

period.

      The lower section of Table 6 contains the after—tax real (1985 dollars)

incomes of the median income married couples in the various age classes for

1973, 1979 and 1983. The incomes are higher for older married couples and have

generally increased slightly over time. The exceptions are an over 4 percent

income decline (between 1979 and 1983) for those under 25 and a 4 percent

income rise for those 35—44 in the same period. The latter increase could

explain the relative rise in ownership between 1979 and 1983 for those 35—44.
                                      —13—



     As we noted earlier, the higher ownership rates for older married couples

are at least partially explained by their higher incomes. Greater income leads

to greater ownership both directly and indirectly through lower owner costs

(higher tenure-choice tax rates). Older households are also less mobile and

thus the transaction costs of purchasing a house and obtaining a mortgage are

less onerous. We have accounted for this by calculating owner costs based on a

3 year holding period for married couples under 25, 5 years for couples 25—34,

and 7 years for couples 35-44. An interesting question, then, is how much of

the observed rise in ownership by married couples across age groups is

explained by these factors and how much by the constant terms in the estimated

equation? To answer this question, we simulated ownership rates for the median

income households in 1973, obtaining differences comparable to those observed

for the age classes (49 percentage point difference between those under 25 and

those 35—44 versus the 47 percentage point difference in Table 6) .   Then the

equation was resimulated setting all constant terms equal to that for the 35—44

age class. We conclude that the economic variables explain about 40 percent of

the difference in ownership across age groups. The other 60 percent is likely

explained by the need to accumulate a downpayment, fewer dependents (and thus

lower taste for ownership) of younger married couples, and, possibly, less

certain incomes.

      Table 7 reports observed changes in ownership rates by age class and

simulated changes in ownership rates for the median income married couples in

the age classes for 1973—79, 1979—83, and the total 1973—83 period. Note that

the simulations are for median income households, not for weighted averages of

households across the income spectrum, an experiment that would be expected to

reflect observed changes more closely. Two sets of simulations are performed

for each period, one with all variables varying and one with only prices

varying (income is held constant). Of the eight sub-period simulations, all
                                      —14—



move in the same direction as the observed change; 60 percent or more of the

observed change is captured in five of the eight cases; and 40 percent is

captured in two others. Only the sharp rise in ownership for the under 25

group in 1973-79 is badly missed. For the full 1973—83 period, the simulations

accurately portray the notable decline in ownership for the youngest married

couples, the relative constancy for couples 25-34, and the rise in ownership of

married couples 35-44.

      The set of simulations that holds income constant implies that the price

variables, not income, explain most of the change in ownership. This is hardly

surprising given the relative constancy of real after-tax income. The one

exception is the full period rise in ownership for married couples 35-44, which

is entirely explained by higher real income.

      Our estimated price elasticities are roughly consistent with earlier

estimates from time series data. The estimates of Hendershott and Shilling

(1982b) suggest about a 6 percentage point increase in the ownership rate in

response to the decline in owner costs between the early 1960s and late l97Os.

Moreover, they interpret the estimates of Rosen and Rosen (1980) as giving a

similar impact. Because half of the 6 point increase should have occurred by

1973, our 2 to 2.7 percent increase in ownership of married couples 25—44

between 1973 and 1979 is of the same order of magnitude as the time series

estimates.

The Impact of the Tax Reform Act of 1986

      The Tax Reform Act of 1986 is well understood to favor ownership over

renting (Hendershott, Follain and Ling, 1987). Owner costs will decline

relative to renter costs, and after—tax income for low and moderate income

households will rise. Here we translate the changes in these costs and incomes

into changes in ownership, using our estimates for the ownership decision.
                                      —15—




      The Tax Act will increase our real after-tax income variable by 2 to 3

percent for married couples under 30 and by 2½ to 3½ percent for married

couples 30-44. The slightly larger percentage for older couples follows from

the assumption of two dependents for older households versus one for younger

(and the substantial increase in the personal exemption) -   These increases are

roughly independent of income throughout the $15,000 to $60,000 range. Given

that average tax rates over these incomes rise from 8 to 25 percent under

pre1986 tax law, the percentage tax cut declines from roughly 25 to 40 percent

at $15,000 (the higher number for married couples with two exemptions) to 7 to

8 percent at $60,000.   (Note that these tax cuts are for renters; owners

experience slight tax increases because the cut in marginal tax rates reduces

the value of their housing deductions.) These average tax cuts exceed those

reported in the press, especially at higher incomes. The press data are

averages for renters and owners; the averages decrease sharply as income rises

because the weight given to owners rises sharply.

      In the absence of a decline in interest rates, the Tax Act will tend to

raise owner costs, owing to the decline in tenure—choice tax rates, but rental

costs will increase even more. With a percentage point decline in interest

rates, owner costs will fall for most households, and the increase in rental

costs will be less. The ratios of owner costs to rental costs for different

income households are largely independent of whether interest rates are

constant or decline by a percentage point, and thus so are the ownership rates.

In our calculations, we draw upon the analysis of Hendershott, Follain and Ling

(1987) which assumes a percentage point decline in interest rates and predicts

a 10 percent increase in rents. With these assumptions, the ratio of owner to

renter costs declines by 10 to 15 percent.
                                        —16—




        Table 8 reports the simulated increases in ownership rates for married

couples in our four age classes for three different before-tax income levels:

15,000, 25,000, and 40,000 (1988 dollars) .    Because the price elasticities

decline with income, the responses are greater for lower income households.

For low income ($15,000) households, the ownership rate rises 2½ to 4

percentage points. By the $40,000 income level, the increase is under a

percentage point, and at the $60,000 income level the response is effectively

zero.

        In 1983, roughly 9 million of the 25 million married couples under 45

had incomes between $10,000 and $25,000. A 2½ percentage point increase in

their ownership rate would increase the number of owners by 225,000. A one

percentage point increase in the rate for the about 7 million married couples

under 45 with incomes between $25,000 and $40,000 would increase owners by

70,000 more. The total 300,000 increase would constitute a 1¼ percentage point

rise in the ownership rate of all married couples under age 45. This increase

will occur over an extended period of time. Hendershott, Follain and Ling

(1987) argue that the rents will rise over a three to eight year period, the

longer adjustment occurring in areas with vacancy rates far above equilibrium

levels. Adding our two year ownership response suggests that the full

ownership effect will take five to ten years.


                                   V. Summary

        Ownership patterns for young (under 45) married couples are striking in

two respects. First, ownership rates rise dramatically with age: couples 35—

44 consistently have ownership rates nearly SO percentage points higher than

couples under 25. Second, half of the sharp ownership gains of young married
                                      —17—




couples in the 1970s were reversed in the first half of the 1980s. These

patterns do not hold either for single or other households or for married

couples over 44.

      According to our estimates, roughly two—fifths of the rise in age-

specific ownership rates from under 25 to 35—44 is attributable to the increase

in income and reduction in mobility associated with age. Both of these changes

reduce the annual cost of ownership (a higher tax bracket favors investment in

a nontaxed asset and a longer holding period lowers annual equivalent

transaction costs). Moreover, the taste for ownership seems to rise with

income. The other three-fifths of the rise in age—specific ownership with age

is likely attributable to the greater wealth (less difficulty in making a down

payment) and larger number of dependents (and resultant greater demand for

privacy) of older married couples.

      Our estimates explain over half of both the increase in ownership rates

of our four age classes between 1973 and 1979 and the decrease between 1979 and

1983. Virtually all of the differences in trend changes in ownership rates

over the full 1973—83 period (2½ percentage point decrease for married couples

under 25 versus 2 percentage point increase for those 35—44) is explained.

Most of the explanation comes from changes in the Cost of owning relative to

renting, although the trend increase in ownership for those 35—44 is due solely

to higher income.

      For young married couples, the income elasticity of ownership is in the

0.3 to 0.6 range, and it seems to decline with age. This estimate is roughly

Consistent with Rosen's. The price elasticity declines sharply with both age

and income, exceeding —0.5 (in absolute value) for married couples under age 25

with incomes below $20,000 but being near zero for married couples with incomes

over $50,000 or over age 44. These estimates are roughly consistent with the

time series estimates of -0.15 (Hendershott and Shilling; Rosen and Rosen) but
                                      —18—




are only a tenth to a fifth of Rosen's cross sectional estimate. We illustrate

that estimates more comparable to Rosen's can be obtained from our data when

the cross—sectional variation is allowed to dominate the estimates, but that

such estimates are grossly inconsistent with the time series behavior of

ownership rates. This suggests a potential danger in using cross—section

estimates to interpret time series variation.

     The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will raise after—tax incomes of married

couples and lower their cost of owning relative to renting. Thus an increase

in ownership should be expected. However, the increase in after-tax income is

small (2 to 3 percent) , and our estimates of the price elasticities are low.

Thus we would forecast only a 300,000 increase in owning married couples or

about a 1¼ percentage point increase in the aggregate ownership rate of married

couples under 45.

    Linear interpolations at incomes below $20,000 can give rise to substantial error
because the ownership—income curve is quite nonlinear; thus the lowest income level
in the table is $22,500 (median incomes for owners in the four age classes are
roughly $22,500, $30,000, $33,000 and $36,000).

    Bracket creep acted to raise tenure choice tax rates sharply between 1973 and
1979. However, the increase in the personal exemption from $1000 to $3200 in 1977
of fset much, if not all, of the creep for those with incomes between 22,500 and
30,000 (1986 dollars)



    Heteroscadasticity is present when aggregated data are used. A procedure
suggested by Kinenta (1986) was employed to correct for this problem.



    Two other variables were tested: an age-class unemployment rate (possibly a proxy
for income uncertainty) and a mortgage payment constraint variable. The
unemployment rate had a coefficient near zero; the coefficient on the constraint
variable was unexpectedly positive.



    The elasticity of Ownership with respect to the cost of owner housing
(ln o1/1n p' is:

                 =   (1 —            + 2b3ln p' —
                            o')[b1                     (2b3 + b5)ln y1 + b5ln p].

The elasticity of the ownership rate with respect to the cost of rental housing
is the negative of the elasticity with respect to the cost of owner housing
plus (l_oi)2b3ln(p/pr). Lastly, the elasticity of ownership with respect to

income is (l—o1)(b6y1 -
                              (2b3 + b5)ln(p'/p)].

    Moreover, the equation would predict an enormous (about 20 percentage point)
ownership decline between 1983 and 1985 when the jump in owner costs between 1979
and 1981 was allowed to have its full impact.

                                  DATA APPENDIX

       The calculations of the annual cost of owner—occupied housing generally

 follow Hendershott and Shilling (l982a, p. 107). variables assumed to be

 constant over time are economic depreciation (0.012)   ,   selling   costs (0.06)

 loan origination fee as a percent of loan (0.015), and loan— and structure-to-

value ratios (0.80 and 0.83, respectively). We also assume annual maintenance

 expenditures equal to 2 percent of property value.

      The variables that change over time are listed in Table A. Columns 1,2

and 3 contain the annual property tax rates (from Hendershott and Shilling),

the contract mortgage interest rate for owner—occupied housing (the Federal

Home Loan Bank Board effective interest rate, minus the estimated effect of

discount points), up—front financing costs (appraisal fees, title and recording

fees, for example) assumed not to vary with loan size. Estimated to be $800 in

1984, prior years are obtained by deflating by the CPI-U Xl index.

      Columns 4,5, and 6 are commodity-specific expected inflation rates for

the general, house price, and rent indicies, respectively. These adaptive

expectations are constructed as 16—quarter distributed lags on the current and

past rates of inflation of the relevent indicies (see Hendershott and

Shilling). Expected general inflation for each quarter is constructed using

the quarterly CPI—UX1 series; quarterly estimates are then averaged to produce

the annual figures in column 4. A pure expected house price inflation series

is calculated in similar fashion; the quarterly constant quality house price

index and the lagged weights are first used to estimate an underlying expected

quarterly house price appreciation index and then an annual average is

computed. Column S is an average of this pure house price appreciation series

and the expected rate of general inflation (column 4). The expected rate of

growth in the implicit rental income that homeowners receive, column 6, is also

a simple average, but in this case of expected general inflation and an
                                      —32—



underlying expected rental rate inflation series constructed based up on the

Lowry (1981) rental housing index, again using the 16—quarter lagged weights.

      Column 7 contains the house price ratio used to convert nominal annual

costs of owner—occupied housing into real terms. The ratio equals the constant

quality house price index divided by the general (CPI-U Xl) price index, with

both series equal to 100 in 1972.

      The price of owner—occupied housing services relevant to the tenure

decision is the annual after—tax cost of obtaining the average (not the

marginal) dollar's worth of owner—occupied housing services. The tax rate for

this calculation is defined as the average tax rate at which housing related

expenditures, including forgone interest on invested equity, are deducted.

Because tenure choice tax rates vary widely across households, these tax rates,

and thus annual owner costs, are estimated for married couples using the median

income of each AIRS income class considered in the years 1973—1983 (excluding

1982). Separate tax rate tables are inputed for each year (married couples

under 30 are presumed to have one dependent; those over 30, two dependents).

Property tax rates and mortgage rates for these calculations are taken from

columns 1 and 2. The equity rate is presumed to be the maximum of 0.7 times

the contract mortgage rate ("the tax-exempt rate") or the after—tax contract

rate plus a 0.03 risk premium. Nonhousing related itemized deductions for each

year, including both average and marginal state and local income tax rates, are

based on the average deductions of itemizing owners in each income class

considered. These averages are taken from each year's Statistics of Income

data (IRS Publications 1304). Other assumptions follow }lendershott and Ling

(1986). To calculate the two and four year lagged owner prices for each

income class, the median income in the current year is deflated back to the lag

year using the CPI-U Xl index.

       The income variable used in the regression equations is the estimated

after—tax income of the household, assuming it rented (and itemized if optimal

do to so).

       For the annual cost of rental housing, we compute the equilibrium cost

for a year in which equilibrium seems to have existed and then extrapolate that

cost backward and forward using a real rent series. This series, listed in

column 8 of Table A, is the Lowrey index divided by the general price index

(CPI—U Xl), with both indicies convertedto 100 in 1977. This series implies

an 8 percent decline in real rents between 1972 and 1975, roughly constant real

rents through 1981, and then a 7 percent rise by 1984. Given the constancy of

real rents in the late 1970s, we assume equilibrium existed in 1977.

       The calculation of 1977 rents employs the following equation:

       The cost of capital (or capital budgeting) approach is employed. Rather than

       including debt payments in the cash flows, all nondebt payments are discounted

       by the weighted average Cost of capital (average of debt and equity rates),

       equal to 6.4% in 1977 (Hendershott, Follain and Ling, 1987). Economic

       depreciation rates of 0.014 for rents and 0.018 for prices are assumed, and the

       expected rate of inflation in both rents and value is taken to be the general

       expected inflation rate. Other assumptions include: t=0.5, g=0.25, pt=0.0l4,

       oe=0.02, B=0.03, y=O.88 and DEP is based on 200% declining balance over 30

       years. The holding period, N, is determined endogenously as that which

       minimizes the rental price. Solving the above equation for R and dividing

       through by P produces estimates of the 1977 rental price per dollar of purchase

       price. These results are multiplied by 1.1358, the change in real house prices

       between 1973 and 1977 (column 7)   ,   to    obtain the column 9 real rental price

       estimates of 0.0737 for 1977. This value is extrapolated forward and backward

       using column 8.
