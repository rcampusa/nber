         Mathematical     models      of bond pricing are used by both academics          and Wall Street

practitioners,   with practitioners     introducing    time-dependent   parameters   to fit “arbitrage-free”

models to selected asset prices.       We show, in a simple one-factor setting, that the ability of such

models to reproduce a subset of security prices need not extend to state-contingent            claims more

generally.   The popular Black-Derman-Toy             model, for example, overprices call options on long

bonds relative to those on short bonds when interest rates exhibit mean reversion.               We argue,

more generally, that the additional parameters of arbitrage-free models should be complemented

by close attention      to fundamentals,     which might include mean reversion,          multiple   factors,

stochastic volatility, and/or non-normal interest rate distributions.

1     Introduction

Since Ho and Lee (1986) initiated work on “arbitrage-free”                     models of bond pricing,
academics and practitioners            have followed increasing] y divergent paths, Both groups
have the same objective:         to extrapolate     from prices of a limited range of assets ~he
prices of a broacler class of state-contingent            claims. Academics      study relatively parsi-
monious models, whose parameters are chosen to approximate                       “average”   or “typical”
behavior    of interest rates and bond          prices.     Practitioners,     on the other hand, use
models with more extensive             sets of time-dependent       parameters,     which they use to
Imatch current bond yields, and possibly other asset prices, exactly.

    To practitioners,     the logic of this choice is clear: the parsimonious            models used by
academics are inadequate for practical use. The four parameters of the Vasicek ( 1977)
and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross        (1985) models, for example, can be chosen to match five points
on the yield curve (the four parameters plus the short rate), but do not reprodl~cr the
complete yield curve to the degree of accuracy required by market participants.                      Even
complex, multi-factor       models cannot generally approximate              bond yields with sufficient
accuracy.     Instead,   practitioners      rely almost universally          on models    in the Ho and
Lee (1986) tradition,       including     those developed     by Black, Derman,          and Toy (1990),
Black and ]{arasinski        (1991),    Cooley, LeRoy, and Parke (1992),           Heath, Jarrow, and
Morton (1992), Hull and White (1990, 1993), and many others, Although                          analytical
approaches    vary across firms and even within them, the Black- DernlaI1-Toy model is
currently close to an industry standard.

    Conversely,    academics have sometimes expressed worry that the large parametf:r
sets of arbitrage-free      models may mask problems with their structure.                   A prominent
example is Dybvig        (1989), who noted that the changes in parameter values required
by repeated      use of this procedure       contradicted     the presumption       of the theory that
the parameters are deterministic functions of time. Black and Karasinski (1991, p 57)
put it more colorfully:      “When we value the option, we are assuming that its volatility
is known and constant,        But a minute later, we start using a new volatility.              Similarly,
we can value fixed income securities by assuming we know the one-factor                        short-rate
process.    A minute later, we start using a new process that is not consistent                      with
the old one, ”     Dybvig    argued that these changes in parameter               values through time
implied that the framework itself was inappropriate.

   We examine the practitioners’ procedure in a relatively simple theoretical setting,
a variant of Vasicek’s (1977) one-factor C,aussian interest rate model that we refer
to as the benchmark         theory.    Our thought experiment         is to apply models with time-
dependent drift and volatility parameters to asset prices generated by this theory. We
judge the models to be useful, in this setting, if they are able to reproduce               prices of a
broad range of state-contingent        claims. This experiment        cannot tell us how well the
models do in practice, but it allows us to study the role of time-dependent                parameters
in an environment      that can be characterized         precisely. VVe find, in this environment,
that if the world exhibits mean reversion, then the use of time-dependent                  parameters
in a model without       mean reversion can reproduce           prices of a limited set of assets,
but cannot    reproduce     the prices of general state-contingent           claims.    In this sense,
these arbitrage-free    ~models allow arbitrage opportunities:         a trader basing prices on,
say, the Black- Derman-Toy         model can be exploited        by a trader who knows the tr~~e
structure of the economy.

    A striking exalmple of misprizing in this setting involves options on long bonds,
Options of this type vary across two dimensions of time: the expiration                    date of the
option and the maturity of the bond on which the option is written.                        The Blacl<-
Dermall-Toy    model has a one-dimensional             array of volatility parameters     that can be
chosen to reproduce either the prices of options with any expiration date on one-period
bonds or of options with common           expiration     dates on boncls of any maturity.        But if
the world exhibits mean reversion, this vector cannot reproduce                the two-dimensional
array of prices of bond options.       If the volatility parameters are chosen to match prices
of options on one-period      bonds, then the model overprices options on long bonds.

    While we think mean reversion is a useful feature                in a model,       it illustrates   a
more general point:       that misrepresentations         of fundamentals,    whatever their form,
cannot generally be overcome by adding arrays of time-dependent parameters. From
this perspective, the role of academic research is to identify appropriate fundamentals,
which might include multiple factors, stochastic volatility, and/or             no~l-uormal interest
rate movements.        We conjecture    that arbitrage-free      models with inaccuracies         along
any of these dimensions will misprice some assets as a result.




2     A Theoretical                  Benchmark

We use a one-factor      Gaussian interest rate model as a laboratory          in which to examine
the practitioners’     procedure    of choosing    time-dependent  parameters to fit a bond
pricing   model   to observed      asset prices.    The moclel is a close relative of Vasicek
(1977). Although in some respects it is simpler than those used by practitioners, its
log-linear structure is extremely useful in clarifying the roles played by its various
parameters.




                                                   2
    To fix the notation,    let ~ be the price at date t of a zero-coupon                     bond of maturity
71,the claim to one dollar at date t + TL,By convention                           fi~= 1 (one dollar today costs
one dollar).   Bond yields are
                                           y;   =   –n-l    log   b;


and forward rates are
                                          f:    = log(b;/b;+’).                                               (1)

We label the short      rate rt = Y; = f:.

    We characterize asset prices in our benchmark theory, or laboratory,                          with a prici~~g
kerTLel: a stochastic    process governing prices of state-contingent                      claims. Existence of
such a process is guaranteed in any arbitrage-free                environment.           We describe the kernel
for our theoretical environment in two steps. The first step involves an abstract state
variable z, whose dynamics follow

                             ~t+l   =      pzt + (1 – p)6+             &t+l

                                    —
                                           Zt +(1    —p)(J—            ~t) +Et+l,                             (2)

with {Et} distributed      normally      and independently              with mean zero and variance az.
The parameter     y controls mean reversion:               with y = 1 the state follows a random
walk, but with values between zero and one the conditional                             mean of future values of
z converges    to the unconditional        mean 6. Step two is the pricing kernel nt, which
satisfies
                                        – log ~n~+~=       z~ +   ~E~+I       .                               (:3)


The parameter     A, which we refer to as the price of risk, determines                          the covariance
between innovations      to the kernel and the state and thus the risk characteristics                         of
bonds and related assets.

    Given a pricing kernel, we derive prices of assets from the pricing relation

                                          1 = Et(m~+~Rt+l),                                                   (4)

which holds for the gross return Rt+l on any traded asset. Since the one-period                           retllrn
on an 71+ l-period      bond is ~+1 /b~+l, the pricing relation gives us

                                         b:+l = Et(?7~t+l~;+l)7                                               (5)

which allows us to compute bond prices recursively, starting with the initial condition
b:=l.

    Consider a one-period       bond.     From equation           (5) and the initial condition           L? = 1
we see that the price is the conditional              mean of the pricing kernel:                 b: = Elnl,t+l.


                                                      3
Since the kernel is conditionally                  lognormal,          we need the following             property    of log-
normal random          variables:      if log x is normal                   with mean p and variance             az, then
log E(x)     = p + 02/2.      From equation                (3) we see that log ?n~+l has conditional                  mean
–zt and conditional         variance (Aa)2. Thus the one-period                               bond price satisfies

                                            log b; = –2, + (Aa)2/2

and the short rate is
                                       r~ = –logb;            = z~ – (Aa)2/2.                                            (6)

Thus the short rate ~ is the state z with a shift of origin.                                     The mean short rate is
6 – (Ao)2/2,    which we denote by L in the rest of the paper.

      The stochastic       process for z, equation                (2), implies similar behavior              for the short
rate:
                                 rt+l = Tt +(1              –~)(p–           Tt) +    Et+l,


a discrete time version of Vasicek’s (1977) short rate diffusion.                                    Future values of ~;~
short rate are
                                                                                 n




for n >1,     which yields conditional              first and second moments of

                                    E,(r,+n)        = l-, + (1 – 9“)(P               – ~t)                               (8)

and
                                                      w
                                                                                                                         (9)
                                                     j=l

We return to these formulas later.

      Prices of long bonds follow from (5); details are provided in Appendix A.1. Their
properties    are conveniently summarized by forward rates, which are linear functions
of the short rate:

                                                                  [
                                                                      A2–
                                                                             (A+
                                                                                      1;:)2]a,2,                       (lo)

for all T1~ O. Given forward rates, we can compute bond prices and yields from their
definitions, The right side of equation (10) has a relatively simple interpretation, If
we compare it to (8), we see that the first two terms are the expected short rate r~
periods in the future. We refer to the last term as a risk premium and note that it



                                                              4
depends on three parameters:               the magnitucleof          risk (o),       the price of risk (A), and
mean reversion (y).

    Both the Ho and Lee (1986)                   and Black,        Derman,     and Toy (1990)        models    are
capable of reproducing         an arbitrary forward rate curve (equivalently,                   yields or bond
prices), including one generated by a theoretical model like this one, An issue we
address later is whether this capability extends to more complex assets, With this
in mind, consider a European call option at date t, with expiration date t + ~ and
strike price k, on a zero-coupon       bond with maturity n at expiration.         Given the
lognormality    of bond prices in this setting, the call price is given by the Blacl<-Sc.holes
(1973) formula,
                                     T,n

where N is the cumulative            normal distribution           function,

                                 ~         _     log[b:+n/(b:k)]     + v;,n/2
                                     l—




and the option    volatility    is


                                                                                                              (12)


See Appendix     A.4. .Jamshidian (1989) reports a similar formula for a continuous-ti]ne
version of the Vasicek model.             The primary difference from conventional                 applications
of the Black-Scholes     formula is the role of the mean reversion parameter                         ~ in ( 12).




3     Parameter                 Values

We are trying,    in this paper,           to make a theoretical            point,    but we find it useful to
illustrate the theory     with numerical             examples.        The parameter         values come from
an informal     moment     matching            exercise based on properties             of monthly    yields for
[JS government securities computed by McCullocb and Kwon ( 1993). Some of the
properties of these yields are reported in Table 1 for the sample period 1982-91,

    We choose the parameters to approximate some of the salient features of bond
yields using a time interval of one month. From equation (7) we see that ~ is the
unconditional    mean of the short rate, so we set it equal to the sample mean of the


                                                         5
one-month     yield in Table 1, 7.483/1200.         (The 1200 converts an annual percentage
rate to a monthly yield. ) The mean reversion parameter y is the first autocorrelation
of the short rate.   In Table 1 the autocorrelation        is 0,906, so we set y equal to this
value. This indicates a high degree of persistence in the short rate, but less than with
a random walk. The volatility parameter          a is the standard deviation      of innovations
to the short rate, which we estimate with the standard error of the linear regression
(7). The result is a = 0.6164/1200.        Thus the values of (p, O, p) are chosen to match
the mean, standard deviation,      and autocorrelation      of the short rate. We choose the
final parameter,   the price of risk A, to approximate      the slope of the yield curve. Note
from (10) that mean forward rates, in the theory, are




This tells us that to produce      an increasing      mean forward     rate curve (implying       an
increasing mean yield curve) we need A to be negative.             The price of risk parameter,
in other words, governs the average slope of the yield curve. One way of fixing A, thent
is to select a value that makes the theoretical mean yield curve similar to the sample
mean yield curve, given our chosen values for the other three parameters.               An example
is pictured in Figure 1, where ~vesee that A = —750 produces theoretical                mean yields
(the line in the figure) close to their sample means (the stars) for maturities between
one month and ten years. With more negative values the mean yield curve is steeper,
and with less negative     (or positive)   values the yield curve is flatter (or downward
sloping).

    Thus we see that all four parameters        are required for the theory to imitate the
dynamics     of interest rates and the average slope of the yielcl curve.          We use these
benchmark     values later to illustrate differences in prices across bond pricing models.




4     Ho and Lee Revisited

We turn now to the use of time-dependent              parameters   to fit theoretical    models to
observed asset prices. We apply, in turn, analogs of the models of Ho and Lee ( 1986)
and Black, Derman, and Toy (1990) to a world governed by the benchmark                    theory of
Section 2.

    Our first example is a (;aussian analog of Ho and Lee’s (1986) binomial                 interest
rate model. The analog starts with a state equation,




                                                6
with time-dependent      parameters             {CYt} and normally     and independently   distributed
innovations    {qt} with mean zero and constant variance 92. The pricing kernel is

                                        – log T?lt+l = ~t + 7TL+1.                                (14)

lVe use different letters for the parameters than in the benchmark theory to indicate
that they may (but need not ) take on different values, Our Ho and Lee analog differs
from the benchmark       theory in two respects,              First, the short rate process does not
exhibit    mean reversion,
                         which we might think of as setting ~ = 1 in equation (2).
Second, the state equation (13) includes time-dependent  “drift” parameters {at}.

    Given equations    (13,14),   the pricing relation (5) implies a short rate




and forward rates


                                                                                                  (15)
                                          j=l


for rZ~ 1. See Appendix      A.2,        Note that (10) differs from (15) of the benchmark           in
two ways. One is the impact of the short rate on long forward rates. A unit increase
in r is associated   with increases in f“           of one in Ho and Lee, but (1 — pn) < 1 in the
benchmark.     The other is the risk premium, the final term in ecluation (1,5).

   Despite these differences, time-dependent drift parameters allow the Ho and Lee
model to reproduce some of the features of the benchmark theory. One such feature
is the conditional   mean of future short rates. The future short rates implied by this
model are                                             .



which implies conditional    means of

                                                              71
                                        Et(rt+n)     = ~t + ~   ~t+j                              (17)
                                                            j=l


for 71>0.     If we compare this to the analogous expression for the benchmark                 theory,
equation    (8), we see that the two are equivalent if we set

                                    n

                                                                                                  (18)



                                                          7
Thus the time-dependent               drift parameters of the Ho and Lee model can be chosen to
imitate this consequence             of mean reversion in the benchmark                       theory.

    In practice it is more common                    to use the drift parameters to fit the model to the
current yield curve. To fit forward rates generated by the benchmark                                      theory we need
[compare (10,15)]


             5 at+j
             j=l
                           =     (1 -~’’)(p        -r,)    + [A’ - (A+(l         -~’L)/(l       -~))’]      cJ2/2


                                 - [72 - (7+          ~)’] P2/2                                                         (19)

The drift parameters implied by (18) and (19) are, in general, different.                                    Since




we can equate the two expressions                         when y = 1 by setting ~ = a and ~ = J. But
when O < v < 1 the two expressions cannot be reconciled.                              This is evident in Figure 2,
where we graph the two choices of cumulative                         clrift parameters,         ~~=1 a~+j, using the
parameters estimated in Section 3, with ~ = a, ~ = A, and r = 3.0/1200.                                          The drift
parameters           that reproduce       the conditional         mean converge             rapidly      as the effects of
mean reversion wear off. But the drift parameters that fit the current yield curve get
steadily smaller as they offset the impact of maturity                             on the risk premium               in this
model.       This results, for the range of maturities                   in the figure, in a declining                 term
structure of expected            future short rates, while the benchmark                      implies the reverse,

    The discrepancy             in the figure between             the two choices of drift parameters                   is a
concrete example of


Remark         1 The parameters               of   the Ho    and Lee    model      can      be chose~t      to match     the
current      yield    curve,    or the conditio~tal          means   of future      short     ratesj     bllt they   ca~l~lot
ge~lerally     do both.


This property of the Ho and Lee model is a hint that time-dependent                                      drift parameters
do not adequately              capture    the effects of mean reversion in the benchmark                             theory.
Dybvig       (1989, p ,5) makes a similar observation.                     A closer look indicates               that the
difficulty lies in the nonlinear interaction in the risk premium between mean reversion
and the price of risk.            In the benchmark             theory, the risk premium                  on the ~~-period
forward rate [see equation               (10)] is




                                                              8
In the Ho and Lee model, equation               (15), the analogous expression is




If we choose ~ = A and ~ = a the two expressions are equal for ~1= 1, but they move
apart as 71grows. The discrepancy              noted in Remark 1 is a direct consequence.

    A similar comparison          of conditional      variances     also shows signs of strain.              The
conditional    variances of future short rates implied by the Ho and Lee model are

                                             Vart(rt+m)    = n~z.

If we compare this to the analogous expression in the benchmark theory, equation (9),
we see that they generally differ when ~ # 1. With y < 1 and ~ = CJ,the conditional
variances are the same for n = 1, but for longer time horizons they are greater in the
Ho and Lee model.        We summarize this discrepancy              in


Remark        2 The parameters       of the Ho and L~e model             cannot   be chosc:u     to re])roduce
the conditional     variances    of future    short   rates.



    Thus we see that additional              drift parameters       allow the Ho and Lee model                 to
imitate some of the effects of mean reversion on bond yields. They cannot? however,
reproduce     the conditional     variances of the benchmark              theory,     Dybvig     (1989, p 5)
summarized        this feature   of the Ho and Lee model              more aggressively:           “[T]he     Ho
and Lee model starts with an unreasonable                 implicit assumption        about innovations         in
interest ratesj but can obtain a sensible initial yield curve by making an unreasonable
assumption     about expected      interest rates. lJnfortunately,          while this ,.. give[s] correct
pricing of discount boncls..., there is every reason to believe that it will give illcorrert
pricing of interest rate options. ” Dybvig’s              intuition about options is easily verified.
The Black- Scholes formula, equation (11), applies to the Ho and Lee model if we use
option volatility
                                  v; ~ = Var,(log b~+~) = ~(n~)’.                                           (20)
This formula cannot be reconciled             with that of the benchmark            theory, equation        ( 12),
for all combinations      of ~ and n unless y = 1. If we choose the volatility parameter
~ to reproduce       the option    volatility     ZJI,Iof a short option          on a short bond,          then
we overstate the volatilities       of long options        on long bonds.         As a result, the model
overvalues options with more clistant expiration dates ancl/or longer underlying bonds.

   We see in Figure 3 that call prices CTI1implied by the Ho and Lee model can
be substantially      higher than those generated              by the benchmark        theory.    The figure


                                                      9
expresses the rnispricing as a premium of the Ho and Lee price over the price generated
by the benchmark         theory.    Benchmark        prices are based on the parameter               values of
Section 3. Ho and Lee prices are based on drift parameters that match current bond
prices, equation     (19),   and a volatility        parameter        p = a that Imatcbes the option
volatility   VI,1 of a one-period      option      on a one-period           bond.   Both are evaluated       at
strike price k = bj/bJ+”.      For ~ = 1 the two models generate the same call price, but
for options    with expiration       dates 12 months in the future the Ho and Lee price is
more than ,50 percent higher.




5      Black,        Derman,              and Toy Revisited

Black, Derrnan, and Toy ( 1990) extend the time-dependent                            parameters    of Ho and
Lee to a second dimension.           They base bond pricing on a binomial                    process for the
logarithm     of the short rate in which both drift ancl volatility                    are tilne-(le~]elldetlt.
We build an analog of their model that retains the linear, Gaussian                               structure   of
previous sections, but includes these two sets of time-dependent                        parameters.      Given
a two-parameter     distribution      like the normal, time-dependent                drift and volatility can
be used to match the conditional              distribution        of future short rates exactly and thus
to mitigate the tendency           of the Ho and Lee model to overprice                  long options.     The
question is whether they also allow us to reproduce                        the prices of other interest-rate
derivative securities.

    Our analog of the Black-Derman-Toy    model adds time-dependent                         volatility to the
structure of the previous section: a random variable z follows

                                       Zt+l    =   ~t +    ~t+l   + qt+l                                   (21)

and the pricing kernel is
                                       – log ?n~+~= z~ + yqt+~ .                                           (22)

The new ingredient        is that each qt has time-dependent                   variance ~~~. This structure
differs from the benchmark          theory in its absence of mean reversion (the coefficient of
one on zt in the state equation)       and in its time-dependent               drift (the CY’S)and volatility
(the ~’s).

    We approach      bond pricing as before.               We show in Appendix          A.2 that the short
rate is
                             r~ = – log (EtT?z~+~)= z~ – (~pt+~)2/2



                                                          10
and forward rates are




for 71~ 1. Equation    (23) reduces to the Ho and Lee expression,         equation    (15), when
@t = @ for all t. AS in the Ho and Lee model, forward rates differ from the benchmark
in both the impact of short rate movements on long forward rates and the form of
the risk premium.

   We can use both sets of time-dependent           parameters   to approximate      asset prices
in the benchmark    theory.     Consider the conditional   distribution   of future short rates.
The short rate follows




so future short rates are




Their conditional   mean and variance are


                    Et(rt+n)     = ~t +   72(P?+l
                                               – P:+,z+l
                                                      )/2        +fat+,
                                                                  j=l




This model, in contrast        to Ho and Lee, is able to match the conditional         variances
of the benchmark    theory, which we do by choosing volatility parameters            that decline
geometrically:


This implies conditional       variances of




the same as ecluation (9) of the theory. Similar patterns of declining time-dependent
volatilities are common when these methods are used in practice, Black, Derman, and


                                               11
Toy’s numerical example included (see their Table I). To match the conclit ional mean
of the benchmark               theory, equation     (8), we choose drift parameters                that satisfy




Thus we see, as Black, Derman,                     and Toy (1990, p :33) suggest, that we can fit the
first two moments of the short rate with two “arrays” of parameters:


Remark            3 The parameters          of the Black-Derman-Toy            model     caTl bc chosen         to repro-
duce the conditional             means    and variances       of future    short    rates.



Given the critical role played by volatility in pricing derivative assets, this represents
an essential advance beyond Ho and Lee.

       Despite time-dependent              volatility    parameters,      the model cannot simultaneo~lsly
reproduce          the conditional        moments       of the short rate and the forward                  rates of the
benchmark            theory.     The drift parameters             that reproduce        the forwarcl rate curve,
equation          (10), are


                           =     (1 - pn)(p - r,)+         [A’ -(A+       (1 - y“)/(1        - y))’]    0’/2
            j=]




Comparing           (28) and (29) we see that the two are not equivalent, in general. ii~e note
the difference in

of future         rates,   the drift parameters         of the Black- Derman-Toy              model     can be choserl
to match          the current     yield   curve,   or the conditioltal      means      of future       short   rate.~, but
they    cannot       generally    do both.



Figure 4 plots the difference between (29) and (28). The parameter values are those
of Section 3, with ~ = A, p~+j = y ~–la, and r = ;3.()/12()(). The differences are smaller
than those of Figure 2 for the Ho and Lee model, but are nonzero nonetheless.

       Remark 4 is a hint that the Black-Dermall-Toy                       analog cannot generate accurate
prices for the full range of state-contingent                 claims in the benchmark              economy, but we

can see this more clearly by looking at specific assets. Consider European call options
on zero-coupon      bonds.     Once more the lognormal                  structure of the model means that
the Black- Scholes formula, equation            (11), applies. If we choose drift parameters to fit
the current yield curve, then any difference between call prices in the model and the
benchmark      theory must lie in their option volatilities.                    The option volatility for the
Black-Derman-Toy           analog is

                                             V;,l=     n2 ~‘    ~~+j.
                                                          j=l

see Appendix A.4. If we restrict ourselves to options on one-period bonds (so that
71= 1), we can reproduce the volatilities of our theoretical environment by choosing
~6’s that decline geometrically         with time, the same choice that replicates COI]ditional
variances of future short rates, equation              (27).

      However, the Black- Dermal~-Toy analog cannot simultaneously                              reproduce    prices
of options on bonds of longer maturities.                  If we use the geometrically               declining pa-
rameters of equation        (27), the option volatility is




From (12) we see that the ratio of option volatilities is

                       Benchmark         Volatility     = (1 + ~ + .            + ~“-l)z

This ratio is greater than one when O < w <1                    and n > 1, and implies that when the
Blacl~-Dernlall-Toy        analog prices options         on short bonds           correctly,     it will overprice
options on long bonds.         We see in Figure 5 that this rnispricing gets worse the longer
the maturity of the bond, and is greater than 150 percent for bonds with maturities
of two years or more. As in Figure 3, benchmark                     prices are based on the parameters
of Section    3, the drift parameters           of the Black- Dernlall-Toy                 analog are chosen to
reproduce    the current yield curve, the strike price is k = b~/b~+”, and the expiration
period is r = 6. Thus we have



Remark       5 The parameters          of the   Black-Derman-Toy                model      cannot
prices   of call options     o~t bonds for    all maturities        a~ld expiration         dates.



      The difference   in option       volatilities,    and hence in call prices, between                   the two
models stems from two distinct roles played by mean reversion in determining                                 prices


                                                        13
of long bonds.         Mean reversion appears, first, in the impact of short rate innovations
on future short rates. We see from (9) that the impact of innovations on future short,
rates, in the theory, decays geometrically                    with the time horizon          ~, This feature is
easily mimicked in the Black-Dernlan-Toy                     model, as we have seen, by using volatility
parameters      {~f}     that decay at the same rate.              The second      role of mean reversion
concerns      the impact       of short rate movements            on long bond prices.           In the Black-
Dermall-Toy      model, a unit decrease in the short rate results in an 71unit, increase in
the logarithm of the price of an ~~-period bond; see Appendix                      .4.2. In the benchmark
theory, the logarithm of the bond price rises by only (I+p+.                     ~.+p’’-’)      = (1–p’’)/(l     –
y); see Appendix         Al.    This attenuation of the impact of short rate innovations on long
bond prices is a direct consequence             of mean reversion.          It is not, however, reproduced
by choosing geometrically           declining volatility parameters and is therefore missing from
call prices generated by the Black- Derman-Toy                    analog.    Stated somewhat differently:
the Black- Derman-Toy            analog does not reproduce           the hedge ratios of the benchmarl{
theory.

    As a practical matter, then, we might expect the Blat.k-Dernlall-Toy                          procedure     to
work well in pricing options on short term instruments,                       including interest rate caps.
For options on long bonds,               however, the model overstates the option volatility                   and
hence the call price.           A common      example of such an instrument              is a callable bond.
This procedure         will generally overstate the value of the call provision                   to the issuer,
in the theoretical environment,             and thus understate the value of a callable long-term
bond.

    The discrepancy            between option prices generated              by the benchmark         theory and
the Black-Dernlan-Toy             analog illustrates one difficulty           of using models with tinle-
dependent      parameters:        that a one-dimensional           vector of time-dependent            volatility
parameters cannot reproduce               the conditional       variances of bond prices across the two
dimensions of maturity and time-to-expiration.                    We turn now to a second example of
misprizing:     a class of “exotic.” derivatives whose returns display different sensitivity
than bonds to interest rate movements,

    Consider an asset that delivers the power O of the price of an n-period                            bond one
period in the future.          This asset has some of the flavor of derivatives with magnified
sensitivity    to interest rate movements             made popular          by Bankers Trust, yet ret sins
the convenient         log-linearity     of bond prices in our framework.               As with options,        we
compare the prices implied by the benchmark                      theory,


               log ~      =     - (.,+     (Aa)2/2)    +Hlogb;+
                                                                       (’+’11::)2a2’2
                                –@(l–pn)(p–           r,),                                                     (30)

                      j=l

Both follow from pricing relation (4) with the appropriate                     pricing kernel.

      Suppose      we choose     the parameters      of the Black-Dernlall-Toy                 analog      to ulatch
the conditional variance of future short rates [equation (26)], the current, yield curve
[equation (29)], and the price of risk [y = A]. ~~an this model reproduce the prices of
our exotic asset for all values of the sensitivity parameter 9? The answer is generally
no. When n = 1 the two models generate the same price d) for all values of H,just as
we saw that the two sets of cumulative               drift parameters were initially the same (see
Figure 4 and the discussion following Remark 4). For longer maturities, however, the
prices are generally different.         Figure 6 is an example with 7Z= 60 and r = ~3.00/1200.
We see that for values of O outside the unit interval, the Black-Dermall-Toy                                     analog
overprices      the exotic,    although      the difference     between      models     is smaller than for
options on long bonds.          Thus


Remark       6 The parameters          of the Black-Derman-Toy            model    can be chosrn           to match
both the current       yield   curve    and the term    structure      of volatility    for     options     ort    onc-
period    bonds,   but they cannot      generally   replicate   the prices    of more         exotic    derivatives.




      These examples        of rnispricing illustrate a more general result:                    that the Blacl<-
Dermall-Toy        analog cannot replicate the state prices of the benchmark                           theory.     This
result is stated most clearly using stochastic              discount    factors,




which define n-period-ahead             state prices. We show in the Appendix                    that the benchm-
ark      theory implies discount factors




and the Black- Derman-Toy              analog implies

Proposition       1 The time-depende.?lt         dTift    an,d volatility     parameters     of th~ Black-Dcr-

benchmark      theory.



A proof is given in Appendix             A.3. The difficulty lies in the innovations,




There is no choice of volatility parameters {@t} in Blaclt-Dernlall                        -Toy that can repli-
cate the nonlinear interaction           of mean reversion (y) and the price of risk (A) in the
benchmark      theory.

    In short, the time-dependent            drift and volatility            parameters     of a model like the
Black-Derman-Toy           analog cannot replicate the prices of derivative                   assets generated
by a model with mean reversion.




6        Arbitrage              and Profit Opportunities

In the laboratory        of the benchmark      theory, the Black-Dermall-Toy                analog systenlati-
cally misprices some assets. In this section we consider strategies that might be used
to profit from traders using prices indicated                 by the Black-Dermall-Toy           model.

    One way to exploit someone trading at Black-Derman-Toy prices is to arbitrage
with someone trading at benchmark prices. If, as we have seen, a Black- Dern~all-
Toy trader overprices          options   on long bonds relative to those on short rate, and a
benchmark      trader does not, then we can buy frolm the latter and sell to the former,
thus making a riskfree profit. This is as clear an example of arbitrage as there is. Bllt
since such price differences are so obvious,               they are unlikely to be very common.

    It is less easy to exploit a Black-Derman-Toy                   trader when trades take place only
at prices dictated by the model.            Since Black- Derman-Toy              prices are consistent with
a pricing kernel, they preclude riskless arbitrage.                  We can often devise, however, dY-
namic strategies         whose returns are large relative to their risk.                   One sllch strategy


                                                         16
involves call options on long bonds, which (again) the Black- Dernlall-Toy                        model gel]-
erally overvalues.    If we sell the option to the trader at date t, and liquidate at t + 1,
we might expect to make a profit. This seems particularly                     likely in the option’s    final
period,     since the option is overvalued       but the bonds on which the option is written
are not.

    Before we evaluate this strategy, we need to explain how the Blacl~-Dernlal] -Toy
trader prices assets through time. .4 trader using the Black-Dermall-Toy model gel]-
erally finds, both in practice and in our theoretical                setting, that the t,iI~le-del]ell(iellt
parameters      must be reset each period.          In our setting,         suppose   the trader chooses
volatility parameters at date t to fit implied volatilities from options on short bonds.
As we have seen, this leads her to set {~~~+1,~t+z, ~t+3, . .} eclual to {a, pa, y20, . . .}.
If the parameters were literally time-dependent,               then in the following period logic dic-
tates that we set {~~+2, ~t+3, /~~+4,. . .} equal to {pa, V2a, W30, . .}. But if we calibrate
once more to options on one-period bonds, we would instead use {cJ, pa, ~2a,               .}.
This leads to a predictable      upward jump in the volatility                 parameters   from one pe-
riod to the next, as in Figure 7. Similarly, the drift parameters                      must be adjusted
each period to retain the model’s      ability to reproduce               the current yield curve, These
changes in parameter       values through time are an indication                  that the model is im-
perfectly imitating the process generating state prices, but they nevertheless improve
its performance.     In this sense the internal inconsistency               noted by Dybvig (1989) is a
symptom of underlying problems, but not a problem in its own right. Thus our trader
prices call options using drift and volatility parameters that match, each period, the
yield curve and the term structure of volatilities                  impliecl by options     011   one-period
bonds, equations      (29) and (27), respectively.

     Now consider a strategy against such a trader of selling a ~-period                     option on an
~t-period bond and buying it back one period later. The gross one-period                      return from
this strategy is
                                     Rt+l    =    –c;;;’’’/c;’n,

for r z 1, with the convention that an option at expiration has value c~)” = (~ – k)+.
The profit from this strategy is not riskfree, but it can be large relative to the risk
involved.     In the world of the benchmark         theory, the appropriate           adjustment     for risk
is given by the pricing relation (4). We measure the mean excess risl{-adjusted                       return
by
                                    a = E (7nt+l Rt+l)             — 1,

using the pricing kernel nt for the benchmark              economy.        This measure is analogolls to
Jensen’s alpha for the CAPNI and is the appropriate risk adjustment in this setting.
For the trading strategy just described, and the parameter values of Section :3, the
returns are in the neighborhood        of several hundred percent per year; see Figurt~ 8.


                                                    17
The returns in the figure were computed            by .Monte Carlo, and concern          two-period
(~=2)   options on bonds for maturities (n) between 1 and 24 months.                The returns are
greater with ~ = 1, but decline significantly         as ~ increases.    For ~ >6   the overpricing
is difficult to exploit, since the overpricing of a five-period         option the following period
is almost as great.




7       Mean        Reversion             and Other Fundamentals

We have seen that the time-dependent            drift and volatility      parameters   of analogs of
the Ho and Lee (1986) and Black- Dermall-Toy               (1990) models cannot reproduce        the
prices of state-contingent claims generated by a model with mean reversion. This
thought experiment does not tell us how well these models perform in practice, but
it indicates that extra parameters are not a solution to all problems:              they need to b~
used in the context of a structure with sound fundamentals.

    We focused on mean reversion because we find it an appealing feature in a bond
pricing model, yet it is missing from the most popular binomial interest rate mod-
els. The estimated autocorrelation of 0.906 reported in Table 1 is not substantially
different from one, but a value of one has, in the benchmark theory, two apparently
counterfactual implications for bond yields, The first is that the mean yield curve
eventually     declines (to minus infinity)     with maturity.     In fact yield c,urves are, on
average, upward sloping, Figure 1 being a typical example. A second implication
was pointed out by Gibbons and Ramaswamy (1993) and may be more telling: with
y close to one, average yield curves exhibit substantially              less curvature than we see
in the data.     .An example with p = 0.99 is pictured         in Figure 9, where we have set
A = –200 to keep the theoretical          10-year yield close to its sample mean. These two
implications     illustrate the added power of combining           time-series   and cross-section
information,     and suggest to us that random walk models overstate                the persistence
of the short-term     rate of interest.   For these reasons, we feel that mean reversion is
suggested by the properties      of bond prices.

    For similar reasons,     Black and l{arasinski       (1991),   Heath, Jarrow,      and h’Iorton
(1992), and Hull and White (1990, 1993) have developed                  ways of introducing   mea~~-
reversion into arbitrage-free     models.    Despite these developments?         mean reversion is
generally ignored by all but the most sophisticated            market participants.       Financial
professionals do not generally reveal their methods, but they can be inferred frol~~
other sources. One source is books on fixed income modeling.    Tuckman ( 1995) is
aimed at quantitatively-oriented          MBA   students    and is used in Salomon        Brothers’


                                                 18
sales and trading training course, yet devotes only four pages to models with mean
reversion.       Sundaresan ( 1996) targets a similar audience and disregards mean reversion
altogether.           Perhaps      a better       source is Bloomberg,         the leading      purveyor         of fixed
income information            services. Calculations           on Bloomberg       terminals of the “fair value”
of interest rate derivatives are based on a log-normal                        analog of the Ho and Lee model,
and calculations          of “option-adjusted          spreads” for callable bonds use the same model
as the default (Bloomberg                  1996), with Black, Derman, and Toy (1990) and Hull and
White (1990) available as alternatives.

       However, we think the central issue is not, mean reversion,                            but whether pricing
models — arbitrage-free                or not — provide a good approximation                     to the fundanlell-
tals driving bond prices.                  Mean reversion,          in this context,     is simply an example             of
a fundamental           that cannot be mimicked by time-dependent                         drift and volatility        pa-
rameters.        A second example             is multiple factors.         Work by, among others, Brennau
and Schwartz (1979),                Chen and Scott (1993),               Duffie and Singleton          (1995),   Dybvig
(1989),      Garbade       (1986),     Litterman      and Scheinkman           (1991),    and Stambaugh           (1988)
clearly indicates the benefits of additional                     factors in accounting         for the evolution          of
bond        prices through         time,     Longstaff     and Schwartz        (1992)     are representative         of a
growing number of studies that identify a second factor with volatility, whose varia-
tion through time is apparent in the prices of options on fixed income instruments.
Yet another example is the fat tails in weekly interest rate changes documented                                       by
Das (1994),           who introduced          jumps    into the standard         diffusioll-basecl       models,      We
would guess that models that ignore any or all of these fundamentals                               will, as a direct
consequence,          produce      inaccurate      state prices.

       We    argue,    in short,    that    fundamentals       matter,     and that    poor   choice     of fundanlell-
tals   cannot     generally        be rectified    by judicious       use of time-depenclent       parameters.




8           Final Thoughts

We have examined              the practitioners’           methodology       of choosing      time-dependent         pa-
rameters to fit an arbitrary bond pricing model to current asset prices. We showed,
in a relatively         simple theoretical          setting,    that this method         can systematically         mis-
price some assets. Like Ptolemy’s                   geocentric       model of the solar system, these models
can generally be “tuned” to provide good approximations to (in our case) prices of
a limited set of assets, but they may also provide extremely poor approximations for
other assets. As Lochoff (1993, p 92) puts it: ‘LEven bad models can be tuned to give
good results” for simple assets.


                                                               19
    Whether these theoretical examples of misprizing can be used to direct trading
strategies in realistic settings depends on the relative magnitudes of the misprizing
and the inevitable approximation       errors of more parsimonious   models.   We would not
be willing, at present, to bet our salaries on our benchmark theory. Nevertheless, we
think the exercise indicates that it is important to get the fundamentals right. In our
thought experiment,     fundamentals    were represented by the degree of mean reversion
in the short rate, and we saw that a mistake in this dimension           could lead to large
pricing errors on some securities.       The extra time-dependent     parameters,   in other
words, are not a panacea:    they allow us to reproduce    a subset of asset prices, but do
not guarantee accurate prices for the full range of interest-rate derivative securities.
In more general settings, we expect a model with 71arrays of parameters to be able to
reproduce   the term structure of prices of rt classes of assets, but if the fundamentals
are wrong there will be some assets that are mispriced.

   The difficulty in practice is that even the best fundamental        models provide only
a rough approximation     to the market prices of fixed income derivatives.     That leaves
us in the uncertain territory described by Black and Karasinski (1991, p 57): “[~>ne]
approach is to search for an interest rate process general enough that we can assume
it is true and unchanging.   ... While we may reach this goal, we don’t know enough to
use this approach    today. ” Best practice,   we think, is to combine   current knowledge
of fundamentals     with enough extra parameters to make the approximation          adequate
for trading purposes.

A       Mathematical                        Appendix

W’e derive many of the formulas used in the text. For both the benchmark theory
and our analog of the Black-Derman-Toy   modelt we derive the stochastic discount
factors implied by the pricing kernels listed in the text, and the implied bond prices,
forward rates, and prices of call options on discount bonds.                            The result is effectively
a mathematical       summary of the paper.



A.1       Benchmark                Theory


We characterize      bond      pricing   theories   with     stochastic       cliscount     factors,




or — log ~ft,t+~, =      – ~;=l       log nLt+j. Given the pricing kernel ~n of our benchmark
theory [equations (2) and (3)], the stochastic                  discount factors are




for n z 1. Given the discount factors, we compute                           bond prices from fi~ = EtIWt,~+,Z
[a consequence      of (5)]:


           –log~         =      nd+


Forward rates [see (1)] are



                                                                   l–~”            2

                                                                    l–p

which includes a short rate of rt = j: = Zt – (Aa)2/2.

    It is conventional         to express   discount       factors,    bond     prices,     and    forward   rates   in
terms   of the   observable      short   rate   T rather    than      the   abstract      state   variable   z, which




                                                       21
is easily done given the linear relation between them. Since p = 6 — (~a)z/2,                we get
discount factors

We approach     our Gaussian           analog of the Black-Dern~an-Toy       model the salne way,
using equations    (21 ) and (22) to define the pricing kernel. Our analog of the Ho and
Lee model is a special case with ,Bt= ~ for all t. The stochastic              discount factors are




They imply bond prices of

and, for n 2 1, forward rates of




Sillce the, short rate is ~t = ~~ = Zt — (y@t+l )2/2, we can rewrite these relations as

A.3        Nonequivalence                 of Discount                 Factors

Our examples of assets that are mispriced by the Black-Dernlall-Toy  model indicate
that E31ack-Derman-Toy cannot generally reproduce the stochastic discount factors of
our benchmark       theory:


Proposition       1 The      parameters         {y,    at, Pt}    Of the    Black-DermaTl-Toy       model      CUILILOi
be chosen     to reproduce     the stochastic          discount     factors      of the benchmark    theory.



The proof consists of comparing the two discount factors, (A 1) for the benchmark
theory and (A2) for the Black-Derma~l-Toy model. The deterministic terms of (,41)
and (A2) are relatively simple.            For, say, the first n discount factors,                  we can equate
the conditional means of (Al) and (A2) by judicious choice of the n drift parameters
{~t+l, ~~~,Q,+,,}. The stochastic terms, however, cannot generally be ecluated. We
can represent the initial stochastic                  terms for the benchmark            theory in an array like
this:


                                          j=l                              j=z              j=~

                   n=l                    ~ct+l
                   n=z                 (A+ l)Et+,                          A&t+2
                   ?1= :3            (A+ 1 + y)&t+,                  (A+ l)&,+2             AE~+~

                                                             23
For the Black-Derman-Toy                   model the analogous terms are


                                                    j=l                                   j=~                   j=:~
                       n=l                          7qt+l
                       TL=z                   (7+         I)?/t+]                         yvt+2
                       n=~                    (7+         ~)qt+l                    (7+      1 )qt+2            ‘i7t+3



If a = Othe model is riskless and replicable with drift parameters alone. Alternatively,
if p = 1 we can replicate the benchmark                                    theory by setting ~ = ~ and T~~+j= ct+i,
which implies ~t+i = a for all j.                               But with a # O and v #                          1 it is impossible   to
choose the price of risk y and volatility parameters {~t+l, ~t+2, ~t+3} to reproduce the
benchmark         theory.      Suppose we try to match the terms sequentially.                                           To match the
term (n, j) = (1,1)            we need
                                                            ~~t+l = ~&t+l ,
which requires ~~t+l = ~0. Similarly, equivalence of the (2, 1) terms,

                                                (7+         l)qf+l        = (~+           l)~t+l,

tells us (for nonzero A) that the parameters must be ~ = A and ~~~+1= a. The (13,1)
term now requires
                                                      y+2=A+l+y,

which is inconsistent              with our earlier parameter                             choices when y # 1. (When             A = O
the same conclusion                holds, but the argument starts with the (2, 1) term.)                                     Thus we
see that our attempt to reproduce the discount factors of the benchmark                                                   theory with
those of the Black-Dermall-Toy                       model has failed.

    It is easy to imagine             similar       problems              with extensions of the model.                  We could, for
example,        let ~ depend         on time.             But    for      similar reasons, this one-dimensional                  array
cannot     reproduce         the    discount        factors          of   the benchmark                mode].



A.4         Bond        Options

Any stream of cash flows {ht} can be valued by
                                                                 ?Z

using     the   stochastic         discount         factors          M.        We     use       this relation     to price European
options     on zero-coupon            bonds.


                                                                          24
    Consider a European call option at date t with expiration date t + ~. The option
gives its owner the right to buy an n-period bond at date t + T for the exercise price
k, thus generating    the cash flow

                                      h ,+, = (b;+.     -   ~)+,

where x+ = max{O, x} is the nonnegative          part of ~. The call price is

                                 “n = E,
                                Ct         [Mt,t+,(v+.– ~)+]                                     (A3)

Computing this price involves evaluating         (A3) with the appropriate            discount factor
and bond price.

    Both     of our theories have lognormal   discount factors and bond  prices, so to
evaluate     ( A3) we need two properties of lognormal expectations,  Let us say that
log z = (log xl, log Zz) is bivariate normal with mean vector p and variance matrix Z.
Formula 1 is
                          E [Z11(X2 – k)] = exp(pl          + a~/2)LN(d),

with

                                                                   1
                                                  V2
where N is the standard normal distribution             function       and 1 is an indicator function
that equals one if its argument is positive, zero otherwise.                A similar result is stated
and provecl by Rubinstein      (1976, Appendix).      Except for the J$Tterm, this is the usual
expression    for the mean of a lognormal      random variable.            Formula 2 follows from 1
with a change of variables (X1X2 for Z1):




with
                                 ~=P2–logk+a12+a:
                                                   Q2
Our application    of these formulas to (A3) uses Mt,t+. as xl and ~+T as 12.

    For the benchmark     theory, we use discount factor (A 1) ancl evaluate (A3) using
the expectation    formulas.   To keep the notation         manageable,      let




                                               25
Now we look at the discount factor and future bond price.                               The discount   factor is,
from (Al),




It has conditional    mean given by the first two terms and conditional                          variance 2.47.

and option volatility




the conditional   variance of the logarithm of the future bond price.

   The call price for the Black-Dermall-Toy                     model follows a similar route with dis-
count factor (A2). If we choose the model’s                     parameters to match bond prices, then
the only difference in the call formula is the option volatility,
                                                           ‘r

Whether this is the same as the benchmark                  theory depends on t,he choice of volatility
parameters   {~t }.

    The difficulty with the Black- Derman-Toy      model with respect to pricing options
in our benchmark economy       is similar to that with stochastic discount factors (Propo-
sition 1). Volatilities are defined over the two-dimensional   array indexed hy the length
~ of the option and the maturity n of the bond on which the option is written.         This
array cannot   be replicated   by the one-dimensional     vector of volatility   parameters
{p,}.
