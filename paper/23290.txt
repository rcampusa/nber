                                          ABSTRACT

As health care financing, organization, and delivery innovations proliferate, the need for
comprehensive, detailed data on medical spending has never been more apparent. This study
builds on previous work to provide a more comprehensive accounting of medical spending at the
individual level than has been done in the past. We account for spending by the entire population:
the civilian, non-institutionalized population that is the subject of past studies, as well as high
medical spenders, the institutionalized, the incarcerated, and active-duty military personnel. We
use within-imputation and other adjustments to build a micro dataset and reconcile survey data
based on our estimate of medical spending to the National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA).
The micro dataset we build can be used for more detailed policy evaluations that more closely
reflect true national personal health expenditure at the individual level.

Introduction

       Accurately and comprehensively tracking health care spending by Americans is a central

focus of U.S. government agencies, economists and health service researchers (Rosen and Cutler,

2007, 2009; Aizcorbe et al., 2008). The National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA)

maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) track spending on direct

medical care and other health-related activities (public health, research, etc.) for the entire U.S.

population (NHEA, CMS, 1960-2014).          However, the NHEA do not provide a sample of

individuals with their associated spending. For this reason they cannot be used to study trends in

the concentration of spending by certain populations or for certain types of services beyond

broadly aggregated categories.

       For these more disaggregated types of analyses, researchers generally depend on person

or household level surveys of medical utilization and expenditure. These surveys, including the

Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS),

offer detailed claims and/or self-reported information for each medical service used by survey

respondents. While offering greater detail, micro surveys are generally limited in scope in terms

of their study populations and health services. For example, the MEPS excludes individuals

residing in nursing homes and other facilities, as well as active duty military personnel. Further,

the MEPS is known to underestimate total spending, especially by high-spenders, because of its

reliance on self-report of expenditures (Zuvekas et al. 2009). The MCBS is only for the Medicare

population, omitting a huge portion of total medical dollars. Nevertheless, each of these surveys

is useful for cost-effectiveness analyses, and other policy related studies of medical expenditure

requiring individual-level data.




                                                 2
       In this paper, we present a methodology for adjusting micro surveys to match national

medical spending. Our final product is an individual-level data set of medical spending matching

national total spending that allows for analysis of subpopulations and trends and that is not

limited in its covered population.

       We are not the first to attempt such reconciliation. Past research by Arnett et al. (1990),

Fisher (1980), Waldo et al. (1989), Meara et al. (2004), Selden et al. (2001), Sing et al. (2006),

and Bernard et al. (2012), has also proceeded along these lines. A number of other studies have

used these results in further analyses (Ormond et al., 2011; Finkelstein et al., 2009; Roehrig et

al., 2009). However, these studies have been limited to the non-institutionalized civilian

population; effectively, this excludes roughly 32 percent of personal health care (PHC) spending

in the NHEA (Sing et al., 2006; Rosen and Cutler, 2009). Our analysis expands upon this earlier

work by CMS and AHRQ to include the entire U.S. population, thus allowing for a much richer

analysis of medical spending. We also pay particular attention to spending of high cost

individuals.

       We focus on medical spending in 2002 in order to directly compare our findings with a

reconciliation of the 2002 MEPS and NHEA (Sing et al., 2006). Although a more recent

reconciliation exists for 2007 (Bernard et al., 2012), our work also includes additional sources of

information about non-covered populations.

       We align the NHEA spending and survey-reported spending in terms of covered services

(e.g., hospital care, prescription drugs, etc.) and covered populations (e.g., Medicare

beneficiaries, active duty military, etc.). We exclude only the spending from the PHC-portion of

the NHEA that we would not expect (or desire) to be captured by the micro surveys (e.g.,

hospital non-patient revenue such as from gift shops or parking, spending by non-US residents,



                                                3
etc.). To account for missing populations, we use imputation methods to reflect the size and

demographic profile of the out-of-scope groups. After aligning populations and covered services,

we reconcile the enhanced survey-reported spending with the adjusted NHEA by making a final

adjustment to survey-reported spending. The resulting data matches NHEA totals and accounts

for a comprehensive swath of the US population.

          The rest of the paper is as follows. Section I discusses the data on medical spending.

Sections II and III describe the reconciliation methods in detail. Section IV presents our results

and offers the main conclusions.



I. Data

          Data on aggregate national health expenditures are provided in the National Health

Expenditure Accounts (NHEAs) produced annually by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid

Services (CMS). Within the broad category of health spending, we focus on personal health care

because it captures spending for therapeutic goods and services also measured by the national

micro surveys. Personal health care excludes other health-related endeavors, such as research,

construction, public health activities, and the administrative costs of insurance programs. In

2002, personal health care represented about 84 percent of total national health expenditures.

          Spending for personal health care can be divided by source of funds and category of

service. Categories of service include hospital care, professional services (physicians, clinics,

and dentists), nursing homes, home health agencies, and medical products (prescription drugs,

durable equipment, and non-durable products).

          We use two major surveys to capture individual level healthcare spending. The first one

is the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), which covers the civilian non-institutionalized



                                                 4
population. The second is the 2002 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), sponsored by

CMS and covering Medicare beneficiaries including those in institutions. But, there are several

population groups not covered by either of these surveys. The MEPS does not sample residents

of health care institutions (nursing facilities, homes for the cognitively impaired, etc.), and

neither MEPS nor MCBS include active duty military personnel, incarcerated individuals,

institutionalized non-Medicare population.

        We account for these populations using several other data sets. To account for the

institutionalized non-Medicare population, we use the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey

(NNHS). The NNHS is a nationally representative sample of nursing homes, their services, staff,

and current residents. The survey collects information on residents’ demographic characteristics,

health status, sources of payment, use of medications, and services received. Information on

people in jails and prisons is obtained from the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal

Correctional Facilities (SISFCF) and 2002 tables published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics

(BJS). Information on US deployed active duty military personnel is obtained from the Office of

Army Demographics (2003) and Department of Defense (2002). Next, we describe each of the

data sources in detail.




National Health Expenditure Accounts

       The National Health Expenditure Accounts are produced annually by the Office of the

Actuary at CMS. The NHEA report total spending and its division by source of payment and

category of service. This information is summarized in a series of ‘sources and uses’ of funds

tables, published annually and available via download from the CMS website beginning with

data from 1960. We use the 2010 edition of the 2002 NHEA.


                                               5
       The NHEA are developed from a variety of sources. They are based on aggregate

provider based revenue data sources, such as the US Census Bureau (the Economic Census and

the Service Annual Survey), the American Hospital Association, IMS Health and other

government administrative data. They are believed to be an accurate representation of total

spending, and represent a major contribution to our understanding of medical expenditures in the

U.S. The NHEA offer a comprehensive picture of spending flows over time within the health

care system, identifying both the source and the destination of health expenditure. A typical

NHEA table for 2002 is shown in Table 1, which reports national health expenditures by source

of funds and type of expenditure. Of the estimated $1,636 billion in expenditures in 2002, health

consumption expenditures are $1,534 billion and investment (research and equipment) is $102

billion. In this study, we focus only on the Personal Health Care Expenditures (PHC, $1,372

billion). This includes therapeutic goods and services rendered to a person to treat or prevent a

particular medical condition. Table 1 reports detailed PHC expenditures. PHC service categories

include hospital care ($486 billion), physicians ($341 billion), dental services ($74 billion), other

professional services ($44 billion), other health, residential and personal care expenditures ($78

billion), home health agencies ($37 billion), nursing homes ($94 billion), prescription drugs

($158 billion), durable medical equipment ($27 billion) and other non-durable medical products

($33 billion).




Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)

       The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS was designed to provide detailed

information about the nation's changing health care system. Administered by the Agency for

Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ, the MEPS collects information from several sources


                                                 6
on the types of health services used by respondents, the cost of these services, and how the

services were paid for (Cohen et al. 1996, 1997, 2009). The MEPS sample consists of

households that responded to the prior year’s National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and is

designed to represent the civilian non-institutionalized U.S. population. The basic unit of

analysis is the person, and data are collected for each family member in the household who is

eligible for the survey.

       The MEPS Household Component (HC) consists of an overlapping panel design in which

respondents are interviewed, using a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) system, five

times over thirty months to collect utilization and expenditure data for a minimum of two

consecutive calendar years. A new panel has been introduced each year since the MEPS began in

1996. Expenditure data in the MEPS are primarily self-reported. However, the Medical Provider

Component, which surveys medical providers and pharmacies identified by MEPS-HC

respondents, serves as an imputation source to reduce the level of bias in survey estimates of

medical expenditures due to item non-response and household data of questionable quality. Its

purpose is to supplement household reported data and it is not intended to be an independent

sample of providers for estimation purposes. The purpose of the multi-source data collection is to

build an accurate accounting of health care utilization and expenditure (rather than charges) for

the covered population. In addition, detailed information on respondents’ insurance coverage,

employment, health status and physical functioning, access to care, and demographic and

socioeconomic characteristics is available for the study of different population groups.

       While the MEPS does well in capturing spending on its covered populations, it excludes

certain policy relevant groups. As a survey of the civilian non-institutionalized population, the

MEPS does not include residents of health care institutions (nursing facilities, homes for the



                                                 7
cognitively impaired, etc.), active duty military personnel, incarcerated individuals, citizens

living abroad, or non-citizens in the United States. Trends in the concentration of medical

spending for certain uses or populations cannot be fully understood using the MEPS alone.

Residents of long-term care institutions are arguably the most important group among those

excluded, having disproportionately high medical spending. If an individual transitions from the

community to a nursing home during a survey wave, none of their medical spending (within or

outside of the institution) for the duration of their time in the institution is recorded in MEPS.

       To make the MEPS comparable to the NHEA, Sing et al. (2006) made two major

exclusions to the NHEA: $146 billion for long term care facility expenditures and $52 billion for

acute care expenditures of institutionalized. Out of a total exclusion of $377 billion in Sing et al.

(2006), about $198 billion (52 percent) is for long term and acute care. Other omitted groups in

MEPS include the prison and jail population (Sabol, 2007), those on active military duty,

Americans living overseas (estimated at roughly 4 million in 2000 (American Citizens Abroad

(ACA), 2008)), and high-spenders (Zuvekas et al., 2009).



Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS)

       The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), sponsored by the Centers for

Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), is a nationally representative survey of aged, disabled,

and institutionalized Medicare beneficiaries. It over-samples the very old (aged 85 or older) and

disabled Medicare beneficiaries (Adler, 1994; CMS, 2008b). The survey uses a rotating panel

design whereby panelists are followed over a span of four years, and undergo three interviews

each year. Because it is a person-based survey, the MCBS follows people regardless of whether

they live in a household or a long-term care facility, or switch between the two during the course



                                                  8
of the survey period. The MCBS has been administered continuously since 1991 (the baseline

interviews). It collects information on the health status, health care utilization, expenditures (both

Medicare and non-Medicare payments), health insurance coverage, and socioeconomic and

demographic characteristics of the entire spectrum of Medicare beneficiaries (both elderly and

disabled).

       The central purpose of the MCBS is to collect utilization and source of payment

information for all services used by Medicare beneficiaries, including those not covered by

Medicare (Adler, 1994). MCBS spending data are believed to be reasonably accurate, as self-

reported utilization and expenditure information undergo extensive validation using Medicare

claims data. Further, the MCBS’s method of tracking respondents in the community and

institutions makes it an invaluable source of information on the spending of this under-studied

population. MCBS data demonstrate just how critically important expenditure data are for the

institutionalized population.




The National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS)

       The National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS) is a set of national sample surveys of

nursing homes, their residents, and their staff. Although each of these surveys emphasized

different topics, they all provided some common basic information about nursing homes, their

residents, and their staff. All nursing homes included in this survey had at least three beds and

were either certified (by Medicare or Medicaid) or had a state license to operate as a nursing

home. Data on the facilities were collected through face-to-face interviews with the

administrators and staff and included bed size, ownership, and staffing. Data obtained on

residents included demographic characteristics, functional and health status, diagnoses, services


                                                  9
received, and sources of payment. Information was collected for up to twelve current residents in

each facility.



II. Medical spending adjustments

        The first step in this reconciliation study is to align the micro surveys of medical

spending to the NHEA. Selden et al. (2001) and Sing et al. (2006) attempted these reconciliations

between NHEA and MEPS for 1996 and 2002, respectively. In their work, MEPS-reported

expenditures were reconciled with the comparable components of NHEA expenditures, omitting

those in institutions and their spending. In this study, we make two basic types of adjustments.

First, we remove expenditures from the NHEA for goods and services which are out of scope of

micro surveys (MEPS, MCBS). Second, we redefine some categories of medical service in the

NHEA, MEPS and MCBS (shifting expenditures as appropriate) to create consistent categories

between these three sources. These alignments are similar to previous reconciliations between

the MEPS and the NHEA.



Exclusions from NHEA

        We focus on the Personal Health Care (PHC) portion of the NHEA which, in 2002,

totaled $1.34 trillion. We exclude expenditures not directly related to patient care from the PHC

(Table 1); such as net cost to health insurance ($88,927), government administrative expenses

($21,624 million) and public health activities ($51,870 million), spending on research ($32,016

million) and structures and equipment ($70,028 million), which are not covered in the MEPS-

MCBS. Beyond these non-PHC adjustments, there are five personal health care spending items




                                               10
that need to be removed because they are out of scope of the surveys. These adjustments are

listed in Table 2.

       First, we exclude ‘other non-durable medical equipment’ from the NHEA ($33,292

million). This includes items such as non-prescription drugs, heating pads, bandages and other

similar purchases about which the MEPS and MCBS do not collect information.

       Second, we exclude expenditures on ‘other health, residential and personal care

expenditures’ ($77,597 million), which combines spending for health care in many different

programs including school health, worksite health care, Medicaid home and community based

waivers, some ambulance services, residential mental health and substance abuse facilities, and

other types of health care provided in non-traditional settings. The largest public component is

Medicaid spending and other personal services provided under home and community based

waivers. Out of this $77,597 million, $44,213 million is paid by Medicaid and other state and

federal programs. Following previous reconciliation work (Selden et.al (2001); Sing et al.

(2006)), we exclude this entire category.

       Third, we exclude graduate medical education and disproportionate share payment

($17,000 million). Fourth, we exclude non-patient revenue ($54,599 million) (i.e., revenue

unrelated to the direct provision of medical services, received by health care providers) from

each service category. Hospitals, for example, have non-patient revenue from gift shops and

cafeterias, as well as from philanthropic donations. Such non-patient revenues are present in

several service categories, including hospital, home health, nursing home, and physician and

clinical care. Finally, we exclude services for foreign visitors in US ($1,700 million).

       Together, these exclusions reduce Personal Health Care services to $1,188 billion

compared to $1,372 billion of unadjusted Personal Health Care. In total, we exclude about $184



                                                 11
billion from the category of Personal Health Care as out-of-scope services expenditures. These

exclusions are significantly smaller than those in Sing et.al (2006), where they removed about

$377 billion from Personal Health Care. The reason we remove $193 billion less from the NHEA

as compared to Sing et al. (2006) is that we complement MEPS with additional micro-surveys on

the institutionalized population (MCBS, NNHS) and make additional adjustments (prison,

military) to account for these expenditures.



Alignment of Service Categories

       After we have made the out-of- scope exclusions from the NHEA, our goal is to match by

service categories the total spending in the surveys to the adjusted total spending in the NHEA.

Table 3 illustrates the mapping of service categories between the three sources. Owing to the

tremendous detail available in the MEPS and MCBS, service categories can be constructed fairly

consistently across the three sources. The few remaining differences in the categorization of

expenditures are due to the differences in how each source assigns expenditure. For example,

hospitals provide many services other than direct inpatient services. Expenditures classified as

Hospital Care in the NHEA include revenue for room and board, ancillary services, physician

services (which are not billed separately), inpatient pharmacy, hospital-based nursing home and

hospital-based nursing home care (CMS, 2008(a)). The MEPS and MCBS, on the other hand,

assign expenditure for these services to the prescription drug, nursing home and home health

care categories, respectively. Selden et al. (2001) and Sing et al. (2006) make several other

transfers and substitutions between service categories that are based on both published and

unpublished data.




                                               12
       For the most part, these transfers do not affect total NHEA expenditure but do cause

differences in service-specific total expenditures between the studies. Also, different from our

methods, Selden et al. (2001) and Sing et al. (2006) each separately reconcile Dental, Other

Providers’ and Other Medical Equipment between the MEPS and the NHEA, whereas we

combine Other Providers with Physician and Clinical Services, and combine Dental and other

Medical Equipment into the ‘Other’ category. These differences in methods do not cause

differences in the overall adjustment rate but do contribute to discrepancies in service-specific

expenditures between the MEPS micro survey and the NHEA totals. Following a previous

reconciliation, we make several transfers between the NHEA defined service categories to other

categories. Following previous work, we make two adjustments in the NHEA to reassign

expenditure to be consistent with the MEPS and MCBS service categories. We use unpublished

data provided to Meara, White and Cutler (2004) by the CMS Office of the Actuary on the

proportion of public spending for home health and nursing home care (separately) used to

purchase hospital-based care. These data cover 1990 to 2000, and we linearly extrapolate to

2002. Following Meara, White and Cutler (2004), we use these proportions to impute total

spending on hospital-based home health and nursing care in 2002 ($16 billion and $13 billion,

respectively reported in Table 4). The imputed hospital-based values of Home Health and

Nursing Home Care are calculated as follows: where HBHHIMP = [a/(1-a)] * HHNHEA              and

HBNCIMP = [b/(1-b)]* NCNHEA HHNHEA and NCNHEA are the NHEA Home Health and Nursing

Care totals, a and b are the proportions of public spending on Home Health and Nursing Care

used to purchase hospital-based services, and HBHHIMP and HBNCIMP are our imputed

estimates. We implicitly assume that the same proportion of private expenditures purchase

hospital-based services. Table 4 shows detailed transfers, which follows the work of Sing et al.



                                               13
(2006) unless otherwise noted. For example, we move $1,600 million from Hospital to Other

Personal Health Care and $15,985 million from Hospital to Home Health. In total, we transfer

75,174 million (a little less than 7 percent of total adjusted NHEA) across service categories.


III. Survey data adjustments

       In this section, we explain how we combine different surveys to have a nationally

representative sample on population and spending. We use MEPS as the baseline survey, and add

other surveys/data to account for missing population and spending in MEPS.

       To better understand the health care expenditures made by the Medicare community

population, we create a micro data file combining the MEPS and the MCBS data. To account for

some missing independent variables (demographic) in the survey data, we use standard within-

imputation methods (Rubin, 1987; Schenker and Raghunathan, 2007). This imputation helps us

to use all available survey data without dropping any observations.

       For Medicare-covered community residents, we adjust the sample weights to make sure

that the combined surveys match national population totals. However, the MCBS and MEPS add

to different population totals. In 2002, the Medicare-enrolled community-dwelling population is

estimated at 37.6 million by MCBS (based on Medicare enrollment file) and 39.2 million by

MEPS (Table 5). For this study, we presume the MCBS number is the most accurate (CMS data)

and calibrate weighted totals in the MEPS to the match MCBS totals.

       First, we calibrate the distribution of MEPS sample weights among that survey’s

respondents to the distribution found in the MCBS by medical expenditure, demographic, health

status, and socioeconomic characteristics. To carry this out, we estimate a logistic regression

predicting the propensity to be in the MEPS. We then use the propensity scores to create deciles

of respondents with similar characteristics in both surveys. Within each decile, we inflate or

                                                14
deflate the MEPS weights to the MCBS weights. With these adjusted sample weights, MEPS and

MCBS respondents with similar characteristics now have similar sample weights.

           Our second set of adjustments corrects for double representation of the community-

dwelling Medicare beneficiaries in the linked MEPS-MCBS data. For this group, we adjust

individual sample weights in both surveys so that the sum of the combined data is equal to the

sum of weights found in the MCBS. This adjustment reduces by one-half the individual weights

in the MCBS and the calibrated weights in the MEPS.

                                      kj




           In the MEPS-MCBS concatenated dataset, we have two sets of survey design parameters,

with each survey using different sets of geographic areas to represent the nation. While there is

potential for the sampled areas of one survey to overlap with the sampled areas of the other,

MCBS and MEPS draw their samples in different ways; MCBS is an individual level survey

with its own sampling frame, and MEPS is a household survey which uses the sampling frame

from the prior year’s National Health Interview Survey. Hence, we treat each survey’s sampling

strata and cluster pairs as statistically independent of each other.

           Next, we account for the institutionalized population not covered by Medicare. Of the

nearly 1.5 million people in nursing homes on a typical day in 2004, about 170,000 (or 12

percent) did not have Medicare coverage (National Center for Health Statistics, 2008). To

account for this population, we increase the sample weights in the MCBS so that the sum of the

weights among non-elderly institutionalized respondents reflects this additional population. We

first sample records in the NNHS for people who are under age 65, and for whom nursing home


                                                          15
services are not paid by Medicare. These records reflect a typical daily census, but this work

requires having an annual total of people in an institution. We estimate this with two

adjustments. The first is to adjust the weights so that the 2004 NNHS represents the estimated

2002 population. This adjustment factor is about 0.98. The second is to adjust the weights to

make the NNHS represent the yearly population in institutions rather than a count of people at

one point in the year. This is calculated by comparing the MCBS and NNHS elderly populations.

The adjustment factor for this rotational adjustment is approximately 2.89.

       We concatenate the adjusted NNHS data with records from the MCBS of non-elderly,

Medicare-covered individuals who have institutional spending. To form demographically similar

groups, we estimate a logistic model for being in the MCBS, using the demographic variables

common to the two surveys as the independent variables. We assign respondents to propensity

score quintiles based on having a similar likelihood of being in the MCBS. For each propensity

score quintile, we increase sample weights among the MCBS respondents such that the sum of

the new MCBS weights reflects the number of non-elderly institutionalized persons with nursing

home stays throughout the year from the original MCBS and the NNHS matched data updated to

the annual estimate. This adjustment assumes that the non-Medicare institutionalized are similar

to the Medicare institutionalized, adjusted for age and other demographics.

       To account for the prison population and those on active duty military within the United

States, we adjust the sample weights among MEPS respondents without Medicare coverage. We

start with state and federal prisoners. Data from the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal

Correctional Facilities give a breakdown of prisoners by sex, age, race, and education. We use an

adjustment factor of 1.005 to estimate 2002 numbers (Bureau of Justice Statistics). For each cell,

we adjust upward the sample weights in the MEPS such that the adjusted population size for



                                               16
each group is equal to the size of the original MEPS population as well as the inmate population.

In making this adjustment, we assume that prisoners with a particular age-sex-race-education

profile have health expenses similar to those of community residents with the same profile.

       Next, we use a similar method for active duty military. We use demographic tables on the

five branches of the military for fiscal year 2003 as estimates of age-sex-race group sizes (Office

of Army Demographics, 2003). We use an adjustment factor of 0.59 to account for active duty

military within US.

       Previous studies have shown that individuals with high health care expenditures are

under-represented in the MEPS. Comparing the MEPS to Medicare claims data, Zuvekas et al.

(2009) found a relative absence of high-spenders (expenditures $25,000 and above) in the

MEPS. Comparing the MCBS and the MEPS Medicare community sample, we estimate the

percentage of high-spenders that are missing in the MEPS and adjust the MEPS weights to

account for them. In the MEPS Medicare community sample, we increase the weights for high-

spenders by 1.14. We also decrease the weights for low-spenders by 0.99 in order to keep the

sample size intact. In total, we add about $8 billion for missing high-spenders in the MEPS

Medicare Community population.

       We also adjust the MEPS weights to account for missing high-spenders in the non-

Medicare population. We first estimate that there are about 2 million high-spenders in this

population. Previously, from the concatenated MCBS-MEPS Medicare community data, we

estimated the percentage of high-spenders that are missing in the MEPS. We assume the same

number of missing in the non-Medicare population, and adjust the weights to account for them.

We inflate the weights for high-spenders in the MEPS Medicare community sample by 1.14 and

deflate the weights for low- spenders by 0.99, keeping the non-Medicare community population



                                                17
intact. In total, we add about $15 billion for the missing high-spenders in the MEPS non-

Medicare community population.



IV. Results and Discussion

       Table 5 reports the sample sizes in the different surveys, weighted to reflect the 2002

population. The MEPS represents 285 million people, including 39 million Medicare enrolled

elderly people living in communities. The MCBS represents 41 million beneficiaries covered by

Medicare. Based on information from NNHS, the non-Medicare institutionalized population is

estimated to be about 0.47 million. Prison inmates are estimated to be about 1.4 million, and

active duty military within U.S. about 0.9 million.

        Table 6 show the healthcare spending by service type (hospital care, physician and

clinical services, prescription drugs, etc.), and what portion is funded by Medicare and what

portion is non-Medicare funded. Out of a total of $1,187,763 million in personal healthcare

spending, Medicare paid $251,714 million and the rest $936,049 million is non-Medicare

spending. Approximately, 21% was paid by Medicare.

       Table 7 compares total annual medical expenditure from the adjusted MEPS and MCBS

to total adjusted NHEA spending, by payer and service category. Overall, the survey spending

underestimates national spending by 12.7%. Our estimates using the adjusted micro surveys are

closest to the adjusted NHEA estimates for prescribed medicines, nursing home care, and other

services (including dental care and durable medical equipment (DME)). In addition, our

estimates for expenditures made under the Medicare program are much closer to the NHEA than

for non-Medicare payers. The last column in Table 7 reports how much survey-reported

spending would have to be adjusted in order to equal adjusted NHEA spending.


                                                18
       Figure 1 gives a comprehensive account of this reconciliation study. The NHEA

estimated Personal Health Care expenditures in 2002 are about $1,372 billion, and the national

micro-surveys accounted for $1,036 billion. Of the $336 billion in expenditures that is

unaccounted for, we know that $184 billion is out of scope (See Table 2 for details) of the

micro-surveys. The remaining $152 billion is an undercount of spending in the micro-surveys

and we make adjustment to spending by service category to match the national totals (Table 7).

       This may be mostly due to under-reporting of medical expenditures for the non-Medicare

community population in MEPS. Under-reporting was found to be the most common problem in

a review of 42 studies evaluating the accuracy of self-reported health care utilization data

(Bhandari and Wagner, 2006). Households report their own out-of-pocket payments fairly well

(Machlin et al., 1999), but may not know third party payments at all or report them inaccurately

because of confusion about discounts and contractual arrangements between provider and third

party payers. (Zuvekas et al., 2009).

       Our adjusted NHEA for 2002 is $1,036 billion as compared to $964 billion in Sing et al.

(2006). Thus, our reconciliation removes approximately $184 billion from the NHEA as

compared to $408 billion in Sing et al. (2006). Our total expenditure estimates from MEPS and

additional surveys micro-surveys is $1,036 billion. In Sing et al. (2006) the total adjusted MEPS

expenditure was $831 billion (pooled sample of 2002 and 2003). We reconcile an additional

$205 billion as compared to Sing et al. (2006). This is possible because we have included the

institutionalized population not covered by MEPS.

       Out of $1,036 billion reconciled by different surveys: non-Medicare community

population spending was $498 billion, Medicare community spending was $307 billion, and




                                               19
spending on the institutionalized population, high-spenders and those in prison & the military

was $205, $23 and $3 billion dollar respectively.



Limitations

       It is important to keep in mind that this reconciliation requires several assumptions.

Differences between our estimates and the adjusted NHEA for specific service categories may be

caused by remaining differences in how services are defined in the surveys versus the NHEA.

Thus, the aggregate totals may be more important than the sub-categories. Further, in adjusting

the sample weights to account for sub-populations not covered in the MEPS and MCBS (non-

elderly institutionalized, prison inmates, and active duty military personnel), we implicitly

assume that their health expenditures (adjusted for demographics) are the same as in the

population we can observe. This assumption may not always be accurate.



Conclusions

       The major comparison for our work is the work of Sing et al. (2006). We follow many of

their adjustments to the NHEA, but direct comparison of the estimates is difficult. We remove

less spending from the NHEA, and use the concatenated Medicare community MEPS-MCBS,

MCBS institutionalized data, and MEPS non-Medicare data with adjustments for excluded

populations.

       We construct a more comprehensive dataset of medical spending by American citizens

than has been done in the past, using both the MCBS and MEPS, and accounting for the

institutionalized population, prison inmates, active duty military personnel, and high-spenders.

We reconcile this linked and enhanced MEPS-MCBS dataset to the NHEA, building upon a rich



                                               20
body of prior work by AHRQ and CMS. In total, we remove only 13.4 percent from personal

health care in the NHEA as out-of-scope, and reconcile to remaining comparable spending from

the micro expenditure surveys. This enhanced MEPS-MCBS dataset matched to the NHEA can

be used for more detailed policy evaluations that more closely reflect true national personal

health expenditure at the individual level.
