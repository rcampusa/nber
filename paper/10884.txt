                                             ABSTRACT

Using micro data on virtually all of the drugs and diseases of over 500,000 people enrolled in Puerto

Rico's Medicaid program, we examine the impact of the vintage (original FDA approval year) of

drugs used to treat a patient on the patient's 3-year probability of survival, controlling for

demographic characteristics (age, sex, and region), utilization of medical services, and the nature and

complexity of illness. We find that people using newer drugs during January-June 2000 were less

likely to die by the end of 2002, conditional on the covariates. The estimated mortality rates are

strictly declining with respect to drug vintage. For pre-1970 drugs, the estimated mortality rate is

4.4%. The mortality rates for 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s drugs are 3.6%, 3.0%, and 2.5%, respectively.

The actual mortality rate is about 16% (3.7% vs. 4.4%) lower than it would have been if all of the

drugs utilized in 2000 had been pre-1970 drugs. Estimates for subgroups of people with specific

diseases display the same general pattern.

         Clinical studies of specific new drugs have shown that these drugs increase
survival rates. Here are three examples:

    •    Stenestrand et al (2001) studied the impact on survival of statin treatment
         following acute myocardial infarction. They found that 1-year mortality was
         9.3% in the no-statin group and 4.0% in the statin treatment group.
    •    Grier et al (2003) found that adding two experimental drugs to the standard four-
         drug chemotherapy regimen has significantly improved survival in patients with
         non-metastatic Ewing's sarcoma, a highly malignant bone cancer of children and
         young adults. The overall survival rate increased from 61 percent to 72 percent
         for Ewing's sarcoma patients with localized disease who underwent the
         experimental six-drug chemotherapy.
    •    The journal U.S. Pharmacist (2002) reported that patients suffering from
         advanced metastatic melanoma who were treated with a combination of an
         investigational agent, Ceplene, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) had twice the survival rate
         as patients who were treated with IL-2 only. The patients were enrolled in a three-
         year study. The study also showed that the Ceplene/IL-2 combination
         significantly increased survival in a subpopulation group of advanced metastatic
         melanoma patients with liver metastases. The rate of survival in this group was
         six times that of the group given IL-2 only.

         Also, I have performed several studies using aggregate data (Lichtenberg (2002-
2004)) that indicated that the introduction of new drugs has increased longevity. The
objective of the present study is to examine the impact of the vintage (original FDA
approval year) of drugs used to treat a patient on the patient’s probability of survival,
using micro data on virtually all drugs and diseases from Puerto Rico’s Medicaid
program, which covers about 1.5 million people.1, 2

I. Econometric framework

         To determine the effect of the vintage distribution of a person’s prescribed
medicines on probability of death, conditional on demographic characteristics (age, sex,
and region), utilization of medical services, and the nature and complexity of illness, I
will estimate the following model:


1
  I am grateful to the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration (ASES) for providing me access to the
data. ASES does not necessarily endorse or accept the conclusions of this study.
2
  I hypothesize that survival also depends on the vintage (year of invention or market introduction) of
medical products and services other than drugs, such as laboratory tests and radiological and surgical
procedures. Unfortunately our ability to measure the vintage of these other products and services is much
more limited than out ability to measure the vintage of drugs. I plan to address this issue in future research.
                                                                                        3



         DIEDi = β1970 POST1970i + β1980 POST1980i + β1990 POST1990i + γ Zi + εi

where:

   DIEDi = 1 if individual i died during the period 2000-2002
          = 0 otherwise
POST1970i = the fraction of individual i’s prescribed medicines whose active
          ingredients were approved by the FDA after 1970
POST1980i = the fraction of individual i’s prescribed medicines whose active
          ingredients were approved by the FDA after 1980
POST1990i = the fraction of individual i’s prescribed medicines whose active
          ingredients were approved by the FDA after 1990
       Zi = a vector of covariates
       εi = a disturbance

Suppose individual A consumed only medicines approved in 1985. For that individual,
POST70 = POST80 = 1, and POST90 = 0. Hence E(DIEDA | ZA) = β1970 + β1980.
Suppose individual B consumed only medicines approved in 1995. For that individual,
POST70 = POST80 = POST90 = 1. Hence E(DIEDB | ZB) = β1970 + β1980 + β1990, and
E(DIEDB | ZB) - E(DIEDA | ZA) = β1990. The parameter β1990 may be interpreted as the
difference between the death probability of people consuming only post-1990 medicines
and that of people consuming only pre-1991 medicines. More generally:

If all drugs     …then E(DIEDi | Zi) =
consumed by
individual i
contained
ingredients
approved
in…
1965             k
1975             k + β1970
1985             k + β1970 + β1980
1995             k + β1970 + β1980 + β1990

where k is a constant.

Hence
                                                                                                        4


The             …may be interpreted as this difference:
parameter…
β1970           1970s drugs vs. pre-1970 drugs death probability
β1980           1980s drugs vs. 1970s drugs death probability
β1990           1990s drugs vs. 1980s drugs death probability

II. Data and measurement

        ASES provided me with all medical and pharmacy claims of ASES beneficiaries
during the period January 1-June 30, 2000. There were about 12.2 million claims.
        Demographic information. The following demographic variables could be
determined from the claims records:
    •   The person’s sex
    •   The person’s age
    •   The geographic region in which services were provided

        Unfortunately, we lack data on other personal attributes, such as education and
income.    But unobserved heterogeneity with respect to income is limited by the fact that,
to be eligible for Medicaid in Puerto Rico, annual income of a family of four could not
exceed $16,440 (in the year 2002).

        Person’s utilization of services.

    •   The person’s number of medical claims (physician encounters)
    •   The person’s number of hospital admissions
    •   The person’s number of pharmacy claims

        Vintage distribution of pharmacy claims. Each pharmacy claim3 included the
National Drug Code (NDC). I determined the active ingredient(s) contained in each
NDC from Multum’s Lexicon. I determined the earliest FDA approval date of each
active ingredient from standard commercial pharmaceutical databases, i.e. Gold Standard
Multimedia’s Clinical Pharmacology 2000 and Mosby's Drug Consult. Using this
information, I calculated, for each pharmaceutical claim, the values (0 or 1) of POST70,
POST80, and POST90. I then calculated, for each individual, the average values of


3
 I examined outpatient pharmacy claims (which contain NDC codes), but not hospital and medical claims
for drugs administered by providers (e.g. chemotherapy), which contain J-codes and other HCPCS codes.
In future research I plan to account for all drug claims.
                                                                                                       5

POST70, POST80, and POST90, i.e. the fraction of the individual’s Rx’s that were for
drugs approved after 1970, 1980, and 1990.
        Nature of person’s illnesses. The medical claims include ICD9 (diagnosis)
codes. I grouped these codes into the following 15 broad disease groups:4

Disease        ICD9            Disease group
category       codes
1              001-139         infectious and parasitic diseases
2              140-239         neoplasms
3              240-279         endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, and immunity
                               disorders
4              280-289         diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs
5              290-319         mental disorders
6              320-389         diseases of the nervous system and sense organs
7              390-459         diseases of the circulatory system
8              460-519         diseases of the respiratory system
9              520-579         diseases of the digestive system
10             580-629         diseases of the genitourinary system
11             680-709         diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue
12             710-739         diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue
13             740-759         congenital anomalies
14             760-779         certain conditions originating in the perinatal period
15             780-799         symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions

        I then calculated DISEASE_SHAREij (j = 1, 2,…, 15): the fraction of person i’s
diagnoses that were in each disease category. For example, if all of person i’s diagnoses
were diabetes, then DISEASE_SHAREij = 1 if j = 3 and DISEASE_SHAREij = 0 if j ≠ 3.
If person i had 3 circulatory diagnoses and one digestive diagnosis, then
DISEASE_SHAREij = 0.75 if j = 7, DISEASE_SHAREij = .25 if j = 9, and
DISEASE_SHAREij = 0 for all other j.
        In addition to measuring the shares of diagnoses in each disease category, I
calculated the person’s “effective number” of diseases. Rather than simply counting the
number of disease categories in which a person’s diagnoses fell, I computed the
following index:

        N_DISEASEi = 1 / Σj DISEASE_SHAREij2

4
 I excluded women with diagnoses of complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium (ICD9
codes 630-677) from the sample.
                                                                                                       6



If all of a person’s diagnoses fell in one disease category, then N_DISEASEi = 1. If half
of a person’s diagnoses fell in one disease category, and half fell in a second category,
then N_DISEASEi = 2. If 90% of a person’s diagnoses fell in one disease category, and
10% fell in a second category, then N_DISEASEi = 1 / (.92 + .12) = 1.22.
          Mortality. The Department of Health provided me with a list of (encrypted)
social security numbers of all Puerto Rican residents who died during the period 2000-
2002. I merged this list with the January 1-June 30, 2000 ASES claims data; this allowed
me to determine whether or not an ASES beneficiary who had utilized services during
January 1-June 30, 2000 had died by the end of 2002:

          DIEDi = 1 if person i died by the end of 2002

                 = 0 otherwise

Descriptive statistics. Sample means of the variables are shown in the following table.5

 For all variables except POST70, POST80, and POST90, the sample size is approximately 794,000. For
POST70, POST80, and POST90, the sample size is approximately 542,000: about a third of beneficiaries
had no pharmaceutical claims.

    diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective
    tissue                                                                        6.8%
    congenital anomalies                                                          0.4%
    certain conditions originating in the perinatal period                        0.1%
    symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions                                   7.5%

The three-year mortality rate is 3.1%. This seems consistent with published mortality
data for Puerto Rico. According to the United Nations, the crude (annual) death rate in
Puerto Rico during 2000-2005 under “medium variant” mortality assumptions is 8.3 per
1,000 population.6 This implies a three-year mortality rate of approximately 2.49% (= 3
* 0.83%). Mortality of ASES beneficiaries may be somewhat higher than that of other
residents of Puerto Rico.
          We can compare the vintage distribution of drugs used by ASES beneficiaries to
the vintage distribution of drugs used by all Americans and by American Medicaid
beneficiaries using the 2000 Prescribed Medicines file of the Household Component of
the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), which is conducted by the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality. This comparison is shown in Figure 1. The fraction of
ASES Rx’s that were approved after 1970 (63.2%) is similar to the fraction of U.S.
Medicaid Rx’s that were approved after 1970 (61.7%). However, the fractions of ASES
Rx’s that were approved after 1980 and 1990 (29.7% and 8.2%) are much smaller than
the fractions of U.S. Medicaid Rx’s7 that were approved after 1980 and 1990 (48.4% and
25.5%). Use of older drugs in Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program may be partly
attributable to the fact that, in Puerto Rico, the physician bears the costs of the drugs—the
cost is deducted from the physician’s capitation payment.

  We consider any Rx for which Medicaid paid at least part of the cost to be a Medicaid Rx.

III. Empirical results

        OLS estimates of the mortality model based on the entire population of ASES
beneficiaries with pharmaceutical claims (N = 539,750) are shown in Table 1.8 The
dependent variable is DIED: a dummy variable equal to one if the person died during
2000-2002, otherwise equal to zero.9 In addition to the three drug-vintage variables
(POST70, POST80, and POST90), the model includes: three utilization variables
(number of medical, pharmacy, and hospital claims), 15 diagnosis category variables, the
index of the number of diseases (N_DISEASE), 9 region dummy variables, and 200
single-year-of-age-by-sex dummy variables (not shown to conserve space).
        The coefficients of all three drug-vintage variables are negative and highly
significant (p-value < .0001), which is consistent with the hypothesis that ASES
beneficiaries using newer drugs during January-June 2000 were less likely to die by the
end of 2002, conditional on the covariates. Before considering the implications of the
drug-vintage coefficients in detail, we will discuss salient features of the coefficients on
the covariates.
        The coefficients on all three utilization variables are positive and highly
significant: people who used more medical services during January-June 2000 were more
likely to die by the end of 2002. For example, one additional medical claim (physician
visit) is associated with a .0031 (about 8%) increase in the probability of death. Although
utilization of medical services presumably reduces mortality, given initial (pre-treatment)
health status, people in the worst initial health utilize the most medical services.
Including the three utilization variables (as well as the diagnosis category and
demographic variables) is therefore likely to control for initial health status, which is
unobserved and might be correlated with drug vintage (although the sign of the potential
correlation is not clear).
        The coefficients on the diagnosis category variables indicate differences in
mortality rates associated with different diagnoses. They are plotted in Figure 2. By a
large margin, people diagnosed with neoplasms had the highest mortality rate. Diseases

  Due to the large number of regressors (described below), I estimated a linear probability model, rather
than a probit model.

  The mean of the dependent variable is 3.7%. This is higher than the 3.1% figure reported above, which
included ASES beneficiaries with no pharmacy claims.

of the blood and blood-forming organs and diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue
are two other high-mortality conditions. The lowest-mortality conditions include mental
disorders, diseases of the nervous system and sense organs, and diseases of the
musculoskeletal system and connective tissue.
         The coefficient on N_DISEASE is negative and highly significant, which is
somewhat surprising. This indicates that, conditional on the distribution of diagnoses a
person had (and other covariates), the greater the effective number of diseases the person
had, the lower the probability of death.
         The coefficients on the region dummy variables indicate differences in mortality
rates associated with different regions. They are plotted in Figure 3. The mortality rate
in Suroeste is almost 1.5 percentage points higher than the mortality rate in the second-
highest region, Este. The regions with the lowest mortality rates are Montana, Guayama,
and Arecibo.
         Estimates by condition. In addition to estimating the model using data on the
entire population of ASES beneficiaries with pharmaceutical claims, I also estimated the
model separately for people with three specific diagnoses: (1) diseases of the circulatory
system; (2) endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, and immunity disorders
(primarily diabetes); and (3) neoplasms. All three of these conditions exhibit relatively
high mortality rates (above 6%), and the first two are highly prevalent (affecting at least
one-sixth of the population). There were more than 2600 deaths in each group of people.
         Rather than reporting the complete set of estimates (as in Table 1) for each group,
we report just the coefficients of the three drug-vintage variables, as well as means of key
variables for each group, in Table 2.
         The first column of Table 2 shows estimates for the entire population (copied
from Table 1). The coefficients of the three drug-vintage variables (lines 11, 12, and 13)
indicate differences between the mortality rates of people using drugs of different
vintages. By combining these coefficients with the average mortality rate (line 3) and the
vintage distribution of drugs (lines 7-10), we can infer the (levels of) mortality rates of
people using drugs of different vintages.10

  As argued above, if the mortality rate of people using pre-1970 drugs is equal to k, then the mortality rate
of people using 1970s drugs is (k + β1970), the mortality rate of people using 1980s drugs is
                                                                                                         10

         The vintage-specific mortality rates are shown in lines 14-17 of Table 2 and
plotted in Figure 4. The estimated mortality rates are strictly declining with respect to
drug vintage. For pre-1970 drugs, the estimated mortality rate is 4.4%. The mortality
rates for 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s drugs are 3.6%, 3.0%, and 2.5%, respectively. The
differences in mortality rates are highly statistically significant (p-value < .0001).
         We can use these estimates to compare the actual mortality rate in the ASES
population (resulting from the actual vintage distribution of drugs) to what the mortality
rate would have been, given alternative hypothetical vintage distributions of drugs. We
consider two such alternative distributions:
    •    POST1970 = 0%: this would have characterized the distribution of drugs in 1970
    •    The vintage distribution of U.S. Medicaid Rx’s in 2000
         The results of these calculations are shown in Figure 5. The actual mortality rate
is about 16% (3.7% vs. 4.4%) lower than it would have been if all of the drugs utilized in
2000 had been pre-1970 drugs. There would have been almost 3800 more deaths in the
ASES population during 2000-2002 if all of the drugs utilized in 2000 had been pre-1970
drugs. This suggests that new drugs introduced during 1970-2000 reduced the mortality
rate by about 0.58% (= (1 / 30) * ln(4.4% / 3.7%)) per year.
         I would like to compare this figure to time-series mortality data for Puerto Rico
during the period 1970-2000. I don’t have time-series data on the age-adjusted mortality
rate of Puerto Rico during this period, but I do have data on the age-adjusted mortality



(k + β1970 + β1980), etc. To determine these mortality rates, we simply need to solve for k. The overall
mortality rate is the weighted average of these mortality rates, weighted by the percentage of people using
drugs from each period:

MORTAVG = (DRUG%PRE1970 * k) + (DRUG%1970s * (k + β1970)) +
 (DRUG%1980s * (k + β1970 + β1980)) + (DRUG%1990s * (k + β1970 + β1980 + β1990))

where

MORTAVG = mean(DIED)
DRUG%PRE1970 = mean(1 – POST70)
DRUG%1970s = mean(POST70 – POST80)
DRUG%1980s = mean(POST80 – POST90)
DRUG%1990s = mean(POST90)

k = MORTAVG – ((DRUG%1970s * β1970) + (DRUG%1980s * (β1970 + β1980)) + (DRUG%1990s *
(β1970 + β1980 + β1990)))
                                                                                                   11

rate of the U.S. during the period 1979-1998 (see Figure 6).11 The age-adjusted mortality
rate of the U.S. declined at an annual average rate of 0.71% during the period 1979-1998
(and, due to the large jump between 1979 and 1980, it declined at an annual average rate
of 0.92% during the period 1980-1998). Moreover, in both Puerto Rico and the U.S., life
expectancy increased much more rapidly in the 1970s than it has done since 1980.12
Therefore, our estimates’ implication that new drugs introduced during 1970-2000
reduced the mortality rate by about 0.58% per year is not implausible. At the same time,
the estimates imply that the introduction of new drugs accounted for a significant fraction
of the long-run decline in Puerto Rican mortality.
          As noted earlier, percentages of post-1980 and post-1990 Rx’s are much lower in
ASES than they are in U.S. Medicaid. The estimates imply that if the ASES vintage
distribution were the same as U.S. Medicaid’s, ASES’s mortality rate would have been
5.3% lower (3.5% vs. 3.7%), and there would have been almost 1100 fewer deaths in the
ASES population during 2000-2002.
          Estimates by disease group. Columns 2-4 of Table 2 present estimates of the
model for each of three groups: (1) people with diseases of the circulatory system; (2)
people with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, and immunity disorders
(primarily diabetes); and (3) people with neoplasms. Estimated vintage-specific
mortality rates, by condition, are shown in Figure 7. With only one exception (post-1990
drugs for people with neoplasms), within each group the coefficients of all three drug-
vintage variables are negative and highly significant, which is consistent with the

hypothesis that ASES beneficiaries using newer drugs during January-June 2000 were
less likely to die by the end of 2002, conditional on the covariates.

   IV.      Summary

         The Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration (ASES) contracts with private
managed care organizations to provide health care services for approximately 1.5 million
people, or 40% of the population of Puerto Rico. We examined the impact of the vintage
(original FDA approval year) of drugs used to treat a patient on the probability of
survival, conditional on demographic characteristics (age, sex, and region), utilization of
medical services, and the nature and complexity of illness, using ASES data covering
over half a million people. I could not control for education and income, but to be
eligible for Medicaid in Puerto Rico, annual income of a family of four could not exceed
$16,440 (in the year 2002).
         We found that ASES beneficiaries using newer drugs during January-June 2000
were less likely to die by the end of 2002, conditional on the covariates. The estimated
mortality rates are strictly declining with respect to drug vintage. For pre-1970 drugs, the
estimated mortality rate is 4.4%. The mortality rates for 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s drugs
are 3.6%, 3.0%, and 2.5%, respectively. The differences in mortality rates are highly
statistically significant (p-value < .0001).

         The actual mortality rate is about 16% (3.7% vs. 4.4%) lower than it would have
been if all of the drugs utilized in 2000 had been pre-1970 drugs. This suggests that new
drugs introduced during 1970-2000 reduced the mortality rate by about 0.58% per year.
This is not implausible, in light of the time-series data on mortality. The introduction of
new drugs appears to have accounted for a significant fraction of the long-run decline in
Puerto Rican mortality.
         Percentages of post-1980 and post-1990 Rx’s are much lower in ASES than they
are in U.S. Medicaid. The estimates imply that if the ASES vintage distribution were the
same as U.S. Medicaid’s, ASES’s mortality rate would have been 5.3% lower (3.5% vs.
3.7%). Use of older drugs in Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program may be partly attributable
to the fact that, in Puerto Rico, the physician bears the costs of the drugs—the cost is
deducted from the physician’s capitation payment.

        In addition to estimating the model for the entire ASES population, we estimated
the model separately for three groups: (1) people with diseases of the circulatory system;
(2) people with endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, and immunity disorders
(primarily diabetes); and (3) people with neoplasms. With only one exception, within
each group the coefficients of all three drug-vintage variables were negative and highly
significant.
        In this study, we did not control for the effect of the vintage of medical products
and services other than drugs on survival, and this may have affected our estimates of the
effect of drug vintage. We plan to address this issue in future research.
