                                           ABSTRACT

We estimate the impact of the tariffs that U.S. export crops face on farmland rental rates. The
estimation of the impact of the localized measure on the rents faces two aggregation problems
that lead to identification challenges: a) aggregating tariffs across trading partners to obtain crop-
specific tariffs, and b) aggregating the crop-specific tariffs across crops to obtain the localized
measure. Utilizing shift-share style approaches, we find that a one percent increase in the
localized tariff reduces the rents by about 2.6 - 5.3% point, which implies that the 2018 Chinese
retaliatory tariffs would reduce the rents by about 2%.

1     Introduction

The importance of international markets for U.S. agriculture is difficult to overstate. As
U.S. agricultural production grows faster than domestic demand, the importance of ex-
port markets becomes larger; for instance, about 20% of grains, and 39% of oilseeds are
sold overseas (USDA, 2019b). The reliance of U.S. agriculture on export markets has
been greatly facilitated by efforts to lower trade barriers. For example, the implementa-
tion of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 contributed to a
68% increase in U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico within five years of its
signature (Jiang, 2016). Similarly, U.S. agricultural exports to China increased by nearly
185% within the five years following China's accession to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in 2001 (FAS, 2018). While U.S. agricultural imports have also grown substan-
tially, the agricultural sector has displayed steady trade surpluses (Beckman, Dyck, and
Heerman, 2017). Moreover, about a third of cash revenue in the agricultural sector comes
from exports (Schnepf, 2017). The benefits of agricultural exports spill over to the wider
economy: it is estimated that, as recently as 2016, agriculture exports sustained more
than one million full-time jobs, two-thirds of which were non-farm (USDA, 2019a).
    Although the potential benefits of trade are many, international trade reallocates re-
sources within the economy, resulting in winning and losing sectors. The concerns about
these disparate effects are evident in the historical evolution of the studies looking at
the effects of increased trade liberalization on wage inequality in the U.S. manufacturing
sector. Several studies stated that the impacts of competition with low-income countries
on U.S. labor markets had been limited given that low-wage countries had only little
influence on U.S. import markets (e.g. Katz and Autor, 1999; Krugman, 2000). However,
recent empirical studies on the effects of the rapid growth of low-wage countries, particu-
larly China, on regional U.S. labor markets, find lower wages and higher unemployment
in the communities most exposed to Chinese imports (Autor, Dorn, and Hanson, 2013;
Acemoglu et al., 2015). In contrast to the case of manufacturing, we lack rigorous em-
pirical evidence on the impacts of agricultural trade liberalization on the income of the
factors directly employed in U.S. agriculture despite the increasing U.S agricultural ex-

                                            1
ports caused by the recent economic growth in China and other low-income and emerging
countries such as Mexico (USDA, 2019a).
   Therefore, in this paper, we directly estimate the effect of localized exposure to for-
eign market accessibility on the farmland rental rates. Our objective is to empirically
document the overall effect of the localized exposure to the changes in tariffs that the
U.S. exports of agricultural commodities face. Constructing a localized measure of the
exposure to the tariffs faced by the U.S. exports and the estimation of the impact of
the localized tariff exposure on the U.S. cash rents have two aggregation problems that
may lead to identification challenges. First, we need to aggregate the tariffs imposed
by various trading partners on the U.S. exports to obtain crop-specific tariffs that the
U.S. exports face. And then, we compute the localized measure of the tariff exposures
by aggregating the crop-specific tariffs across crops at the local level. We discuss how
using contemporaneous shares for both aggregation problems leads to endogeneity bias
and propose to use the shares of the base period for the aggregations.
   We then conduct prediction exercises for the 2018 Chinese retaliatory tariffs using the
estimated impact of the changes in the localized tariff exposure with and without consid-
ering the trade volume allocations as responses to the retaliatory tariffs. To incorporate
the trade volume reallocation, we estimate the counterfactual localized tariffs using the
Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model (Hertel, 1997). We focus on the imposition
of tariffs on U.S. field crops imposed by China as retaliation from the implementation of
U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports (Taheripour and Tyner, 2018; Regmi, 2019). Although
the tariffs imposed by China went up by 10 to 25% depending on the crops, this does
not mean that the U.S. exports automatically face the equivalent increases in the tariffs.
As China discourages the U.S. exports, they get diverted to other markets with different
tariffs (Hubbs, 2018; Taheripour and Tyner, 2018). As a result, the final export-volume-
weighted average tariff will tend to be lower than the net tariff imposed by China. The
resulting tariff will depend on the time horizon under consideration. In the short run,
the weighted-average tariffs will be affected only by the readjustment of trade flows. We
use the GTAP model to predict the readjustment and thus the weighted-average tariffs.

The exercises provide important insights into the effects of the recent trade war on the
profitability of the U.S. agriculture and the incidence of those on the landowners.
   The availability of data on the county-level cash rents limits our study to the period
2008­2017. By the beginning of this period, most of the tariff reductions agreed upon
during the WTO Uruguay Round were already in place. Likewise, agricultural trade
within North America was mostly liberalized. This limits the variation of tariffs across
destination markets to recent few consequential events. Chiefly among these is the U.S.--
Korea Free Trade Agreement, that went into force in early 2012 (Baylis, Coppess, and
Xie, 2017). Another important source of dynamism in tariffs during this period is China's
increased consumption of U.S. commodities (Gale, Hansen, and Jewison, 2015). Despite
the limited sample period, there still exist informative variations within and across the
sample counties (see section 2 and figure 5).
   We find a negative and significant effect of the localized tariffs on the cash rents of non-
irrigated fields in the U.S. counties. The finding is consistent across different specifications
that mitigates the potential endogeneity concerns arise from the simultaneity across the
profitability, the destination-specific export shares, and the local crop shares. From our
preferred specification, we find that a one percent increase in ad valorem equivalent of the
localized tariff reduces the cash rents by about 2.6­5.3% point. This estimated impact
indicates that the 2018 Chinese retaliatory tariff would be translated to a 2% reduction
in the cash rents.
   The empirical evidence on the effects of market accessibility for the U.S. agriculture
is relatively scarce, with the notable exception of Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016), which
uses railroad expansion during 1870­1890 as a proxy for changes in domestic and foreign
market access to estimate the effects of freer trade on U.S. land values. A potential factor
explaining the lack of empirical assessment of trade liberalization on the returns to the
factors employed by agriculture is the difficulty of linking geographically disaggregated
economic units, such as counties, to trade shocks faced by the U.S. as a whole. We con-
tribute to the literature by utilizing variations in recent changes in the trade environment
that the U.S. agriculture faces, and the "shift-share" style approaches to link those vari-


                                               3
ations to the local farmland rental rates. Another relevant but richer literature that we
attempt to contribute to is the literature on the incidence of farm programs (e.g. Kirwan,
2009; Hendricks, Janzen, and Dhuyvetter, 2012). How much of the benefits from the U.S.
farm programs that the landowners are capturing has been a great interest to researchers
and policy-makers. Our findings on how the changes in trade environments translate to
the rental rates have related implications.
    A recent and influential growing literature has made enormous progress refining the
use of "shift-share" designs (e.g. Bartik, 1991; Autor, Dorn, and Hanson, 2013; Kovak,
2013; Jaeger, Ruist, and Stuhler, 2018; Ad~
                                          ao, Koles´
                                                   ar, and Morales, 2019), which consist
on obtaining measures of within-country spatially disaggregated variation in shocks which
are only observed at the country level (e.g., trade or immigration), using initial sectoral
employment shares. The theoretical underpinnings of this strategy were greatly improved
by Kovak (2013), who developed theoretically-consistent aggregation schemes based on
the specific factor model of Jones (1975). Note that these studies are concerned with
the effects of reducing owns tariffs (e.g. Topalova, 2010; Kovak, 2013) or importing more
from China (e.g. Autor, Dorn, and Hanson, 2013), on local labor markets. These recent
developments motivate our proposed estimation approach.



2     Data

We use annual county-level data of cash rents for non-irrigated fields in the U.S. from
2008 to 2014 and from 2016 to 2017 collected by the National Agricultural Statistics
Service (NASS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (U.S. Department of
Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2018). Note that NASS did not
conduct the cash rent survey in 2015. We choose the counties with more than one year
of observations from the NASS cash rent survey, which leads to 2,534 counties. The per
acre cash rental rates are adjusted by the producer price index with 1982 being base year
(Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018).
    To connect the tariffs imposed on the U.S. exports by importing countries to the



                                              4
changes in the farmland rental rates, we focus on seven field crops that the U.S. exports:
barley, corn, oats, sorghum, soybeans, upland cotton, and wheat. We hypothesize that
the tariffs faced by the U.S. exports of these crops affect the cash rental rates of non-
irrigated fields. To measure the importance of each crop for a given county, we compiled
the planted acreage data from NASS survey data. Since the NASS survey combines
counties in a district with small numbers of planted acreages into a single observation
per year, we do not observe the planted acreages for all seven crops in all of our sample
counties. For counties with missing values for the planted acreages, we treat them as
zeros. We also subtract the irrigated planted acreage from the planted acreage to focus
on non-irrigated farmlands. We also obtain the annual production values by crop from
the NASS survey data.
   By combining the compiled planted acreage data with the county-level total cropland
data from the two rounds of the Census of Agriculture (U.S. Department of Agriculture,
National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2014), we compute the shares of each crop. We
subtract the irrigated cropland that was harvested from total cropland and then use
this as the denominator--representing total non-irrigated cropland area--for calculating
the crop shares. We observe some shares greater than one, which can be due to the
discrepancy between the Census and the survey data and in such cases we replace them
with one. We also use the weather data from the Parameter-elevation Regressions on
Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) and compute the growing degree days (GDDs) and
the heating degree days (HDDs) using daily data from April to September following
Schlenker and Roberts (2009). The temperature thresholds for GDDs are 10 and 30
degrees Celsius and 30 degree Celsius for HDDs.
   We obtain the tariff and trade volume data from the World Integrated Trade Solution
(WITS) database developed by the World Bank (World Integrated Trade Solution, World
Bank, 2019) that enables users to run queries to obtain relevant trade and tariff data from
UNCTAD Trade Analysis Information System (TRAINS) and UNSD Commodity Trade
(UN Comtrade). We extract the importer-exporter pair level data for the seven field
crops using 4-digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HS) codes (1001; 1003; 1004; 1005; 1007;


                                            5
1201; 5201).
   The TRAINS database does not necessarily include all relevant tariff lines. For exam-
ple, preferential tariff rates are missing for Mexico in years 2011­2013 and 2015­2016 and
TRAINS reports that the effectively applied tariffs (AHS) that Mexico applied to some
of the U.S. imports are equal to the most-favored-nation tariff rates (MFN). However, it
is not reasonable to assume that Mexico applied the MFN to the imports from the U.S.
in those years since the U.S. and Mexico were in the NAFTA. Thus, in such cases, it is
reasonable to assume that the preferential tariff rates are simply not reported. Therefore,
if we observe any preferential tariff for a given reporter-partner pair for a given HS code
in certain years but do not observe for the later years from the years with the preferential
tariff, we replace the AHS with the preferential tariff from the most recent year. We also
replace the AHS with the preferential tariff if both AHS and the preferential tariff are
reported and the AHS is larger than the preferential tariff.
   Also, the TRAINS database does not take account the Tariff-Rate Quota (TRQ)
implementation and generally reports the out-of-quota tariff rates. We believe that the
out-of-quota tariff rates are reasonable for the most of countries since quotas are usually
binding or close to be filled for the seven crops except for China. Chinese TRQs have not
been filled for corn and wheat and the fill rates have been quite low (Chen, Villoria, and
Xia, forthcoming). Thus, for Chinese imports of U.S. corn and wheat we replace with the
in-quota rate of 1%. Finally, there are missing years in the TRAINS and UN Comtrade
database for some of the importer-exporter pairs. We impute the missing years by using
the average of the consecutive years around the missing years if they are not missing.
Our results are robust with respect to this imputation and we report the results without
the imputation in the Appendix.
   Figure 1 shows the 2008­2017 average of the cash rental rates of non-irrigated farm-
lands for each county. As expected, the counties in the Corn Belt states (e.g. Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa) have higher rents on average compared other counties. Figure 2 shows
the percentage changes between the average of 2008­2012 and the average of 2013­2017.
While the Corn Belt counties have high cash rental rates on average throughout the


                                             6
sample period, the counties located in North and South Dakotas, Nebraska, Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio experienced substantial increases in their cash rental
rates.

and started to increase since. Note that the number of observations is smaller in 2008
compared to other years since rents were reported for a lot fewer counties in 2008 (1,236
counties in 2008 whereas other years have reported counties range from 2,159 to 2,240).
One concern from the difference in the number of counties between 2008 and the other
years is the attrition problem and thus, we conduct our main analyses when we exclude
the 2008 data and results are robust (see the Appendix).

   Finally, table 1 displays the summary statistics for the key variables including cash
rents, crop shares, localized tariff exposures and weather variables for the full sample, the
subsamples of 2008 - 2012 and of 2013 - 2107. As shown by figures 2 and 3, cash rents
are greater during the last five years of the sample. Corn and soybeans have the largest
shares among the seven field crops throughout the sample period accounting for about

                                                                                                                                         9
20% of non-irrigated croplands in the sample counties.
   To compute the localized tariff exposures, we consider the following three approaches
(See section 3 for the detailed discussion on these approaches). The first approach is
use contemporaneous export shares and contemporaneous crop shares to calculated the
average tariff for each county. The second approach uses the contemporaneous export
shares, but holds crop shares fixed at initial levels. The third approach holds the export
shares and crop shares fixed at the initial levels. During the first five years, the average
localized tariff exposures range from 3.0 to 3.7 % ad valorem equivalent and become
smaller in the last five years with 1.0 ­ 1.2 % ad valorem equivalent.
   Figure 5 shows the boxplots of tariff rates across commodities to illustrate the distri-
bution across counties in each year using the three different approaches to calculate the
localized tariffs, LT . While the overall trend of reductions in LT is consistent across the
three different approaches, year-to-year variations differ. The two LT measures that uses
the contemporaneous export share are relatively similar compared to the one with the
export shares help constant at the initial period because the trade flows have a greater
degree of variation compared to local crop shares.

3       Model

To motivate our main empirical approach, we start with the following simple expression
of crop-specific net profit function for county i and crop j , which can be represented as:


                                                                       
(1)                        P rof itij = pj (j , j )qj (Xij , zi ) - W Xij


where pj and qj are the price and the quantity produced, W is the vector of input prices,
j and j are the export tariff and the (non-tariff) price shifters, zi is the vector of county-
                               
specific characteristics, and Xij is the vector of optimal input uses, which are functions
of pj , zi , and W . To avoid notational clutter, we omit the time subscript for now. We
linearly approximate equation (1) as


(2)                       P rof itij = 0 + 1 j + 2 j + W + zi .


      Assuming a competitive land rental market, we express the county average rental rate
as the acreage-weighted average of crop-specific net profit functions, which is

                                     j (0   + 1 j + 2 j + W + zi )Aij
                       Renti =
                                                    j Aij

(3)                        =         (0 + 1 j + 2 j + W + zi )Sij
                                 j

                          = 0 + 1           j Sij + 2       j Sij + W + zi
                                        j               j


where Aij is the planted acreage of crop j in county i, and Sij is the share of planted
acreage in total cropland for crop j in county i. Note that            j   Sij = 1.


3.1      Empirical Approach

Equation (3) leads to our main empirical equation of interest:


(4)               Rentit = 0 + 1 LTit + Xit + 1s t + 2s t2 + ui + vt + it




                                                 12
where LTit is the localized (ad valorem) tariff exposure, and Xit is the vector of other
covariates including weather variables, and ui and vt are county and year fixed effects. We
also include state-specific quadratic time trends to control for region-specific evolution of
cash rents and LT over time. The parameter of interest is 1 , which is the effect of the
localized tariff on the cash rents. We define the localized (ad valorem) export tariff rate
for county i in year t as


(5)                                     LTit =            jt × Sijt
                                                     j


where jt is an aggregated tariff that is faced by the U.S. export of crop j in year t and Sijt
is the weight that represents the share of the planted acreage of crop j in county i and in
                                                                                    P lanted Acreageijt
year t divided by the total cropland (excluding irrigated land), i.e. Sijt =            Croplandit
                                                                                                        .
We also estimate equation (4) with the natural log of real cash rent as the dependent
variable. Considering the possible correlations of the regressors and the error term within
states and within years, we cluster the standard errors on state and on year (Cameron,
Gelbach, and Miller, 2011).
      The tariff and trade volume data from WITS are at the level of the pairs of importing
and exporting countries. Therefore, we need to aggregate the pair-level data to the
commodity level. We denote the ad valorem tariff rate imposed by importing country
d for crop j in year t as jdt . For jdt , we use the effectively applied tariffs (AHS) that
are the volume-weighted average at the HS code 4-digit level. We treat the domestic
consumption as "export" to the U.S., d = U S , with zero tariff, jU St = 0, throughout the
sample period. For crop j , in year t, the aggregated tariff rate for crop j in year t, jt , is
defined as


(6)                                      jt =            jdt × jdt
                                                 d


where jdt is the weight, which is based on the trade volumes imported by each country,
              Imported V olumejdt 1
i.e. jdt =     T otal P roductionjt
                                    .

      Note that the annual production values reported by NASS are smaller than the total exports of UN


                                                     13
      Estimating equation (4) where the localized tariff exposure is constructed by using
contemporaneous shares, i.e. LTit (jdt , Sijt ), as weights is subject to endogeneity con-
cerns. Any demand or supply shifters--denoted as j in equation (3)--will affect the
cash rent and the crop shares simultaneously such that Cov (Sijt , it ) = 0, which implies
Cov (LTit , it ) = 0. For example, the increased corn demand caused by the U.S. biofuel
policy affects cash rents and crop shares simultaneously by changing profitability and
promoting corn production. Unobserved supply and demand shocks for crops can also
affect the import shares such that Cov (jdt , it ) = 0. For example, a major drought in
the U.S. in 2012 could have affected cash rents but it also increased the share of U.S.
domestic corn consumption and reduced the corn-specific tariff, jt , since greater weight
is placed on the zero domestic tariff.
      Our main identification strategy to deal with the endogeneity from the contempora-
neous shares is to utilize a measure of the localized tariff constructed with initial shares
as an instrument. The first stage regression that we estimate is


(7)                        ¯ (jd0 , Sij 0 ) + 3 Xit + 4s t + 5s t2 + µi + t + eit ,
             LTit = 0 + 1 LT


       ¯ (jd0 , Sij 0 ) denotes the localized tariff constructed with initial trade volume
where LT
                Imported V olumejd0                                P lanted Acreageij 0
shares jd0 =     T otal P roductionj 0
                                         and crop shares Sij 0 =       Croplandi0
                                                                                        .   The initial trade
volume shares are calculated such that Imported V olumejd0 and T otal P roductionj 0
are the five-year average over the years 2003­2007. Similarly, the initial crop shares are
calculated where P lanted Acreageij 0 is the five-year average over the years 2003­2007
and Croplandi0 is the total cropland (excluding irrigated land) from the 2007 Census.


3.2      Identification Assumptions

Our empirical approach is motivated by the literature on Bartik instruments and shift-
share designs (e.g. Bartik, 1991; Autor, Dorn, and Hanson, 2013; Kovak, 2013; Jaeger,
Ruist, and Stuhler, 2018; Ad~
                            ao, Koles´
                                     ar, and Morales, 2019). The core idea is to exploit
Comtrade for some crops in some years. For such cases, we replace the annual production values with
the total exports.


                                                     14
plausibly exogenous shocks (i.e., crop-specific tariffs) on counties that are differentially
exposed to the shocks (i.e., through crop shares). Ad~
                                                     ao, Koles´
                                                              ar, and Morales (2019)
discuss the exclusion restriction in relationship to shift-share designs like our setting.
   The key assumption for identification of our IV estimator is that crop-specific tariffs,
jt , which is measured as the weighted-average of jdt by the initial trade shares, are
independent of cash rent in the absence of the tariffs, conditional on the included controls
(Ad~
   ao, Koles´
            ar, and Morales, 2019). This assumption is violated if crop-specific changes
in tariffs are correlated with crop-specific non-tariff price shifters, i.e. Cov (jt , jt ) = 0.
One crop-specific price shifter during this period was ethanol demand. According to data
from Economic Research Service (ERS), corn used for ethanol increased sharply from 2008
to about mid-2010 and then remained relatively stable afterwards (Economic Research
Service, United States Department of Agriculture, 2019). Tariffs for corn decreased over
the period (figure 4), but not necessarily in the same pattern as ethanol demand as corn
tariffs decreased sharply from 2011 to 2013 (figure 6). Note that we also include state-
specific quadratic time trends to control for region-specific evolution of cash rents and
LT over time.

   Including county and time fixed effects is key to eliminating potential bias. For exam-


                                                                  15
ple, counties producing crops with higher tariffs could have unobserved biophysical char-
acteristics that also affect rental rates. These biophysical characteristics are controlled for
with county fixed effects. Changes in tariffs could also be influenced by macroeconomic
factors that also affect all crop prices, but these are controlled for with year fixed effects.
      The other assumption for our IV estimator to be unbiased is that the first-stage
relationship with the instrument is sufficiently strong, i.e. 1 = 0. This condition is
trivial in our setting because much of the variation in localized tariffs is due to changes
                                                                           ¯ (jd0 , Sij 0 ).
in crop-specific tariff rates that drives the variation in our instrument LT
The first-stage F statistics are greater than the rule-of-thumb threshold of 10 for testing
"weak" IV (Stock, Wright, and Yogo, 2002) for all of our specifications.


3.3      Reduced-form Model

Alternatively, we also consider a reduced-form approach where we substitute the instru-
ment directly into the second-stage equation:


(8)                         ¯ (jd0 , Sij 0 ) + Xit + 1s t + 2s t2 + ui + vt + it .
            Rentit = 0 + 1 LT


Assumptions for equation (8) to be unbiased are similar to the assumptions of our IV
model (Ad~
         ao, Koles´
                  ar, and Morales, 2019). We also consider the measure of LT that uses
the contemporaneous export shares, but holds crop shares fixed at initial levels (denoted
    ~ (jdt , Sij 0 )). We also estimate results with the natural log of reals rent as the
as LT
dependent variable.
      A key difference between the IV and the reduced-form models is the interpretation
of 1 . For example, consider the impact of an increase in the tariff by country A. The
coefficient in the IV model uses contemporaneous shares, so estimating the impact of
country A's tariff on rental rates should also account for how shares adjust when cal-
culating the new LT . The coefficient in the reduced-form model does not account for
changes in shares to calculate the localized tariff, so estimating the impact of country A's
tariff would simply require calculating the new LT with the initial shares. The difference



                                              16
leads to two distinct approaches to compute the LT that incorporates the 2018 Chinese
retaliatory tariffs in section 6.



4     Estimated Incidence of Tariff Changes on Farm-

      land Rental Rates

Table 2 reports the estimated results of equations (4) and (8). Panel A reports the
results from the estimations with real cash rents as the dependent variables and panel
B reports the results with the natural log of the dependent variable as the dependent
variables. In Panel A, the first two columns report the estimated coefficient of 1 of
equation (4) followed by the two other columns with the estimated coefficient of 1 of
equation (8) where the dependent variables are in levels. As discussed in the earlier
section, we estimate equation (4) using an IV estimation. The first-stage F statistics of
the IV estimation is 61.59, which is far exceeding the rule-of-thumb threshold of 10 for
testing "weak" IV (Stock, Wright, and Yogo, 2002).
    Both columns (1) and (2) report a negative and significant effect of the localized tariff
exposure measured by the contemporaneous share. Column (2), which is the IV estimate,
reports the estimated coefficient that is more negative than that of column (1). We
suspect that the variable, LTit (jdt , Sijt ), is positively correlated with the error term via
jdt or Sijt . For example, if there are outward shifts of the demand from some destination
countries with relatively higher tariffs, LTit would increase but also the shifts would lead
to better profitability, and thus, possibly higher rents (thus, possibly, Cov (jdt , it ) > 0).
Similarly, LTit (jdt , Sijt ), can be positively correlated with the error term if croplands in a
county are moving toward to a crop with higher tariff exposures, independently from tariff
changes but due to other factors that lead to better profitability (i.e. Cov (Sijt , it ) > 0).
    The increase in the magnitude of the estimated coefficient of LTit is consistent across
the two specifications of the dependent variable. The estimated coefficient reported in
column (2) of panel A indicates that an one percent point increase in the localized tariff
exposure (ad valorem equivalent) leads to about 2 real USD reduction in the cash rents,


                                               17
which is about 5.3% of the overall average (4.6% of the 2017 average). Similarly, the log
specification (the estimated coefficient in column (2) of panel B) indicates that the cash
rent decreases by about 2.6% as the localized tariff exposure increases by a percent point.

    Columns (3) and (4) report the results from the reduced-form regressions of equation
(8), which use the localized tariff measures using the initial crop shares and the contempo-
raneous export shares, and using the initial crop and export shares as the key explanatory
variables. Again, the results are consistent across the two dependent variables. In both
panels, the estimated coefficients of column (3) have smaller magnitude than those of
column (4), which suggests that contemporaneous export shares lead to a positive cor-
relation between the localized tariff exposure and the error term. The magnitude of the
coefficients in column (4) is similar to those in column (2), which are the IV estimates.

                                                                 18
5     Fisher's Randomization Tests

Given potential correlations within each state and within each year, we cluster the stan-
dard errors at state- and year-level following Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2011). Al-
though we believe that the two-way clustering provides us an appropriate statistical
inference, the variance-covariance matrix of error can have more complex structure than
what multi-way clustering can capture (e.g. Ad~
                                              ao, Koles´
                                                       ar, and Morales, 2019; Barrios
et al., 2012).
    Therefore, we conduct Fisher's randomization test (FRT, Fisher, 1960) based on a
similar permutation approach as that of Hsiang and Jina (2014). More specifically, we
provide alternative p-values using the following two types of permutation samples: i) per-
mutation across counties (cross-sectional permutations) and ii) permutation across years
(time-series permutations). Using these permutation samples, we re-estimate equation
(8), obtain the distributions of the estimated coefficients for the localized tariff variable
(i.e. ^1 ) and the associated t-statistics, and then compute the p-values associated with

the estimated coefficient and the t-statistic from the actual observations. The test based
on the cross-sectional permutations checks the possibility of coincidental statistical sig-
nificance of the main results from unobservable time-specific shocks. Similarly, the test
based on the time-series permutations checks whether the main results are driven by
unobservable county-specific factors.
    For the cross-sectional permutations, we first shuffle Si0 , which is the vector of initial
crop shares, Sij 0 , across counties. We then merge the outcome variable, the tariff vari-
ables, and the weather covariates with the shuffled set of Si0 . With this new dataset, we
         ¯ (jd0 , Sij 0 ) and estimate equation (8). We conduct 5,000 iterations of these
compute LT
steps. For the time-series permutations, we shuffle Tt , which is the vector of crop-specific
tariffs (initial export share weighted), ¯jt (jd0 ), across years. In order to have sufficient
number of underlying permutations, we shuffle Tt across years. The rest of the estimation
procedure is equal to that of the cross-sectional permutations. Note that the permutation
approaches are equivalent to drawing 5,000 pseudo-sample datasets from all possible per-
mutations. For the cross-sectional permutations, the number of possible permutations is

                                              19
22,535 given 2,535 counties and for the time-series permutations, the number is 215 given
15 years from 2003 ­ 2017.
   Figure 7 presents the distributions of the estimated coefficients and the associated
t-statistics from the cross-sectional and the time-series permutations. The upper two
density plots are based on the cross-sectional permutations and the lower plots are based
on the time-series permutations. The left plots are the distributions of the estimated
coefficients and the right plots are the distributions of the estimated t-statistics. We also
report the empirical p-values for the estimated coefficient, -1.96 (Column (4), Panel A,
table 2), and the t-statistic, -3.60, which is the estimates from the actual observations.

tion samples (Note: The density plots are based on 5,000 iterations. The p-values are
empirical p-values­for the coefficients, we compute P rob(   ^1 < -1.96) where -1.96 is the
estimated coefficient from the actual observation and for the t-statistics, we compute
P rob(t < -3.60) where -3.60 is the t-statistic from the actual observation. The red solid
lines represent the estimated coefficient and the t-statistic from the actual observations.)




                                             20
    Overall, our main result and the rejection of the null of zero tariff effect remain ro-
bust. The distributions of the estimated coefficients indicate that neither unobservable
time-specific nor county-specific factors are driving the main result and its statistical sig-
nificance. The empirical p-values from the distributions of cross-sectional and time-series
permutations both are approximately zero (figure 7, the left panel). Alternatively, we
can also compute Fisher's exact p-values of FRT from the distributions of the t-statistics.
With slightly higher p-value for the time-series permutations, the both distributions have
the p-values lower than 5%. We speculate that the relatively high p-value for the time-
series permutations is due to the small number of years. However, even with the Fisher's
exact p-values, our result remains robust.



6     Predicted Impacts of the 2018 Chinese Retaliatory

      Tariffs on the U.S. Agricultural Exports

In order to place the estimated effects in the context of the 2018 trade war between
the U.S. and China, we provide several estimates of the predicted impact of Chinese
retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. exports. In July 2018, in response to the implementation
of U.S. tariffs on Chinese products, China declared to increase the ad-valorem tariffs on
the U.S. agricultural products. Table 3 summarizes the tariff changes for the seven field
crops.

    Although a sudden increase in tariffs is bound to drive a readjustment in trade flows,

                                             21
first, we assume that there is no trade diversion and estimate the impact of the nominal
increase in the Chinese tariffs on the U.S. exports. In order to compute the change in
the localized tariff exposure, we use the following equation:


(9)                   ¯ i=
               China LT           (j China 0 × (j China 2018 - j China 2017 )) × Sij 0
                              j


where j China 0 is the initial share of Chinese import, measured by using the average of
2003­2007, j China 2017 and j China 2018 ) are the Chinese tariffs imposed on the U.S. export
of crop j before and after the retaliation, and Sij 0 is the initial crop share in county i.
The difference, j China 0 × (j China 2018 - j China 2017 ), is reported in the first column table
4 by crop. For the no trade diversion scenario, we utilize the estimated coefficient of the
reduced-form estimation, which utilizes the localized tariff exposure measured by using
the initial export and crop shares. In other words, to predict the effect of the computed
       ¯ i , we use the estimated 1 of column (4) in table 2.

      However, trade volumes do reallocate with respect to their destinations as responses
to sudden changes in tariff rates. In order to capture such reallocation, we use the Global
Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model (Hertel, 1997) to calculate the changes in trade
volumes following an increase in China's tariffs reported in table 3. The GTAP model
is an applied general equilibrium model commonly used to evaluate trade policies. The
model assumes that producers operate under constants returns to scale and is based on the
standard framework of simultaneous utility and profit maximization. On the trade side,


                                                22
the model uses the so-called Armington assumption (Armington, 1969), whereby products
are differentiated by place of origin. The underlying assumptions and the parameters we
use are documented in Hertel (1997) and Hertel et al. (2007).
   For the trade volume adjustment scenario, we use the estimated changes from the
simulated results of the GTAP model, which consider the reallocation in trade volumes
to each destination. The second column in table 4 reports the estimated changes from
the GTAP model. Similar to the no trade diversion scenario, we compute

where ^jd2018 is the estimated shares of the trade volumes as responses to the Chinese

retaliatory tariffs. The estimated changes, i.e.          ^                - jd2017 jd2017 ), are

reported in the second column of table 4. We then compute the effect of China LT i using
the estimated 1 of equation 4 via the IV estimation.
   Table 5 reports the results from the two scenarios, no adjustment in trade volumes
and trade volume adjustment based on Armington assumption via the GTAP model.
Interestingly, the two scenarios predict similar magnitudes of the reductions due to the
Chinese retaliatory tariffs. The percentage reductions are estimated based on the esti-
mations with the natural log of the cash rents as the dependent variable and the nominal
reductions are based on the estimation with the cash rents as the dependent variable.
The average of the predicted reductions ranges from 2.33 to 2.45% or from 3.71 to 3.91
nominal USDs.

   Figures 8 and 9 report the spatial patterns of the predicted reductions in the cash
rents caused by the Chinese retaliatory tariffs. Figure 8 show the predicted reductions
based on the reduced-form estimation and the nominal changes in the tariffs faced by the
U.S. products and figure 9 displays the predictions based on the IV estimation and the
GTAP estimates of the changes in the localized tariff exposure. As expected, areas with
high shares of cotton or soybeans had larger predicted reductions. Note that the subtle
difference in the spatial patterns between the two figures is from the difference in the use
of the contemporaneous or initial crop shares.

7     Alternative Specifications

Our main estimations leverage the variations in the tariffs throughout the years and
across destination countries. While we carefully construct the identification approaches
to estimate equations (4) and (8), there are two remaining concerns. First, our estimates
may not represent the average effect across years if there are long-run adjustments as
responses to the current and potential changes in tariffs. Another potential threat for
our main specification is that the level of tariffs in a particular year can be coincidentally
correlated with the cash rents and the results are driven by that particular year. As the
robustness checks for our main specifications, we consider two approaches that utilize the
variations measured for different time windows.


7.1    Panel Long Difference Approach

We first consider Panel long difference approach (Panel LD) to examine whether the
long-run response deviates from the panel FE estimates, which would capture relatively
shorter-run effects. Thus, we implement the panel long-difference model (e.g. Burke and
Emerick, 2016) by computing the five-year average of the variables in equation (4) for


                                                   25
the years 2012 and 2017 and take the difference.
   Thus, we estimate the following equation:


           Renti post2012 - Renti pre2012 = 0 + 1 (LT i post2012 - LT i pre2012 )+
(11)
                                                    (Zi post2012 - Zi pre2012 ) + it


where Renti post2012 and Renti pre2012 are the five-year averages of the county-average cash
rents for the periods 2008­2012 and 2013­2017, and LTi post2012 and LTi pre2012 are the
five-year averages of the localized tariff exposure measured by using the contemporaneous
shares. Similar to our main specification, we estimate equation (11) by an IV estimation.
                               ¯ , which is the localized tariff exposure measured by
We use the long difference of LT
the initial shares, as the instrument for the long difference of LT . We also estimate the
long difference version of the reduced-form regressions, i.e. the long difference version of
equation (8).
   Table 6 reports the results from the panel LD regressions. The first two columns report
the results from estimating equation (11) with OLS and IV and the last two columns
report the results from the reduced-form regressions using the two alternative measures
of the localized tariff exposure. Overall, the results of table 6 are consistent with the
main estimation results. Similar to table 2, we find that the magnitude of the estimated
coefficient from the IV estimation is greater than that from the OLS estimation. The
reduced-form results, columns (3) and (4), are also consistent with the main estimation
                                           ¯ is more negative than those of LT or LT
results with the estimated coefficient of LT                                       ~ . An

interesting finding is that the coefficients of the reduced-form estimation in table 6 are
substantially more negative than those in table 2 whereas the results of the IV estimation
are similar.

7.2      Shift-share Analysis by Year

Shift-share designs are useful in estimating the effects of shocks that vary across economic
sectors, but that can only be measured for the country as a whole, such as immigration
(e.g. Jaeger, Ruist, and Stuhler, 2018), the emergence of China as an exporter (e.g.
Autor, Dorn, and Hanson, 2013), or Brazilian trade liberalization (e.g. Kovak, 2013), on
spatially heterogeneous labor markets. These studies use local-level sectoral labor shares
at the initial time periods of the studies to capture differences in exposure to the shocks
stemming from heterogeneous patterns of specialization. When we focus on farmland
cash rental rates, which is analogous to wages, the natural analog to labor shares across
different sectors are land allocations across different crops that face different degrees of
foreign market accessibility.
   As a robustness check, we utilize the shift-share design to show that the tariff reduction
shocks affect cash rental rates positively. To construct the shift-share design, we need to
define the pre-shock "base period". The most noticeable trade-related event during the
sample period is the U.S.--Korea Free Trade Agreement, which became effective in early
2012 (Baylis, Coppess, and Xie, 2017). Given that the cash rent data start from 2008
but with relatively fewer counties being surveyed, we define the base period as the years
from 2009 to 2011 and compute the annual tariff shocks based on such definition.



                                                       27
   More specifically, we estimate the following regression equation for each year t:


(12)                                      ¯ it + Zit + us + it
                          Rentit = 0 + 1 LT


where Rentit = Rentit - Renti 2009-2011 , i.e. the change in cash rent in county i in year
t from the average cash rent from 2009 to 2011. The tariff shocks are measure by


(13)        ¯ it =
           LT                       (jdt - jd 2009-2011 ) × jd 2009-2011    × Sij 2009-2011
                      j       d


which is the weighted average of the changes in the tariffs in year t from the average tariffs
from 2009 to 2011 weighted by the average export and crop shares from 2009 to 2011.
The changes in weather covariates from the 2009­2011 average and state fixed effects are
denoted by Zit and us .
   The shift-share approach represented by equation (13) isolates the effect of tariff
shocks on cash rental rates from the effects from changes in local crop production patterns.
By fixing the export and crop shares at the levels in the base period of the analysis, we
limit the confounding effect from the changes in crop production patterns and yet, exploit
the spatial variations that stem from the different degrees of exposure to the changes in
crop-specific tariffs. As reported in table 7, we find that the results are robust.

8         Discussion and Concluding Remarks

We find that the changes in nominal tariffs in destination markets have substantial effects
on land rents. These results are robust to different specifications that try to minimize
confounding effects due to the adjustment of both the crop and export destination port-
folios as tariffs in the destination markets change over time. The back-of-the-envelope
estimate of the elasticity of the cash rents to changes in the localized tariffs from our
panel estimates ranges from -0.015 to -0.028, so that an increase in the localized tariffs
by 1% reduces land rents by 0.015­0.028%.2 At the outset, we recognize that nominal
tariffs are an incomplete measure of trade liberalization as it ignores the tariffs faced by
other countries competing in the same destination. The fact that our main source of
identifying variation is from free trade agreements negotiated after worldwide episodes of
multilateral tariff reductions (i.e., the adoption of the WTO Agreement of Agriculture at
the culmination in 1995), partially alleviates this concern.
        Still, we recognize that it is possible that the countries to which the U.S. exports
the most, were lowering their tariffs to other countries at the same time that they were
lowering their tariffs to the U.S. This would attenuate our parameter estimates if tariffs
to enter the same destination would move together across all the exporting destinations
and the price differentials across exporters would vanish. Including the variation in tariffs
faced by the U.S. vis-`
                      a-vis the variations in tariffs faced by U.S. competitors is part of
our future research. Yet, our estimates are useful to inform trade policy-makers and
negotiators about the potential gains and losses accruing to the agricultural sector by
negotiation preferential tariffs and likely to serve as lower bounds.
        Likewise, as demonstrated in the paper, these estimates are also useful for the eval-
uation of the effects of unilateral losses of market access. Our estimates indicate that a
na¨
  ive evaluation of the effects of the retaliatory tariffs imposed by China on U.S. field
crop exports would cause large declines in land rents, particularly, and not surprisingly,
in the counties where cotton and soybeans are the dominant crops.

    These are from the back-of-the-envelope calculation of (2.12/43.04)/(1/0.57) and 0.026/(1/0.57)
based on the 2017 values, where 2.12 and 0.026 are from column (2) of panels A and B in table 2,
respectively.
