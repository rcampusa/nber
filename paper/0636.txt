                     On the Predictability of Tax—Rate Changes



                                       ABSTRACT



       Some previous analyses have suggested that the smoothing of tax rates

over   time would be a desirable guide for public debt management. One
implication of this viewpoint is that future changes in tax rates would be
unpredictable   based on current information. This proposition is tested by

examining the behavior of U.S. federal and total government tax (and "non—tax")

receipts relative to GNP. The sample for the federal government goes back to

1879, while that for total government starts in 1929. Some econometric

problems with using time—averaged data are discussed. The main empirical

results accord with the theoretical analysis——in particular, there is first,

little indication of drift in the tax rates; second, insignificant relations

of tax—rate changes to the own history of changes; and third, little explana-

tory value for tax—rate changes from a vector of lagged variables, which

include the behavior of government spending and real output. If the findings

are sustained, they impiy that the existing IJ.S. time series data do not

isolate periods in which current overall tax rates would be perceived as

high or low relative to expected future rates. Accordingly, it may be

impossible to use these data to evaluate policies that entail intertemporal

manipulation of aggregate tax rates.

     Some previous papers (Burro, 1979, 1980; Kydland and Prescott, 1980)

suggested that the smoothing of t.x rates over time would be a desirable

guide for debt-management policy. For example, the large temporary outlays

by government during wartime would be primarily debt-financed in order to

avoid a substantial excess of wartime tax rates over rates that would be

expected for later years. Similarly, assuming that real government spending

is not strongly procyclical, a countercyclical response of the public debt

allows for smoothing of tax rates over the business cycle.

    Heuristically, the case for intertemporaluniformity of tax rates--say,

on factor incomes--emerges if the (own- and cross-) responsiveness of factor

supplies to after-tax rewards is similar at different dates, For example,

the Ramsey-like rule for taxation in inverse relation to own supply elasticities

yields this answer in the context of a uniform intertemporal pattern of

elasticities.1

    Departures from uniform taxation over time would be suggested if factor

supply elasticities interact, for example, with the contemporaneous level of

government spending or with the state of the business cycle. The signs or

magnitudes of these effects are not apparent on theoretical grounds--conceivably,

the uniformity of tax rates over time may remain as a satisfactory approximation

to optimal policy. The theory has also not been applied to contexts of uncer-

tainty about future values of government spending, aggregate real income, and

so on,

    The basic approach in this paper is first, to adopt the criterion of

constant expected overall tax rates as an approximate guide to optimal public

finance; and second, to regard this proposition as a positive theory about

government behavior. The properties of tax collections over time are

 examined empirically to test whether actual
                                                        behavior departs significantly
 from that dictated by this simple. rule for
                                                    intertemporal public finance.
      A previous empirical investigation (Barro, 1979) considered the impli-

 cations of tax smoothing at the level of the federal government for the

 determination of U.S. public debt. The present analysis looks directly at

 the behavior of taxes--specifically,
                                          at propositions that concern the unpre-
 dictability of changes in future tax rates.

      Suppose that Tt represents the (average marginal) tax rate applying to

 incomes that accrue during period t.
                                          (The restriction to income taxes is
not central to the analysis.) The basic
                                               hypothesis is that         is set in
accordance with a rule that generates
                                          equality between Tt and all expected
 future tax rates, as perceived at date
                                           t. In particular, constancy of tax
rates emerges if the realizations for all future values of real government

spending, real GNP, and so on, equal their
                                                   mean values as conditioned on date t
information.

     The level of     is determined from the government's intertemporal

budget constraint, taking accowit of tax effects on the scale of economic

activity (that is, on the tax base). Departures of real government spending,

real GNP, etc., from their prior expectations generate revisions in tax rates.

In a simple setting where taxes are proportional to income, the tax rate

change depends on a weighted sum of changes in expected future values of

government spending relative to aggregate income. For present purposes, the

important point is that r is set at each date so that


     (1)   E(t.JI) =          for       I =   1,   2,
                                     —3—




 applies, where I represents date t information. In other words, tax rates

 follow a Martingale process. Alternatively, in first-difference form, all

 future changes in tax rates are unpredictable;


        (2)     E(Tt+j_Tt+ji)JIt =   0     for   j =   1,   2,



 Equation (2) is the main proposition that is tested in this paper. The full

distribution of tax-rate changes need not be time-invariant in order to

satisfy equations (1) and (2), but the empirical analysis embodies this

additional restriction. In this form tax rates are generated from a random

walk.

        The random-walk model for tax rates is reminiscent of similar proposi-

tions for some asset prices, which have been the subject of considerable

empirical investigation. See Fama (1970) for a survey of this area. The

approach is also analogous to the study of consumption that has been carried

out by Hall (1978).

     Suppose that real government spending, aside from interest payments,

and real GNP are not themselves generated from random-walk processes, In

this case the unpredictability of changes in future values, as shown for tax

rates in equation (2), would not apply for these other variables, The

essence of the tax-rate-smoothing policy implied by equations (1) and (2)

is that any foreseeable behavior for real government spending,2 real GNP,

etc., is incorporated in the setting of the current tax rate, so as to avoid

a pattern whereby tax rates would vary with the predictable changes in the

other variables, Tests for the unpredictability of tax-rate changes are
                                 -4-




most interesting in an environment where some future changes in real govern-

ment spending, real GNP, etc., are forecastable. In particular, it would

be less interesting to find that tax-rate shifts were unpredictable if changes

in the government spending-GNP ratio were also unpredictable.   Accordingly, the

empirical analysis includes tests in the form of equation (2) for other vari-

ables--notably, for the government spending-GNP ratio--along with the tests

for tax rates. A comparison across the various equations is of substantial

interest from the perspective of assessing the tax-rate-smoothing model.



Empirical Counterparts of Tax Rates

     Although average marginal tax rates matter in the theoretical analysis,

data considerations limit the empirical investigation to aggregate average

tax rates. The implicit assumption is the absence of substantial changes

over time in the relation of these average rates to the underlying average

marginal tax rates.

     The spirit of the theory pertains to an overall package of taxes at

each date, rather than to individual components. Specifically, the finding

of predictability of tax-rate changes for particular categories of taxation

would not invalidate the central thesis. Therefore, the analysis deals

with the overall tax (and so-called non-tax) receipts for a specified govern-

ment entity. The primary results deal with the U.S. federal government, although

findings are indicated also for the U.S. total government sector.3 An attempt

was made to consolidate the Federal Reserve with the federal government by

excluding from receipts the transfers made by the Federal Reserve to the

U.S. Treasury. (Curiously, this item appears under corporate tax liabilities.)

 Notes to Table 1:

      TAXF is total federal government receipts less transfers from the
           Federal Reserve, divided by nominal GNP, Before 1929 an
           estimate of interest received by the federal government was
           also deducted. (The original data included this interest as a
           component of revenue.)

          GF is total federal expenditures less net interest payments, divided
             by nominal GNP. Before 1929 an estimate of gross interest paid
             was deducted. (Interest received appears on the receipt side of
             the accounts.)

     TAXT is total government receipts (intergovernmental transfers are
          netted out) less transfers from the Federal Reserve, divided
          by nominal GNP. Data were obtained since 1929,

          GT is total government expenditures (intergovermental transfers
             are netted out) less net interest payments, divided by GNP,
             Data were obtained since 1929,

     DY     log (Yi/Yti), where Y is real GNP, 1972 base.

          r is the total nominal return over the year for a value-weighted
            portfolio of all New York Stock Exchange issues (as compiled by
            the University of Chicago's Center for Research on Security
            Prices) less an inflation rate. The inflation rate from 1948
            to 1979 is log(P/P .3, where      is the December value of the

            shelter, (See n. 7 below,) For 1926-47, the inflation rate is
            based on the overall CPI for an urban consumer,

          R is the annual average interest rate on 4-6 month maturity prime
            Commercial Paper.

          H is the annual average of seasonally-adjusted high-powered money
            (total currency outside the U.S. Treasury plus reserves of
            member banks at the Federal Reserve),

  R.H/GNP is the ratio of R•H--the cost per year of holding the stock of
          high-powered money--to nominal GNP.

(Notes to Table 1 continued)

     Earlier data on federal receipts and expenditures are from Firestone
(1960, Table A-3). Data before 1929 on interest paid and received by the
federal government are from issues of the Annual Report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, Washington D.C., U0S Government Printing Office. Federal Reserve
transfers were zero before 1929. Earlier figures for real and nominal GNP
are from Long-Term Economic Growth, 1860-1970, Series Al, A7. Values before
1889 are based on Gallmans data, which were obtained from Anna Schwartz.

      CPI data, compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, were obtained
          from the Chase Data Bank.

        R is from Banking and Monetary Statistics, Banking and Monetary

         One interesting issue Concerns the treatment of
                                                           inf1ationay finance,
   which is excluded in
                          conventional measures of tax collections
                                                                       The current
    tax rate on holdings of
                             high_powered (government_issue) money, H, is deter-
    mined by a short-term
                          nominal interest rate, R. The flow, RH,
                                                                      represents
    the expected costs per period that are imposed
                                                    on holders of money. In a
   Perfect_foresight setting, the present value of these flows
                                                                  (back to some
   "initial" date) corresponds also to the
                                             present value of government revenue
   from money creation. Departures of the actual
                                                    present value of revenues
   from this magnitude
                       are associated with
                                            unexpected capital gains or losses
  on cash holdings__see
                         Phelps (1973, pp. 74-5) and Auernhejmer (1974) for
  discussions of this matter.
                                 The implications of adding the tax on cash
  balances to the usual
                         concepts of taxation are discussed in the
                                                                     empirical
  section__quantitatively the differences in results are insubstantial.

      Appropriate empirical
                              counterparts for the overall tax base are not straight-
 forward. Net and
                    gross national product come
                                                  imniediately to mind--the latter
 concept might be preferable because
                                     reported depreciation is largely arbitrary
 from an economic
                  standpoint and because the
                                             (true) depreciation component of
 GNP is potentially
                    subject to taxation. In any event tax assessments are
                                                                           not
necessarily limited to final
                               product or net income-- levies
                                                                can be based on
intermediate flows,
                      including governmenta' transfer
                                                      payments, and on various
 stock variables, such as overall wealth or
                                             estates. Some experimentation
indicated that the results
                            were insensitive to the choice of tax base
                                                                        among
GNP, NNP, or either of these
                              concepts augmented by governmental transfers.
The results discussed
                       in this paper use GNP
                                             as the proxy for the tax base.
                                —11—


Hence, tax rate variables are measured as federal or total government tax

(and nQn-tax) receipts relative to GNP. The hypothesis of unpredictability

for changes in future average marginal tax rates translates empirically into

a proposition of unpredictability for changes in future values of tax receipts

relative to GNP.

     The analysis is limited to annual observations on tax receipts. Within-

year data do not seem meaningful because of discrepancies between the time

of tax accrual (which is pertinent for allocative effects) and the

time of payment to the government.

     Government expenditure ratios are measured analogously--as either

federal or total annual government spending relative to GNP.   The total

government figures exclude intergovernmental transfers. Net interest pay-

ments are determined endogenously, given an initial debt stock, by the

tax/deficit policy in conjunction with the time path of other government

spending. From the standpoint of tax-rate smoothing, the pertinent matter

is the predictability of changes in government spending aside from interest

payments. Therefore, net interest payments have been excluded from the

government expenditure variables. (However, the results are little changed

if this adjustment is not made.) Before 1929 an estimate of federal interest

paid is excluded from spending and an estimate of interest received by the

federal government is deducted from total receipts. See the notes to Table 1

for details.




TimeAggregatioTn Problems

     Working (1960) discussed a difficulty in testing random-walk hypotheses

with time-averaged data on commodity or stock prices. The same problem arises
                                  —12-



 in the present context where annual aveirages of tax rates are used.4 If the

 random-walk model appUes at some interval that is shorter than a year (and

 which might be infinitesimal), then a random walk would not appear in the

 time-averaged annualdata. Suppose, for example, that a positive innovation

 to the tax rate (reflecting, say, a change in information about future real

 government spending) occurs during year t. This change affects period t's

 average annual tax rate by less than one-to-one--depending on the timing of the

 informational shift during the year- -but alters expected future tax rates on

a one-to-one basis. Therefore, future time-averaged tax rates,         would
not be related to     by a unitary coefficient. In terms of first differences

from one year to the next, the serial independence of tax-rate changes would

be replaced by a pattern of positive association.

    Using first differences of time-averaged observations,
                                                             Dt
Working's analysis shows--for the case where the interval for the fundamental

random-walk model is infinitesimal and where the underlying distribution

of the disturbances is time-invariant--that the simple correlation

between     and DE1 equals .25. Note that the simple correlations of

DTt with earlier lag values remain equal to zero. With the inclusion of

four lagged values,        it can be shown (see Appendix I) that the

partial correlations of Dt with each lagged value are given by (.29, -.08,

.02, -.01). Subsequent partial correlations would be negligible. Generally,

Dt can be written as a moving-average process that involves a pattern of

weights on the underlying innovations applicable to periods t and t-l. For
                                           —13—




 testing purposes it is convenient to approximate this process in an auto-

 regressive form in terms of the time-averaged variables. Assuming normality

 for the underlying disturbances, the approximation is

 This equation replicates the pattern of partial correlations that was just

 described.

      For a case where current information,
                                                        ' is     limited to current and

past tax rates, equation (3) suggests that the random-walk model can be tested

via- univariate autoregressions in which the coefficients are constrained to

equal the hypothesized values. (Note that the constant equals zero--that is,

a drift in the tax rate violates the underlying theory.)
                                                                         Although this pro-
cedure is carried out empirically, it has the shortcoming of ignoring the

predictive content of other variables, such as real government spending and

real GNP. Unfortunately, simple results for time-averaged data do not

generally obtain when additional variables are introduced.

     Suppose that another variable, X, is added to the analysis. Assume that

this variable is generated also from an underlying random-walk process. It

is assumed here that the innovations to r and X are bi-variate normal. The

X-variable is potentially of interest if its innovations are correlated con-

temporaneously with those of t--denote this correlation by the fixed parameter,

p. The other parameters of the distributions are also treated as time-invariant.

                                                                         rate, t, would still
In the absence of time-averaging, the latest observed tax

                                   -14-




irrelevant here, despite the condition,p     0. However, when -r is observed

only in time-averaged form, the observations on X can become pertinent--

essentially, this variable may help to pin down the latest value of the

fundamental r series, given that only -r. is observed. Aside from the

situation where p = 0, a case where the observation on X is not helpful

arises when this variable is observed in the same type of time-averaged

form as that applying to -r.   In this case equation (3) continues to apply--in

particular, the coefficients on all lagged values of first differences of the

time-averaged X variable, D)(t1, equal zero. (See Appendix I.)

    The results change if the X-variable--still generated from an underlying

random-walk process--is observed directly, rather than in time-averaged form.

(For example, if stock prices plus accumulated dividends are generated from

a random walk (with drift), but X represents the full return on equity over

the year or the end-of-year stock price, rather than the annual average of

stock prices.) For the case where D1 and DXt1 are the only included

right-side variables, it is shown in Appendix I that the regression coef-

ficient of Dt on DX1 has the same sign as the underlying contemporaneous

correlation, p. The coefficient on Dti is reduced below .25 when p            0—-

further, the coefficient becomes negative if      is   sufficiently large.5

    The analysis becomes more complicated if the movements in the X-variable

are themselves serially correlated. Note that, unlike for tax rates, the

theory does not suggest any special form for the X-process--therefore, the

random-walk case cannot generally be assumed. In any event the model no

longer implies either that variables like DXt would be irrelevant for
                                 —15—




    in the form of equation (3) or that the coefficients o the DTt

variables would equal those shown in the equation.

    Suppose that all variables dated t-l, as well as t, are excluded on the

right side of an equation for DTt. Despite the presence of time-averaging,

the regression coefficients of all right-side variables in this form--which

are dated up to t-2--would be zero. Thus,            .,., and all variables,

DX2, ..., would be irrelevant for DTt. Therefore, tests for the unpredict-

ability of tax-rate changes can be carried Out in this form in a multivariate

setting.

    With the tax rate change, DT, examined only in relation to variables that

are dated two or more years previously, there are questions about the power

of statistical tests. The comparison with parallel relationships for real

government spending and other variables is important in this respect--that is,

the presence of predictive power in these other equations would suggest that

the tests for tax-rate changes were meaningful. Also, the presence of drift

in the tax rate--that is, a test for a nonzero constant in the Drt equation--is

not sensitive to the exclusion of date t-lexplanatoryvariables. Despite ques-

tions about statistical power in annual equations with first lags omitted, it

is unclear how else to proceed in the multivariate case, The possibility for

a direct analysis--as shown inequation (3) for the univariate setting--depends

strongly on the detailed statistical properties of the additional variables,

X, which are not the focus of the theory. Further, with respect to aggregate

tax rates, it does not seem feasible to use data at an interval finer than

one year.

 Drift in the Tax and Spending Ratios

       Table 2 reports the estimated coefficients and standard errors for

 equations that include only the constant term. For the federal government,
 the
                  rariable is either the change in the ratio of federal tax

 receipts to GNP, D(TAXF)t     (TAXF) -                  or the change in the
                                          (TAXF)ti,
 ratio of federal spending to GNP,                   -
                                     D(GF)t E   GF       GFt1.   The periods con-
 sidered are 1884-1979, 1884-1929, 1930-1979, and 1948-1979. Data and

 definitions of variables appear in Table 1.     Graphs of the tax and spending
 ratios are shown in Figure 1.

       The estimated constants correspond, of course, to the means of the depen-

dent variables over each sample. Since the federal tax and spending ratios

rose over all samples that are considered, the estimated constants in the

first-difference specification__that is, the estimated drift for each ratio

in level form--are all positive.
                                     However, the point estimates are very
close to zero for the 1884-1929
                                   period. Over all samples considered, the
estimated constants differ insignificantly form zero at the 5% level,

although significance would have been attained in some cases if a less

stringent critical value had been adopted.

    Over the longer samples--1884_1979
                                          or l930-1979--the point estimates of
drift coefficients for the tax and spending ratios are very close. However,

the substantially greater sample variance for the spending ratio (which is

discussed further in a later section) implies that the estimated drift coef-

ficients for this variable do not differ significantly from zero. For the

federal tax ratio, the estimated drift coefficient for the 1884-1979 sample

s.e. = .0020 (t =          1.7).   For the post-World War II period (1948-1979),

the situation is reversed--the spending variable exhibits a larger estimated

coefficient and t-ratio than the corresponding tax variable. For the federal

spending ratio, the estimated drift coefficient is .0027, s.e. = .0024

(t =    1.1),   while that for the tax ratio is .0007, s.e, = 0019 (t =           0.3).
       When the total government sector is substituted for the federal govern-

ment, there is a greater indication of drift in the spending and tax ratios.

(See Pigure 2--note that data have been obtained for total government variables

only since 1929.) The estimated coefficient for tax-rate changes over the 1930-79

sample, .0043, s.e. = .0017, is significant at the 5% level. The point esti-

mate for changes in the spending ratio, .0043, is the same, but the standard

error, .0065, greatly exceeds that for tax-rate changes. Estimated drift

coefficients for l948-79--.0044, s,e. = .0026 for spending and .0024,

s.e.      .0017 for taxes--are higher than those found for the federal govern-

:aent, but again insignificantly different from zero at the 5% level.

       Except for some weak indication from the post-World War II sample, the

results do not support the view that a drift in the government spending

ratio over some period would be smoothed out (through the use of debt policy)

and not appear in the tax ratio. On the other hand, the findings for the

federal government are consistent--at conventional significance levels--with

the absence of drift in both spending and tax ratios. The historical rise

in these ratios, as shown in Figure 1, is not necessarily an indication of

systematic trends. Even for the total government sector over the 1930-79

 Results from Univariate Autoregressions

       Table 3 reports results for OLS regressions that include a constant

 and four annual lags of the dependent variable. The form of these equations
 is

where Z represents either TAXF or GF. The sample periods and dependent vari-

ables coincide with those just discussed. The regressions were run also with

first lags deleted and with the coefficients of the four lags constrained to

equal those shown in equation (3). For each sample and choice of dependent

variable, Table 3 reports the following:

       1) the F-ratio for the hypothesis that the coefficients of the four

lagged dependent variables are all zero, but where the constant is unrestricted,

a1 =              =        =
                               0;
             a3       a4
      2) the F-ratio when the hypothesis of a zero constant,                      =
                                                                                      0,   is added;

      3) the unrestricted point estimate and standard error for the first lag

coefficient, ct1 (the full regression results are shown in appendix Table Al);

      4) for the case where the first lag of the dependent variable is
                                                                                             omitted,

     5) F-ratios for the hypothesis shown in equation (3),               c = .29,
               =
      -.08,        .02,    c4 =    -.01,   with the constant first unrestricted and

 then set to zero.

     From the perspective of testing the random—walk model with time-averaged

data, the F-ratios listed under (5) are of most interest. Those listed under

 (4) also constitute a valid test of the theory. The constraints

shown under (1) and (2) are not implications of the underlying random-walk

model.

    With the change in the federal spending ratio, D(GF), used as the dependent

variable and for the longer samples, 1884-1979 and 1930-1979, the hypothesis

from equation (3), c1 =          .29, 2 = -.08,     c3      .02, c4 =-,Ol, is rejected at

the 5% level. With the constant unrestricted and 5% critical values shown

in parentheses, the results are F1 =               3.9   (2.5) for the 1884-1979 period
and F5 = 2.7 (2.6) for the 1930-79 sample. With the constant set to zero,

the corresponding results are F1 3.1 (2.3) and F5 = 2.2 (2.4). The last

statistic is just below the 5% critical level. Overall, there is indication

from the longer samples that the past history of changes in the federal

spending ratio has some predictive power for future changes. Over the

1948-79 sample, the random-walk hypothesis would be accepted for the federal

spending ratio--the result is F7 =            1.3   (2.7) with the constant unrestricted
and F7 = 1.2 (2.6) with the constant set to zero.

    For the tax-rate change, D(TAXF), the random-walk model from

equation (3) is accepted over all samples. With the constant unrestricted,

the hypothesis, a1 =      .29,   a2 =   - .08, a3 = .02, a4 = -.01, corresponds
                                   —23—




to statistics of F1 = 1.3 (2.5) for the 1884-1979 sample, F5= 0.8 (2.6)

for the 1930-79 period, and F27     1.7 (2.7) for the 1948-79 sample. With

a zero constant included in the null hypothesis, the corresponding

statistics are F1 =    1.4 (2.3), F5 = 1.0 (2.4), and F7 1.4 (2.6),
In all cases one accepts the hypothesis that the past history of changes in

the federal tax-GNP ratio has no predictive value for subsequent changes.

    The results of another valid test of the random-walk model--c2 =         =
                                                                       ct3
   = 0,   with the first lag value omitted--are shown also in Table 3. The

conclusions correspond to those just discussed--rejection for the D(GF) vari-

able over the 1884-1979 and 1930-79 samples, but acceptance for D(GF) over

the 1948-79 period and for the D(TAXF) variable over all samples,

     It may be worth noting the pattern of estimated coefficients for the

1948-79 sample when D(TAXF) is the dependent variable. As indicated in

Table Al of the appendix for the case where the first lag of D(TAXF) is

omitted, these estimates and standard errors are -.37(.17) for D(TAXF)t2,

-.22(.17) for D(TAXF)t    and -.20(.17) for D(TAXF)t4. This pattern of

negative coefficients on past tax-rate changes would be predicted by a

model that specified a target level of tax rates. In this case, shifts

in tax rates would tend to be reversed later. Although the pattern of

estimated coefficients is suggestive of this mechanism, the insignificant

F-values imply that the post-World War II data are also consistent with

the random-walk model for tax rates. The F-values for the case where the

first lag of D(TAXF) is deleted are (from Table 3) F8 = 2.2 (5% critical

value =   3.0) with the constant unrestricted and F8 = 1.7(2.7) with the
constant constrained to zero.

    Table 3 indicates also the statistics for tests of the hypothesis,

a1 = a2 = a3 =    =       0.   The F-values for the D(GF) variable over the longer
               a4
samples are substantially greater than before--for example, F1 = 9.3 applies

to the 1884-1979 period when the constant is unrestricted. The statistics

for the D(TAXF) variable remain below the 5% critical levels, although the

F-values obtained from the 1884-1979 sample are larger than those found in

tests of the other hypotheses. In any event the previous discussion demon-

strated that a1 =         =         =        = 0 is not an implication of the underlying
                     a2        a3       a4
random-walk model.

    Overall, the evidence from the longer samples supports the idea that tax

rates are set so as to smooth out predictable movements in federal spending

relative to GNP. The significant F-values for the D(GF) variable in tests

of equation (3) indicate that some smoothable variations in the federal

spending ratio have been isolated. For the 1948-79 period, the lack of

predictive power from the own           past   history is accepted for both the tax and

spending ratios. This finding is consistent with the underlying theory--how-

ever, the results are less interesting in that no smoothable movements in

D(GF) were detected.

     The results for the total government sector (for 1934-79 and 1948-79

samples) are basically similar to those just described. The main difference

is that the F-value for the case of the spending ratio over the 1934-79 sample

is somewhat smaller than that found for the federal spending ratio over the

1930—79 period.

 Results from Vector Autoregressions

      The variables selected for vector
                                           autoregressions were those that seemed
 promising, piori, as predictors for tax-rate changes. The two types of

 variables considered were those that pertained to the evolution of government

 spending and those that related to
                                       aggregate output fluctuations.6 The ratio
of federal spending to GNP, as discussed before, is one of the included

variables. A measure of the persistence
                                            of these expenditure changes is
likely to be important for tax rate
                                       determination--in particular, tax rates
should respond strongly and
                               contemporaneously to spending changes that are
viewed as largely permanent. Some
                                      previous analysis (Barro, 1981) isolated
a war-intensity variable as a good indicator of the temporary nature of

the accompanying changes in defense spending. This variable, which is

defined for war years as the
                               concurrent u.s. casualty rate (CAS), is included
in the vector autoregressions.
                                  (See Table 1 for a definition and
                                                                      tabulation.)
I have not found any other variables
                                       that signal the duration of changes in
government spending.

      The growth rate of real GNP, DY, is included as a business cycle-type

 variable. The real rate of return on equity, r,7 has also been used, pri-

 marily because it functions as a good predictor for subsequent values of DY.

 Together, the DY and r variables provide some predictive value for subse-

quent growth rates of output. Therefore, these variables would be likely

to pick up any systematic "cyclical" patterns in tax rates. See Table 1

for a listing of the DY and r variables.

     I have not attempted to include any political variables, such as the

proclamation of a tax "surcharge" for 1968, the announcement of a "one-time tax

rebate" for 1975, or Reagan's promise during 1980 to cut tax rates for 1981
                                      —27—




and later years. The issue is whether these pronouncements have any informa-

tion content--holding fixed the other included variables--for subsequent

changes in overall tax rates. It is unclear how to quantify these types of

announcement variables over the full sample in order to test for their

predictive value.

     Four annual lags of each variable have been included in the vector

autoregressions. The previous discussion of time-averaging indicates the

difficulty in interpretation for first-lag values. As mentioned, the random-

walk model does not generally predict own-lag coefficients as shown in

equation (3) or zero values for the coefficients of other variables. Since

coefficient hypotheses in representations that include first-lag values are

sensitive to the detailed specification for all variables--on which the

theory provides no guidance- -   it   seems best to focus on settings in which

the first lags are omitted. For this case, with the tax-rate change as

the dependent variable, the random-walk model predicts zero coefficients for

all independent variables. Clearly, the interest in these tests is heightened

if some predictive power remains for changes in the federal spending ratio

and output growth, even when all first lags are eliminated.

     Results are presented for 1930-79 and 1948-79 samples.       (The r variable

was unavailable before 1926, although some satisfactory approximations can

probably be generated from available stock price indices and dividend data.

Since the quality of real GNP data also deteriorate before 1929, it may not

pay to extend the sample much before 1930,)
                                   —28—




     The format of Tables 4-7 is as follows:

     1) The presence or absence of first-lag variables and the sample period

are indicated.

     2) The dependent variable for each regression is shown in the first

column.

     3) F—statistics and 5% critical values are shown for the hypothesis that

the coefficients of all lagged variables are zero--for the case of the D(TAXF)

and D(GF) variables, the F-ratio is shown also when the hypothesis of a zero

constant is added.
     4) F-values are indicated for the hypothesis of zero values for all

lags of one variable--D(TAXF), D(GF), GAS, DY, or r--with no restrictions

imposed on the coefficients of the other variables; the full regression

results with D(TAXF) and D(GF) as dependent vai'iables are shown in Table A2

of the appendix.

     Consider first the results for the 1930-79 sample when first lags of

all variables are excluded (Table 4). For the federal tax-rate change,

D(TAXF) in line 1, the hypothesis that all lagged coefficients equal zero

corresponds to a statistic, F 1.3 (5% critical value = 2.0) when the

constant is unrestricted, and F = 1.4 (2,0) with the constant set to zero.

Therefore, the hypothesis is accepted that tax—rate changes, D(TAXF)t

 (TAXFt -              are unpredictable, based on the information contained in
            TAXFt1),
lagged values up to date t-2 for the five variables considered.     The F-values

are also below the 5% critical level for each variable considered separately.

The largest value, F = 2.6 (2.9), arises for the lags of the equity return,

r.

       A parallel hypothesis for changes in the federal spending ratio,
                                                                                  D(GF)t
in line 2, is rejected. The hypothesis of zero coefficients for lagged

values up to date t-2 corresponds to a statistic, F = 4.2 (2.0), when the

constant is unrestricted, and F 4.4 (20) with the constant set to zero.

The individual F-values indicate separate significance only for the lags of

the wartime intensity variable, GAS, where the statistic is            F4 = 6.2   (2.9).

This result reflects the predictable effect of war on subsequent changes in

federal spending (which is negative, because of the temporary nature of war8).

The insignificance of the GAS variable in the D(TAXF) equation indicates

that this predictable influence on spending does not carry over to a fore-

seeable movement in tax rates. Deficit spending during wars allows for

the smoothing of tax rates.

      The distinction between spending and tax behavior does not hinge entirely

on the war variable. With the lags of the GAS variable deleted, the lags of

the remaining four variables are jointly significant for D(GF)--the statistic

            2.8 (2.0). These variables re still jointly insgnficant for

D(TAXF), where the statistic is F =         1.3.
       The results for output growth, DY in line 4 of Table 4, indicate some

explanatory power even with first lags of all variables omitted. The statistic

for zero coefficients on all lagged variables (with no restriction on the con-

stant) is F = •2.4 (2.0). For individual variables, there is significance

for the lags of DY, r and GAS--the respective statistics for F4 (5% critical

value =    2,9) are 4.3, 4.1 and 4,0. Therefore, the equation for tax-rate
changes could have picked up a systematic response to business fluctuations--

that is, to the expectation that output was currently high or low relative
                                     -30-




 to tmnormalt (with allowance for drift in the level of output). To
                                                                    this
 extent, the findings rule out an important cyclical pattern of the federal

 tax-GNP ratio,9

      The independent variables
                                  are jointly significant when GAS is used
 as the dependent variable (F
                                    15.2 (2.0) in line 3 of the table).1°
 The main role is played by the lags of GAS and D(GF) (F4 = 23,8
                                                                 (2.9) and

 22.6, respectively). The variables consideredlack explanatory power for

 future values of the real rate of return on equity, r (line 5).

      Table 5 contains regression results in the same form for the 1948-79

sample. The conclusions on the tax-rate variable, D(TAXF) in line 1, are

simLar to those just described. That is, the hypothesis of unpredictability

for tax-rate changes is again
                                 accepted. However, significant predictive
power no longer obtains for future changes in the federal spending ratio--the

statistics (line 2) are F = 1.9 (2.4) with the constant unrestricted and

      2.1 (1.9) with the constant set to.zero. These statistics are just below

the 5% critical values. The individual F-values indicate that the most

important change from the previous results is the loss in predictive power

for the lags of the CAS variable. This change reflects the elimination of

the World War II years from the sample.     In any case, since no smoothable

variations in the federal spending ratio were isolated, the absence of

predictability for tax-rate changes over the 1948-79 period does not provide

strong support for the theory.

     The equation for output growth (line 4 of Table 5) also indicates

lack of explanatory power over the 1948-79 sample, as indicated by the

statistic, F = 0.6 (2.4). With lagged values incorporated only up to

date t-2, the present set of variables does not identify situations where

 subsequent output growth would be expected to depart from the normal drift,,

 In this sense the results also would
                                        not detect predictable tax-rate changes
that were associated with anticipated movements in output.

      Finally, the results over the 1948-79 period do reveal some explanatory

power for future values of the war-intensity
                                                  variable, GAS (line 3), but
none for r (line 5).

      Results that include the first lags of all variables are shown in

Table 6 for the 1930-79 period and in Table 7 for the 1948-79 period. The

addition of first lags raises the F-ratios over both samples when the

dependent variable is D(TAXF), D(GF) or DY.11       For the 1930-79 period,

the statistics for the D(TAXF) variable are now F =        2.5 (1.9) with no
restriction on the constant, and F =      2.6   (1.9) with the constant set to

zero. Comparable results for the D(GF) variable are F = 9.7 (1.9) and

F =   9.3   (1.9). For the DY variable, the result (with no constraint on

the constant) is F = 10.2 (1.9). The individual statistics indicate the

separate significance of CAS and D(GF) for the D(TAXF) variable; of GAS

and D(TAXF) for the D(GF) variable; and of r, GAS and DY for the DY

variable.

      If the time-averaging problem had been ignored, these results would have

indicated substantial predictive power from the included independent variables

for future changes in the federal spending ratio and output. The explanatory

power would have been viewed as much reduced, but still significant, for

the federal tax-rate change. This interpretation is unclear because the

 Inclusion of the Tax on Cash Balances

      The analysis has been redone with taxes defined to include the infla-

 tion tax on holdings of high-powered money,12

 where R is the annual
                         average of the 4- to 6-month commercial paper rate and
 H is the annual
                   average of high-powered money (total currency outside the U.S.

 Treasury plus reserves held by commercial banks at the Federal Reserve)
                                                                               The
values of R•H are shown relative
                                   to nominal GNP in Table 1,,

the inclusion of this tax component has a small impact on calculated
                                                                     overall
tax rates, with the largest effects in terms of percentage points
                                                                 occurring
since the rise in interest rates in the late 1960s,'3 For
                                                          example, the
federal tax rate is raised in 1969
                                     form .207 to .214, in 1974 from .200 to
.208, and in 1979 from .206 to .213,

     This change in the definition of tax rates does not alter the

Results with Total Taxes and Spending

     The conclusions from the vector autoregressions are not greatly modified

if federal taxes and spending are replaced by total government measures.

Because of data limitations, the 1930-79 sample is now replaced by 1934-79.

The findings for 1934-79 show first, no predictability for changes in

tax rates when first lags of variables are excluded (F =      1.5);    second,

significant explanatory power in this setting for changes in total spending

relative to GNP (F =   4.6);   third, significance for tax-rate changes when

first lags are included (F =     2.9);   and fourth, a much larger F-value in this

case or changes in the spending ratio (F 8.1). The results over

the 1948-79 sample are also similar to those discussed previously for the

federal government.



The Volatility of Tax and Spending Ratios

     The underlying theory implies that tax-rate movements would smooth out

predictable variations in the ratio of government spending to income. In

this respect the model is reminiscent of interest-rate term-structure models,

where the long rate is supposed to smooth out predictable movements in short

rates. Shiller (1979, 1980) has used such models to generate propositions

that concern the relative volatility of variables--for example, the variance

of changes in long-term interest rates should be smaller than that of short

rates, The parallel proposition here would be an excess of the variance of

changes in spending ratios over that for changes in tax rates.

     The sample standard deviations (about sample means), G,     for   changes in

spending and tax ratios are shown over various periods in Table 2. The
                                  —38—




 -va1ues are higher for the spending ratios in all cases. For the 1884-1979

 sample, the results are GD(GF) = .0402 and
                                            °D(TAXF) = .0116.   Over the 1930-79

 sample, the comparable values are .0487 and .0140. When total government

measures are used, the results over the 1930-79 period are .0461 versus .0120.

      For the 1948-79 period, the spending ratios are far more stable and the

differences in s-values are less dramatic. The values are .0134 for D(GF)

and .0106 for D(TAXF). Corresponding figures for total government are .0145

and .0097.

      The greater volatility in spending ratios than in tax ratios supports

 the underlying view of tax-smoothing.   However, it is clear that a smaller

 Variance for changes in tax ratios than for changes in spending ratios does

not, per se, rule out a pattern of predictable movements in tax rates. There-

fore, the volatility tests should be viewed as supplementary to the tests that

have been carried out earlier.



Concluding Observations

     The present evidence is generally supportive of the tax-rate smoothing

model of intertemporal public finance. Valid tests of the random-walk model

for aggregate federal and total government tax rates led to acceptance at

conventional significance levels.14 In some cases parallel hypotheses for

the ratio of government spending to GNP and for output were rejected. There-

fore, the analytical procedure was capable of detecting systematic movements

of tax rates that mimicked predictable
                                         changes in government spending and

aggregate output. The volatility tests for taxes versus government spending

were also consistent with the tax-rate-smoothing

     Given the limitation to annual data and the necessity of deleting first

lags in the vector autoregressions, the approach can miss predictable patterns

in overall tax rates that apply to short time intervals. For example, if a

change occurs that would induce a permanent shift in tax rates, but adjustment-

cost considerations dictate postponing the effective date for tax law changes

until the following calendar year, then tax rates would be perceived for some

portion of a year as high or low relative to expected long-run values. The

tests that delete first-lag values would not pick up this relationship.

However, the results from the univariate autoregressions do rule
                                                                   out simple,
statistically significant patterns of association for overall tax-rate

changes from one year to the next.

     From the viewpoint of intertemporal substitution effects, the important

relation concerns current tax rates relative to anticipated future rates.

For example, an expectation of rising tax rates on labor earnings would

generate a positive substitution effect on current labor supply. Similarly,

anticipations about future changes in the investment tax credit have been

emphasized as a source of intertemporal substitution effects on investment

demand (Kydland and Prescott, 1977, pp. 482-86). The present techniques and

explanatory variables were incapable of identifying situations where current

overall tax rates for the federal or total government sector were temporarily

significantly above or below their long-run expected values. If this finding

is sustained in more general circumstances, it suggests that existing aggre-

gate time series observations will not be useful in assessing how responsive
                                 —40-




the economy would be to overall taxes that are perceived as temporarily

high or low. The necessary experiment seems not to have been carried Out.

Policies that involve intertemporal manipulation of aggregate tax rates

probably cannot be evaluated with the available data,

         1Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980, Chapter 12) discuss the limitations

 of the analysis that focuses on own-elasticities. They also present

 some more general treatments of the optimal tax problem. Conditions for

 the optimality of uniform taxation are presented in Sandmo (1974) and

 Sadka (1977), The difficulty in using these results arises in assessing

 the quantitative significance of deviations from the precise conditions

 for ensuring that uniform taxation is optimal.

      2The theory applies to government spending net of interest
                                                                 payments.
 The interest payments are determined from the initial debt and the time

path of deficits, given the time path of interest rates,

      3Mobility across governmental jurisdictions may limit the possibilities

for a tax-rate-smoothing debt policy--see Benjamin and Kochin (1978), There-

fore, the model may fit better for the federal government than for state and

local governments, However, the federal government can set a debt policy to

smooth total tax rates, rather than federal rates, In this case, the model

would apply to total government tax rates.

         It also affects Hall's (1978) analysis of consumption, although the

problem was not considered there.

     5A negative coefficient for Dti arises if Ipi >        v'7. The   coefficient
cannot fall below -1/5, which is attained when Ipi   = 1,

     6i examined also lagged values of public debt expressed relative to

GNP. These variables were unimportant for explaining changes in the tax

and spending ratios,

      7The dollar rate of return for each year is the value-weighted total

 return for all New York Stock Exchange issues, as compiled by the University

 of Chicagots Center for Research on Security Prices. An inflation rate is

 subtracted to determine the real rate of return. From 1948 to 1979 the

 inflation rate is calculated from the seasonally-unadjusted December value

 of the consumer price index for an urban consumer, measured exclusive of

 the shelter component. (Shelter was deleted in order to avoid the erroneous

 measures of mortgage interest costs. For the 1967-79 period, where the CPI net

 of mortgage interest costs is available, there was a close correspondence

 between the inflation rate measured net of shelter and that measured net

 only of mortgage interest costs.) Before 1948 the overall CPI for an urban

 consumer was used.


      The estimated coefficient of
                                   CASt2 in the equation for D(GF) is
-.23, s.e, =   .05.   See Table A2.


     9My previous results on the cyclical behavior of public debt
                                                                       (Barro,
1979, pp. 963, ff.) were based on the relation of current real GNP to

an estimated time trend. That
                                 analysis should be revised to utilize a
measure of current real GNP relative to
                                              predicted future values. The
temporary federal spending variable from that analysis should be similarly

recomputed.

    10Since CAS > 0
                      applies, the linear specification for this variable
is inappropriate. However, the only purpose of this equation is to indicate

the significant explanatory value of the lagged variables.

     11The F-value for GAS remains significant, while that for r is again

insignificant.

     12GNP wa retained as the tax base, although the inclusion of "monetary

services" would be a possibility.


     13The proportionate effects are greater in some earlier periods--for

example, in 1929, where R = .058 applies, the federal tax rate is revised

upward from .0368 to .0408.


     14The one exception is the significant drift for the total government

tax ratio over the 1930-79 period.

 Analysis of the Time-Aggregati,on Problem

      Suppose that observations correspond to "years" as numbered by
 t   1, 2, ...      Each year is composed of underlying segments, i =                                       n.
                                                                      1, 2, ..,
 The basic model dictates a random walk for a variable t at these underlying

time units:

             (Al) tiT.T t,i-4 +U.,
                                ti

for all t and i =      1,    ...   n, where TtO 'r1. The disturbance                                  is i.i.d.

with zero mean. The distribution of u is assumed to be normal in some of the

discussion.

     The time-averaged observation for period t is


                             n1 ti
           (A2)



Using equation (Al), the first difference,                                -
                                                                              -r1 can be
shown to equal


           (A3)          =
                             - {[nu     +
                                            (n_l)u2           +   ... +              +            +
                                                                                         [u_i,2       2ut_1,3
                         +   ... + (n_l)u_1,]}
That is,          is a moving-average process, involving disturbances applicable to

years t and t-l.

     From equation (A3) it follows (as in Working (1960)) that the simple

correlation between DT and Dt               is
                             t        t-l



           (A4) CORR(DTt, D'r- )

As the underlying interval becomes infinitesimal, n            3nd

                  urn
        (A5)            c0RR(DTt,DTt1) =   1/4.

It follows from inspection of equation (A3) that the simple correlation of

Dt with DTt., where i > 2, is zero With DTt1 omitted, DTt is

independent of the set of lagged variables, DTt2 Drt3,

        Equation (A3) can be used also to evaluate a string of partial

correlations involving DT and a set of lagged values                 where i = 1,   2,

        With four lags included, the pattern of partial correlations turns out

to be 56/193 (.29), —15/193 (—.08), 4/193 (.02), and —2/193 (—.01).

        Consider another time-averaged, random-walk variable in first-difference

form,


        (A6)      DXt =     {(nvi ... + v•)
                                   +              +
                                                      [v.i2 ... + (n_l)vi}}.
                                                           +



The underlying interval length, as determined by n, coincides with that for

t,   The disturbances, (u±, Vt1), are now treated as bivariate normal with

zero mean, serial independence and contemporaneous correlation p.

        It can be shown that the partial correlation of DTt with DXt1,. given

     is zero. Similarly, given the string of lagged values, DTt1, the partial

correlation of Dt with DXt. is zero.


        Suppose now that X is observed directly, rather than in

Recall that p is the correlation between
                                                     u. (the T-innovation) and v. (the

respectively.    When p = 0
                            the coefficients in equation (A8) reduce to (1/4,

Dt1 is positive if p2 <        2/3--that   is, if Jp <          .82,   Otherwise, the coef-
ficient is negative. The magnitude of this coefficient is no greater than

1/4--the value approaches -1/5 as jpj +          1.

Notes:   The dependent variable is noted in the first row as either the first difference of TAXF or GF. Each column
         reports the array of estimated coefficients and standard errors for a single regression. The independent
         variables are a constant and four lags of DITAXF), D(GF), CAS, DY, and r. See Table 1 for definitions of
         variables.    is the standard error of estimate. F-statistics are shown in Tables 4-7 of the text.
