                                               ABSTRACT

The effects of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) are disputed. In this paper, we assess these effects
using capital market data and an event-study approach, using a daily data set covering a thousand announcements
spanning over eighty economies and a hundred RTAs over twenty recent years. We measure the effects
of news concerning RTAs on the returns of national stock markets, adjusted for international stock
market movements. We then link these excess returns to features of the RTA members and the agreements
themselves. We find evidence of the natural trading partner hypothesis; stock markets rise more when
RTAs are signed between countries that already engage in high volumes of trade. Stock markets also
rise more when poorer countries sign RTAs.

1: Introduction and Motivation

       There has been an unprecedented rise in the number of Regional Trade
Agreements (hereafter RTAs) over the last fifteen years. However, the consequences
of RTAs are controversial. In this short paper, we attempt to assess RTAs using the
lens of the stock market.1

       A large literature on RTAs has emerged; Freund and Ornelas (2009), Baldwin
(2008) and Panagariya (2000) provide surveys. Some stylized facts emerge from the
recent literature. RTAs tend to boost trade between their members, with rather small
trade-diverting effects for non-members. RTA formation is not random, but depends
systematically on economic and political factors. Further, there is evidence of
considerable heterogeneity in the overall trade effect of RTAs.2

       A few studies go beyond pure trade effects of RTAs. The welfare effects of the
Canada-U.S. FTA and NAFTA on member and non-member countries have been
assessed to be small and positive or close to zero according to Trefler (2004) and
Romalis (2007). Based on a structural model, Egger and Larch (2011) find that positive
welfare effects of the Europe Agreements are more pronounced for Central and Eastern
European countries (CEEC) than for the older (15) members of the EU.

       The “natural trading partner hypothesis” suggests that positive welfare effects
should stem from RTAs between countries with high trade volumes prior to the
agreement. The strength of the theory is a matter of controversy. Baier and Bergstrand
(2004) and Egger and Larch (2008) find support for natural trading partners. In
contrast, Krishna (2003) uses a general equilibrium model to argue that the welfare
effects from potential RTAs with 24 trading partners of the United States are not
associated with either trade volume between or distance to RTA-partners.

       We examine the reaction of stock markets to news about RTAs for a number of
reasons. Most obviously, our analysis can be viewed as a complement to existing work.
More importantly, it is easier than tracking effects on trade, which requires a well-
specified empirical model of trade flows. To determine the impact of RTAs on output,
                                               2


let alone welfare would require an even more elaborate specification. Further, the
response of the capital markets to news about RTAs automatically incorporates
discounted expected future effects of RTAs. Finally, since we have a relatively large
number of observations, we are able to differentiate across RTAs, and see how their
impact varies with their characteristics.3 For instance, there is little systematic empirical
evidence that poorer countries profit from RTAs. This is a matter of considerable
controversy to eminent economists like Joseph Stiglitz, who is concerned that poorer
countries face a “take-it-or-leave-it” attitude in negotiations with partners like the United
States.4




2: Empirical Methodology

       We adopt an event-study methodology to analyze why the stock-market effects
of RTA announcements differ across announcements. Our objective is to use the most
comprehensive data set possible.

Creating Excess National Returns

       We are typically interested in a high-frequency return on the stock market, but
only the idiosyncratic national component after any common global stock market drift
has been taken into account. We adjust national returns for international drift in a plain-
vanilla method suggested by MacKinlay (1997). In particular, we regress daily national
returns on daily global returns of the MSCI so as to be able to estimate a national beta
(and an associated intercept). We do this separately for each event, using a window of
time that starts thirteen months before the news event and ends a month before the
announcement. That is, we first estimate over the relevant estimation window:


       Ri,t = αi + βiRMSCI,t + εi,t   over t=T-395 ... T-29                            (1)


where: Ri,t is the one-day return on the national stock market index of country i at day t,
RMSCI,t is the analogue for the MSCI, E(εi,t)=0, Var(εi,t)=σ2, T is the day of the relevant
RTA news announcement. We then form one-day excess returns (ERi,t) for the event
                                                    3

                        ∧    ∧                                                         ∧     ∧
window as ERit = Rit − α i − β i ⋅ RMSCI ,t , where the values for the coefficients α i , β i  are
                                                                                                
estimated with least squares as described in (1).

           Our default measure of excess returns is the national return (measured in local
currency) adjusted for global stock market drift as proxied by the MSCI dollar return.
However, to check for sensitivity, we also provide a number of different variants of this
measure. For instance, we use the EAFE index to measure global stock market drift,
instead of the MSCI. A different perturbation skips any adjustment at all for international
stock market drift; we also consider restricting the responsiveness of the national stock
market to international returns to lie in (-1,1). Alternatively, we convert national returns
from local currency into American dollars, and then regress these dollar returns on the
MSCI dollar return. We also report national returns measured in dollars as well as the
effect of RTA news on the exchange rate (rather than the stock market).

           We accumulate excess returns over different windows of time around the dates
of RTA announcements. Our default measure is to accumulate ERi,t starting a day
before the news and continuing for 10 business days (two weeks) afterward so that we
        T +10
form ∑ ERi ,t ≡ ERi ,T . However, we test for robustness with respect to the exact window
        T −1

size.

Linking National Returns to Fundamentals

           We are interested in linking features of excess national stock returns to more
fundamental economic determinants; this enables us to understand why excess returns
vary across countries and RTA announcements. There are two sets of relevant
fundamentals: those of the country and those of the RTA. Countries may respond more
to RTAs because of national features (the stock markets of open countries may respond
more to RTAs since trade is more important to them), or because of the nature of the
RTA (e.g., RTAs with irrelevant trading partners may have little effect on the stock
market): we seek to investigate both types of effects.
                                                     4


       We estimate the following equation:


        ERi ,T = γ ⋅ X i ,T + δ ⋅ RTAi ,T + u i ,T                                      (2)


where: Xi,T denotes a set of characteristics of country i at time T, RTA is a set of
characteristics describing the nature of the RTA signed by the country at the time, and
{γ,δ} are the (vectors of) coefficients of interest to us. We estimate (2) with least
squares on the assumption that the disturbance represents a host of well-behaved
terms that drive the national stock market independently of the included regressors. We
use standard errors clustered at the country-level, and include an intercept and a
dummy that differentiates RTAs that cover trade in goods and services (rather than
simply goods).




3: The Data Set

       We consider all RTAs that have been signed, reported and enacted into force.
The universe of RTAs is drawn from the “Regional Trade Agreement Information
System” (RTA-IS) database of the World Trade Organization (WTO), available at
http://rtais.wto.org.5

News Announcements

A central component of our data set and identification strategy consists of a unique set
of dates. These are days of important news releases concerning individual RTAs. We
consider two important dates: a) the day when it was announced that negotiations on a
RTA will commence at some future date (which we dub “Start”), and b) the day that
agreement on the RTA was actually reached (“Deal”).6,7 We identify the exact
announcement dates through a full-text analysis on LexisNexis, where we mainly focus
on international newswires, press releases and well-established newspapers published
in English.8 Announcements of RTAs are usually made by prominent policy makers like
the President, Prime Minister, or the minister of Finance, Economics, or Trade Minister
                                             5


of the country, and often precede official signature dates (as reported by the WTO) by
several weeks or months.9 Announcements that are made over the weekend are
advanced to register on the next business day.

       In the interests of parsimony, we combine together RTA start and deal dates into
a single data set, rather than modelling them separately. The hypothesis that the stock
market responds equally to both types of news cannot be rejected at any reasonable
significance level.

Stock Markets and Exchange Rates

       Over 130 countries in the world have signed RTAs. Since we try to include as
many of them as possible, one of the constraints on our data set is the number of stock
markets in the world. To the best of our knowledge, we include all countries for which
daily stock market data is available since 1970. Since we are primarily interested in the
effects of RTAs on domestic agents, our default measure is the daily closing rate of a
broad national stock market index, denominated in local currency. For example, we
use: the S&P500 for the American stock market, the FTSE for the UK, the DAX for
Germany, the Nikkei for Japan, and the S&P/TSX for Canada. We search for series
from a number of different data providers, and use them in a sequential order
determined mostly by the span of the data and the perceived accuracy of the data set:
Global Financial Database (which we use wherever possible); MSCI/Barra (which we
use when reliable GFD data does not exist); Freelunch.com (to fill in remaining gaps);
Freelunch.com and the Standard & Poors IFC.

       While returns in local currency are those of greatest interest to local investors,
they are not the only returns of interest. Foreign investors may be more interested in
local returns after taking into account any coincident exchange rate changes.
Accordingly, we add to our data set daily closing spot exchange rates vis-à-vis the U.S.
dollar; these allow us to convert stock market returns from local currency returns into
U.S. dollar returns. Once again, we gather data from a number of different sources and
use them in sequential order. We draw on exchange rate data from the U.S. Federal
                                                6


Reserve, and (via Datastream): Thomson Reuters, WM/Reuters, Global Treasury
Information Systems (before 2000, these series come from Bankers Trust), and MSCI.

           To the national series, we add a few global stock market aggregates such as the
MSCI World and EAFE indices (both measured in dollars). We use these series so as
to be able to adjust national stock market returns for global stock market returns.

           The series have been corrected after extensive checking for mistakes,
transcription errors, jumps, the introduction of the Euro, and the like.10 Also, we restrict
ourselves to trading Monday through Friday.

           Overall our data set covers 1001 country-RTA-events for 82 countries and 122
regional trade agreements. An appendix table provides detailed information on the
announcement dates, the type of news and the countries included for each RTA in the
data set.

Country and RTA Characteristics

           Along with the excess returns from our financial data set, we need features of
both the country and the RTA fundamentals to estimate equation (2). We gather data
from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators for four country-specific
regressors. We are interested in whether the response of a country’s stock market to
RTA news differs with its income, size, openness, and stock-market size. Accordingly,
as regressors in equation (2), we include the natural logarithms of: a) real GDP per
capita b) population, c) the nominal trade: GDP ratio, and d) the stocks traded: GDP
ratio.11

           We are also interested in whether features of the RTA drive the stock market
reaction. To measure the importance of the RTA in terms of actual (and potential)
exports, we combine WDI data with bilateral data taken from the IMF’s Direction of
Trade Statistics and create bilateral exports from country i to all the trading partners in
the RTA, and normalize this by i’s GDP. A different measure of RTA importance is the
simple summation of real GDP of the RTA trading partners; we also include the log of
this on the right-hand side of equation (2).12

4: Results

Benchmark Results

       We tabulate our default estimates of equation (2) in Table 1. The middle column
presents results for our default window, which begins one day before the news
announcement and extends until ten days afterwards. To check for sensitivity we
consider both longer and shorter windows; these are presented on either side of our
default.

       A country’s size, openness, and stock market depth play little important role in
explaining why stock market returns across different RTA announcements. Still, there is
a strong negative effect of national income; the stock markets of poor countries rise
more with RTA news than do those of rich countries. This effect is statistically at
conventional significance levels. It is also economically large. For our default window
of (t-1,t+10): an increase in income of one standard deviation from the average level of
real GDP per capita lowers excess returns by an annualized amount of 10% (the effect
would be larger if we used a shorter window of time). Finally, it is sensible; poorer
countries are more protectionist than richer ones, and thus have more to gain from trade
liberalization.

       We also find a strong effect for current exports to RTA members, consistent with
the “natural trade” hypothesis. This effect is consistently statistically significant, and
economically large; an increase in the RTA export/GDP ratio of one standard deviation
from the mean delivers annualized returns of around 9%. This strong result contrasts
with the irrelevance of the economic size of the RTA; collective RTA output has no
strong or consistent relationship with stock market returns. These results are robust to
the exact choice of window size for excess returns.

Sensitivity Analysis

       We have found that the stock markets of poorer countries respond more
positively to RTA news; RTAs between countries with proportionately more exports also
have a more pronounced effect. On the other hand, the economic size of the RTA
                                               8


seems irrelevant to the markets, as does the size, openness and financial depth of the
country signing the RTA. Are these default results sensitive to minor perturbations in
the basic econometric methodology? In a word “no,” as we document in this section.

       Table 2 uses a number of different techniques to adjust national for global
returns. We compare results from our default regressand with those when: a) we
restrict βi in equation (1) to lie in the range of (-1,1); b) we set αi=βi=0 and thus do not
adjust for global returns at all; c) we substitute EAFE returns for those of the MSCI; and
d) we combine a) and c). None of our results is substantively changed. Appendix Table
A1 shows that our results are also insensitive to the exact sample of data.13

       Our default measure of national returns is measured as a percentage change in
local currency. In Table 3 we show that currency fluctuations do not account for our
results. We do this in two ways: first, we convert LC to US$ returns; alternatively, we
add the LC/$ exchange change to the MSCI return in equation (1). Our results seem
insensitive. Appendix Tables A2 and A3 repeat the analysis of Table 1 for returns
measure in US$ and the LC/US$ exchange rate respectively.

       In Table 4 we check if adding extra controls destroys our results. First, we
replace exports to RTA partners by exports to and imports from RTA partners (still
scaled by domestic GDP). We then add time-specific fixed effects. Another column
reports adding controls for the type of RTA; we differentiate customs unions, free trade
agreements, and preferential trade agreements. Finally we add a fixed effect for each
RTA. Only the last perturbation has any substantive effect, leaving the sign and
essential magnitude of the income effect unchanged, but reducing precision to the point
where the coefficient is insignificantly different from zero.




5: Summary

       In this short paper, we have assessed the effects of Regional Trade Agreements
(RTAs) from a new vantage point, that of the stock market. We use an event-study
approach to analyze a new comprehensive daily data set that includes 1001 new
                                            9


announcements spanning 82 economies and 122 RTAs between 1988 and 2009. We
measure the effects of news concerning RTAs on the returns of national stock markets,
after adjusted for international stock market movements in a variety of ways. Our
strategy is to link these excess returns to features of both the RTA participants and
those of the agreement itself. We find strong robust evidence of the natural trading
partner hypothesis; stock markets rise more for RTAs between countries that engage in
high volumes of trade. Another strong result is that stock markets respond more to
RTAs signed by poorer countries.

Note: All information except for the event date and event type drawn from the RTA-database of the World Trade Organization (see http://rtais.wto.org). The “List of
all RTAs in force” and the “List of early announcements” were downloaded from this database on 21 October, 2009, and 27 February, 2010, respectively. RTAs
reported in chronological order. Following three selection criteria have to be met in order to be included in our dataset: i) RTA reported to and part of WTO’s RTA-
database ii) daily stock market data available and iii) this daily financial market data available for both RTA-members in the case of a bilateral trade agreement or
for at least one RTA-member country if the signatory constitutes a RTA itself. Event date based on full-text research via LexisNexis, where we mainly focus on
international newswires, press releases and well-established newspapers published in English. Event date refers to official announcement of at least one of the
involved governments that i) negotiations on a regional trade agreement will be started soon (start) or ii) that a general agreement on such an agreement has been
reached (deal). The reported dates refer to the first trading day, when such an announcement can be priced in. Announcements of deals usually proceed the
official signature date as reported by the WTO by several weeks or months. Name of RTA is name of Regional Trade Agreement as reported by WTO.
Description of Announcement gives some details on news.

   By “regional trade agreements” (RTAs), we include customs unions (CUs), free trade agreements
(FTAs) and preferential trade agreements (PTAs). We do not distinguish between these forms; it is not
easy to do so in practice, and all are allowed within the GATT/WTO framework.

   Among others, Magee (2003, 2008), Baier and Bergstrand (2004, 2007, 2009), Carrère (2006), Eicher
et al. (2011) and Egger et al. (2011) document the endogenous nature of regional trade agreements and
their heterogeneous effects. Egger and Larch (2008) and Baldwin and Jaimovich (2010) emphasize the
“spatial dimension” of trade agreements; if geographically close countries or important trading partners
strike a deal with another country, the incentives for non-members to pursue a regional trade agreement
increase.

  We are not aware of any event study that investigates differences across RTAs, but Thompson (1994)
and Rodriguez (2003) among others exploit differences across individual firms – for one specific RTA,
here, Canada-U.S. and NAFTA – to test for trade theories.

   Joseph Stiglitz raises this concern for instance in the following news paper articles: “New Trade Pacts
Betray the Poorest Partners,“ Wall Street Journal, July 10, 2004; “Nobel Laureate Criticizes FTA, U.S.
Unilateralism,” The Korea Herald, Nov. 16, 2007.

   These are listed in the RTA-IS under “List of all RTAs in force” as well as those that have been signed
but are not yet in force (listed in the RTA-IS under “List of early announcements”).

   If the countries officially decide to conduct some sort of “pilot study” together, this announcement is
defined as the official start of negotiations, so long as de facto negotiations are not conditional on the
success of the pilot study.

   In the case of entry into the European Community/European Union, we define a “deal” as the European
Commission’s announcement to officially recommend the accession of a new member. While the
European Council technically decides to accept this recommendation, the Council has never yet rejected
a positive recommendation.

   The full-text research via LexisNexis (LexisNexis Academic) was performed between October and
December 2009, at the Haas Business School and between December 2009 and March 2010 at ETH
Zurich. The full-text research typically starts with the key-words “free trade” or “trade agreement” and the
two respective country names. We restrict ourselves to dates before the respective RTA went into force.

   One of the reasons for a gap between the official announcement and the signature ceremony is “legal
scrubbing” since it usually takes some time to transform the political will of a general agreement into a
contract. (We are not aware of any cases where an agreement has not been followed by the formal
signing of a RTA.) A number of RTAs have been signed but not yet ratified; these RTAs are not yet in
force (prominent examples would be the US–Korea and US–Colombia RTAs).

    Typically when we collect the same series from different sources (e.g., the EAFE index or the $/C$
exchange rate), the series coincide closely.

     Note that the variable “stocks traded relative to GDP” is only available from 1988.

    In the case of RTA-enlargements, the features of the RTA only refer to the new RTA partner(s).

    The following time periods are defined as financial crises: Tequila Crisis (12/1994 and 1/1995), Asian
Crisis (7/1997 to 12/1997), Russian Crisis and LTCM crisis (8/1998 to 12/1998), Argentine sovereign
default (12/2001 and 1/2002) and onset of Subprime Crisis (8/2008 and 9/2008).
