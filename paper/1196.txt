           Management in an Overlapping Generations Economy

                                 ABSTRACT




       This paper analyzes exchange rate management in a simple overlapping
generations model. This framework is used to evaluate alternative policies
in terms of their implications for the welfare of individuals in the economy.
The analysis identifies two objectives of monetary     policy,   providing a
desirable store of value and collecting seigniorage. When        the   chief   concern

is to provide a desirable store of value (as when the monetary authority's
major constituency consists of the asset holders of the economy), a policy
of fixing the exchange rate does better when shocks are primarily of domestic
origin while floating becomes more desirable when foreign shocks predominate.
When seigniorage concerns are paramount (as when the authority's constituency

is the young generation) flexible rates do   better.    When seigniorage concerns

are paramount   and when the monetary authority cannot establish a reputation
for conducting monetary policy in a way that makes the currency a desirable
store of value, a national currency may not be viable     in   the absence of
exchange controls. Such controls may be justified in this situation.

1. Introduction

         The design   of   monetary policy and exchange rate management is a topic

that has   received   considerable attention in the last five years. Papers by

BUiter   (1979), Turnovsky (1983), Buiter and Eaton (1980), Eaton and         Turnovsky

(1980) and Frenkel and Aizenman (1982) are examples of models that consider
the optimality of alternative stabilization rules. The models used to
evaluate alternative monetary and        exchange   rate policies and to derive
optimal policies suffer from      four   deficiencies that this paper attempts to
address.

     First, models    are constructed on the basis of a number of aggregate macro-

economic relationships that are not derived from underlying preferences and

technologies. Their usefulness for policy evaluation is therefore questionable

for the reason given by Lucas (1976): changes in policy may          lead   to changes in

these aggregate relationships. Output supply and asset demands are examples of

functional relationships that may be sensitive to policy changes.

     Second, po1cy evaluation is based upon ad hoc objective functions of the

government rather than upon a comparison of the welfare of individuals in the

economy under alternative policies. Assuming that the government is responsive

to the welfare of its citizens its policy objectives should derive from the

preferences of individuals in the economy. When individual objective functions

are specified alternative policies can then be evaluated in terms of their

effects on individuals' utilities.

     Third, discussion of optimal monetary policy in open economies has typically

ignored the role of national monies in generating seigniorage for their govern-

ments. Fischer (1982) has recently discussed seigniorage as an objective of
                                                 2

        monetary      policy but provides no formal analysis. In fact, in some countries

        seigniorage constitutes a major source of revenue, possibly because it con-

        stitutes the administratively least expensive and least distortionary form

        of   taxation.
               Fourth, optimal policies are typically derived from the class of closed
    -
        loop   policies. As Kydland and Prescott (1977) have emphasized, such policies

        may not be time consistent. For many of the models discussed above the

        optimal closed loop and optimal feedback policies coincide.' Once seigniorage

        considerations are introduced, however, they diverge.

               This paper develops a model of an open economy derivative of the Samuelson

        (1958) pure consumption loan model.2 Individuals have available to them as a

        store of value a     foreign currency which depreciates in value at a stochastic
        rate   that is exogenous to the economy under consideration. The population

        growth rate of this economy is also an exogenous stochastic process.

               The government of this economy has the ability to provide its own currency

        as a store of value. Individuals choose their first period consumption and
•

        allocate their savings between the two currencies to maximize the expected

        utility of consumption over two periods. There is no individual bequest motive.

        New money issue is used to finance government expenditure which is assumed to

        benefit only the younger generation. It is assumed that foreigners do not

        hold the domestic currency, possibly because of exchange controls or the fear

        of   exchange controls in the future. Otherwise the exchange rate would be
        indeterminate, as demonstrated by      Kareken and Wallace (198l).

                 Bringing   the economy toward the o1den Rule and   generating   seigniorage
        constitute two              of monetary policy. Providing a relatively riakiess
                           major goals

        store of value is an additional goal. The objectives of monetary policy to
        provide                                   generate revenue for public expendi-
                  a desirable store of value and to

        ture are in sharp conflict in the short run but may be more compatible in the
        long   run.

                                                                                  -
           When the primary objective of the monetary
                                                   authority is to provide a
 desirable store of value, one insight of the previous literature
                                                                   reemerges:
 a policy of predetermining the exchange rate each period tends to yield
 higher welfare when the foreign price level is stable relative to domestic
 output and conversely. A policy of having no national currency at all,
 relying solely upon the foreign currency as a store of value, can in some

 circumstances   dominate a policy of having a currency fixed in value in
 terms of the foreign currency or freely floating against it. When the
 primary   function   of the monetary authority is to generate seigniorage, however,

 a policy of pure floating always dominates a fixed exchange rate policy or a

 policy of having no national currency.

     When seigniorage considerations are present, a government that attempts

to maximize the welfare only of the current young       generation cannot sustain

a currency. The only time consistent policy leads to a nonmonetary economy.

Introducing the expected utility of future generations as a public good can

reverse this result, however. Alternatively, when earning seigniorage is not

an objective3'             time consistent policy can correspond to the optimal

closed loop policy.4

     Section 2 derives the optimal savings and portfolio behavior of each

atomistic individual in the economy under consideration. Section 3 imbeds

this behavior in a simple, aggregate model to derive the behavior of the

domestic price level and the exchange rate as functions of exogenous vari-

ables and policy parameters. The expected welfare of each generation in a

nonmonetary economy is derived In section 4, and is compared with expected

welfare under fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes for a monetary economy.

Section 5 considers optimal feedback policies under alternative social welfare

and individual utility functions. Section 6 discusses the role of reputation

as a means of enforcing a monetary economy and the optimal closed loop policy.

Some concluding remarks appear in section 7.

 2. Optimal Consumption and Portfolio Behavior

        Consider an economy of the Saxnuelson (1958) pure consumption loan

 variety. Individuals live two periods, earning an amount Y in the first

 period of their lives and nothing in the second period. An individual

 i entering the labor force in period t seeks to maximize a utility function

 of the form:

        log        + 8 log C0+ 1 + w Ct                                        (2.1)


where C1 denotes i's consumption in the working period, CO+ in the retire-

ment period, and G denotes per worker government spending in the working

period. Individuals are assumed not to derive utility from government spend—

'ing   in   their retirement period. The parameter w indicates the weight placed

on government spending relative to private consumption.

        Individuals have available to them as stores of value a domestic money

and a foreign money. There is a single traded good, the price of which, in

period t, is P in terms of domestic money and         in terms of foreign money.

Exact purchasing power parity (PPP) obtains so that

where Et denotes the domestic currency price of foreign currency. The country

under consideration is small in the sense that domestic actions do not affect

     The rate of inflation in terms of the foreign price level is II so that

            = (1 +        P   —                                                (2.3)

The next section derives this process for the domestic price from the under-

lying macroeconomic equilibrium of the economy.

     No voluntary intergenerational transfers take place. The two monies

provide the only assets to transfer income from the working period to the

retirement period. During the working period individual i                     thus chooses Ciy
and divides his wealth between the two monies to maximize expected lifetime

utility. Let                 denote   individual i's share of wealth allocated toward the

foreign money. Thus

behavior of a single individual facing a given level of government spending

and distributions of the foreign and domestic price levels and the exchange

rate. The next section derives the level of government spending and the

behavior of the domestic price level and exchange rate from aggregate

characteristics of the economy and from government policy.

          Following much of the previous literature on exchange rate intervention

    this model assumes that the only contemporaneous variable that the government

    observes is the exchange rate. (See, e.g. (Buiter (1979), Turnovsky (1983),

    Buiter and Eaton (1980), Eaton and Turnovsky (1980), Frenkel and Aizenman (19E2)).

    On the basis of information available at the end of the previous period the

    government sets a monetary growth rate g that is subject to revision in

    response to new information embodied in the exchange rate. The actual money

    growth rate is therefore
                M      e
                g + au                                                              (3.6)

    where u, recall, is the unanticipated component of the exchange rate and
                                                                                   a
    a policy parameter. Setting a = 0 corresponds to a regime of pure floating
while      the exchange rate is fixed within the period   (i.e.,   nonatochastic) when
      —   — . It is assumed that g is bounded from below by zero; the expected
level of government spending cannot be negative.

response. Analytic solutions for the general case were not obtained.

       It is nevertheless useful to consider instead three special cases:

the non—monetary economy, the monetary economy with fixed exchange rates

within the period, and a monetary economy with perfectly flexible rates

4.1 A Nonmonetary Economy

       From expression (4.3) observe that if

           >   n+   11* + a/(l — a)                                                       (4.6)

then A =     1,   i.e., domestic currency is not held at all. Seigniorage from

domestic money creation is zero and foreign money is the only store of value.

Expected utility is

                                                                                          (4.7)

      When a =      —   individuals will hold only domestic currency if g — n<II*

end   only   foreign currency if gM — n>II*            The econd case yields the noninonetary

economy. If gM.n=u* individuals are indifferent between the two currencies.

For concreteness, assume that A = 0 In this case. When gM<n + 11*, then,

expected utility is given by

      UP       p + (I +        —   gM     —   n) — 1/2 cy2+ W[gM —    (2 +   a2)]         (4.8)




and when gM > n + 11* by uN. Therefore if wW>l it is optimal to set gM =                j* +
while if wJ<l, to set g =            0.       In the first case expected utility is


               p +l        —   fl*   -   a2/2     + W(fl* + n —       + a2)]              (4.8')

while in the second it is


      UP' — p     + (1 + ) + n — a2/2               — wW(a2

           Comparing (4.8') and                   (4.8")         with (4.7), expected utility in a nonmonetary

economy, note that a nonmonetary economy dominates a monetary economy with fixed

exchange         rates         if and only if

The only cost to establishing a currency with ixed rates relative to a no

currency situation is the variability in seign.orage. This cost increases

with the variance of the foreign price leveland the domestic growth rate.

The benefit is the ability either to earn seigniorage on domestic currency or

else to establish the Golden Rule interest rate. Either bnef it increases with

the term 11* + n, or the difference between the world interest rate (_fl*) and the

domestic growth rate.

 constraints (4.11), (4.12) and gO. The second—order condition for a

 maximum is satisfied, however, if and only if wW>l.

      In view of this complication it is considerably simpler to focus on two

 particular special cases, one in which seigniorage effects are negligible (W=O),

 and one in which they are paramount (wW=oo).           Each is treated in turn.

Comparing expressions (4.13') and (4.13") with (4.7) note that                  a     monetary economy

with pure floating dominates a nonmonetary economy when r + fl* and a*2 are

large relative to a2.

 The   greater     the domestic growth rate relative to the foreign inflation rate

 the higher is the increase in the rate of return from establishing a domestic

 currency. When            a*2    is large relative to o the return on domestic money

 under floating rates will be relatively less risky.

        The desirability of fixing the exchange rate or allowing it to float

can    be   determined by comparing expressions (4.13') and (4.13") with

expression (4.8") evaluated at w =               0.   The condition for -fIxed rates to

4. 3.2 Dominance of Seigniorage Effects
                                                                            --


       To analyse          the   situation in which earning seigniorage is of paramount

concern set                .     From expression (4.13) observe that seigniorage is at a

maximum when•


       gM     (n + fl+ a)/2                                                               (4.15)

if X>:Oat     this value which requires, in turn, that


                       a2)/2 <2
       n +         —
                                                                                          (4.16)
                                            17


In this case earnings from seigniorage, denoted S, are


                  *       22
             (n+fl +a)
                    p          W                                                   (4.17)

             .4(a2+a*2)
               U      p                 0




If A —    0 at the value of gM given by (4.15) then the monetary authority can

Since both (4.17) and (4.19) are positive, while in a nonmonetary economy

seigniorage is zero, when seigniorage dominates the welfare function a monetary

policy with flexible rates always yields higher expected utility than a non--

monetary economy.

      Under fixed rates seigniorage earnings are stochastic because of the need

to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the currency.       The

appropriate comparison,then, is between expected seigniorage under

the two regimes. Normalizing (4.8) by dividing through by Lh note that maxirnum

expected seigniorage under fixed rates as w goes to infinity is


      E(S)     [fl* + —    (2 ÷ a2)]W                                              (4.20)

      By comparing (4.20) with (4.17) and (4.19) it can be shown that maximum

expected     seigniorage is necessarily higher under perfectly flexible exchange

rates. When rates are perfectly flexible disturbances in the foreign price

level affect neither the domestic price level nor the amount of money creation.

They consequently do not affect real per capita seigniorage. Disturbances in

the domestic population growth rate create domestic price level disturbances

in the opposite direction. The two cancel each other to the point where, as a
                                           18


first—order approximation,real seignorage            capita is non—stochastic.

When exchange rates are fixed, however, variation in the domestic price

level and population growth rate are no longer perfectly negatively

correlated. As a consequence of Jensen's inequality, expected real

seignorage per capita is lower. This effect is not offset by the fact

that   under   fixed rates more money can be created, on average, without

leading to substitution into the foreign currency. Under fixed rates

 5. Optimal Feedback and Closed Loop Policies

         The last section compared expected utility in a situation in which the

 monetary     authority      pegs the exchange rate each period with one in which it

 sets the money supply independently of the exchange rate. It was assumed that

 the monetary authority could precommit itself to a monetary response that

 maximizes the expected utility of each generation.

      The monetary authority may,          however, respond only to the wishes of
 generations present at the time the monetary policy is implemented. At this

 point   the money holdings of the old generation are a bygone, while the demand

 for money of the young geieration depends upon its expectations of policy in a

 later period. If current policy has no effect on expectations of future policy

 the monetary authority will establish a level of monetary growth each period

 taking as given monetary policies in other periods and existing asset

holdings.

      In period t, then, the authority selects            and a to maximize   a weighted
average of the old and young generation.' utilities. Let a denote the weight

assigned to the young generation's utility and 1—a the weight to the old

generation's utility.

     The component of the expected utility of che old. generation that is a

function of policy           in period t   is
                    + (1 —            )

                                        20


A time consistent policy is a choice of g and a that maximizes

csU+(l—ct)U.                                               -


      When seigniorage earnings do not affect utility ( = 0) the young

generation is unaffected by current policy. Situations in which séigniorage

effects are absent (w = 0) and in which the old generation dominates the

social welfare function (a = 0) thus imply equivalent welfare criteria.

Similarly, equivalent welfare criteria emerge when seigniorage effects are

paramount (ô = co) and when the young generation dominates the social

welfare function (a = 1).

     One result of this section is that when the young generation dominates

•the social welfare function or when seigniorage dominates the individual

utility function (i.e., when a = 1 when °F w = co) then time consistent (or

optimal feedback) policy cannot sustain a monetary economy. The consequent

equilibrium is in general inferior to the optimum that would emerge if the

monetary authority could precommit itself to an alternative policy (i.e.,

to choosing the optimal closed loop policy). A second result is that when

the old generation dominates the social welfare function or when seigniorage

does not appear in the individual utility function (i.e., when a = 0 or u = 0)

then time consistent policy may also yield a nonmonetary economy or it may yield

the optimal closed loop policy.

5,]. Dominance of Seigniorage Effects or Young Generation Dominant

     For the case in which a = 1 or w =      this result is straightforward.

is maximized when g =    and a = 0. Given
                                                   , the       higher the monetary

growth rate the more revenue from seigniorage while exchange market intervet.tion

reduces expected seigniorage revenue.

     When the policy parameters assume these values the rate of return on

domestic currency is ....minus Infinity. Wealthholderg, anticipating in the previous

 period that these policies will be pursued,will set                                                   1. Hence,
                                                                                            At —
 in a rational expectations equilibrium, no seigniorage is collected. The

 economy degenerates to a nonmonetary economy with expected utility per

 generation uN            given   by expression (4.7).

 5.2 Absence of Seigniorage Effect or Old Generation Dominant

        Somewhat         more surprisingly, this same result can emerge when a = 1 or
               0                                                         •

also   constitutes             an optimal closed loop policy when seigniorage effects ar3

absent (c              0). To see this observe that the derivative of expected average

utility, with respect to a, evaluated at the point gM =                            o, a          —
                                                                                                     —a2/a,
                                                 22

                                                                                           (5.8)


Since at this point A =           0,          0. Hence the first—order condition for a time

consistent policy also corresponds to the first—order condition for an optimal

policy when w =        0.     Since the second—order conditions for a maximum are satisfied,

this    time consistent        equilibrium corresponds to the equilibrium that emerges

vhen w       0 and     the   optimal closed loop policy is pursued.

        An intuitive explanation for the optimality of this equilibrium is that the

larger the share of domestic currency in portfolios, the closer are the expected

domestic interest rate facing consumers and the expected growth rate. A lower value of

A thus brings the economy closer to the Golden Rule, thereby raising welfare.

The    optimal   value of a should therefore be chosen to minimize A. In fact,

risk associated with domestic currency each period leads them to stabilize the

exchange rate in an optimal way.

emerge if a and w assume intermediate values.

sustained by time consistent policies. Second, the level of monetary growth

    6. The Role of Reputation in Enforcing a Monetary Economy


             A conclusion of the previous section is that when earning seigniorage

    is the predominant concern of the monetary authority, or that when the

    utility of the young generation dominates the social welfare function,

    then a time consistent policy cannot sustain a monetary equilibrium. It

    was assumed that the only objective of the monetary authority is
                                                                     to maximize
    a   weighted average of the expected utilities of generations currently present.

          An alternative objective is to maximize a weighted average of the expected

    utilities of current and all future generations. A reason for the monetary

    authority to take into account the welfare of future generations is that their

welfare constitutes a public good to current generations, i.e., the utility of

future generations as a group affects the welfare of the current generations,

but no atomistic member of •a current generation has an incentive to provide

a bequest to any member of the subsequent generation. In'this context the

monetary authority's incentive to maintain the reputation of its currency to

allow future generations to earn seigniorage can lead to the time consistency

of a monetary economy.

          Let the expected utility from seigniorage of a generation born at time t

be given by

•

                                -       - a(l - a)2    (a2 + a)J,}                (6.1)




An      upper     bound U is placed on the welfare that can be generated from seigniorage

to insure boundedness of the overall objective function.

         Let the objective function of the monetary authorityat time t be

Denote     this policy as the optimal one—period policy.

       At some initial period to the monetary authority announces the policy

response henceforth, denoted by the parainers                     ä, t >   t.   If the monetary

authority deviates from the policy it announces in some period t,                    individuals
will anticipate that for Vt>t, gM =                 g,    a —   0, i.e., that the optimal one

period policy will be pursued. Let U be sufficiently high to imply

      U/W >     ii ÷ Ii +                                                                     (6.4)
which, from     expression (4.3), insures that when individuals anticipate the optimal

one—period policy in period t           they will select A —             l i.e., hold no domestic

currency.

      If   the authority deviates from its announced policy in period t,                assuming

that A —         <   l,it can attain a level of its objective functionU in that period
end   zero subsequcntly, since henceforth A = 1.                 The economy degenerates to a

nonmonetary economy. Thus the value of deviating from the announcement in any

period   t is simply U.
      By sticking with its announced policy in period t,                 assuming   that this policy

was anticipated in period t—l             and   that the announced policy will be adhered to

    7. Conclusion
         This paper has analysed exchange rate management in avery simple

    overlapping generations model. The purpose has been to evaluate monetary

    policy in an open economy on the basis of its implications for the welfare

    of individuals in the economy. While this paper has used               a micro—

    economic framework for analysing monetary policy, it has done so at the

    expense of omitting a number of important features of open economies that

    have received attention elsewhere. For example, in this model government

    debt provides th2 oaiy store of value. There is no productive capital and

    no distinction Letween assets that are held as stores of value and for

    transactions purposes. The implications of policy for output and employment

    are not considered. The lack of a consensus about the microeconomic causes

    of these phenomena makes      their   incorporation into an analysis of this sort

                                                           -
    difficult.

         The analys:.s in this paper identifies two objectives of monetary policy:

    to provide a desirable store of value, i.e., one with a high and stable rate

    of return, and to collect seigniorage. Despite the difference in approach

    between   this and other studies some similar results emerge.7 In particular.
    a policy of pure floating is likely to be more desirable when the foreign price
•   level is highly variable relative to domestic output        and converssly. In
    addition,    the benefits of having a national currency at all    diminish when the
    foreign   inflation rate is   low   and stable.

        While having a national currency may be desirable from a national welfare

perspective, tine consistent policy on the part of the monetary authority may

be unable to sustain a currency. This result is most likely to emerge when the

primary concern of the monetary authority is the extraction of seigniorage (as

when its      major   constituency is the young       generation) and when It is unable to
                                       28


 develop a reputation (as when the monetary authority is not perceived as a

continuous, infinitely—lived organization). The fact that seigniorage pro-

vides a major source of revenue in some countries suggests why these are also

countries that must institute exchange controls: the police power of the state

is used to maintain the viability of domestic currency faced with competition

from foreign currencies. When seigniorage provides the least distortionary

source of government revenue at the margin, such policies may be optimal.

     This paper has considered government liabilities that take the form of

currency. Introducing a coupon on this liability would not affect the analysis.

Hence the model applies to government borrowing generally rather than simply to

monetary issue.     Introducing a distinction between   monetary and non—monetary
debt would require introducing a transactions motive for holding money. This

aspect of the microfoundatjons of exchange rate management has been explored

by Stockinan   (1980) and Helpman (1981). An integration of 'the portfolio con-
siderations examined   here and the transactions motives treated in this other

literature constitutes an important topic for future research.

1. See Kydland (1977) for a discussion of the distinction between
    closed loop and feedback policies. See Calvo (1978) for
    a discussion of optimal and time consistent monetary policies
    in a non—stochastic closed economy context.

2. Exchange rate policy has also been examined in an overlapping
    generations context by Lapan and Enders (1979, 1980), Aizenman
    (1981) and Hsieh (1982). These papers assume that private
    individuals are unable to hold foreign assets. Exchange
    rate intervention therefore creates a scope for capital mobility
    that otherwise would be absent. A comparison between exchange
    rate regimes therefore, implicitly, involves a comparison
    of different degrees of capital mobility. In contrast this
    paper assumes that private individuals can hold foreign assets.
    Hence the degree of capital mobility is fixed across regimes.
    Heipman and Razin (1979) provide a discussion of this point.

3. Lapan and Endérs (1983) and Nickelsburg (1981) show, in general how
    actual and potential capital controls can lead to a unique
    exchange rate.

4. This paper considers monetary policy ma single small open
    economy in which collection of seiiorage isa pOlicy goal.
    Buiter and Eaton (1983) have analysed the interaction of
     the monetary policies of' several countries in a deterministic
     overlapping generations context, also focussing on the sei1iorage
     issue.

5. An equivalent assumption for the purposes of this analysis
    is that other revenue sources are inelastically supplied
    in some amount T and that the utility function (2.1) is of
    the form:

             log C +   8 log        + w   ( + Gt)
     Alternatively, the utility function could incorporate deadweight
     losses from other sources of tax revenue as well as the benefits
     from government spending.

6. The optimal value of the intervention parameter a, when seigniorage
    considerations are absent, is derived in Section 5 below.

7.   In principle, seigniorage considerations could be introduced
     into a much wider class of macroeconomic models to derive
     optiinai. policy rules. A number of' conclusions derived in
     the simple overlapping generations model used here are likely
     to emerge in more general models.
