                                          ABSTRACT

In this paper we investigate the sources of the important shifts in the volatility of U.S.

macroeconomic variables in the postwar period. To this end, we propose the estimation of DSGE

models allowing for time variation in the volatility of the structural innovations. We apply our

estimation strategy to a large-scale model of the business cycle and find that investment specific

technology shocks account for most of the sharp decline in volatility of the last two decades.

   THE TIME VARYING VOLATILITY OF MACROECONOMIC
                   FLUCTUATIONS

         Abstract. In this paper we investigate the sources of the important shifts in
         the volatility of U.S. macroeconomic variables in the postwar period. To this
         end, we propose the estimation of DSGE models allowing for time variation in
         the volatility of the structural innovations. We apply our estimation strategy
         to a large-scale model of the business cycle and …nd that investment speci…c
         technology shocks account for most of the sharp decline in volatility of the last
         two decades.




                                      1. Introduction

   It has been well documented that the volatility of output, in‡ation, interest
rates and many other macroeconomic variables of the U.S. economy has exhibited
a very high degree of time variation over the last …fty years (see, for instance,
Sims and Zha (2004) or Stock and Watson (2003a)). Perhaps, the most notorious
episode of substantial volatility shift in recent U.S. economic history is the “Great
Moderation,”1 which corresponds to the sharp decline in the standard deviation of
output as well as other macroeconomic and …nancial variables since the mid 1980s.
While signi…cant e¤orts have been devoted to determine the timing of the Great
Moderation (see, among others, Kim and Nelson (1999), McConnell and Perez-
Quiros (2000), Stock and Watson (2002), Chauvet and Potter (2001), Herrera and
Pesavento (2005)), there have been surprisingly few studies attempting to identify
the structural disturbances responsible for these volatility changes.

      The name Great Moderation is due to Stock and Watson (2002), although the phenomenon
was …rst noted by Kim and Nelson (1999) and McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000).

    In this paper we …ll this gap, by estimating a DSGE model in which the volatility
of the structural innovations is allowed to change over time. First, we describe an
algorithm that allows for simultaneous inference on both the model’s parameters
and the stochastic volatilities. Then, we apply our modeling and estimation strat-
egy to a large-scale business cycle model of the U.S. economy, along the lines of
Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) and Smets and Wouters (2003). The
model exhibits a number of real and nominal frictions, and various shocks with a
precise microeconomic interpretation. The novelty of our set-up is that all of these
shocks have variances that can ‡uctuate over time.
    We believe that this is an interesting innovation because it enables us to identify
the sources of the changes in the volatility of the main macro variables during the
postwar period. Thereafter, we are able to shed light on the nature of the underlying
disturbances responsible for the Great Moderation and other shifts in the volatility
of the U.S. business cycle.
    The main conclusions we reach in this study are as follows. First, the exoge-
nous structural disturbances hitting the U.S. economy display substantial stochastic
volatility. Nonetheless, the degree of time variation in variances di¤ers considerably
across shocks, being more pronounced for technology disturbances and, particularly,
monetary policy shocks. Consequently, while stochastic volatility is present in all
of the model’s observed endogenous variables, di¤erent series exhibit contrasting
patterns of ‡uctuations in their variances.
    Second, the decline in the volatility of output, investment, hours and consump-
tion in the early 1980s is largely driven by investment speci…c technology shocks.
These shocks have an equivalent interpretation of disturbances to the inverse of the
price of investment in terms of consumption goods. We corroborate our …nding that
investment speci…c technology shocks have become less volatile by documenting a
decline in the standard deviation of the relative price of investment. Moreover,
motivated by Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2005), we suggest an interpretation of
these disturbances as proxying for investment …nancial frictions. In line with this
interpretation, we rely on evidence outside our DSGE model to show that …nancial
frictions did indeed decline at the beginning of the 1980s, particularly in mortgage
…nancing.


    From the methodological standpoint, this paper is related to the statistics litera-
ture on stochastic volatility models (for an overview, see Kim, Shephard, and Chib
        THE TIM E VARYING VOLATILITY OF M ACROECONOM IC FLUCTUATIONS                         3


(1998)) and, more generally, on partial non-Gaussian state-space models (Shephard
(1994)). Drawing from this literature, we develop an e¢ cient algorithm, based on
Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, for the numerical evalu-
ation of the posterior of the parameters of interest. Methodologically, the paper
closest to ours is Laforte (2005), although in his analysis the time varying vari-
ances are modeled as Markov switching as opposed to the smoother processes in
the analysis here.
  Regarding the application of these techniques, this paper is related to the large
literature using estimated micro-founded models to understand the main sources
of U.S. business cycle ‡uctuations (see, for instance, Rotemberg and Woodford
(1997), Ireland (2004), Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005), Smets and
Wouters (2003), Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde (2005)). However, as
mentioned, we depart from previous work in this area by allowing for time vari-
ation in the volatility of the structural disturbances. Our approach is also linked
to the fairly large literature dealing with the estimation of vector autoregressions
with heteroskedastic shocks (see, for example, Bernanke and Mihov (1998), Cogley
and Sargent (2003), Sims and Zha (2004), Primiceri (2005) or Canova, Gambetti,
and Pappa (2005)). In contrast to this strand of work, one advantage of our analy-
sis is that a fully-‡edged model provides an easy interpretation for the structural
disturbances hitting the economy.
  The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the class of models we
will deal with and outlines some methodological issues, with the details relegated
to an appendix. Section 3 and 4 illustrate our application to the model of the
U.S. business cycle and sketch the estimation technique. Section 5 and 6 discuss
the estimation results and address the causes of the Great Moderation. Section 7
concludes with some …nal remarks and priorities for future research.


                  2. Stochastic Volatility in DSGE Models

  The general class of models we will work with is summarized by the following
system of equations:

(2.1)                      Et [f (yt+1 ; yt ; yt   1; t;   )] = 0,

where yt is a k   1 vector of states and endogenous variables,       t   is an n   1 vector of
exogenous disturbances,     is a p   1 vector of structural parameters and Et denotes
the mathematical expectation operator, conditional on the information available at
4                  ALEJANDRO JUSTINIANO AND GIORGIO E. PRIM ICERI


time t. For example, (2.1) can be thought as a collection of constraints and …rst
order conditions derived from a micro-founded model of consumers and/or …rms
behavior. The novelty here is that the standard deviation of the elements of                                        t   is
allowed to change over time. In particular, we make the assumption that

                                    log      t               ^t =       t "t

                                            "t               N (0; In ),

where N indicates the normal distribution, In denotes an n                                           n identity matrix
and     t   is a diagonal matrix with the n                       1 vector         t    of time varying standard
deviations on the main diagonal. Following the stochastic volatility literature (see,
for instance, Kim, Shephard, and Chib (1998)), we assume that each element of                                           t

evolves (independently) according to the following stochastic processes:

(2.2)              log   i;t   =   (1            i
                                                     ) log    i   +      i
                                                                             log   i;t 1        +   i;t

                         i;t       N (0; s2i )                      i = 1; :::; n.

Observe that modeling the logarithm of                   t,   as opposed to                 t   itself, ensures that the
standard deviation of the shocks remains positive at every point in time.
    Our objective is to characterize the posterior distribution of the model structural
                                                                                                          T
parameters ( ) and the time varying volatility of the shocks (f t gt=1 ). Note that
the model described by (2.1) is in general nonlinear and its solution does not have
a closed-form expression. Therefore, an approximation of the solution is required.
Observe also that commonly used log-linearization methods would not serve our
purposes, as the time varying standard deviations would disappear under this ap-
proximation. Moreover, log-linear methods would be accurate in this set-up only if
the variability of the standard deviations were small. Higher order approximations
would instead preserve the interaction term                           t "t .   However, the additional non-
linear terms generated in this case would considerably complicate the estimation.2
For these reasons, we develop what we call a partially nonlinear approximation of
the model, which combines the appeal for our purposes of both log-linearization
and higher order approximations. In particular, we approximate the solution of the
model by the partially nonlinear function

(2.3)                      y^t = A^
                                  yt    1   + B^t = A^
                                                     yt                 1    +B        t "t ,

   2 There has been recent work estimating nonlinear DSGE models, as in Fernandez-Villaverde
and Rubio-Ramirez (2004) or An and Schorfheide (2005). However, these methods have been
applied only to small scale models.

where y^t denotes log deviations from the non-stochastic steady state of the variable
y. Appendix A proves that (2.3) represents a valid approximation of the model
solution.


                                           3. The Model

  We apply our method to a relatively large-scale model of the U.S. business cycle,
which has been shown to …t the data fairly well (Del Negro, Schorfheide, Smets,
and Wouters (2004)). The model is based on work by Christiano, Eichenbaum,
and Evans (2005) and Smets and Wouters (2003), to which the reader is referred
for additional details. Our brief illustration of the model follows closely Del Negro,
Schorfheide, Smets, and Wouters (2004).

3.1. Final goods producers. At every point in time t, perfectly competitive …rms
produce the …nal consumption good Yt , using the intermediate goods Yt (i), i 2 [0; 1]
and the production technology

                                                                    1
                                  Yt =             Yt (i) 1+            p;t   di               .
                                           0

 p;t   follows the exogenous stochastic process

                   log     p;t   = (1    p ) log            p   +       p     log   p;t 1      +   p;t "p;t ,


where "p;t is i:i:d:N (0; 1) and         p;t       evolves as in (2.2). Unless otherwise noticed,
this property of a time varying variance applies to all shocks in the model. Pro…t
maximization and zero pro…t condition for the …nal goods producers imply the
following relation between the price of the …nal good (Pt ) and the prices of the
intermediate goods (Pt (i), i 2 [0; 1])
                                             Z         1                             p;t
                                                                        1
                                    Pt =                   Pt (i)       p;t   di           ,
                                                   0

and the following demand function for the intermediate good i:
                                                                            1+ p;t
                                                       Pt (i)                 p;t
                                    Yt (i) =                                          Yt .
                                                        Pt


As a consequence,        p;t   will also correspond to the price mark-up over marginal costs
for the …rms producing intermediate goods.

3.2. Intermediate goods producers. A monopolistic …rm produces the inter-
mediate good i using the following production function:

                         Yt (i) = max A1t               Kt (i) Lt (i)1                           At F ; 0 ,

where, as usual, Kt (i) and Lt (i) denote respectively the capital and labor input
for the production of good i, F represents a …xed cost of production and At is an
exogenous stochastic process capturing the e¤ects of technology. In particular, we
                                                                                                               At
model At as a unit root process, with a growth rate (zt                                                 log   At 1 )   that follows
the exogenous process

                                zt = (1         z)              +   p zt 1       +       z;t "z;t .


As in Calvo (1983), a fraction              p   of …rms cannot re-optimize their prices and, as
we allow for indexation, set their prices following the rule

                                                                            p        1
                                      Pt (i) = Pt               1 (i) t 1
                                                                                         p
                                                                                             ,

where      t   is de…ned as    Pt 1   and       denotes the steady state value of

the wage and the rental cost of capital.

3.3. Households. Firms are owned by a continuum of households, indexed by
j 2 [0; 1]. As in Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000), while each household is a mo-
nopolistic supplier of specialized labor (Lt (j)), a number of ‘employment agencies’
combines households’specialized labor into labor services available to the interme-
diate …rms

Pro…t maximization and a zero pro…t condition for the perfectly competitive em-

S captures the presence of adjustment costs in investment, with S 0 = 0 and S 00 >
0. Lucca (2005) shows that this formulation of the adjustment cost function is
equivalent (up to a …rst order approximation of the model) to a generalization of
a time to build assumption. As in Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (1997) and
Fisher (2005),   t   is a random shock to the production technology of capital goods
and evolves following the exogenous process

                               log    t   =      log   t 1      +           ;t " ;t .


    Following Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000), in every period a fraction                         w   of
households cannot re-optimize their wages and, therefore, set their wages following

3.4. Monetary and Government Policies. Monetary policy sets short term
nominal interest rates following a Taylor type rule. In particular, the rule allows
for interest rate smoothing and interest rate responses to deviations of in‡ation
from the steady state and deviations of output from trend level:
                               "                    #1 R
              Rt      Rt 1 R       t       Yt =At Y

              R        R                    Y =A

where R is the steady state for the gross nominal interest rate and "R;t is a monetary
policy shock. We also consider an alternative speci…cation of the policy rule, in
which the monetary authority responds to output growth.
    Fiscal policy is assumed to be fully Ricardian and public spending is given by
                                                           1

                                                           gt
where gt is an exogenous disturbance following the stochastic process

                      log gt = (1          g ) log g   +   g    log gt        1   +     g;t "g;t .

3.6. Steady State and Model Solution. Since the technology process At is
assumed to have a unit root, consumption, investment, capital, real wages and
output evolve along a stochastic growth path. Once the model is rewritten in
terms of detrended variables, we can compute the non-stochastic steady state and
employ the partially nonlinear method illustrated in section 2 and appendix A, to
approximate the model around the steady state. This delivers a partial nonlinear
state space model of the kind described in Shephard (1994).
  We conclude the discussion of the model by specifying the vector of observables,
completing the state space representation of our model:
                                                                      Wt

where    log Xt denotes log Xt       log Xt     1.


                                          4. Inference

4.1. The Data. We estimate the model using seven series of U.S. quarterly data,
as in Levin, Onatski, Williams, and Williams (2005) and Del Negro, Schorfheide,
Smets, and Wouters (2004). These series correspond to the vector of observable
variables of our model, reported in section 3.6. The sample for our dataset spans
from 1954QIII up to 2004QIV. All data are extracted from Haver Analytics data-
base (series mnemonics in parenthesis). Following Del Negro, Schorfheide, Smets,
and Wouters (2004), we construct real GDP by diving the nominal series (GDP)
by population (LF and LH) and the GDP De‡ator (JGDP). Real series for con-
sumption and investment are obtained in the same manner, although consumption
corresponds only to personal consumption expenditures of non-durables (CN) and
services (CS), while investment is the sum of personal consumption expenditures of
durables (CD) and gross private domestic investment (I). Real wages corresponds
to nominal compensation per hour in the non-farm business sector (LXNFC) di-
vided by the GDP de‡ator. Our measure of labor is given by the log of hours of all
persons in the non-farm business sector (HNFBN) divided by population. In‡ation
is measured as the quarterly log di¤erence in the GDP de‡ator, while for nominal
interest rates we use the e¤ective Federal Funds rate. We do not demean or detrend
any series.

4.2. Bayesian Inference. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods
are used to characterize the posterior distribution of the model’s structural para-
                                                                       T
meters ( ), the time varying volatility of the shocks (f t gt=1 ) and the coe¢ cients of
10                ALEJANDRO JUSTINIANO AND GIORGIO E. PRIM ICERI


the volatility processes (    ;   ; s2 ). Bayesian methods deal e¢ ciently with the high
dimension of the parameter space and the nonlinearities of the model, by splitting
the original estimation problem into smaller and simpler blocks. In particular, the
MCMC algorithm for this paper is carried out in three steps. First, a Metropolis
step is used to draw from the posterior of the structural coe¢ cients . Drawing
                                               T
the sequence of time varying volatilities          (conditional on , ,      and s2 ) is in-
stead more involved and relies mostly on the method presented in Kim, Shephard,
and Chib (1998). It consists of transforming a nonlinear and non-Gaussian state
space form in a linear and approximately Gaussian one, which allows the use of
simulation smoothers such as Carter and Kohn (1994) or Durbin and Koopman
(2002). Simulating the conditional posterior of          ;   ; s2 is standard, since it is
the product of independent normal-inverse-Gamma distributions. The details are
left to appendix B.


4.3. Priors. As customary when taking DSGE models to the data, we …x a small
number of the model parameters to values that are very common in the existing
literature. In particular, we set the steady state share of capital income ( ) to
0:3, the quarterly depreciation rate of capital ( ) to 0:025 and the steady state
government spending to GDP ratio to 0:22, which corresponds to the average share
of government spending in total GDP (Gt =Yt ) in our sample. Moreover, in order
to reduce the number of free parameters, we set all the autoregressive coe¢ cients
of the log-volatilities,     ’s, to 1, which re‡ects the assumption that the volatilities
follow geometric random walk processes.
     The …rst three columns of table 1 report our priors for the remaining parameters
of the model. While most of these priors are relatively disperse and re‡ect previous
results in the literature, a few of them deserve some further discussion. For all
but one persistence parameters we use a Beta prior, with mean 0:5 and standard
deviation 0:15. The exception is the autoregressive coe¢ cient of the mark-up shock
due to a weak identi…cation problem between this parameter and the one capturing
the degree of price indexation. As a result, we imposed a tighter prior on            p   to
avoid convergence problems in our MCMC algorithm.
     The priors for the variances of the shocks are Inverse-Gamma distributions with
mean and standard deviation equal to 0:15, with the exception of the investment
speci…c technology shock. In fact, as we will see in the next section, this shock
turned out to be (somewhat to our surprise) very important. To be conservative,
        THE TIM E VARYING VOLATILITY OF M ACROECONOM IC FLUCTUATIONS                       11


we decided to impose a prior favouring slightly less variation than other shocks.
Notice, however, that this prior enters only in the speci…cation of the model without
stochastic volatility that we estimate only for comparison.
   The priors on the variance (s2 ) of the innovations to the log-volatility processes
deserve some comment as well, as these coe¢ cients are new in the DSGE liter-
ature. We chose an inverse-Gamma prior with mean equal to 0:012 for several
reasons. First, assuming that the log-volatilities behave as random walks, this pa-
rameterization implies an average variation of about 15 percent over our sample
of forty years. We regard this as a conservative estimate. Second, in the context
of time varying vector autoregressions, Primiceri (2005) has tested several prior
speci…cations and concluded that this value attains the highest marginal likelihood.
Nonetheless, we assessed the sensitivity of the estimates to alternative speci…cations
of the prior (especially for the variance of the innovation to the log-volatilities) and
found that these modi…cations had no important in‡uence on the results.

                                5. Estimation Results

5.1. Parameter estimates. The last three columns of table 1 summarize the pos-
terior distribution of the model coe¢ cients, reporting posterior medians, standard
deviations and 5th and 95th percentiles computed with the draws. All coe¢ cients
estimates are fairly tight and seem for the most part in line with those reported in
Del Negro, Schorfheide, Smets, and Wouters (2004) and Levin, Onatski, Williams,
and Williams (2005).
   One important exception is the wage stickiness parameter (           w ),   which is lower
than previous estimates reported in the literature dealing with inference in DSGE
models. In view of the welfare implications of wage rigidity (see, for instance,
Levin, Onatski, Williams, and Williams (2005)) these variations in estimates may
be important, although we do not explore these issues in the current paper. The
estimate of the Calvo stickiness parameters for prices ( p ) is approximately equal
to 32 , which is also a value slightly below those found in other papers.4 This number
seems still higher than estimates in micro studies (see, for instance, Bils and Klenow
(2004)), although the presence of indexation mechanisms (which assures that prices
are actually changed in every period) makes the results potentially consistent with
the micro evidence on the high frequency of price changes.

   4 See Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde (2005) for an example of a model generating
an even lower estimate of the price stickiness parameter.
12                    ALEJANDRO JUSTINIANO AND GIORGIO E. PRIM ICERI


     For comparison, table 1 also reports posterior medians, standard deviations, 5th
and 95th percentiles of a model estimated with time invariant volatilities. Notice
that most of the coe¢ cient estimates are similar to the time varying model, although
there are some important exceptions. Most notably, two of the coe¢ cients related
to the labor market block of our framework change importantly when stochastic
volatility is allowed for. Speci…cally, the Calvo wage stickiness parameter (                       w)

drops from 0:71 to 0:38 and the inverse Frisch elasticity of labor supply ( ) declines
as well from 3:8 to 2:5. The higher elasticity of labor supply and the more volatile
behavior of wages are compensated by a smoother pattern of the intra-temporal
preference shock ('t ), whose autocorrelation coe¢ cient is estimated much higher
in the stochastic volatility model. This suggests that not accounting for stochastic
volatility might introduce some identi…cation bias in the estimation.5
     Finally, table 4 shows that the estimates of the …xed coe¢ cients are quite robust
to the alternative speci…cation of the monetary policy rule, in which the monetary
authority responds to output growth.


5.2. Volatility estimates. Figure 1 presents the plots of the time varying stan-
dard deviations for the seven shocks of our model. Notice that the degree of stochas-
tic volatility varies substantially across disturbances. Three of the shocks seem to
have relatively constant standard deviations. This is the case for the price mark-up
shock (    p;t ),   and the two taste shocks (bt and 't ). The evidence is very di¤er-
ent for the volatility of the four remaining shocks, which exhibit a very important
amount of time variation. The exogenous disturbance showing the highest degree
of time varying volatility is the monetary policy shock ("M
                                                          t

                                                              , …gure 1a), for which
the di¤erence between the lowest and the highest levels of the standard deviation is
roughly 500 percent. Observe that the “Volcker episode”6 is perfectly captured in
our estimates, as well as the reduction in the volatility of monetary policy shocks
during the Greenspan period.

    5 It is worth pointing out that the posterior distribution of the time invariant model is bimodal.
The values reported in table 1 are relative to the global maximum. However, there exists a local
maximum for which the level of the log-posterior is only slightly lower (just by one point) and
the values of the coe¢ cients are much closer to the estimates of the time varying model. Notice
also that the time varying model does not exhibit the problem of two modes, suggesting that
accounting for stochastic volatility might help to solve some of the identi…cation problems, which
are common in this class of models (Canova and Sala (2005)).
    6 The “Volcker episode”refers to the high volatility of interest rates in the 1979-1983 period, due
to the monetary targeting regime initiated by chaiman Paul Volcker in response to the dramatic
rise in U.S. in‡ation in the 1970s.
       THE TIM E VARYING VOLATILITY OF M ACROECONOM IC FLUCTUATIONS                 13


  Monetary policy shocks are not the only ones exhibiting a clean pattern of time
varying volatility. The standard deviation of technology shocks (zt , …gure 1b)
seems to decrease by almost 50 percent in the second part of the sample. This is
potentially consistent with the observed reduction in the volatility of GDP in the
last two decades, an issue addressed in more detail in the next section. A similar
pattern is observed for the volatility of the investment speci…c technology shock
( t , …gure 1d) and the government spending shock (gt , …gure 1c). Note, however,
that between these two shocks the fall in volatility at the beginning of the 1980s
seems more dramatic in the case of the investment speci…c technology shock.
  One contribution of our analysis is the ability to quantify how the importance
of various shocks has changed over time in generating economic ‡uctuations. To
this end, we analyze the variance decomposition of each series, which will lead us to
address the causes of the Great Moderation in the next subsection. We perform the
variance decomposition exercise in the following way: for every draw of the para-
meters and the volatilities of the exogenous disturbances, we construct the implied
variances of the (endogenous) observable variables, using the state space represen-
tation of the model solution. Then, we re-compute the variances of the observable
variables, by sequentially setting to zero the volatility of all disturbances but one,
for all time periods. In this way we are able to investigate the contribution of each
shock to the variance of the observables. Notice that, since the variances are chang-
ing over time, our variance decomposition is a time varying “object” as well. Due
to space considerations, we do not present the graph of the variance decomposition
for all of the observables. Instead, we present a complete characterization of the
variance decomposition for GDP, while for the remaining series we only report the
time varying share of the variance explained by selected shocks.
  Figure 2 presents the time varying shares of the variance of GDP growth due to
each exogenous disturbance. Consistent with Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell
(2000) and Fisher (2005), the most important shock in explaining the variability
of GDP growth seems to be the investment speci…c technology shock (…gure 2d).
Indeed, at least in the …rst part of the sample, this disturbance explains roughly
40 percent of the variance of GDP growth. Note, however, that the importance of
this shock declines over time.
  On average, neutral technology and labor preference shocks each explain 20 per-
cent of the variance of GDP. This share seems to remain relatively stable over
time for the neutral technology shock (…gure 2b), while it increases in the last two
14                  ALEJANDRO JUSTINIANO AND GIORGIO E. PRIM ICERI


decades for the disturbances to labor preferences (…gure 2f). Other shocks are less
central for output. The limited importance of the monetary policy shock (…gure
2a) is striking and probably related to the observation that, in this class of mod-
els, ‡exible price output seems to track quite closely actual output (Walsh (2005)),
which represents a shortcoming of current sticky price models.
     For the remaining series, …gure 3 plots the time varying variance shares explained
by selected shocks. A major portion of the variance of consumption is explained by
the inter-temporal shock to the discount factor (…gure 3a). Although not crucial
for output, monetary policy and mark-up shocks are each quite important for the
volatility of interest rates (…gure 3b) and in‡ation (…gure 3c). Moreover, as one
would expect, the investment speci…c technology shock and the labor preference
shock explain most of the variability of investment (…gure 3d) and hours (…gure 3e)
respectively, while the neutral technology shock accounts for about 40 percent of
the variance of real wages (…gure 3f).7
     Figure 4 plots the model’s spectral variance decomposition for output, in devi-
ations from the model’s common stochastic trend, driven by neutral technology.
We consider periodicities between 8 and 32 quarters. Figure 4 corroborates the
evidence on the importance of the investment speci…c technology shock, suggesting
that this disturbance is crucial in explaining output ‡uctuations at the business
cycle frequencies (…gure 4d). Note, however, that the labor disutility shock plays
also a very important role in this case (…gure 4f).

                                6. The Great Moderation

6.1. The Great Moderation and the role of investment speci…c technology
shocks. We now apply our methodology and our results to analyze in greater
detail the Great Moderation episode that we have alluded to earlier. In two very
in‡uential papers, Kim and Nelson (1999) and McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000)
drew attention to the dramatic reduction in the volatility of U.S. GDP, which has
characterized the last two decades relative to the pre-1980s period.8 This change
seems to be more abrupt than gradual (Kim and Nelson (1999) and Stock and
Watson (2002)) and the break date is estimated to approximately correspond to
1984. In our sample, the standard deviation of GDP growth over the 1984-2004
period is almost one half of the standard deviation computed over the 1955-1983

     7 The complete set of variance decomposition graphs is available upon request.
     8 Stock and Watson (2003b) show a similar pattern for other G7 countries.

sample. As mentioned, the literature has labeled this phenomenon as the Great
Moderation.
  A number of hypothesis have been put forward to account for this decline in
volatility and exhaustive reviews can be found in Blanchard and Simon (2001) and
Stock and Watson (2002, 2003a). Explanations of this phenomenon can be broadly
bunched as corresponding to simply good luck, technological progress (particularly
in managing inventories) or improvements in the conduct of monetary policy under
the Volcker and Greenspan chaimanships. However, several authors have found
evidence contrary to the technological progress and improved monetary policy hy-
potheses (see, for instance, Stock and Watson (2002), Maccini and Pagan (2003) or
Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson (2004)).
  Therefore, the starting point of the analysis of the Great Moderation undertaken
in this paper is the very robust …nding of Stock and Watson (2002, 2003a), who
conclude that “this reduction in volatility is associated with an increase in the
precision of forecasts of output growth” (Stock and Watson (2002), p 42). Notice
that our framework is a natural candidate to understand the structural causes of
the reduction in forecast errors. In fact, given that our methodology allows for
time varying volatilities and is based on a fully-‡edged model, it provides an easy
interpretation for the structural disturbances hitting the economy.
  Figure 5a plots the volatility of GDP growth implied by our model. There are
at least two things to notice. First, although the evolution of the standard devia-
tion of GDP growth is very similar to the one obtained from univariate estimates,
we notice that the DSGE model somewhat overpredicts the level of the volatility.
This problem is common to the time invariant version of the model and is there-
fore indicative of di¢ culties in simultaneously matching the levels of persistence,
comovements and volatilities observed in the data, even with state of the art DSGE
models (Del Negro, Schorfheide, Smets, and Wouters (2004)). Second, nonetheless,
the model captures remarkably well the timing and the size of the Great Modera-
tion, despite the abrupt nature of this fall in volatility. Observe that the volatility
of GDP growth starts declining around 1981, which is slightly earlier than some
estimates provided by the literature using models with discrete structural breaks.
This is due to the speci…cation of our time varying volatility model, which tends to
smooth out abrupt changes (see, for example, Boivin (2001)).
  To assess the role played by each shock in accounting for the Great Moderation,
we rely on counterfactual simulations exercises. Our approach consists of using
16                 ALEJANDRO JUSTINIANO AND GIORGIO E. PRIM ICERI


our model to simulate the volatility of GDP growth under alternative paths for
the volatility of each structural disturbance. This counterfactual simulations can
be interpreted as the hypothetical pattern of the volatility of GDP growth in the
period 1981-2004, had the standard deviation of that particular structural shock
only remained unchanged with respect to the 1980 level.9
     Figure 6 presents the results of our counterfactual exercises. Our approach gives
a very strong conclusion about the causes of the Great Moderation. As evident
from …gure 6d, the main explanation for the Great Moderation seems to be the
sharp reduction in the volatility of investment speci…c technology shocks. That
is, had the volatility of investment speci…c technology shocks remained at its 1980
level, then the standard deviation of GDP growth would have been substantially
higher than the realized one in the 1981-2004 period.
     Finally, it is worth noting that changes in the volatility of the monetary policy
shock have had a rather modest e¤ect on the decline in the variance of output
(…gure 6a). This is the case, despite the fact that the model reproduces quite well
the time varying pattern of the standard deviation of interest rates observed in the
data (…gure 5b).


6.2. The relative price of investment. In our model, investment speci…c tech-
nology shocks can be equivalently interpreted as disturbances to the inverse price
of e¢ cient units of investment in terms of consumption goods.10 Although this
variable is not used in our estimation, data on the price of investment relative to
consumption has been used by other authors to proxy for investment speci…c tech-
nology shocks (see, for instance, Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell (1997, 2000)
and Fisher (2005)).
     In order to verify that the reduction in the volatility of investment speci…c tech-
nology shocks is not somewhat spurious and speci…c to our model, we rely on data
outside our DSGE model and analyze the volatility of this relative price. In partic-
ular, we construct the chain-weighted de‡ators for our components of consumption
(non-durables and services) and investment (durables and total private investment)
and estimate the standard deviation of its growth rate using a simple 10-year mov-
ing window. Figure 7 plots the estimate of the time varying standard deviation and


   9 More precisely, we …x the volatility of each shock to the average of the time varying standard
deviation for all four quarters in 1980. A longer window does not a¤ect our results.
   10 See Fisher (2005) for an explanation of this alternative interpretation.
        THE TIM E VARYING VOLATILITY OF M ACROECONOM IC FLUCTUATIONS                        17


makes clear that this volatility has sharply decreased in the second part of the post-
war sample. Moreover, the timing of the decline corresponds remarkably well with
the timing of the Great Moderation. We regard the fact that our model provides a
very similar insight (without using any data on the relative price of investment) as
a remarkable result.

6.3. Interpretation. What are the main implications of our results? The answer
to this question depends on the interpretation of disturbances in DSGE models.
Most of the existing literature regards these shocks as genuinely exogenous shifts
in tastes, technology and policies. An alternative interpretation, however, is that
these disturbances can proxy for features of the economy that we wish to abstract
from when writing down our model (Hall (1997) and Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan
(2005)). In particular, Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2005) have recently argued
that disturbances similar to our investment speci…c technology shock might proxy
for investment …nancial frictions. This link becomes evident in models that take
into consideration agency costs for the …nancing of investment, such as Carlstrom
and Fuerst (1997).11 If we subscribe this view, a natural explanation of the Great
Moderation would be based on a reduction in …nancial frictions.
   Interestingly, this purely “theoretical” hypothesis squares remarkably well with
the empirical and anecdotal evidence about the expanded access to credit and
borrowing for …rms and particularly households since the beginning of the 1980s.
The mortgage industry underwent substantial …nancial deregulation in this period,
following the passing of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary
Control Act (DIDMCA) in 1980 and the Garn-St Germain Act of 1982. An impor-
tant component of this transformation was the demise of Regulation Q which had
established a ceiling for banks deposit rates, limiting de facto the amount of bank
lending in periods of rising interest rates. Overall, these new laws ignited other
developments (such as mortgage securitization) that fostered greater integration
between mortgage and capital markets and consequently led to greater availability
of mortgage credit at prevailing market interest rates (see, for instance, Hender-
shott (1990), Dynan, Elmendorf, and Sichel (2005) and Campbell and Hercowitz
(2004)).
   Since our model is not rich enough to analyze this issue in greater detail, we
rely on alternative evidence to support our claim that a reduction in investment
  11 See Faia and Monacelli (2004) for an analysis of alternative speci…cations of agancy costs
models and their implications for dynamics in New-Keynesian DSGE models.
18                 ALEJANDRO JUSTINIANO AND GIORGIO E. PRIM ICERI


…nancial frictions–proxied by the decline in variability of our investment speci…c
technology shock–played a predominant role in the Great Moderation. This alter-
native evidence in support of our hypothesis is summarized in …gures 8 and 9.
     Figure 8 plots the time varying standard deviations of consumption, investment
and several of their components, obtained using an AR(4) model with stochastic
volatility. Notice that the most drastic reduction in volatility has characterized the
time series of investment and particularly residential investment, whose standard
deviation has decreased by more than 70 percent. The volatilities of the other
components exhibit smoother evolutions with the exception, perhaps, of durable
consumption. This is consistent with the sizable reduction in the variability of
production in the automobile industry (as detailed in Ramey and Vine (2005)), as
it reasonable to expect that the automobile industry would also be quite sensitive
to deepening of credit markets (Campbell and Hercowitz (2004)).
     Finally, observe that we present alternative series for real investment in equip-
ment and software, depending on whether Gordon (1990)-Cummins and Violante
(2002) or NIPA de‡ators are used to construct these series. This is done in order to
asses the robustness of our results to additional quality adjustments in the NIPA de-
‡ator for equipment and software, as noted by Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Krusell
(1997) and Fisher (2005) in their analysis of investment speci…c technology shocks.
As it is clear from …gures 8f and 8h, these data considerations are inconsequential
for our analysis of volatility.
     Further compelling evidence on the role of …nancial frictions–particularly for
residential investment–in explaining the Great Moderation is presented in …gure 9
(…rst column) which plots the spreads between the 30-year …xed mortgage interest
rate and the AAA Moody bonds, 10-year and 30-year Treasury constant maturity
rates.12 The large and volatile spreads of the early 1980s correspond to the end of a
system dominated by heavily regulated thrift institutions, in which credit availabil-
ity was subject to large swings due to ‡uctuations in deposits (Bradley, Gabriel,
and Wohar (1995)). The transition to smaller spreads is commonly associated with
the beginning of a more e¢ cient and integrated mortgage market (McCarty and
Peach (2002), Dynan, Elmendorf, and Sichel (2005) or Schnure (2005)).
     With this observation in mind, next to each series, we also plot an estimate of the
time varying standard deviation for each spread, obtained using an AR(4) model

  12 Our plots of the spreads start in 1978 because data about the 30-year Treasury constant
maturity rate are not available before that date.
       THE TIM E VARYING VOLATILITY OF M ACROECONOM IC FLUCTUATIONS                 19


with stochastic volatility. Three points deserve particular attention: …rst, all three
volatilities decline quite sharply at the beginning of the 1980s; second, the timing
of the decline coincides perfectly with the timing of the Great Moderation and,
particularly, of the important reduction in the volatility of residential investment
already documented (…gure 9d). Finally, the timing and the sharpness of the decline
in volatility of the mortgage over 30-year Treasury Bills spread (…gure 9f) suggests
that the turmoil in the mortgage market before the early 1980s was probably due
to other factors, beyond the chaos caused by the behavior of in‡ation and in‡ation
expectations during this period.
  To summarize, the sharp decline in the volatility of investment speci…c technology
shocks, as well as the relative price of investment to consumption, matches very
well with the empirical evidence on the expanded access to credit and borrowing
for …rms and especially households since the beginning of the 1980s. Indeed, the
Great Moderation is most evident for residential investment, and the timing of this
reduction in volatility accords well with developments in the mortgage market that
are widely believed to have fostered a decline in …nancial frictions. We therefore
view the development of more elaborate DSGE models, relative to ours, that could
shed light on these issues as a worthy endeavor.


6.4. Robustness issues. In this subsection we perform robustness checks on our
important …nding that the Great Moderation appears to have been driven by the
decline in volatility of investment speci…c technology shocks.
  Our focus is on two of the main explanations that have been provided for the
Great Moderation: changes in the conduct of monetary policy (Bernanke (2004))
and technological improvement in inventory management (McConnell and Perez-
Quiros (2000) and Kahn, McConnell, and Perez-Quiros (2002)). To deal with the
…rst issue, we perform a simple experiment which suggests that in the context
of this model, the lower variability of U.S. output is di¢ cult to explain when only
considering changes in the systematic part of monetary policy. Regarding inventory
management, our second exercise is to re-estimate our model using series that
abstract from the role of inventories in order to show that the Great Moderation is
still evident in this case, albeit in a somewhat less drastic manner. The results of
these two exercises (although they echo …ndings elsewhere using other methods and
models) cannot be taken as conclusive evidence against these two hypotheses, which
may have played some role in the Great Moderation. Nonetheless, they show that
20                 ALEJANDRO JUSTINIANO AND GIORGIO E. PRIM ICERI


when these variants are considered, the decline in the variability of GDP growth is
once again largely attributed to a reduction in the volatility of investment speci…c
technology shocks.


6.4.1. Changes in monetary policy. Our strategy to address the importance of the
changes in the systematic part of monetary policy consists of estimating our model
(without stochastic volatility) on two separate subsamples, 1953-1979:II and 1983-
2004:III. Notice that, following Hanson (2003), we exclude the 1979:III-1982:IV
period from the estimation since monetary policy during this period may not be
correctly characterized by a Taylor rule.13 Table 2 presents posterior modes and
standard deviations of the coe¢ cients estimated over these two periods. Observe
that there are some di¤erences in the coe¢ cient estimates across subsamples. Con-
sistent with the evidence presented earlier, this is particularly the case for the
standard deviations of the shocks. In addition, table 3 highlights that the uncon-
ditional standard deviation of output growth in the second subsample relative to
the …rst is 0:52. In the context of our model this discrepancy can potentially be
explained by three di¤erent sets of parameters: the monetary policy coe¢ cients,
the remaining structural parameters and the standard deviations of the shocks.
     With regard to the policy coe¢ cients, notice that, as expected, monetary policy
in the second subsample seems to have been more responsive to in‡ation (Clarida,
Gali, and Gertler (2000)). To assess the role of these change in the systematic part of
policy on the volatility of output, table 3 presents the relative standard deviation
of GDP growth when the coe¢ cients of the Taylor rule estimated in the second
subsample replace the corresponding coe¢ cients in the …rst subsample, leaving all
other coe¢ cients unchanged. In order to gauge the possible role of changes in
the remaining structural parameters, table 3 also presents the relative volatility
of GDP growth when a similar counterfactual exercise is performed by replacing
all coe¢ cients (other than the volatilities) from the second sub-sample. Table 3
makes clear that neither changes in the systematic part of monetary policy nor the
remaining structural coe¢ cients of the model seem to account for the decline in
the volatility of output. This result is in line with Sims and Zha (2004), Hanson
(2003), Leduc and Sill (2003), Primiceri (2005), Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson (2004).


   13 To further check the robustness of this experiment, we have also estimated the model
from 1979:III to 2004:III allowing for stochastic volatility in order to capture the large degree of
variability of interest rates during this period. Our results are una¤ected by this modi…cation.
       THE TIM E VARYING VOLATILITY OF M ACROECONOM IC FLUCTUATIONS                 21


  The split-sample estimates of table 2 are obtained using the priors reported in
table 1 for both subsamples. Notice that the prior for the coe¢ cient of the policy
response to in‡ation (    ) is a normal distribution with mean equal to 1:7 and
standard deviation equal to 0:3. This prior speci…cation puts very low probability
on values of     smaller than one, which, according to Clarida, Gali, and Gertler
(2000), are plausible parameter values for the pre-1980 period. Interest in this
case arises from noting that, when       < 1, the model admits multiple (sunspot)
equilibria, which can generate arbitrarily high volatility in the macroeconomy. At
least in principle, this could potentially explain the larger volatility of GDP growth
in the pre-Volcker period.
  To assess whether our results are driven by not allowing for indeterminacy, we re-
estimate the model in the pre-Volcker period using a di¤erent prior for the reaction
coe¢ cient to in‡ation. In particular, the new prior density for         has a larger
standard deviation (equal to 0:7) and, hence, puts considerably more weight on the
indeterminacy region. Interestingly, our new estimate of the reaction coe¢ cient
to in‡ation remains almost unchanged across priors (…rst two columns of table 4).
In particular, the 90 percent posterior interval is well above one and none of the
generated draws from the posterior falls close to the indeterminacy region.
  We do not view the absence of indeterminacy in our estimates as surprising. In
fact, sunspot equilibria due to an accommodating central bank tend to generate a
positive comovement between in‡ation and real activity in sticky prices models, as
forcefully argued by Christiano and Gust (1999). This is clearly at odds with the
U.S. experience in the 1970s. As a result, we conclude that in our model, an ex-
planation of the Great Moderation based on indeterminacy seems at odds with the
data, while we recognize that there are certainly other models in which an expla-
nation along these lines could be more promising. Similarly, we acknowledge that
the role of real time data combined with mismeasurement of the variables entering
the Taylor rule may, in smaller models, provide a stronger case for monetary policy
as responsible, at least in part, for greater stability after 1984 (see Orphanides and
Williams (2005)). However, the validity of this explanation in the context of large
scale models like ours has not yet been addressed and remains a topic for future
research.
22                ALEJANDRO JUSTINIANO AND GIORGIO E. PRIM ICERI


6.4.2. Changes in inventory management. Regarding the role of inventories in ex-
plaining the Great Moderation, we proceed with the rather simple exercise of con-
structing series of investment and, therefore, output that abstract from inventories.
This approach corresponds with the measurement of investment series in some
business cycle quantitative studies (for example, Fisher (2005)). Furthermore the
rationale for subtracting inventories from output, as opposed to working with the
series for inventories themselves, arises from the ambiguity of whether invento-
ries bu¤er or rather amplify economic ‡uctuations.14 That is, it remains unclear
whether an increase in the volatility of inventories would map into a rise or a decline
of the volatility of output. Our aim here is simply to check whether when removing
inventories the Great Moderation is still evident and, furthermore, whether our
conclusions regarding the importance of investment speci…c technology shocks in
accounting for this episode still hold.
     Using this new series for investment and output15 we re-estimate the model with
stochastic volatility over the full sample. Figure 8 presents counterfactual exercises
constructed similarly to those reported in section 6.1, using the new coe¢ cient and
volatility estimates. In this case, the moderation in the variability of output growth
is still evident although the decline is somewhat more prolonged as opposed to
abrupt. Moreover, monetary policy shocks seem to be slightly more important than
in the baseline case. Notice, however, that the role of investment speci…c technology
shocks in accounting for the lower volatility of output growth remains for the most
part unaltered. This exercise suggests that, while inventories may be important for
understanding the sharp drop in the variability of output growth, it would seem
that additional explanations are needed to address the Great Moderation (see also
Stock and Watson (2002), Maccini and Pagan (2003), Herrera and Pesavento (2005)
or Ramey and Vine (2005) for similar conclusions). In this respect, and consistently
once again with our previous …ndings, our results point to the predominant role of
investment speci…c technology shocks in explaining the reduced volatility of the
U.S. economy after 1984.



    14 Kahn and McConnell (2002), for instance, argue that while in theory inventories should
bu¤er production from ‡uctuations in sales, in practice the opposite occurs as inventories and
sales comove in the same direction.
    15 We use nominal …xed investment and accordingly subtract inventories from nominal GDP.
Consistent with our previous data, per-capita series are obtained by dividing through with popu-
lation and the GDP de‡ator.

                             7. Concluding Remarks

  In this paper we have estimated a large scale DSGE model of the U.S. business
cycle allowing for the volatility of the structural innovations to change over time.
Our results indicate that the volatility of several shocks has changed dramatically
in the postwar period. However, the sharp reduction in the standard deviation of
GDP growth that has characterized the last twenty years can be explained mostly
due to the decline in the variability of a single disturbance: the investment speci…c
technology shock. This crucial disturbance has the equivalent interpretation of a
shock to the inverse price of e¢ cient units of investment in terms of consumption
goods and, indeed, we also document that this series has exhibited a substantial
moderation in its variability, in accordance with the predictions of our model.
  Our results provide guidance for future research on the volatility of the U.S.
business cycle, suggesting that a fruitful avenue would be to model the variability
of disturbances a¤ecting the relative price of investment goods. In particular, it
would be useful to extend the DSGE model of this paper in order to provide a
more structural interpretation for the sharp reduction observed in the volatility of
these shocks. Although beyond the scope of this paper, we note that explanations
based on increased access to credit markets (Campbell and Hercowitz (2004)) and a
decline in investment …nancial frictions (like the ones modeled in Bernanke, Gertler,
and Gilchrist (1999) or Iacoviello (2005)) are potentially consistent with the decline
in the volatility of the relative price of investment.
  We conclude by pointing out that the applicability of the modeling framework of
this paper goes well beyond the Great Moderation. Indeed, macro-…nance applica-
tions seem particularly suitable for this methodology. In fact, contrary to standard
models with homoskedastic innovations, DSGE models with stochastic volatility as
introduced in this paper generate time varying risk premia even with second order
approximations of the model solution. More generally, DSGE models with stochas-
tic volatility are appropriate for analyzing the e¤ects of shocks to uncertainty and
risk, not only for asset prices, but also for the level of real activity.



              Appendix A. Partially nonlinear approximation

  This appendix proofs the validity of the partially nonlinear approximation of
the model solution. To simplify the notation, here we work with linearizations (as
opposed to log-linearizations). Consider the general class of models described by
24                ALEJANDRO JUSTINIANO AND GIORGIO E. PRIM ICERI


the following system of rational expectations equations:

(A.1)                    Et [ (xt+1 ; xt ; "t ;              t )]       = 0,

                                                             "t                N (0; I),

where each element of    t   evolves as in (2.2). Relative to (2.1), (A.1) abstracts from
the presence of lagged values of x for simplicity. This is without loss of generality,
since the vector of state variables can always be extended to include lags. Let’s
de…ne

(A.2)                                          t         t      "t ,

with ‘ ’denoting the element-by-element product between two vectors. (A.2) can
be used to reparameterize (A.1) as follows:

(A.3)                             Et [ (xt+1 ; xt ;            t;       t )]   = 0.

Assume that (A.3) admits a unique solution in the neighborhood of the non-
stochastic steady state (described by                    (x; x; 0; 0) = 0). This solution has the
form

(A.4)                                       xt = g ( t ;            t) .


To characterize the the …rst order approximation of (A.4), plug (A.4) into (A.3),
obtaining
                    Et        g     t+1 ;     t+1      ; g ( t;          t) ; t;        t   = 0,

and then take a …rst order Taylor expansion. Since                               t   and "t never enter (A.1) sep-
arately (but always as a product), the partial derivative of the function                                 (; ; ; )
with respect to its fourth argument is equal to zero, implying a …rst order approx-
imation of the solution of the form

(A.5)                               xt = g1        t   + o(jj t ;          t jj)


where the matrix g1 , is a function of the partial derivatives of the function                           ( ; ; ; ).
Equation (A.5) makes evident that the …rst order approximation of the model
solution as a function of    t    does not include                  t   explicitly.


     Observe that the more conventional linear approximation of the model solution
derived directly from (A.1) would have the form

(A.6)                             xt = g1           "t + o(jj"t ;              t jj).

Notice that the norms of both vectors, "t and      t,   are required to approach zero
for (A.6) to be an accurate approximation of the model solution. These conditions
are su¢ cient but not necessary for the accuracy of the approximation in (A.5),
therefore validating our partially nonlinear approximation.




                    Appendix B. The estimation algorithm

B.1. The Standard Case: Homoskedastic Disturbances. For the model with-
out stochastic volatility, the estimation algorithm is simply a random walk Metrop-
olis MCMC procedure, as suggested originally by Schorfheide (2000). To initialize
the chains we compute the posterior ordinate for 5; 000 draws from the priors, se-
lect the ten points attaining the highest posterior density and use a maximization
algorithm (Chris Sims’csminwel) to …nd the posterior mode. Having observed that
all chains lead to the same mode, the inverse Hessian at the peak is used as the vari-
ance of a proposal density for generating draws with the random walk metropolis.
We initialize multiple chains by scaling the inverse Hessian upwards and drawing
randomly from a normal centered at the mode. The variance-covariance matrix of
the proposal density is adjusted to attain an acceptance rate close to 0:25, as it
is usually suggested. Trace plots, kernel estimates as well as the variants of the
potential scale-reduction factors proposed by Brooks and Gelman (1998) are used
to gauge the convergence of the algorithm.



B.2. Stochastic Volatility. When the structural shocks exhibit stochastic volatil-
ity, this algorithm must be modi…ed to account for inference on the unobserved sto-
chastic volatilities. A Metropolis within Gibbs MCMC algorithm allows us to itera-
tively draw from the posterior densities of the DSGE model’s parameters, stochastic
volatilities and associated innovation variances. As discussed below, generating a
draw for the stochastic volatilities entails using a normal mixture approximation
and sampling a set of latent indicators for the components of this mixture.
  To illustrate the steps involved in sampling from the di¤erent blocks, let the
vector     collect all parameters of the DSGE model (other than the standard devi-
ations of the structural disturbances of the time invariant model) and notice that
the solution of the linearized DSGE model leads to a state-space representation of
the form

(B.1)                                    xt    = Dyt

(B.2)                                    yt    = A( )yt               1   + B( )         t


where xt and yt represent the observable variables and the endogenous / state
variables respectively. (B.2) is the same equation as in (2.3), but we have dropped
the “hats” to simplify the notation. As discussed in section A the novelty of our
framework is that the vector of structural innovations                                   t   (dimension n 1) is allowed
to have a time varying variance covariance matrix. Indexing each structural shock
by i, the stochastic volatilities for each shocks are modelled as

(B.3)                          i;t   =        i;t "i;t

                                                                                   log       i;t 1   +     i;t

Let the vector ht , with entry i given by hi;t = log                                 i;t ,    collect the log volatilities
for all shocks at time t and stack the whole sample of stochastic volatilities into
the matrix H T = [h1 ; h2 ; :::; ht ; :::; hT ]0 . Finally, we denote the sample of structural
             T                                   0
shocks as          =[    1; 2 ; :::; t ; :::; T ] .

     Suppose that the MCMC algorithm has completed iteration g (> 0); producing
            (g)
samples           ; H T;(g) and V (g) :of the parameters of interest (individual elements of
a vector are indexed by i while (g) indicates the current state of the chain). In
iteration g + 1, the following …ve steps are used to generate a set of new draws.

                                                                     T;(g+1)
B.2.1. Step 1: Draw the structural shocks                                      . In order to generate a new sam-
ple of the stochastic volatilities we must …rst obtain a new draw of the structural
shocks. This can be done easily using the e¢ cient simulation smoother for dis-
turbances developed by Durbin and Koopman (2002). The simulation smoother is
applied to the state space representation given by (B.1) and (B.2).

B.2.2. Step 3: Draw the stochastic volatilities H T;(g+1) . With a draw of                                                 T

in hand the system of nonlinear measurement equations in (B.3) for each structural
shock, can be easily converted in a linear one, by squaring and taking logarithms
                                                                                                     2

an o¤set constant is used to make the estimation procedure more robust. Dropping

the iteration indicators momentarily for ease of notation, this leads to the following
approximating state space form:


(B.6)                                          ~i;t   =   2hi;t + ei;t

(B.7)                                       hi;t      = hi;t    1   +     i;t .



                                 2
where ~i;t = log[(          i;t )    + c]; c is the o¤set constant (set to 0:001); ei;t = log("2i;t ).
Observe that the e’s and the ’s are not correlated. The resulting system has a
linear, but non-Gaussian state space form, because the innovations in the mea-
                                                                    2
surement equations are distributed as a log                             (1). In order to further transform
                                                                                                         2
the system in a Gaussian one, a mixture of normals approximation of the log
distribution is used, as described in Kim, Shephard, and Chib (1998). Under the
assumption of orthogonality across the "’s (recall the variance covariance matrix of
the "’s is the identity matrix) this implies that the variance covariance matrix of
the v’s is also diagonal, allowing to use the same (independent) mixture of normals
approximation for any for each innovation:



                                         K
                                         X

                                         k=1



where si;t is the indicator variable selecting which member of the mixture of nor-




mals has to be used at time t for the innovation i, qk = Pr(si;t = k) and fN ( )
denotes the pdf of a normal distribution. Kim, Shephard, and Chib (1998) select

     Conditional on S T;(g) , the system has an approximate linear and Gaussian
state space form. Therefore a new draw for the complete history of the volatil-
ity H T;(g+1) can be obtained recursively with the standard Gibbs sampling for state
space forms using, for instance, the forward-backward recursion of Carter and Kohn
(1994).

Calibrated coefficients: labor share (α) at 0.3, depreciation rate (δ) is 0.025, g at 1/0.77 which implies a SS government share of 0.22

Relative to the text, γ is expressed in percentage points, while π and r are expressed as net rates, in percentage points. Finally, the standard deviations of the
innovations are also scaled by 100 for the estimation. All these changes are reflected in the specification of the priors.
Prior distributions are identical to those reported in Table 1.

Notes:
Calibrated coefficients: labor share (α) at 0.3, depreciation rate (δ) is 0.025, g at 1/0.77 which implies a SS government share of 0.22
Relative to the text, γ is expressed in percentage points, while π and r are expressed as net rates, in percentage points. Finally, the standard deviations of the innovations are also scaled by
100 for the estimation. All these changes are reflected in the specification of the priors.
Except for the coefficients of the Taylor rule, all other priors are identical to those in Table 1/
1/ Prior for Φp is Normal(1.7,0.7) to provide greater prior mass to the region of indeterminacy. Prior for Φy is N(0.125,0.1) as in Table 1.
2/ Prior for Φp is Normal(1.7,0.3) as in Table 1. Prior for Φy is N(0.5,0.3) and in terms of output growth.
