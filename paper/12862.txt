This paper identifies factors that influence decisions about a country's financial safety net, using a
comprehensive dataset covering 180 countries during the 1960-2003 period. Our analysis focuses on
how private interest-group pressures, outside influences, and political-institutional factors affect deposit-insurance
adoption and design. Controlling for macroeconomic shocks, quality of bank regulations, and institutional
development, we find that both private and public interests, as well as outside influences to emulate
developed-country regulatory schemes, can explain the timing of adoption decisions and the rigor
of loss-control arrangements. Controlling for other factors, political systems that facilitate intersectoral
power sharing dispose a country toward design features that accommodate risk-shifting by banks.

Introduction

This paper portrays government decisions about the design of a country’s financial safety net as

an exercise in incomplete social contracting. The contract authorizes failed financial institutions

and their customers to transfer some of their losses to taxpayers in other sectors of the economy.

Social contracting is a political bargaining process in which different sectors attempt to extract

net value from government services. Although financial stability is a nonexclusive good, its

benefits need not be enjoyed equally by every sector. Successful contracting requires that the

terms appear mutually beneficial. Especially because the rights and duties generated in safety net

contracting are incomplete, sectoral concerns and contract terms may be expected to vary greatly

across countries. This paper tests and confirms the hypothesis that across countries salient

differences in safety net design can be explained to an important degree by differences in

economic and political circumstances.

       Our analysis seeks particularly to determine what factors influence two issues in safety

net design: (1) a country’s decision on whether or not to adopt a system of explicit deposit

insurance; and (2) for countries that adopt explicit deposit insurance, the type of design features

imbedded in their deposit insurance system. We focus on the extent of deposit insurance

coverage, but also include other design features that could control the banking sector’s ability to

extract net rents from other sectors. We investigate these issues using a newly collected dataset

on deposit insurance schemes and selected design features for a large sample of countries.

       Cross-country differences in political arrangements are bound to affect both kinds of

decisions. The presence of an explicit deposit insurance system and how it is designed affects

many constituencies, especially banks, depositors, creditors, specialized bureaucracies, and

taxpayers. Because individual constituencies have conflicting interests, the political process

governing adoption and design decisions can be complex.


                                                 2
        Economists presume that political dealmaking serves both public and private interests.

Public-interest rationales for deposit insurance focus on protecting small, uninformed depositors

and assuring the stability of the banking system (Diamond and Dybvig, 1983). Private-interest

rationales portray regulatory decisions as the outcome of interest-group competition, in which

well-organized or powerful groups compete with voters to pressure public-spirited, but

opportunistic politicians and regulators for regulatory interventions that enable sponsoring

groups to capture rents from other sectors (Stigler, 1971; Peltzman, 1976; Becker, 1983).

        Deposit insurance subsidizes banks that are prepared to exploit weaknesses in

supervisory risk control to extract value from taxpayers and safer banks. Safety-net subsidies

may be defined as implicit risk capital that the government administers in helping to recapitalize

banks when they become deeply insolvent. It is natural to hypothesize that differences in the

distribution of political clout would influence safety net design. Financial institutions regularly

lobby for “reforms” that promise to increase their franchise value (Kroszner and Stratmann,

1998). The more a country’s political system allows sectors to share power, the better narrow

private interests can make their concerns felt.

        An extensive literature analyzes the public and private benefits and costs of explicit

deposit insurance and explores theoretically the challenges of designing an optimal deposit

insurance system.1 Our paper is part of an emerging, complementary body of empirical research.

Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (2002) and Demirgüç-Kunt and Huizinga (2004) show that

deposit insurance design features affect banking system fragility and market discipline.

Demirgüç-Kunt and Kane (2002), Laeven (2002), and Hovakimian, Kane and Laeven (2003)

show that weak institutional environments undermine deposit insurance design.

(1998), and Allen and Gale (1998), and Pennacchi (2006).

         Studies of how political factors affect deposit insurance reform focus predominantly on

the United States. Calomiris and White (1994) argue that federal deposit insurance benefited

predominantly small and poorly diversified unit banks and that, had not the Great Depression

reduced confidence in the banking system as a whole, their pleas for federal insurance could not

have overcome the opposition of politically stronger large banks. Kane and Wilson (1998) show

that, in the face of the Great Depression, large banks’ wish list changed and that large banks’

share prices benefited greatly from introducing deposit insurance precisely because depositors

had lost confidence in banks of all sizes. Kroszner (1998) argues that deposit insurance is

favored by riskier banks, because they can extract a net subsidy at the expense of safer banks in

the presence of an insufficiently risk-sensitive premium structure. He shows that lobbying by

small, risky banks in U.S. has historically accorded with the private interests of this sector.

Similarly, Economides, Hubbard, and Palia (1996) argue that in the U.S. deposit insurance was

instituted for the benefit of the small, unit banks.

         Kroszner and Strahan (2001) study whether interest-group pressures can explain voting

outcomes in the U.S. House of Representatives on the Wylie Amendment on limiting deposit

insurance to a single account per bank. They find that limits to deposit insurance were opposed

by representatives from states where small banks had a large share of the market and by states

with a large proportion of elderly people. The amendment was favored by representatives of

states where banks could sell insurance products and where the insurance industry was relatively

large.

         Our paper is most closely related to Laeven’s (2004) investigation of how political

arrangements affect coverage levels across countries. Our more comprehensive dataset lets us

model simultaneously decisions about adoption and numerous aspects of system design.




                                                   4
        It is important to investigate how different country characteristics, including differences

in political systems, affect political support for deposit insurance. Laeven (2004) is able to study

only one element of deposit insurance design in a cross-country context (deposit insurance

coverage) and uses single-equation methods to explain this variable in only one date (the year

2000). Using a two-equation framework that controls for how country characteristics influence

the logically prior decision to adopt deposit insurance, we are able to study how the evolution of

characteristics over time affects the adoption of a series of loss-control features. Like Laeven, we

find that deposit insurance coverage is higher in countries where poorly capitalized banks

dominate the market, but we are able to show that risky banks lobby against efforts to control

risk-shifting in other ways as well.

        Our paper offers two advances. First, we create a new dataset of deposit insurance design

features that (unlike previous studies) covers all countries that offer explicit deposit insurance

and tracks changes in design features across time in every country. Second, we use this

comprehensive database to generate cross-country evidence on the determinants of the adoption

and design of deposit insurance systems.

        We use discrete choice and proportional hazard models to analyze the adoption of deposit

insurance.2 To study deposit insurance design, we use two-stage selection models that account

for selection bias by including countries that lack explicit deposit insurance.

        We find that external pressures and internal politics play significant roles in adoption and

design decisions. Other things equal, the more contestable a country’s political system, the more

likely it is both to adopt explicit deposit insurance and to adopt inadequate risk controls. We

 Similar models have previously been used by Kroszner and Strahan (1999) to analyze the timing of the elimination
of bank branching restrictions in U.S. states, by Pagano, Penetta and Zingales (1998) to explain the decision of
companies to go public, and by Shumway (2001) to explain corporate bankruptcies.

confirm that private interests, particularly the relative importance of risky banks in the country,

exercise an important but not exclusive influence on adoption and design decisions.

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes some recent trends in

deposit insurance adoption and design. Section 3 introduces testable hypotheses about the nature

of interest-group bargaining, defines the main variables used in the empirical analysis, describes

the sources used to construct these variables, and presents summary statistics for all included

variables. Section 4 specifies and estimates statistical models of the adoption decision. Section 5

explains how selection models can be used to explain deposit insurance design and offers

empirical estimates of two-stage models of adoption and design. Section 6 underscores our

principal findings.



2. Adoption and Design Features of Deposit Insurance

The first national system of deposit insurance was introduced in 1934 in the United States. Since

then, many countries have followed suit. Figure 1 displays all countries with explicit deposit

insurance schemes as of year-end 2003. The 1990s saw a particularly rapid spread of explicit

deposit insurance. In 1995, only 49 countries offered explicit deposit insurance, but by 2003 this

number had surged to 87 countries, an increase of almost 80 percent. Although much of this

recent surge can be attributed to transition countries of Eastern Europe, recent adopters can be

found on every continent.

       Besides adoption dates, we compile information about specific design features of the

particular scheme that each adopting country installs. Since deposit insurance reduces depositor

incentives to monitor banks and increases stockholder incentives to increase bank risk taking,

deposit insurance design should seek to counterbalance these adverse incentives (Kane, 1995;

Bhattacharya, Boot, and Thakor, 1998).


                                                  6
        Depositor and other private discipline are improved by: (i) limiting coverage, (ii)

excluding particular types of deposits (such as foreign-currency or interbank deposits) from the

system, (iii) introducing coinsurance of depositors, and (iv) setting coverage limits per depositor

rather than per account, so that depositors cannot simply increase coverage by spreading deposit

balances across multiple accounts. Stockholder discipline can be improved by introducing risk-

sensitive premia, so that banks that take more risk are “penalized” by higher premiums.3

        Regulatory discipline is also key to a well-functioning deposit insurance regime.

Regulatory discipline can be improved by private-sector involvement in the management of the

deposit insurance system, because private parties are generally considered to be better at

monitoring banks and banks (in particular) are apt to solicit better information with which to

monitor one another than government officials can. It also matters whether membership in a

country’s scheme is compulsory or voluntary. Compulsory membership reduces adverse

selection among banks and forces strong banks to lobby for effective risk-shifting control.

Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (2002) confirm that systems with compulsory membership

outperform voluntary schemes.

        Our analysis focuses not only on decisions about individual design features, but looks

also at how features interact in indices of overall risk control described in section 4.



3. Hypotheses and Definitions

Our goal is to assess the relative importance of public interests, private interests, external

pressures, and internal institutional and political environments in influencing a country’s



3
  The risk-controlling potential of ex ante deposit insurance premiums may be limited. Chan, Greenbaum , and
Thakor (1992) argue that it is difficult to introduce risk-based deposit insurance premiums because this would
require perfect information on banks behavior. With imperfect information, actuarially fair premiums may not be
feasible and may generate additional risk shifting. Pennacchi (2006) shows that even actuarially fair insurance
premiums would not eliminate incentives for banks to take excessive risks.

                                                        7
decision to adopt deposit insurance and follow-on decisions it makes about safety-net design,

specifically about the extent of deposit insurance coverage and other risk-shifting controls.

         We pattern our tests as closely as possible on models others have used to explain

adoption and coverage decisions (Kroszner and Strahan, 2001; Laeven, 2004). However,

differences in data availability across countries obviously constrain the span of variables we can

include. Public and private benefits cannot always be separated and many variables can only be

observed for a few points in time. To include time-invariant country-level variables in the

analysis, we experiment with country fixed effects.

         Sections 3a and 3b develop testable hypotheses about the roles of public interests, private

interests, and internal and external political and institutional forces. These sections also explain

the data sources from which particular variables are constructed.



3.a. Hypotheses

Banking structure

Social costs of deposit insurance are apt to grow with the size and riskiness of the protected

sector. Social costs arise from deadweight costs of intervention, from the displacement of market

discipline, and from moral hazard effects on insured banks. Small and undercapitalized banks

have traditionally been cast as supporters of deposit insurance (Kroszner and Strahan, 2001;

Laeven, 2004).4 5 These banks’ private interests are best served when deposit insurance is

adopted earlier and entails fewer risk-shifting controls. This leads us to investigate whether it

makes a differences if the market share of small (or undercapitalized) banks is large relative to

4
  Keeley (1990) shows that banks will risk bankruptcy only if the option value of deposit insurance exceeds the
franchise value of continuing to operate the bank. Given that small and undercapitalized banks tend to have lower
franchise values, it is expected that they benefit to a greater extent from explicit deposit insurance than large and
well-capitalized banks.




                                                           8
that of large (or well-capitalized) banks. Where small or undercapitalized banks are relatively

important, public interests would be best served if deposit insurance were adopted late and were

to incorporate rigorous risk-shifting control.

Banks relative to other providers of financial services

A number of countries permit banks to sell insurance products. In such countries, one would

expect insurance firms to oppose the adoption of deposit insurance for fear that government

backing would make it easier for banks to take business away from them. Where banks can

underwrite insurance products and the insurance industry is important relative to the banking

industry, insurers’ might be able to both delay deposit insurance adoption and to impose more-

rigorous risk-shifting controls. On the other hand, the public interest would favor adoption if

deposit insurance makes it easier for banks to exploit economies of scope. In this case, efficiency

gains would rise with the size of bank insurance offerings and the public interest would call for

early adoption in countries where banks already sell insurance and the insurance sector is large.

Demographics

As a block, elderly people generally have more financial assets than younger people and often

employ bank deposits as their main savings vehicle. This would dispose them to favor deposit

insurance. Their private interests would seem to be better served when deposit insurance is

adopted earlier. However, rigorous risk-shifting control also seems more likely to emerge in

countries with a relatively large share of elderly people. To the extent that elderly people are less

sophisticated and exert less depositor discipline on banks, the public interest would call for early

adoption and rigorous risk control.

External political pressure and financial crises


5
 On the other hand, Kane and Wilson (1998) find evidence that large banks benefited most from the introduction of
deposit insurance in the United States. If this were true in other countries as well, then large-bank interests might
dominate adoption and decision decisions.

                                                          9
Outside pressure may be generated in several ways. We hypothesize that, when deciding whether

to adopt deposit insurance, policymakers are influenced by choices made by policymakers in

other countries. As explicit deposit insurance becomes widespread, it becomes a hallmark of

regulatory best practice, and countries become more prone to adopt it (Demirgüç-Kunt and

Detragiache, 2002).

       In some countries, the restraining influence of internal economic and political

determinants may have been overcome by domestic and foreign pressure to emulate safety-net

arrangements in other countries, without adequately tailoring the design features to differences in

public and private contracting environments. To test this hypothesis, we estimate models of

deposit insurance adoption and design that include proxies for outside pressure.

       Outside pressure may come directly from supranational agencies. Starting in the 1990s,

IMF crisis-management advice recommended adopting explicit deposit insurance as a way either

of containing crises or of formally winding down crisis-generated blanket guarantees (Folkerts-

Landau and Lindgren, 1998; Garcia, 1999). The World Bank and European Union (EU) have

endorsed explicit deposit insurance as well.

       External political pressure is particularly effective during times of financial crises. The

adoption of deposit insurance is more likely during banking crises because one of the public

rationales for deposit insurance is to prevent bank runs and ensure financial stability (Diamond

and Dybvig, 1983). This leads us to investigate whether and how the occurrence of a financial

crisis might affect the timing and character of deposit insurance decisions.

Political and legal institutions

In addition to identifiable private and public interests, specific political, legal, and economic

factors are likely to affect the timing and character of deposit insurance decisions. Demirgüç-




                                                 10
Kunt and Kane (2002) argue that countries have different contracting environments, and that

these differences must be taken into account when designing a country’s financial safety net.

       To separate economic from political and legal influences, all regression experiments

control for the level of economic development. We also control for differences in political

environments. In political systems that are more democratic, the voices of minority interest

groups can express themselves more forcefully. Presumably, forces that lobby for deposit

insurance can be more effective in democracies (Kroszner and Strahan, 1999). We test the

hypothesis that, ceteris paribus, deposit insurance is adopted earlier and with fewer risk-shifting

controls in more-democratic countries.

       Because moral hazard is exacerbated in countries with poor legal institutions (Demirgüç-

Kunt and Kane, 2002), the quality and enforcement of applicable laws may affect the adoption

and design of deposit insurance. In countries where the quality of legal institutions is poor, the

potential for corruption and abuse is higher. This is apt to generate opportunities for risk-shifting

by insured banks. In countries with poor legal institutions, the public interest would be better

served if deposit insurance were adopted later and imposed stronger risk-shifting controls.

Bank regulation and supervision

Increases in the rigor of bank regulation and supervision are apt to reduce the budgetary cost of

providing deposit insurance. The pre-existence of expense-saving forms of regulatory discipline

is likely to encourage the decision to install an explicit deposit insurance scheme. At the same

time, the rigor of bank regulation is probably controlled by the very same political and economic

factors that affect deposit insurance adoption and design (Barth, Caprio, and Levine, 2006). To

investigate this issue, we examine the influence exerted by four aspects of bank regulation and

supervision: stringency of capital regulations, restrictions on the activities banks can engage in

(including securities underwriting, insurance, and real estate), entry restrictions, and official


                                                  11
supervisory power (including whether the supervisory framework supports prompt corrective

action).

Macroeconomic environment

Finally, we introduce variables that capture macroeconomic developments that may affect the

quality of bank assets, particularly the rate of growth of real GDP and the rate of inflation. These

variables were used previously by Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (2002) to explain the

incidence of banking crises. Our regression experiments introduce the size of a country’s fiscal

deficit as well. High inflation often results from budget deficits that a government finances

predominantly through money creation. Assuming taxpayers resist deficit expansion, a

government may decide against introducing explicit deposit insurance when the contingent

liabilities it creates for the government could not be tax-financed.



3.b Data Sources and Definitions of Included Variables

Our dataset is unique in covering design features for all countries that had adopted explicit

deposit insurance through yearend 2003. The data were collected both from official country

sources and supplemented by information fromWorld Bank country specialists. We also

contacted deposit insurance agencies to extend data availability where necessary. Appendix 2

details the sources of the data we employ.

       Our work expands an earlier Demirgüç-Kunt and Sobaci (2001) database in two ways.

First, we update the endpoint to 2003 to incorporate data on recent adopters. Second, we create a

time series of individual-country design features. Whereas the 2001 database provided data on

coverage only for the year 2000, we track coverage levels for every year in which an explicit




                                                 12
deposit insurance scheme existed.6 The complete database covers 181 countries. Of these

countries, 87 (or 48%) have explicit deposit insurance (as of end-2003). This includes countries

with blanket guarantees. Interestingly, although deposit insurance schemes can be found in all

parts of the world, we find that explicit deposit insurance schemes are observed more frequently

in developed countries than in developing countries7.

        For all countries with explicit deposit insurance, we compile time-series information on

eight design features: (i) the coverage ratio (Coverage ratio), which we define as the ratio of the

coverage limit on insured deposits to per capita GDP; (ii) whether or not foreign currency

deposits are covered (Foreign currency deposits); (iii) whether or not interbank deposits are

covered (Interbank deposits); (iv) whether or not there is coinsurance (Coinsurance); (v) whether

coverage applies per account or per depositor (Payment); (vi) whether premiums are flat or risk-

adjusted (Premiums); (vii) whether or not the administration of the scheme is exclusively

publicly managed (i.e., without participation from the private sector) (Administration); and (viii)

whether or not membership is voluntary (Membership). We calibrate each indicator variable so

that a higher score denotes an increased potential for risk-shifting. We also aggregate these

individual features to form indices of the overall rigor of risk-shifting control.

        We first investigate the determinants each index component separately. “Moral hazard

indices” (Moral hazard) combine the eight individual features in different ways. The pre-

eminent index is the first principal component of the variance-covariance matrix of the eight

features. As robustness tests, we also experiment with alternative moral hazard indexes that

either include additional principal components or straightforwardly average the values of



6
  For example, coverage levels in the United States have increased five times: from US$ 5,000 at adoption in 1934,
to US$ 10,000 in 1950, to US$ 15,000 in 1966, to US$ 20,000 in 1969, to $40,000 in 1974, and finally to US$
100,000 since 1980.
7
  Using the World bank definition of a high-income and low-income country, we find that 78% of high-income
countries, but only 16% of low-income countries offer explicit deposit insurance by year-end 2003.

                                                        13
individual indicators. Table 1 lists adopting countries, the year explicit deposit insurance was

introduced, and the design features we investigate.

       We also collect data on the political and economic variables needed to test the hypotheses

mentioned earlier. For all variables, time-series data cover the period 1960-2002, unless

otherwise noted.

       We proxy the political clout of small banks by Small Banks, the fraction of banking assets

in small banks in the country. A bank is considered small if its total assets are below 1 billion

U.S. dollars. To proxy the clout of undercapitalized banks, we use Undercapitalized Banks, the

fraction of a country’s banking assets in banks showing a below-median capital to asset ratio.

Data on bank size and capital come from Bankscope, a database containing financial data on

international banks. Both categorizations are based on 1995-99 averages.

       To express the clout of the insurance sector, we use Insurance penetration. This variable

expresses gross insurance premiums underwritten as a share of GDP. This information is

collected from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. Because data on insurance

penetration starts in 1987, we use the mean value for 1987-2002.

       To represent the clout exercised by elderly people, we use Pop65, which is the share of

the population age 65 and over. These data also come from the World Bank’s World

Development Indicators database.

       To proxy outside pressure, we experiment with several variables. Contagion is the

fraction of countries in the sample that has adopted explicit deposit insurance at each point in

time. This variable proxies the extent to which deposit insurance is believed to be a universal

best practice. As more and more countries adopt deposit insurance, this nonlinear trend variable

increases in value. IMF Pressure is a zero-one indicator whose value is one from 1999 on. In

1999, the IMF published a best-practice paper on deposit insurance and its design, which


                                                 14
recommended explicit deposit insurance for developing countries. The World Bank also

recommended explicit deposit insurance for specific developing countries during the sample

period. World Bank Loan is an indicator variable that has the value one for countries starting in

the year the World Bank began an adjustment lending program that entailed installation of

explicit deposit insurance. Data on World Bank lending programs that support deposit insurance

come from World Bank (2004). The EU Directive on Deposit Insurance (which came into force

in 1994) also encouraged deposit-insurance adoption, particularly for the EU accession countries.

The 10 countries that joined the EU in 2004 had no choice but to adopt the minimum coverage

set forth by the Directive. Prior to accession, these countries all established an explicit deposit

insurance scheme. To capture this influence, we construct a variable, EU candidacy, that for EU

candidate countries only, takes a value of one from 1994 on.

       To represent banking crises, we construct a binary variable, Crisis, whose value is one in

years that a given country is experiencing a systemic banking crisis, and is zero otherwise. Data

on the timing of banking crises come from Caprio et al. (2005). A banking crisis is defined as a

situation in which significant segments of the banking sector become insolvent or illiquid, and

cannot operate without special assistance from monetary or supervisory authorities.

       To characterize the political environment of a country, we focus on Polity score, an index

that ranges from –10 to 10. Negative scores are assigned to countries that are autocracies and

positive values to democracies. As a robustness check, we experiment with three other proxies.

Democracy is a variable that ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores assigned to countries that

are more democratic. Executive constraints is an index that measures the extent to which a

country’s institutions constrain the decision-making powers of the country’s chief executive in

ways that create other “accountability groups.” This index ranges from 1 to 7. Higher values

indicate stronger restrictions on executive authority. Finally, political competition ranges from 1


                                                  15
to 10, with higher scores representing increased political competition. This index tracks the

extent to which non-elites access institutional structures for political expression. These data

come from the Center for International Development and Conflict Management at the University

of Maryland. Regression experiments presume that minority interest groups exercise more

influence in political systems that are democratic, that place constraints on the executive power,

and that are politically competitive.

       To capture the contracting environment of the country and the development of economic

institutions more generally, we use the we use GDP per capita, and indices for Bureaucracy and

Law and Order. Bureaucracy ranges from 0 to 4, increasing with strength and quality of the

bureaucracy. Law and Order expresses the quality of country’s legal system and rule of law. It

ranges from 0 to 6, where high scores indicate a high level of law and order. Because data on the

quality of bureaucracy and law and order do not start until1984, we average data for these two

variables over 1984-2002.

       We represent differences in the macroeconomic environment by the following variables:

GDP growth, Inflation, and Fiscal deficit. Movement in these variables captures the size of

internal and external macroeconomic shocks a country experiences. GDP growth is the growth

rate in real GDP. Inflation is defined as the annual rate of inflation. Fiscal surplus is the ratio of

fiscal surplus to GDP, where negative values denote fiscal deficits and positive values denote

fiscal surpluses. These data come from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators

database. Because data on fiscal deficits are sparse (in particular, data are lacking for the last

years in our sample period for many countries), our fiscal-deficit variable averages data over

whatever sample is available.

       To measure the quality of bank regulation, we use four different variables. These

variables are taken from the Barth et al. (2006) database and refer to data for the year 2003. In all


                                                  16
cases, higher scores denote greater restrictiveness. Capital regulatory index measures the

stringency of capital regulations in the banking system. The index ranges from 0 to 7. Activity

restrictions measures the degree to which banks can engage in securities underwriting, insurance,

and real estate. The index ranges from 3 to 12. Entry restrictions captures regulatory

requirements to set up a bank. The index ranges from 0 to 8. Official supervisory power is an

index of the power supervisors have to discipline banks. The index ranges from 0 to 14. Barth et

al. (2006) provides details on the construction of each variable.

       Table 2 presents summary statistics for the variables used in our study. The unit of

observation is a country-year. For each variable, detailed definitions and sources are provided in

Appendix 1. The first part of Table 2 lists a series of endogenous design features. The mean

value of the deposit insurance indicator variable, Deposit insurance, states the proportion of

country-years in which the countries in our sample included explicit deposit guarantees in their

safety net. This turns out to be only 17 percent, since many countries adopted deposit insurance

relatively recently. The mean value of indicator variables for specific design characteristics tells

us what proportion of explicit deposit insurance schemes incorporates each particular

characteristic. Design variables are coded so that higher values indicate an increased exposure to

risk-shifting, meaning that moral hazard is less rigorously controlled by that particular design

feature.

       Table 3 reports the correlation matrix of deposit insurance variables and country

characteristics across the years and countries for which data are available for both halves of each

pair of variables. The presence of explicit deposit insurance is positively associated with

economic development (as measured by GDP per capita), external pressure indicators, crisis

experience, and constraints on executive authority. For countries with explicit insurance, we find

that coverage levels and exposures to moral hazard are higher when per capita GDP and


                                                 17
constraints on executive authority are low, and during periods of increased external pressure.

Coverage levels prove higher in countries where government ownership of banks is more

extensive. Because we expect that the same variables would influence adoption and design,

design decisions must be modeled simultaneously with adoption. To avoid selection bias,

regressions seeking to explain design decisions are estimated simultaneously with a selection

model of the adoption decision.



4. Statistical Models of the Adoption Decision

Using a hazard model, we first estimate how the political and economic variables we consider

influence the timing of deposit insurance adoption. To explore the robustness of the inferences

we make, we experiment with alternative models, including Probit models with time-fixed

effects.

A. Hazard Model of the Adoption Decision

           A powerful way to analyze adoption timing is to estimate a hazard model. The hazard

rate λ(t) estimates the probability that a country adopts deposit insurance in year t, given that it

had not yet done so when the year began (Kiefer, 1988). Hazard models surmount the missing-

data problem created by right-censored data. Adoption dates for countries that had not yet

adopted deposit insurance by 2003 are estimated by a synthetic adoption date extrapolated from

the transitions observed for countries that did adopt during the sample period.

           We experiment with two widely used models of the hazard rate. The first is the Cox

proportional hazards model, which expresses the hazard rate as:

                                λi(t) = λ(t) exp (β'xi),                                         (1)

where x is any specified vector of potential explanatory variables. The second is the Weibull

model, which specifies that λ(t) in (1) evolves as:


                                                    18
                               λ(t) = λαtα-1.                                                  (2)

The evolutionary parameter α determines whether the hazard rate is increasing (α > 1),

decreasing (α < 1), or constant (α = 1) over time. We report robust standard errors following Lin

and Wei (1989).

       We designate the Weibull model as our preferred specification because it allows us to

estimate the evolutionary parameter α. High and significant values of α denote positive duration

dependence and can be interpreted as evidence of external influence or emulation. When

employing duration-model techniques, our dataset reduces to a cross section of durations. The

Weibull model lets us compare alternative specifications (focusing specifically on the values of

α) to investigate the presence of external influence rather than either estimating a time trend or

including Contagion as an explanatory variable.

       Assuming the availability of data for our explanatory variables, our sample period

consists of the period 1960-2002. We exclude countries that adopted deposit insurance before

1960 (i.e., the United States) from our analysis. Our initial sample consists of 180 countries, of

which 86 adopted deposit insurance during the period 1960-2002.

       Figure 1 presents the Kaplan-Meier nonparametric estimate of the hazard function over

time. The figure shows that the hazard function is relatively flat in the early years and then grows

steeper in the later years. The particularly large increase observed in the hazard function during

the 1990s coincides with the period that the IMF and the WB began to urge deposit insurance

adoption. EU pressure towards EU accession countries probably also helped to increase the

hazard function in the second part of the 1990s. During the period covered by the EU Directive

on Deposit Insurance, 1994-2003, 42 countries introduced deposit insurance systems. Fourteen

of these (i.e., one-third) are EU accession countries.




                                                 19
B. Regression Experiments Employing Weibull Hazard Models of the Adoption Decision

Table 5 presents regression results for the Weibull hazard model. We first present regressions

that exclude the bank regulatory variables, the institutional variables, and the insurance-

penetration variable because information on these variables is missing for many countries. We

designate the main specification as regression (1). It uses Polity scores to proxy differences in

political environments. Regressions (2) to (4) consider Democracy, Executive Constraints, and

Political Competition as alternative proxies. Regression (5) adds the insurance-penetration

variable and bank regulatory variables. Regression (6) introduces proxies for the quality of the

bureaucracy and the law-and-order tradition in the country. Regressions (7) to (10) include the

external-influence indicators WB Loan and EU Candidacy, experimenting with alternative

proxies for political institutions.8 Because explanatory variables enter exponentially, the

coefficients reported in Table 5 are the logarithms of the underlying relative hazard coefficients.

The relative hazard coefficients can be calculated as the antilog of the reported coefficients. The

exponent of each coefficient estimate shows the proportional increase in the hazard rate that

occurs when the focal explanatory variable increases by one unit.

       We find that our proxy for the clout of small banks delays the introduction of deposit

insurance. This result runs counter to the narrow private-interest view that presumes that small

banks are invariably riskier than large ones and would lobby strongly for the adoption of deposit

insurance. On the other hand, the result parallels the evidence presented by Kane and Wilson

(1998) who show that large banks benefited most from the introduction of deposit insurance in

the United States. The result is also consistent with public-interest theories that predict that

deposit insurance should be adopted later in countries where small, risky banks are relatively

important.




                                                  20
        We also find that deposit insurance is adopted earlier in countries where undercapitalized

banks have substantial clout. This is consistent with these banks’ private interests (and with the

findings of Laeven, 2004).

        Both banking-structure effects are economically important. For example, regression (1)

indicates that a one-standard deviation (22.5%) increase in Undercapitalized Banks would

increase the hazard rate for adopting deposit insurance by exp(0.013*22.5) = 1.34 points (or an

increase of about 34 percent). This implies that countries with higher levels of Undercapitalized

Banks are more likely to adopt sooner.

        Banking crises also raise the probability of early adoption. This is consistent with the

notion that external political pressure to adopt deposit insurance may be particularly effective

during financial crises, when the public rationales for deposit insurance spelled out by Diamond

and Dybvig (1983) -- i.e., to prevent bank runs and re-establish financial stability-- gain ground.

        We do not find that the share of elderly people significantly influences the probability of

early adoption. While regression experiments usually generate a positive coefficient for Pop65

(consistent with the private interests of the elderly), the effect never becomes statistically

significant.

        Differences in the political environment of sample countries appear highly relevant. No

matter how we proxy the quality of democratic institutions in the country, we find that increases

in the political contestability of government control significantly raise the probability of early

adoption. For example, in regression (1) the coefficient on Polity suggests that a one-standard

deviation (7.6) increase in Polity would increase the hazard rate for adopting deposit insurance

by exp(0.058*7.6) = 1.55 points (or an increase of about 55 percent). This result accords with



8
 We do not include the IMF and Contagion variables because these variables do not display cross-country variation
and would therefore drop out of a Cox proportional hazards model.

                                                       21
Kroszner and Strahan (1999) who hold that the political lobby for deposit insurance is more

effective in democracies where minority interest groups are more likely to be heard.

       Differences in macroeconomic environment of the country do not seem to matter much,

although we find some weak evidence that countries are more likely to adopt deposit insurance

when they run a fiscal surplus. This finding supports the view that in countries with persistent

fiscal deficits governments may be unable or unwilling to introduce schemes that create

contingent liabilities for the government.

       The bank regulatory and supervisory framework also does not appear to be an important

factor in the adoption decision, although when we seek to control for bank regulatory and

supervisory differences, our tests become less powerful. The usable sample shrinks to 1808

observations for 72 countries. We find weak evidence that deposit insurance is introduced earlier

in countries that allow banks to engage in a variety of activities, including securities, insurance,

and real estate business. This finding challenges private-interest explanations that predict that

adoption would be delayed in countries where banks can engage in nonbanking activities, such

as the sale of insurance products. However, the result is consistent with the public-interest

theories that predict that adoption should occur earlier in jurisdictions where banks offer

insurance.

       Efforts to control for the quality of the bureaucracy and the law-and-order tradition serve

mainly as robustness checks. Proxies for the quality of legal institutions do not add to the

explanatory power of the model. They leave our main results unaltered and even increase the

importance of the Polity variable, although the significance of the increase is undermined by the

reduction in sample size.

       Finally, regressions (7) to (10) confirm the commonsense expectation that external

pressure from the EU encouraged earlier adoption of deposit insurance by EU accession


                                                 22
countries. On the other hand, World Bank endorsement does not seem to have wielded a

significant influence.

       We also obtain a positive and significant estimate for the evolutionary parameter α . This

tells us that the hazard function for adopting deposit insurance increases during our sample

period 1960 – 2002. To show how quickly, we compare the hazard rates for the years 1980 and

2000. Focusing on the estimate of α in regression (1), we find that for a typical country:

                λ (Year 2000) = λ (40) = λα (λ 40)α −1
                                                       = (40 / 20)α −1 = (40 / 20) 2.16−1 = 2.23.
                λ (Year 1980) = λ (20) = λα (λ 20)α −1

This tells us that such a country is more than 2 times more likely to adopt deposit insurance in

2000 than in 1980. This nonlinear trend approximates the emulation effect that we go on to

estimate directly using the Contagion variable in Probit specifications.9 That significant positive

values are found for α in all Weibull specifications supports our contention that external

influence is important. The likelihood of adoption at time t, conditional upon nonadoption prior

to time t, increases over time.



C. Robustness Experiments Employing Cox and Probit Models of the Adoption Decision

Table 6 shows that results are similar if we use the Cox model rather than the Weibull model of

the hazard rate. Because the Cox model excludes time variation in the hazard rate, it is

impossible to include Contagion and IMF external pressure as potential determinants. In this

model too [regressions (1) and (2)], deposit insurance is adopted earlier in countries that show a

greater clout for large banks, that show greater clout for undercapitalized banks, that undergo

financial crises, that are more democratic, and that are (former) EU accession countries.

       As a further robustness check, we also estimate Probit models of the decision. The

endogenous variable has the value one in years when the country has explicit deposit insurance,



                                                   23
but is zero otherwise. We allow for correlation among errors for each country by estimating

Probit regressions using clustered errors at the country level. Probit models accommodate the

time-varying external pressure variables Contagion and IMF.

           Regressions (3) and (4) are Probit regressions of the adoption decision. These equations

include year-fixed effects to control for unobserved common elements that make deposit

insurance more desirable in countries as time goes by (other than those captured by the WB and

EU Candidacy variables).

           Probit models assume that a country makes each year a decision about changing its

deposit-insurance status. However, once explicit insurance is in place, countries rarely jettison

it. To parallel hazard models, we drop all post-adoption observations. Although the Probit

approach uses right-censored observations that potentially bias the results, the Probit results turn

out to be broadly similar to those obtained from the hazard models.

           Probit regressions (5) and (6) replace the time dummies by the time-varying external

pressure variables Contagion and IMF. Contagion proxies how widely deposit insurance is

believed to be a universal best practice. Consistent with this interpretation, we find that as more

and more countries adopt deposit insurance, countries without deposit insurance become more

likely to follow their lead. Although Contagion is strongly significant, IMF does not enter

significantly once we control for the other sources of external influence.

           Overall, these experiments confirm the hypothesis that domestic private and public

interests and external influence play important roles in adoption decisions.



5. Explaining Deposit Insurance Design




9
    The impact of the external pressure variables Contagion and IMF are already captured by the evolutionary trend α.

                                                          24
           We next use Heckman’s two-stage selection framework to investigate whether and how

political and economic factors influence the design of deposit insurance systems in adopting

countries. We test hypotheses about the “liberality” of system design. By the liberality of a

design feature, we mean the extent to which empirical evidence summarized in Demirgüç-Kunt

and Kane (2002) indicates that it is likely to promote moral hazard and risk-shifting by banks. To

recognize that particular combinations of features might mute or reinforce the impact of some of

the others, we construct a covariance matrix of design features in which each variable is

standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. We define the first principal

component of the covariance matrix of the eight features listed in section 2 as our first Moral

Hazard index.

           The first-stage equation is a selection model for adoption. It uses the same set of

regressors used in the hazard models of Section 4. The second-stage models incorporate a

regressor called Heckman’s Lambda that accounts for the sample-selection bias that would

emerge if one sought to explain design features in a single-equation context. As an inverse

measure of the odds of adopting, this variable measures the degree to which adoption proves

surprising. A positive and significant coefficient for Heckman’s Lambda indicates that latent

characteristics that make adoption surprising also encourage liberality in design.

           We experiment with two versions of Heckman’s two-step selection models.10 First, we

estimate a model using identical regressors in both stages. This model is identified only by the

fact that Heckman’s Lambda is a nonlinear function of the regressors. Second, we estimate a

model that excludes the selection variable Contagion from the second-stage regression. As

shown in the previous section, Contagion is an important determinant of adoption. This variable




10
     We obtain qualitatively similar results when using maximum likelihood to estimate the Heckman selection model.

                                                         25
satisfies the exclusion restriction if Contagion partly explains adoption (as shown in section 4),

but does not wield much influence on decisions about the design features of deposit insurance.

        Regression (1) of Table 7 uses the first principal component of the vector of design

features as the endogenous variable in the second stage. Heckman’s Lambda receives a positive

coefficient, indicating that latent characteristics that make adoption less likely also encourage

liberality in design, but this variable is not statistically significant. We find that design features

are more liberal in countries where insurance markets are relatively large. This is inconsistent

with the view that the private interests of a powerful insurance lobby seeking to promote loss-

control features so as to make it harder for banks to compete with the insurance industry. If

banks enjoy efficiency gains from economies of scope that rise with the size of the insurance

markets, this sign would indicate pursuit of public benefits.

        We also find more risk controls in countries showing larger shares of elderly people. This

is inconsistent with this demographic bloc’s private interests unless elderly people lobby for

extensive risk controls to contain bank risk-shifting for fear that safety-net subsidies would end

up being captured by people younger than themselves.

        The results also indicate that countries with higher levels of per capita income are more

apt to adopt design features that mitigate moral hazard behavior by banks. This may be because

sophisticated risk-control features such as coinsurance and risk-adjusted premiums are more

readily understood and easier to enforce in economically developed countries.

        We also find that countries are apt to adopt better risk controls if they also have more

stringent capital regulations. This supports the view that capital requirements are complementary

ways to limit risk-shifting.

        Finally, we find that countries that impose strict entry restrictions on banks tend to adopt

a more-liberal deposit insurance scheme. This suggests that the banking industry has


                                                   26
extraordinary political clout in such countries, since entry restrictions and generous deposit

insurance both enhance the franchise value of incumbent banks.

       Regression (2) includes year-fixed effects to control for unobserved elements that might

make deposit insurance become more desirable in countries as time goes by. This experiment

confirms that countries with large shares of undercapitalized banks adopt more liberal deposit

insurance. This is consistent with the private interests of risky banks, who can benefit from

extensive deposit insurance coverage and few risk controls.

       These experiments also show that more-democratic countries adopt more-liberal deposit

insurance. This result is consistent with the private-interest view that the lobbying for deposit

insurance subsidies is more effective where minority interest groups have better access to power.

We also find that countries with high inflation rates and wide supervisory authority tend to have

less generous deposit insurance schemes. The experiment confirms the positive (and now

statistically significant) sign accorded Heckman’s Lambda. Latent characteristics that make

adoption less likely also encourage liberality in design. This result underscores the value of

making inferences about design in a two-stage framework.

       Regression (3) drops the time-fixed effects included in the previous regression and

instead includes Contagion as selection variable in the first-stage regression. As before, the first-

stage regression indicates that as time goes by and more countries adopt deposit insurance, other

countries become more likely to adopt deposit insurance. A positive and significant coefficient

continues to be assigned to Heckman’s lambda.

       These findings are broadly consistent with those obtained using time-fixed effects, except

that this experiment indicates that countries that run fiscal deficits seem less likely to impose risk

controls and more likely to load contingent liabilities on the government.




                                                 27
       Regression (4) explores the effects of introducing the external pressure variables IMF,

WB, and EU Candidacy into the model, when excluding Contagion from the second stage. While

we found earlier that external pressure by the WB and EU can lead countries to adopt deposit

insurance earlier, this experiment indicates that these same pressures dispose countries to adopt

schemes that include better risk controls. Expert advice that accompanies international pressure

is likely to lead to more prudent design of deposit insurance. This experiment also indicates that,

consistent with private-interest origins, countries with a larger proportion of small banks tend to

prefer more liberal deposit insurance.

       Regression experiments (5) through (7) use alternative moral-hazard indices as the

endogenous variable in second-stage regressions. The covariates included in these robustness

checks and the first-stage regressions are the same as those in regression (4). The endogenous

variable in regression (5) is a moral-hazard index based on the first two principal components of

design features. Regression (6) uses the moral-hazard index based on the first three principal

components of the design features. The endogenous variable in regression (7) is the simple

average of the individual design-feature scores. While the results are broadly similar across the

alternative specifications, a few differences emerge. In particular, the role of inflation and fiscal

deficits lacks robustness again.

       Although not reported here, we also experimented with specifications including the

alternative political-environment variables (Democracy, Executive Constraints, and Political

Competition). These experiments show much the same results as those obtained when political

institutions are proxied by Polity.

       Table 8 presents Heckman selection regressions for each of the design features that make

up the composite moral hazard indices. First-stage coefficients are virtually identical in all

columns. While second-stage estimates are similar across specifications, a few noticeable


                                                  28
differences emerge. For example, while countries with a large proportion of small banks

generally adopt fewer risk controls, they tend not to cover foreign-currency deposits. This may

be because foreign-currency deposits flow largely to a country’s largest banks, so that small

banks have little incentive to lobby for this form of coverage.

       Also, whereas previous experiments indicated that moral-hazard indices were not

significantly influenced by the occurrence of banking crises, in this experiment coverage tends to

increase in countries that experience banking crises. This finding is consistent with evidence

presented by Hovakimian, Kane, and Laeven (2003) that systems adopted in crisis circumstances

tend to be poorly designed.



6. Summary

Analyzing data covering the experience of up to 180 countries over the past four decades, this

paper studies determinants of the adoption and design of explicit deposit insurance systems.

Regression experiments confirm that the interplay of private and public interests influences the

adoption and design of deposit insurance schemes. Within countries, outside influences and

internal political factors significantly modify the intersectoral contracting process.

       Three principal findings emerge. First, countries with more-democratic environments and

countries with a larger proportion of risky banks are more likely both to adopt deposit insurance

and to design it with fewer risk controls. Other things equal, systems that allow sectoral interests

to negotiate more openly with one another appear more likely both to adopt deposit insurance

and to design it poorly. Second, deposit insurance is more likely to be adopted during financial

crises, presumably because representatives for sectoral interests find it easier to negotiate

regulatory reform in distressed circumstances. Third, external pressures from institutions such as

the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Union influence the


                                                 29
domestic decision-making process. Pressure to emulate developed-country regulatory

frameworks appears to promote adoption of deposit insurance, but also to dispose a country

toward better design. These inferences prove robust to a host of different statistical methods and

control variables.

Table 5. Hazard models of deposit-insurance adoption
This table presents hazard regressions seeking to explain the hazard rate of adopting explicit deposit insurance over the period 1960-2002. The model considers the
adoption of deposit insurance as a “transforming event.” The endogenous variable is the number of years between 1960 and the adoption date. The assumed
distribution of the hazard function is Weibull. The coefficients reported are the logarithms of the underlying relative-hazard coefficients. Regressions 2 to 4 consider
alternative proxies for political institutions. Regression 5 controls for the scope and quality of bank regulations and supervision. Regression 6 includes additional
proxies for the institutional environment of the country. Regressions 7 to 10 add external influence variables, using alternative proxies for political institutions. The
number of adopting countries is the number of countries that have adopted deposit insurance during the observation period. An intercept is used but not shown. Lin
and Wei (1989) standard errors are shown in brackets. The standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the country-level. *, **, *** indicate significance at the 10%,
5% and 1% level, respectively.

Table 6. Alternative models of deposit-insurance adoption

This table presents regressions that explain the adoption of explicit deposit insurance over the period 1960-2002. Regressions 1 and 2 are based on a proportional Cox
(1972) hazard model. The endogenous variable is the number of years between 1960 and the adoption date. Regressions 3 and 4 are based on a Probit model with
year-fixed effects. Regressions 5 and 6 are based on a Probit model without year-fixed effects. The endogenous variable is the explicit deposit-insurance indicator.
We drop observations after deposit insurance is adopted in the country. An intercept is used but not shown. For regressions 1 and 2, Lin and Wei (1989) standard
errors are shown in brackets. For regressions 3 to 6, White standard errors are shown in brackets. The standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the country-level.
*, **, *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively.

Table 7. Heckman two-step selection model for deposit-insurance coverage and other design features

This table reports a series of Heckman two-stage selection regressions for design features. The endogenous variable in the first-stage regression (selection equation) is the explicit
deposit insurance indicator. The endogenous variable in the second-stage (design equation) is a composite moral hazard index. In regressions (1) to (4), we use the moral hazard index
based on the first principal component of following design features: Coverage ratio, Foreign currency deposits, Interbank deposits, Coinsurance, Payment, Premiums, Administration,
and Membership. In regression (5), we use the moral hazard index based on the first two principal components of the design features. In regression (6), we use the moral hazard index
based on the first three principal components of the design features. In regression (7), we use the moral hazard that is the simple average of the design feature variables. All design
features have been transformed to standardized variables (with mean zero and standard deviation of one) for the principal component calculations. We report Heckman’s (1979) two-
step efficient estimates. Model (2) includes year-fixed effects in both the first-stage and second-stage regression. Model (3) adds the Contagion variable as selection variable to the first-
stage regression. Models (4) to (7) add the external influence variables to the first-stage and second-stage regressions. Standard errors are shown in brackets and *, **, *** indicate
significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively.

Table 8. Heckman two-step selection model for deposit-insurance design features: individual design features

This table reports a series of Heckman two-stage selection regressions for design features. The endogenous variable in the first-stage regression (selection equation) is the explicit
deposit insurance indicator. The endogenous variable in the second-stage (design equation) is one of the following design features that make up the moral hazard index: Coverage ratio,
Foreign currency deposits, Interbank deposits, Coinsurance, Payment, Premiums, Administration, or Membership. All design features have been transformed to standardized variables
(with mean zero and standard deviation of one). We report Heckman’s (1979) two-step efficient estimates. All models include the Contagion variable as selection variable in the first-
stage regression. Standard errors are shown in brackets and *, **, *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively.

               political participation. Their chief executives are chosen in a regularized
               process of selection within the political elite, and once in office they exercise
               power with few institutional constraints. Democracy is conceived as three
               essential, interdependent elements. One is the presence of institutions and
               procedures through which citizens can express effective preferences about
               alternative policies and leaders. Second is the existence of institutionalized
               constraints on the exercise of power by the executive. Third is the guarantee of

Political        Index combining regulation of participation and competitiveness of                   Polity    IV,   INSCR
Competition      participation scores. It ranges from 1 to 10, where higher scores represent          Program,       CIDCM,
                 more political competition. Participation is regulated to the extent that there      University of Maryland,

                 expressed. One-party states and Western democracies both regulate
                 participation but they do so in different ways, the former by channeling
                 participation through a single party structure, with sharp limits on diversity of
                 opinion; the latter by allowing relatively stable and enduring groups to compete
                 nonviolently for political influence. The polar opposite is unregulated
                 participation, in which there are no enduring national political organizations
                 and no effective regime controls on political activity. In such situations
                 political competition is fluid and often characterized by recurring coercion
                 among shifting coalitions of partisan groups. The competitiveness of
                 participation refers to the extent to which alternative preferences for policy and
                 leadership can be pursued in the political arena.

Bureaucracy      Index measuring the institutional strength and quality of the bureaucracy. It        International Country Risk
                 ranges from 0 to 4. High points are given to countries where the bureaucracy         Guide (ICRG)
                 has the strength and expertise to govern without drastic changes in policy or
                 interruptions in government services. In these low-risk countries, the
                 bureaucracy tends to be somewhat autonomous from political pressure and to
                 have an established mechanism for recruitment and training. Countries that
                 lack the cushioning effect of a strong bureaucracy receive low points because a
                 change in government tends to be traumatic in terms of policy formulation and
                 day-to-day administrative functions. Average over the period 1984-2002.

                      adequacy is determined. Index ranges from 0 to 7. Higher values denote greater
                      stringency. Data refer to the year 2003.
