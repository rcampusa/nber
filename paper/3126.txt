THE INFORMATION IN THE LONGER MATURITY TERM STRUCTURE ABOUT FUTURE INFLATION


                                              ABSTRACT

        This paper provides empirical evidence on the information in the term structure for longer
 maturities about both future inflation and the term structure of real interest rates. The evidence
 indicates that there is substantial iisformation in the longer maturity term structure about future
 inflution: the slope of the term structure does have a great deal of predictive power for future
 changes in inflation. On the other hand, at the longer maturities, the term structure of nominal
 interest rates contains very little information about the term structure of real interest rates.
 These results are strikingly different from those found for very short-term maturities, six months
 or less, in previous work. For maturities of six months or less, the term structure contains no
 information about the future path of inflation, but it does contain a great deal of information
 about the term structure of real interest rates.
        The evidence in this paper does indicate that, at longer maturities, the term structure of
 interest rates can be used to help assess future inflationary pressures: when the slope of the term
 structure steepens, it is an iudicstiou that the inflation rate will rise tn the future and when the
 slope falls, it is an indication that the inflation rate will fall. However, we must still remain
 cautious about using the evidence presented here to advocate that the Federal Reserve should
 target on the term structure in conducting monetary policy. A change in Federal Reserve
 operating procedures which focuses on the term itructure may well cause the relationship
 between the term structure and future inflation to shift, with the resutt that the term structure
 no longer remains an accurate guide to the path of future inflation. If this were to occur, Federal
 Reserve monetary policy could go far astray by focusiig on the term structure of interest rates.

                                       I. Introduction


       Research beginning with Fama (1975) and subsequent work by Nelson and Sehwert (1977),

Mishkin (1981), Fama and Gibbons (1982). and Huiiinga and Mishkin (1986) supports the view

that the level of interest rates have predictive power for inflation in the postwar United States.'

Recent research has also focused on the information in the term structure about future interest

rate movements.' Together these lines of research suggest that the term structure of interest

rates might contain information about the future paih of inflation.

       An important reason for studying the information in the term structure about future

inflation is that the Federal Reserve is currently considering using data on the term structure as

a policy guide for assessing inflationary pressures in the economy. With the increasing doubts
about the reliability of the money supply data as a target for monetary policy, it is not surprising

that the Fed is looking at other data to guide them. Examining the ability of the term structure

to predict the future path of inflation can provide some indication of whether such afed strategy

of using term structure data to guide monetary policy makes sense.

       Examining the ability of the term structure to predsct the future path of inflation also

provides evidence on the prevalent view that a downward sloping yield curve reflects expectations

of a falling rate of inflation, whiles steeply upward sloping yield curve indicates expectations of

a rising rate of inflation. This prevalent view leads to examination of the behavior of the term

structure, as in Blanchard (1984) and Dornbusch (1988), to decide whether anti-inflation policy




  there is an exception in the period from October i979 until October 1982 when the Federal
Reserve dramatically changed its operating procedures (see 1-luizinga and Mishkin (1986)).
   Shiller, Campbell and Schoenholtz (1982) and Mankiw and Summers (1984), for example, have
questioned the value of the term structure in predicting future short-term interest rates, while
recentevidenceinFama (1984),Fama andflliss (1987), Campbelland Shiller(1987), Hardouvelis
(1988), and Mishkin (1988a) is more positive about the ability of the term structure to forecast
future interest rates.
                                                  2

has becu credible or not. Examining the validity of this prevalent view is thus important to

debates about the credibility of anti-inflation policies which is central to evaluating the cost of

anti-inflation policies.

       Another reason for studying the information in the term structure about future inflation

is that empirical evidence on this topic can indicate whether movements in the term structure of

real interest rates (which are not directly observable) are revealed by movements in the term

structure of unminal interest rates (which are observable). Since researchers who are
constructing models of the business cycle or asset pricing often need to use stylized facts about

the real term structure, assessing whether observable data on the nominal term structure provides

them with informalion about the behavior of the real term structure is an important topic of

research.

       Recent research has begun to examine what information the term structure of interest rates

contains about future inflation. Mishkin (1988b) examines the term structure for U.S. Treasury

bills and finds that, for maturities of six months or less, the term structure of nominal interest

rates provides almost no information about the future path of inflation. On the other hand, at this

shorter end of the term structure, the term structure of nominal interest rates does contain a great

deal of information about the term strecture of real interest rates. However, for longer
maturities of nine and twelve months, the term structure of nominal interest rates does appear

to contain information about the future path of inflation, although it contains little information

about the tern structure of real interest rates.        Using a somewhat different regression
framework! Fasasa (1989) finds that at even longer maturities the term structure helps forecast

the fiasre path of inflation.

      This paper conducts a further examination of the information in the term structure of

nominal interest rates aboutf uture inflation and the term structure of real interest rates. It looks

at the information in the longer maturity term structure by examining data from U.S. Treasury

bonds with maturities of one to five years. The next section of the paper lays out the method-

ology, and it is followed by a discussion of. some tricky econometric issues that are critical to

correct interpretation of results with long maturity, term structure data. Thc empirical results

and concluding remarks thcn complete the paper.                                                 -




                                         H. The Methodology


         in exansiuing the information in the term structure about future inflation, the empirical

analysis in this paper primarily focuses on estimation of the following inflation-change

forecasting equation,



(1)                 -s= a,, + $_[i7-i] + i

                      -                                                                             -
where,
                                                                                                    -
                          = the realized inflation rate over the nextmyears, starting

                            at time t,

               i'           the rn-year nominal interest rate at time t



In this equation, the change in the future rn-year inflation rate from the 1-year inflation rate (ir7

-
    ir) is regressed on the 'slope' of the term structure (i -
         Tests of the statistical significance of the p. coefficient and whether it differs from 1.0

reveal how much information there is in the slope of the term structure shout future changes in

inflation. More specifically, as is described in Misbkin (1988b), a statistical rejection of fl -=0

provides evidence that 1) the term structure contains significant information about the future

path of inflation, and 2) the slopes of the term structures of real and nominal interest rates do not
move one-for-one with each other. On the other hand, a statistical rejection of fi,, =     1   provides
evidence that 1) the slope of the real term structure is not constant over time, and 2) the term

structure of nominal interest rates provides information about the term structure of real interest

rates.

         Note that the phrase 'information in the term structure is being used in this piper quite

narrowly. Information ie the term structure about the path of future inflation refers only to the

ability of the slope, i' - i, to predict the change in the inflation rate, x - w, This paper focuses

on the predictive power of the slope term, i -         i,   because it is the most natural piece of
information in the term structure to examine.

         Bef ore going on to a discussion of lhe data and the empirical results, several econometric

issues that have important consequences for hypothesis testing need to be discussed. As is now

well known, the error term i' will be serially correlated when the number of periods spanned by

the interest rate and inflation are greater than the observation interval, as occurs in the following

empirical analysis. In this overlapping data ease, the forecast error is uo realized until w-yesrs

in the future, with the result that it will follow a MA(12m-1) time snries process. Asymptotically

vslid standard errors are generated here using the method outlined by Hansen and Hodrick
[1980], with a modification due to White [1980] that allowsfor conditional heterosccdasticity, and

a modification suggested by Newey and West [1987] that insures the variance-covariance matrix

is positive definite. Although the corrected standard errors using the method described above
willlead toeorrcct inference asymptotically, previous research (Huizinga and Mishkin 1984J, for

example) indicates that there could be large differences between finite sample distributions and

asymptotic distributions when there isa large amount of data overlap ss in the empirical analysis

in this paper.

         To check out whether inference using asymptotic distributions might be misleading, a

series of Monte Carlo simulations have been conducted. Table 1 reports the results from Monte

Carlo simulations of oae-thousand t-tests of the null hypothesis fi.. = Din the inflation-change

forecasting equation (1) using the Hasssen-I-todrick-White-Newcy-West estimalion method
described above.' The table contains results for the regressions with = two to five years, and

for three sample periods: Panel A for the full sample which has over three hundred and fifty

observations, Pane' B for the pre-October 1979 sample which has three-hundred and twenty-

two observations, and Panel C (or the post-October 1979 sample with less then seventy-five

observations.

       As the last two columns of Table 1 indicate, inference from using the asymptotic
distrsbutioe can be highly misleading, even when the number of observations is in excess of three

hundred and fifty. Using the 5% critical value from the asymptotic distribution, over 18% of she

t-statistics from the Monte Carlo simulations uing the full sample (Panel A) indicate rejection

of the null hypothesis when it is true. Not surprisingly, the bias of the asymptotic distribution gets

worse as the degree of overlap increases with increasing . When we get to the Panel C results

which have under one hundred observations, the degree of bias becomes especially severe. For




                                                                            i
    iFor the Monte Carlo simulations, the inflation rates and the i - spread variables were
constructed from ARMA models whose parameters were estimated from the relevant sample
periods. Because Lagrange-multiplier tests described by Engle [1982] reveal the presence of
ARCH (autoregressive conditional beteroscedasticity) in the error terms, the error terms are
drawn from a normal distribution in which the variance follows an ARCH process whose
parameters were also estimated from the relevant sample periods. Start-up values for AR terms
in the times series models are obtained from the actual realized data from five and six years
before the sample period, and then four years of draws from the random number generalor
produce start-up values (or the error terms. Then a sample size corresponding to the relevant
regression is produced using errors drawn from the distribuLion described above. To cheek out
the robustness of the Monte Carlo results, 1 also conducted experiments where the error terms
were assumed to be i.i.d. rather than ARCH and also where the parameters of the ARIMA and
ARCH processes were esLilnated only from the full sample period; the results were very similar
to those reported in the text. The Monte Carlo results reported in the text assume that the error
terms for the inflation and yield slope equations are independent. Mankiw and Shapiro [1986]
and SLainbaugh [1986], however point out that if the data generating mechanism has yield spreads
correlated with past inflation rates because of contemporaneous correlation between their error
terma, the small sample distribution of teat statistics can be substantially affected. This problem
is not an important one in the data here because the correlations between error terms from yield
spread and inflation equations werefound to be small and statistically insignificant. Monte Carlo
simulations which allowed (or this correlation as in Mankiw and Shapiro P9861 and Stambaugh
[1986J as well as for additional effects of past inflation on yield spreads, were not appreciably
different from those reported in the text.

example, using the 1% critical value From the asymptotic distribution, over fifty percent of the

tstatistics for     5 indicate a rejection of the null when it is Lrue.

       The second through sixth columns of Table 1 provide more information about the

characteristics of the finite sample distribution by providing the critical values for different

marginal significance levels. In Panel A and Panel B, the 5% critical values of the finite

distribution are around 3.0 rather than 2.0 as with the asymptotic distribution, while the 1%

critical values of the finite distribution are over 4.0, For samples with less than one hundred

observations in Panel C, the 5% critical values of the finite sample distribution always exceed 5.0

and the 5% critical value for = 5 is in the double digils.

       Additional Monte Carlo experiments along the lines of those described in Table 1 have

been conducted for t-tests of 1 .      0 and forregressions which examine the predictive ability

of forward rates. They produce results which are quite close to those in Table 1. and are not

       The additional experiments and those reported in Table 1 indicate that we must be quite

careful in conducting inference using asymptotic distributions when the data has a large amount

of overlap (which ranges from 23 periods for monthly observations with m = 2 years, to 59

periods for monthly observations for a = 5 years). For this reason, all critical values and

marginal significance levels of every test statistic reported in the following empirical analysis

have been obtained from Monte Carlo simulation results.




                                        III. The Data

       The empirical analysis makes use of monthly data from 1953 to 1987 for inflation rates and

interest rates oe one through five year Treasury bOnds. The inflation and interest rate data are
  all in nercent at an annual rate The inflation data is calculated from a CPI series which ap-

  propriately treats housing costs on a rental-equivalence basis through out the sample period. For

  more details on this series, see Huizinga and Mishkin (1984, 19116). The interest rile data is

 MeCulloch's (1987, TableA-1) zero coupon yield curve scrieswhich is continuously compounded,

 end--of-month data. Because interest rate data for longer term bonds must be obtained by fitting

 a yield curve through interest rates on the maturiLies available and then using the fitted values

 for the desired maturity dates, it is worthwhile checking whether results are robust to a different

 procedure for constructing the data set. To this end, all the regressions in this paper have also

 been run with an alternative data set construcLed by Fama and Bliss (1987), which has been

 obtained from the Center for Research and Security Prices (CRSP) data tape. There are no

 major differences between the resulLs from the Fama and Bliss data seL versus the McCulloch

 dat-a set. However, slandard errors of coefficients tended to be somewhat smaller with the
 McCulloch data set, so the results with this data set are the ones reported in the teaL.

       The timing of the variables is as follows. A January 1980 interest rate observation, for

example, uses the end of December 1979 bond rate data. A January 1980 observation for the one-

year inflation rate is calculated from the December 1979 and December 1980 CPt; a two-year

inflation rate from the December 1979 and December 1981 CPI; and so on.'




   'Since the last CPI observation is December 1987, the last observation for the full sample in
a regression when g = 2 years is December 1985; form 3 years it is December 1984; for =
4 years it is December 1983; and for m = 5 years it is December 1982. Note also that the
appropriate dating for the CPI in a partscular month is not clear since price quotations on the
component items of the index are collected at different times dering the month. As a result there
is some misalignment of the inflation data and the interest rate data which is calculated for the
end of the nsonth, To see if this misalignment could have an appreeiuble effect on the results, the
regressions in this paper have also been estimated lagging the interest rate one month (i.e., for
the January 1980 observation, I used the November 1979 bond rate). Not surprisingly, the results
with the lagged interest rate data are very close to those found in the text.

                                   V. The Empirical Results


       Table 2 contains the estimates of the inflation-change forecasting equations for horizons

of one through five years. Panel A contains the results for the full sample period, while Panel B

reports the results for the preOctober 1979 period and Panel C the results for the post-October

 t979 period. The sample has been split into these two sub-periods because results in Clarida and

Friedman (1984), Huizinga and Mishkin (1986) and Roley (1986) indicate that the relationship

of nominal interest rates and inflation shifted dramatically with the monetary regime change of

October 1979!

       The results in Table 2 indicate that there is a great deal of information in the longer

maturity term structure about the future path of inflation. For the full sample in Panel A, the

fl_coefficients at all horizons are positive and significantly different from zero (as indicated by

the t-tests of fl_ = II), andfor   = 4andm = 5 thefl_coeffieientsareevensignificantst the t%
level. (Recall that statistical significance is determined nsing critical values derived from the

finite sample distribution obtained from Monte Carlo simulations.) Furthermore, the R"s of the

forecasting regressions are quite high, particularly for the longer horizons: -indeed form 3,
over forty percent of the variation in the change in inflation is explained by forecasts using the

slope of the term structure.

       The results for the two sub-periods also reach the same conclusion that the term structure

for maturities greater than a year containa a great deal of predictive power for changes in future

inflation. The results are even somewhat stronger for the pre-October 1979 period in Panel B,

with all the fl_ significant at the 5% level and three out of four significant at the 1% level. En

addition, the R1's of the forecasting regressions are higher than in the full sample. The post-



   3Tlse sample is not split again in October 1982, as in Mishkin (1988b), because with the long
horizons used in this paper there are oftenfew data points after October 1982. For example, with
  = 5 years, the last data point is December 19S2.

  October 1979 results in Panel Care somewhat weaker than the
                                                                      pre-October 1979 resulLs: the 1125
  of the regressions are lower and only two of thea_coefficients are significant, However the 5,,

  coefficients still always remain positive and the I("s are still quite high.

         The results found in Table 2 are quite different from those found in Mishkin (1988b) for

  term structure maturities of one to twelve months. For maturities under nine months, the term

  structure contains no information about future changes in inflation: R"s of regressions similar

  to those in Table 2 are never larger than .05. Even though for maLurities of nine and twelve

 months Mishkin (1988b) finds that there is significant information about the path of future

 inflation, the R"s of the forecasting regressions are still quile low, typically below .1(1. Taking
 these results and those in Table 2 together suggests that the term structure provides better
 forecasts of future changes in inflation at longer maturities,6

        The t-tests of I fi_       0 in the last column of Table 2 indicate that the nominsi term

 structure for maturities greater than one year contains very little information about the term
 structure of real interest rates. Only in two eases can the null hypotheses that the slope of the real

 term structure is constant or that the slope of the nominal term structure reveals no information

 about the slope of the real term structure be rejected. However, even in these two cases of

statistically significant [1 's_I terms, the J1 - s_I are negative, indicating a negative correlation

of the slope of the real term structure with the slope of the nominal term structure. Indeed f or

   'Another way to look at the information in the term structure follows along the lines of Fansa
 (1984) who looks at whether forward rates help predict future changes in one-month interest
rates, Table Al in the appendix looks at whether forward rates help predict future changes in the
one-year inflation rate; it reports regressions of the change in the one-year inflation rate, 4,_-
    on the forward-spot rate differential at time t, f,,_ - i. (f._ = the forward rate at time t for the
one-year interest rate ni-years in the future.) For both the full sample period and the pre-
October 1979 sample period,forward rates do have significant explanatory power for changes in
one-year inflation rates up to three years out into the future. However, by the time one goes four
years out, the forward-spot differential no longer has a significant fl_ coefficient. This suggests
that the information in the term atrncture about future inflation may begin to decrease when
maturities begin to exceed five years.

are negative; only in the posL-October 1919 period are the [1 - fl_j terms positive. suggesting a

positive correlation of the slopes of the nominal and real term structures.

       Again the results on tests of 1- fl_ = Din Table 2 are quiLe different than those found for

shorter maturities in Mishkin (1988b). In contrast to Lhe results in Table 2, Miahkin (1988b) finds

that for maturities of six months or less the nominal term structure contains a great deal of
informaLion about the term structure of real interest rates. Indeed, the hypothesis thaL Lhe slopes

of the real and nominal term strucLure move one-for-one with each other cannot he rejected for

these shorter maturities Ibis is exactly the opposite of what is found for the longer maturities

reported on us Table 2, where there is typically a negative relationship between the slopes of the

nominal and real term structure.

       Because there arc differences in the fl.coefficients between the pre and post-October 1919

periods, with the fl_coefficients declining somewhat in the peat-October 1979 period, it is worth

asking whether these differences across the sub-periods are statistically significant. Table 3
reports on the results of tests for parameter shifts in the inflation change equations. As can be

seen from the marginal significance levels of these teats, in no case can the null hypothesis that

the coefficients arc equal in the two periods be rejected at the 5% level. However, because the

change in the coefficients across the periods is substantial in magnitude, the failure to reject

equality of the coefficients may be a reflection of the low power of the tests.



A. Interpretation


      The moat striking feature of the Table 2 results is how different they are from those found

at shorter maturities of the term structure in Mishkin (1988b). What explains why there is so

much more information in the term structure about future inflation at longer maturities then

there is at shorter maturities?

         We can answer this question under the assumption of rational expectations by deriving the

following formula for the inflation-change, forecasting equation fl_along the lines suggested by
Fam.a (1984) and Hardouvelis (191411).

                                                      rr]   = the   ratio of Lhe standard deviation of the

                        expected inflation change to the standard deviation of the slope of the real

                         term structure,

              p       = the correlation between the expected inflation change, E(r7 -          ir), and the
                        slope of the real term structure, rr           rr.


This expression is derived by writing down the standard formula for the projection equation

coefficient fl_, and recognizing that the covariance of the inflation forecast error with rr rr

equals zero given rational expectations                                                               -




      The equation above indicates that fi. is determined by how variable the expected inflation

change is relative to the variability of the slope of the real term structure [represen ted by a ,the

ratio of the.standard deviations of E('C w) and (rr - rr)I, as well as by the correlation of the
expected inflation change with the real term structure slope (p). Figure 1 shows how fl_varies

with a and p. The key fact visible in Figure us that fl.will be substantially above zero if the

variability of expected inflation changes is greater than the variability of real term structure

slopes so that a is greater than one.                                           --




      We can calculate estimated values of a and p using the procedure outlined in Mishkin

(1981), in which estimates of rr - rr are obtained from fitted values of regresaions of the cx-

post real rate differentials on pasL inflation changes and past interest rate spreads.' Then the

estimated expected inflation change is calculated from the following definitional relationship,



(8)          E,(x7 - x') = i7 - i - (rr' - rr)


Finally estimates ole and p are calculated from the estimated E,fr7 - x) and (rr - rr).

      The above calculationa readily explain why the fl_estimated at the longer maturities in this

paper are so much higher than those found in Mishkin (1988b) at shorter maturities, particularly

under nine months. For the longer maturities arudied in this paper, the variation in expected

inflation changes are substantially greater than the variation in real Lerm structure alopes. In the

full sample period, the; 's at all horizons are above ZAI, while in the two sub-samples thee 's

hover around 1.5. As we can see in Figure 1, these high a 'a lead to high &'s. On the other hand

at shorter maturities under nine months, the variability of expected inflation changes are

dominated by the variability of the real term structure slopes, so that Lhe resulting small a 's

generate low estimated fi_'s.

       Empirical research that has investigated the time-variation of term premiums5 provide a

rationale why the a 'a are so much lower at the shortest end of the term structure and hence why

only at longer maturities is the term structure able to provide information about the future path

of inflation. Variation in the slope of the real term structure can be attributed to the variation




  'The esLimatea described in the text were generated from OLS regressions in which the cx-
post real rate differential, eprr - eprr, was regresaed on i - i, this differential lagged one
through five years, and on the inflation change (r - ir') lagged two to five years, not including
laggedvalues if they are noj realized at time j. I also experimented with other choices of lags and
the estimated values of a and p were robust to different specifications of the regression
equations.

(1984), Mankiw and Summers (1984), and Fama and Bliss (1987).

of term premiums over time as well as changes in the average of expected oneperiod real inLerest

rates over the next rn-periods versus the next £-periods High variation in these term premiums

will then produce high variation in the slope of the real term structure and make it more likely

that the variatson of the real term structure slope will dominate the variation of expected future

inflation changes. However, research such as Fama and Bliss (1987) has found that variation in

these term premiums is less important at longer maturities, and so at longer maturities it is more

likely that the variation of expected inflation changeswill eow dominate the variation of real term

structure slopes. The corollary of this argument is that at longer maturities in which the variation

in term premiums no longer dominates, the term structure of nominal inte rest rates should
contain very little information about the Lerm sLructure of real interest rates.

      The estimates of p, along with thosefora discussed above, help explain the pattern of the

$_ coefficients in Table 2. For the Panel A, full sample, the estimated p's ste negative at all

horizons an4 decline as rn lengthens, reaching the most negative value of -0.4 form           5. As

Figure 1 indicates, j. will grow as the maturity lengthens and      p becomes more negative. The

Panel B, pre-October 1979 sample displays similar estimated values of p with a similar pattern,

except that p stops declining at = 4 and rises somewhat, which explains why the fi. coefficienL
does not rise as we move from       = 4 years    torn 5 years.   The Panel C, post-October 1979

sample, on the other hand, has estimated p's that are positive, ranging from .10 to .35, leading to

lower 8,.'s. Not too much should be made, however, of this decline in /3..'s in the post-October

1979 sample periods because there isn't enough data to indicate that this decline is statistically

significant;

                                        VI. Conclusions


       This paper provides empirical evidence on the information in the term structure for longer

maturities about both future inflation and the term structure of real interest rates. The evidence

indicates that there is substantial information in the longer maturity term structure about future

inflation: thc slope of the term structure does have a great deal of predictive power for future

changes in inflation. These resul Es are eonsistenL with those in Fama (1989) who also finds that

at longer maturities the term structure helps forecast future inflation. On the other hand, at the

longer maLurities, the term strueLure of nominal interest rates contains vesy little information

about the term structure of real interest raLes. These results are strikingly different from those

found for very short-term maturities, six months or less, in previous work. For maturities of six

months or less, the term structure contains no information about the future path of inflation, but

it does contain a greaL deal of information about the term structure of real intereat rates.

       The evidence in this paper does indicate Lhat, at longer maturities, the term structure of

interest rates can he used to help assess future inflationary pressures: when Lhe slope of Lhe term

structure steepens, it is an indication that the inflation rate will rise in the future and when the

slope falls, it is an indication that the inflation rate will fall. Furthermore, the results here also

lend supporL to research which uses the term structure spread between long (over two years) and

short-term interest rates to assess the credibility of anti-inflation policies.

       However, we muat still remain cautions abouL using the evidence presented here to

advocate that the Federal Reserve should target on the term structure in eondueLing monetary

policy. Although there is significant information in the term structure about the future path of

inflation for long-term maturities, Mishkin (l9SSb) has found that there is little information

about the future path of inflation in the shorter end of the term structure. Furthermore, as the

interpretation of the results indicates, Lhe fl_-regression coefficients are sensitive to the relative
                                                 15

variability of expected future inflation changes and real term structure slopes, as well as to the
eorrela Lion of these two variables. A change in Federal Reserve operating proeedu.res which

focuses on the term structure may well cause the correlation and relaLive variability of expected

future inflation changes and real term structure slopes to shift, thus causing the regression
coefficients to change in the inflation-change forecasting equation. The result might then be that

the term structure no longer remains an accurate guide to the path of future inflation. If this were

to occur, Federal Reserve monetary policy could go far astray by focusing on the term structure

of inlerest rates. This is, of course, jusL another example of the Lucas (1976) critique.
