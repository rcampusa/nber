                                         ABSTRACT

I test the Dang, Gorton, and Holmström (2018) (DGH) theory that the optimal design of private
money is debt backed by debt. I do this in the context of English inland bills of exchange (where
all parties to the bill were in England), which were used as a medium of exchange during the
Industrial Revolution in the north of England in the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth
centuries. These bills circulated via indorsements, committing each indorser's personal wealth to
back the bill. A sample of bills from the period 1762-1850 is studied to determine how frequently
they changed hands (liquidity/velocity) and to determine how their credibility was established.
Some bills were backed by banks and others by the joint liability of indorsers only. I test the
DGH theory by asking: Were bank-backed bills more liquid than the joint liability-backed bills?

            . . . neither gold coin, Bank of England notes, nor country bank notes is virtually our
           standard: but that bills of exchange alone form our standard. (Burgess (1826), p. 73).

1. Introduction

How is private money created such that it is accepted at par and widely used? That is, private money
(whether in the form, e.g., of bank notes or checks) is best if there are no disputes over its value.
Historically, it has been very difficult to create such money. One very important step in the development
of private money was when it began being produced by banks. To understand this step and to test for
the effect of banks on private money production, in this paper I study English inland bills of exchange.

Inland bills of exchange (where all parties to the bill were in England) were a unique form of private money
that predominantly circulated in the industrial north of England in the eighteenth and first half of the
nineteenth centuries. While debt, such bills were not produced by banks (though banks sometimes backed
such bills) and differed from bank debt, such as bank notes or deposits, in fundamental ways. Bills of
exchange circulated via indorsement, putting each indorsers' wealth at risk if the borrower failed.1 In this
paper I ask how bills of exchange could be acceptable as a means of payment? Who used them? And,
finally, I ask whether bank-backed bills were more liquid than those backed by the wealth of indorsers. To
try to answer these questions, I study a sample of almost 500 inland bills from 1750-1840 found in several
English archives.

In every other case, privately produced money is the short-term debt of banks.2 Such debt takes different
forms: private bank notes, demand deposits, sale and repurchase agreements (repo), money market
mutual funds, and financial commercial paper. In all these cases "banks" back their short-term debt with
longer-term debt (maturity transformation). For example, demand deposits are backed by loans and repo
is backed by specific bonds. Gorton and Pennacchi (1990) argue that for efficient transaction purposes
and for safely storing value for short periods of time the short-term debt should be information-insensitive
that is it should be such that no one can profitably produce private information about the underlying
payoffs on the backing collateral and everyone knows this. There is no adverse selection and so such
money is accepted at par without questions. Dang, Gorton, and Holmström (2018) (DGH) argue that the
optimal way to achieve maximal information-insensitivity is debt backed by debt ("debt-on-debt"), short-
term debt backed by long-term debt.

Historically, not all short-term bank debt has been information-insensitive. For example, private bank
notes issued prior to the U.S. Civil War were information-sensitive. These notes did not trade at par some
distance from the issuing bank, but at discounts that varied over time, requiring their use to involve
consulting newspapers called bank note reporters to determine the current discount. See Gorton (1996,
1998). While the secondary market for such bank notes was efficient in the Fama sense (relevant risk
factors were priced), they were not economically efficient because there were constant disputes and

    Firms that issue short-term debt are "banks" whether recognized by the government as such or not.
                                                                                                                   2


transactions costs associated with using them.3 It was some time before private bank money became
information-insensitive. See Gorton (2017). As discussed below, inland bills of exchange did not involve
risk discounts when used as a transactions medium; no risk was priced. The margin that adjusted was their
liquidity.

I study two central questions. First, how were inland bills made information-insensitive (aside from the
identity of the bill profferer), especially those bills that did not involve banks? Second, I test the DGH
theory that debt backed by debt is the optimal design for private money. I do this by comparing the
velocity (number of indorsements) of bank-backed bills to non-bank-backed bills.

There are three parties to a bill of exchange, the drawer is the person who makes the bill and the person
to whom the bill is addressed is called the drawee. The drawee accepts the bill by signing the front of the
bill, becoming the acceptor, and is then obligated to pay a specified person (the payee) or to order at a
specified date. Once the bill is accepted it can be used as money by indorsing it over to a third party. The
new holder of the bill can similarly use it by endorsing it to still another party. Here's one example of how
bills worked as money. A shopkeeper, needing to pay a supplier, draws a bill on himself for £10 maturing
in one month. The shopkeeper accepts the bill by endorsing it, thereby providing evidence of his
indebtedness, and pays the supplier with it. The supplier may then use it to pay another shopkeeper or,
needing cash, discount it with a merchant acting as a bill broker. See Willan (1970). Often the bill would
be honored by the shopkeeper's London broker, where he had an account. Further, in some cases the
acceptor, the party obligated to pay, was in fact a bank.

Ashton (1939, p. 104) gives an example of how bills worked. When Mr. Peter Stubs, a file maker, had
payments to make he might instruct his creditor, Mr. Green, to draw a bill on him, as follows:4


         10                                                           Belfast 29th Octo: 1794
         Ten days after Sight pay Mr. Tho Green or order ten pounds Sterl value in Accot which
                                          s

         place to Accot without further advice.
         To Mr. Peter Stubs                                                    from Thos. Lyle
                 Warrington                                                    Accepted
                                                                               P. Stub Nov. 6th


In this example, Thomas Lyle was the drawer (lender), Peter Stubs the drawee (borrower) and Thomas
Green the payee.5 After Stubs had written his name on the face of the bill, he became the acceptor, legally
liable for payment. On the back of the bill is Green's signature. If Green then sent the bill to pay a debt,
that receiver could also indorse it to pay his own debt, and so on. The important point about the example
is that it was Stubs who initiated the bill, in order to make payment to a creditor.6 Also, the layout of the

  This bill bore the imprint of a stamp duty of three pence (about which more below).

  The sample of bills used here, discussed below, contains a bill drawn by Peter Stubbs of Warrington.
6
  Olivier Accominotti and Stefano Ugolini have pointed out to me that there are other interpretations of the example.
For example, it could have been that Stubs owed money to Lyle and Lyle owed money to Green. In this case, Lyle
                                                                                                                        3


names specifies the role of each party, like a modern check: the drawee\borrower is in the lower left
corner; the drawer\lender is in the lower right corner.

Bills functioned as a medium of exchange via indorsement. The key feature of a bill was that all parties to
a bill were liable (including all indorsers). Tournay (1851), p. 40-41: "The Indorsee or holder of a bill
transferable by indorsement, is entitled to look to the acceptor for payment, and in case of non-payment
by him when presented, then to the drawer and the last and all intermediate indorsers, or parties whose
names are on the bill; the last indorser or any intermediate indorser, after payment as holder, is entitled
to look to the acceptor and drawer, and all his preceding indorsers, to refund him; the drawer being
entitled to look to the acceptor for payment. In the case of a note, the maker stands, as has been already
observed, in the position of the acceptor."7

This joint liability rule meant that the receiver of a bill in payment needed to know the identity of the
party indorsing the bill and believe that this person was substantive. As well, knowledge of the identities
of those other indorsers in the chain would further make the bill credible. So, as Ashton (1945) observed:
". . . since each successive holder indorsed it, the more it circulated the greater the number of guarantors
of its ultimate payment into cash . . . What is remarkable is the high velocity (attested to by the large
number of indorsements) which its circulation attained. And what is more remarkable is the extent to
which it was used in small transactions" (p. 26).8

So, an inland bill of exchange was very different from short-term debt issued by a bank (e.g., a bank note
or check). Unlike all other forms of private money, bills of exchange depended on the two transacting
parties knowing each other in order to be information-insensitive, i.e., no more information needed to be
produced other than the identity of the indorser.9 Personal knowledge of the counterparty, essential for
a bill to be used as money, meant that there was likely a prior relationship. According to DGH the identities
of the individual indorsers should be less relevant when the bill is backed by a bank. And if the bank is
credible, as with individual indorsers, that is sufficient information. In that case, no party produces private
information about the bank and the bill is accepted without questions. Thus, DGH argues that this bank
debt-backed money is more liquid (here in the sense of more indorsements). This proposition is tested
below.

Inland bills were widespread in the industrial north of England. They circulated in ". . . all of Lancashire, of
the West Riding, of Yorkshire, and a large portion of the other great manufacturing districts in the heart
of England" (Fullarton (1845, p. 39)). The "other great manufacturing districts" include, in particular,
Suffolk and Staffordshire, the counties that were homes to the production of iron and steel (see, e.g.,
Ashton (1924) and Birch (1967)). Cotton was produced in Lancashire, where new machinery and

draws a bill on Stubbs which he can sell via indorsement in order to repay Green. And there are other interpretations
of the events as well.
7
  Williams v. Field (1694), 3 Salk. 68 established the right of the last indorser to sue any of the previous indorsers and
also the issuer.

  Wicksell (1936): "While every expansion of simple credit is necess arily bound up with increasing risk, the security
of a bill as a commercial instrument increases with the number of indorsements it carries and consequently with the
number of money payments that it has provided the means of obviating" (p. 6 3).

  Though, note that with a check both the identity of the bank and check writer are relevant.

centralized production were first used (see Baines (1835), Chapman (1904), and Wadsworth and Mann
(1968)). Cotton was the first major industry to use power-driven machinery on a factory scale. Even in
the mid-18th century, the word "factory" meant a cotton-spinning plant (Cottrell (1980)). Bills were used
in these counties. Burgess (1826):

         In the manufacturing districts of Yorkshire and Lancashire, no man, generally speaking,
         thinks of paying for any commodity above the value of ten pounds, otherwise than in a
         bill after date. This practice is now very general throughout the northern and midland
         counties, and is increasing in other parts . . . . A bill for £100 payable after date, which to-
         day is paid at Folkingham for wool, to-morrow at Melton for horned cattle, the next at
         Leicester for sheep, and the succeeding day at Oundle for bark, is as much a part of the
         circulating medium, representing the transfer of commodities from hand to hand, as a
         bank-note for £100." (p. 19-20).10

This economic growth in England's north did not involve banks and the medium of exchange was not bank
notes or checks. An Act of Parliament in 1708 restricted banks to be limited to no more than six partners.
So, country banks were small.11 Not only small, they frequently failed, and generally were not viewed as
credibly safe. Instead, inland bills of exchange were used. Thornton (1802) writes "Liverpool and
Manchester effect the whole of their larger mercantile payments not by country bank notes, of which
none are issued by the banks, but by bills at one or two months due . . . " (p. 44-45, footnote). And, in a
renowned article T.S. Ashton (1945) wrote that: "It is well known that in the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries bills of exchange of small denomination were commonly used in the north of
England, and especially in Lancashire, for purposes which, in other parts of the country, were served by
coin or the notes of local banks" (p. 15).12

There are several related papers on bills of exchange.13 Cuadras-Morató and Rosés (1998) consider the
use of bills as a medium of exchange during the industrialization of Catalonia, based on the archival
records of three different textile firms that cover the period 1859-1860. The bills in Catalonia transferred
via endorsement as in England. Their focus is on the determining the characteristics that made a bill
acceptable in a transaction, for example the characteristics of the counterparty. Maixé-Altés and Iglesias
(2009) study the system of inland bills of exchange in Spain, 1775-1885. Inland bills were used because
the banking system was underdeveloped. They study the integration of the inland bill market by studying
the bill exchange rates between Barcelona and five other Spanish cities. These rates reflected the relative
supply and demand at the different locations relative to Barcelona. The bills were not used as money as
in England. Santarosa (2015) studies individual bills over the period, 1780-1790, from the archives of a

   According to Google maps, Folkingham to Melton is 46 km (28.5 miles), Melton to Leicester is 27 km (16.8 miles),
Leicester to Oundle is 57 km (35 miles). So, the total distance is 130 km (81 miles).
11
   Joint stock banks were allowed in 1826. The legislation allowed banks with more than six partners, freely
transferable shares, but were required to be outside a fifty-mile radius of London. And limited liability did not come
into place until acts in 1855 with the Liability Act followed by the Joint Stock Companies Act of 1856.
12
   As evidence Ashton cites Thornton (1802), Fullarton (1845), Mill (1920), Wicksell (1936) and Von Mises (1934).
Also see Heywood (1812, p. 22). I discuss this further below.

   For the older literature see, e.g., Ashton (1945), Rogers (1995), King (2016), and Pressnell (1956).

French merchant house. These bills were used in international trade and were issued for large amounts.
The focus is on the legal underpinnings that made bills useful in trade. She shows, among other results,
that the likelihood of a bill being protested (the borrower does not pay) is decreasing in the number of
indorsers. Here I study inland bills of smaller amounts that circulated as money, as opposed to credit
instruments which traded at a discount.

Other papers study the use of English bills of exchange as credit instruments internationally include Xu
(2019) and Accominotti, Piquero, and Ugolini (2019). Xu (2019) uses bills from the Bank of England's
archives to study the long-run effects of English bank failures during the Panic of 1866 on international
trade. Accominotti, Piquero, and Ugolini (2019) study the use of bills of exchange during the first
globalization, relying on individual bills rediscounted at the Bank of England in 1906. Their focus is on
constructing and analyzing the international linkages based on these bills.

There is a literature on testing implications of DGH, but none of those papers provide direct tests, as I do
here. See Dang, Gorton, and Holmström (2019) for a survey.

Section 2 briefly provides some further necessary background on inland bills of exchange. Section 3
introduces the sample of bills to be studied. Section 4 looks at the identities and occupations of indorsers.
In Section 5 I analyze what characteristics of bills were associated with a higher velocity, i.e., more
indorsements. In particular, I compare bills where the borrower and payee were a large, well-known,
London bank to bills backed solely by the wealth of the indorsers. Section 6 concludes.

2. Background

In this section I cover the minimum background necessary to understand inland bills generally.

    A. Legal Standing

The bill of exchange was the first instrument to be recognized as negotiable by a court of Common Law in
Martin v. Bourne (1602) (2 Croke, 6.). See Richards (1927), Kerridge (1988) and Rogers (1995). The court
in Hodges v. Steward (1691), 3 Salk. 68 said: "When the bill is payable to J. S. [Steward], or order, there an
express power is given to the party to assign, and the indorsee may maintain an action"; also see Nicholson
v. Sedgwick (1698), 3 Salk. 67. The case of William v. Field (1694) established in a common law court that
the last indorsee could sue any of the previous indorsers, as well as the issuer. Rogers (1995, p. 126): "The
conception of the obligations of parties to bills that developed in the seventeenth century was of
particular significance given that bills were frequently transferred from person to person by indorsement.
The older view that the obligations in exchange contracts were based on delivery of money in exchange
transactions would have been ill-suited to the bill circulation practices . . . "

In Miller v. Race (1758) (1 Burr. 452) Judge Mansfield wrote:

        [Bills] are not goods, not securities nor documents for debts, nor are so esteemed; but
        are treated as money, as cash, in the ordinary course and transaction of business, by the
        general consent of mankind; which gives them the credit and currency of money, to all
                                                                                                                      6


         intents and purposes. They are as much money, as guineas themselves are; or any other
         current coin, that is used in common payments, as money or cash.

Joint liability was established based on conceptually thinking of each indorsement as the issuance of a
new bill. Chief Justice Holt put it (in Anon. Skin. 343), "the indorsement is a quasi-new bill, and a warranty
by the indorser, that the bill shall be paid; and the party may bring his action against any of the indorsers,
if the bill be not paid by the acceptor' ".14

Bills of exchange did not represent a security interest in any specific goods as collateral. Thornton (1802):
"In order to justify the supposition that a real bill (as it is called) represents actual property, there ought
to be some power in the bill-holder to prevent the property which the bill represents, from being turned
to other purposes than that of paying the bill in question. No such power exists; neither the man who
holds the bill, nor the man who discounts it, has any property in the specific goods for which it was given:
he as much trusts to the general ability to pay of the giver of the bill, as the holder of an fictitious bill does"
(p. 31-32).15 Thus bills were not backed by specific goods, making the wealth of the indorser the primary
source of the backing.

     B. The Widespread Use of Bills

The use of bills of exchange required that each indorser be recognized, so bills were used in densely
populated areas, i.e., industrial and manufacturing areas and not agricultural areas. Hodges (1947):

         One of the outstanding features of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain was the rapid
         increase in the population during the nineteenth century which doubled from 9 million in
         1850 to 18 millions in 1901 . . . another outstanding feature was the attractive power of
         industry, which drew the population from the countryside and concentrated it on the
         coal-fields. This process changed the whole face of the countryside, and new densely
         populated regions came into being in Lancashire, Yorkshire, the Scottish Lowlands, the
         Midlands, and parts of South Wales which before had been distinctly rural in character.
         (p. 62).

Inland bills of exchange circulated in the industrial north, the home of the iron and steel industry
(Shropshire and Staffordshire) and the cotton industry (in Lancashire and Yorkshire), the cradle of the
industrial revolution. This area is the belt of counties through the middle of England. Inland bills circulated
in counties that were the heart of the industrial revolution. See Figure 1 below. Bills were not much used
in the sparsely populated agricultural areas. Anderson (1970): "Most of the smaller local payments were
made with paper drawn by one trader upon another. In these ways the inland bill facilitated the growth

   For more background see Tournay (1851), Bayley (1826), Russell and MacLachlan (1859), Byles (1874), Jenks
(1893), Beutel (1938), Rogers (1995), Dylag (2010) and Geva (2011).
15
   Thus, the "real bills doctrine", which said bills represented "real" transactions, was essentially a norm rather than
a law. "Accommodation bills" were bills that were more explicitly not "backed"; See Rogers (1995), p. 223 ff.
                                                                                                              7


of an active internal trade in the 'coal-salt triangle' of the Mersey estuary and its hinterland, and in the
textile manufacture of Manchester and its satellites in East Lancashire" (p. 93).16

Contemporaries uniformly observed the widespread use of inland bills, e.g. Forbes (1860, p. 14), Gordon
(1836, p. 11); the court in Giles v. Perkins 103 E.R. 441 (1807) noted that: " . . . the circulation of the town
of Lancaster and the county was conducted in a great measure by bills . . . paid in, and afterwards paid
away by the bankers . . ". Newmarch (1851): "The comparatively small bills of exchange for sums ranging
from 10 to 30, and higher sums, which were so numerous in Lancashire and Yorkshire during the early
part of the present century, had nothing in common with their somewhat discreditable predecessors.
These bills were in great favour among the small manufacturers, and among dealers in wool, cattle, and
corn. They were proverbial for their dirty appearance, the profusion of their indorsements, and for the
much more valuable quality of being very rarely unpaid" (p. 154).

Newmarch (1857) divides inland bills into three groups: (1) "Small Bills drawn upon smaller Retailers, and
drawn by Retailers upon Consumers"; (2) "Medium Bills drawn by Wholesalers and Manufacturers upon
Retailers and other Intermediate Dealers"; (3) "Large Bills drawn by Importers on Manufacturers and
Wholesalers, and by Manufacturers and Wholesalers on Exporters" (p. 587). Large denomination bills did
not circulate as money, although they were transferred via indorsement, particularly in the London
discount market. Cameron (1967, p. 51): "Many bills, perhaps most, performed no monetary function at
all, others did so only once or twice in the course of their existence. Still others, however, especially the
small bills characteristic of Lancashire, circulated from merchant to merchant with dozens, even scores,
of indorsements" (p. 51). In Newmarch's categorization, the first and second categories were the bills
likely to function as money, but the line between "money" and "credit" is not clear-cut.17

Further, we do not know what denominations correspond to "small" and "medium". John Moss, in
testimony before the House of Commons in 1836:

        You have an opportunity of seeing every description of bill of exchange that is in ordinary
        use in Lancashire; what is the lowest amount generally which you discount, or which
        comes into your hands?--Very few under 20 Do you ever see any under 10? ­Very
        seldom, perhaps one in a week (p. 230).18

How many indorsements were there typically? Lewis Loyd, Esq. in 1826, who was a banker in London and
Manchester, testified that there were bills that had over 120 indorsements.19 In his testimony before the
House of Lords, Loyd testified as follows:

        Have you not seen bills of exchange . . . for the value of 10, with fifty or sixty names upon
        them?

        Yes, with twice that number; I have seen slips of paper attached to a bill as long as a sheet
        of paper could go, and when that was filled another attached to that.20

Such contemporary accounts then have been repeated in the secondary literature. For example, Mill
(1920): "Many bills, both domestic and foreign, are at last presented for payment quite covered with
indorsements, each of which represents either a fresh discounting, or a pecuniary transaction in which
the bill has performed the functions of money. Within the present generation, the circulating medium of
Lancashire, for sums above five pounds, was almost entirely composed of such bills" (emphasis added; p.
519). Lancaster and nearby areas were concentrated in bills. John Gladstone, a businessman from
Liverpool testified in 1826 that " . . . bills of exchange, which from the nature of our business, and the

   Pressnell (1969) in a review of Cameron (1967) wrote: "Cameron thus meets the familiar dilemma that a precise
line between `money' and `credit' may be useless, whilst a useful line may be imprecise" (p. 129).

manner in which it is conducted, form by far the greater part of the circulating medium, all that is required
for minor purposes consists entirely of old, or Bank of England notes" (p.217).21

Newmarch (1851) set out to estimate the amount of bills of exchange circulating in England, for the years
1828-1847. Newmarch was not the first. Heywood (1812) also produced rough estimates; see Pressnell
(1969), p. 171, on Heywood's estimates. Leatham (1840) made more careful estimates; see Pressnell, p.
172. Estimates of both Heywood and Leatham were based on stamp duties.22 Also, there were estimates
by Vansittart, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Hansard, April 9, 1818, col, 1243; also by Johnstone (1811).
Cameron (1967): "[Chancellor of the Exchequer Nicholas] Vansittart] estimated the average daily
circulation of bills in 1793 at 200 million, and Benjamin Heywood, a Liverpool banker, accepted the figure
as does Pressnell, at least as a rough order of magnitude [see Pressnell (1956, p. 171)]. It seems utterly
fantastic, however, that the daily circulation of bills should equal or surpass the annual national income"
(p. 44). Newmarch's (1851) estimates which are the most extensive, and widely accepted, are discussed
below and form part of the basis for Table 1, which shows the components of the English money supply
in this period.

`Other means of payment' rather than in `Total money'". Cameron (1967) does not list "bills" but says
"other". However, the source he gives is Newmarch (1851).

Most instructive is the line with bills as a percentage of the means of payment, for different years. Until
1831 half of the money supply is bills of exchange and thereafter it declines to 40 percent. Cameron
(1967): "Although the use of bills as currency probably declined somewhat with the developments of
checking facilities in the 1830's and 1840's, they still constituted an important part of the total means of
payment at least as late as the 1850's" (p. 50).23 Note, however, that Cameron (1967), using Newmarch's
(1851) numbers may have included bills that were purely credit instruments, rather than solely bills that
circulated as a currency. Again, there is no sure way to distinguish.

       C. The Use of Bills in Transactions24

In the Introduction we saw an example of a bill involving Peter Stubbs. There were many ways in which a
bill of exchange could be used. And we have no data on which ways were typical or more often used.
Here are some more examples to illustrate the flexibility of bill usage.

Suppose a country manufacturer buys inputs from someone other than the factor to whom the
manufacturer's output will be sold. To pay for the purchase of the inputs, the manufacturer could draw
a bill on his factor payable to the supplier of the inputs. In effect, the factor is lending to the manufacturer
to pay the supplier. The factor can repay from the proceeds of selling the manufacturer's goods in the
future. It could be that the manufacturer has already delivered the goods to the factor who has, in fact,
sold them. If the bill was drawn, accepted, and paid after the factor sold the goods and collected the
proceeds, then the transaction is a funds transfer.

Such funds transfers were extensive. A system of correspondent London banks, called the London Agency
System, served to use bills to transfer funds from capital surplus regions to capital deficit regions. Black
(1996): " . . . in regions of capital deficit, bills would be sent to the bank's London agent or . . . to the bill
brokers for re-discount. Brokers in the London market could place bills with those having surplus funds
for investment . . . bill brokers acted mainly as agents, linking those who had bills to discount with those
holding surplus funds seeking short-term investment" (p. 118). Also, see Pressnell (1956, p. 75 ff.).

Here's another example that will be relevant later. The manufacturer sells good to the factor now, or for
future delivery. The factor has a relationship with a bank. So, the factor can ask the manufacturer to draw
a bill on the bank, say with maturity three months. The manufacturer can sell the bill to another party,
who at maturity presents it to the bank. Perhaps contemporaneously the factor deposits the bill amount
at the bank. Here, the bank is liable for repayment and, in effect, guarantees the factor's credit. In this
example, the factor's name does not appear on the bill.

Suppose the factor wants to buy goods from the manufacturer but does not have the cash. He can draw
a bill on his bank, which he can then sell to another party to obtain the cash. This third party presents the


23
     There is some dispute about why inland bills declined; see Nishimura (2010).
24
     I am indebted to Olivier Accominotti and Stefano Ugolini for clarifying these examples.
                                                                                                               12


bill to the bank at maturity, by which time factor, having sold the goods, repays the bank. The
manufacturer's name does not appear on the bill.

     D. As Money, Did Bills Trade at Par?

This is a difficult question to answer. As a credit instrument for a large amount of money, the bill would
trade at a discount in the London market. This discount market was highly developed and extensive; see
King (2016).

But what about smaller denomination bills that circulated as money? In pre-Civil War America, private
bank notes circulated at discounts some distance from the issuing banks.25 Private bank notes were
demand instruments which were the liabilities of individual banks and the discounts reflected risk factors
(see Gorton (1996, 1999)). There are two issues: discounting for the time value of money, because bills
had a maturity, and discounting for default risk. Larger denomination bills were discounted for the time
value of money. It is not clear that this was true when used as money. Thornton (1802), p. 42:

        Bills, it is true, generally pass among traders in the country without there being any
        calculation or regular allowance of discount; the reason of which circumstance is, that
        there is a generally understood period of time for which those bills may have to run,
        which, according to the custom of traders, are accepted as current payment. If any bill
        given in payment has a longer time than usual to run he who receives it is considered as
        so far favouring the person from whom he takes it; and the favoured person, has to
        compensate for this advantage, not, perhaps, by a recompence of the same kind
        accurately calculated, but in the general adjustment of the pecuniary affairs of the two
        parties. (Emphasis added.)

Here it may be that the relevant phrase is "traders in the country", as opposed to in London. This
distinction between London at the country appears to have been recognized by the courts. In Giles v.
Perkins 103 E.R. 477 the court wrote:

        Bankers in London, upon the receipt of undue bills from a customer, do not carry the
        amount directly to his credit, but enter them short, as it is called; that is, note down the
        receipt of the bills in his account, with the amount, and the time when due, in a previous
        (or inner) column of the same page; which sums when received are carried forward into
        the usual cash column.

        But in the country, if the bills have not long to run, they enter them in a gross sum with
        cash to the credit of the customer, giving him either cash or liberty to draw. Such bills are
        therefore regarded by country banks as their property.26



25
   In the U.S. pre-Civil War period private bank notes were discounted from par when they circulated away from the
issuing bank. Roughly 1500 bank notes of different banks circulated, depending on the year. Consequently, there
was a well-developed market for bank notes with fluctuating discounts. See Gorton (1996, 1999).
26
   Also quoted by Horsefield (1952, p. 316).
                                                                                                                  13


But, Thornton (1802) is not definitive on the question. In fact, just before and after the paragraph quoted
above, Thornton suggests that bills were discounted.27 But, again, his comments are clouded by the murky
line between a credit instrument and money.

More important, however, is the question of whether default risk was priced, as in the U.S. pre-Civil War
private bank note markets. It seems that this was not the case. Contemporary observers do not mention
this and there were no discounts listed in newspapers, other than the (time value of money) discount rate
on credit instrument bills, typically of larger amounts, trading in London. Further, the risk that would need
to be priced concerned the wealth of each individual indorser, and the probability of all the parties
defaulting jointly. This is very different than pricing the risk of a single bank defaulting. There could not
possibly be discounts published for each combination of parties to a bill. So, it seems that there was no
pricing of default risk, consistent with information-insensitivity. No discounting for default risk suggests
that parties to these bills were viewed as sufficiently wealth to make the bills safe.28

     E. Banks and Bank Notes

Why were bills of exchange used as a hand-to-hand currency rather than bank notes? Banks in England
during this period were small partnerships (limited to six partners) and their notes circulated in a limited
area near the bank (Ashton (1961)). Unknown Author (1821): "The immense extent of mercantile bills of
exchange circulating in England, appears to be connected with the restriction on provincial Bank
partnerships . . . [which] . . . have precluded the use of local Bank notes . . ." (p. 46; emphasis in original).29
The restriction to six partners meant that banks were small and were prone to fail. Horsefield (1952): In
the late 1700s: " . . . private bankers . . . frequently went bankrupt" (p. 309). Norwood (1858) documents
that British banks generally were prone to become bankrupt.

This was due largely to the frequency of banking panics. James (2012, p. 290): "Panics were frequent and
their extent widespread in late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century England involving numerous bank
failures. Even with his rather conservative assessments of `failure', Pressnell (1956, p. 443) found in
England between 1750 and 1830 at least 343 self-declared country `bankers' failed ­ 334 of them between
1790 and 1826." James (2012, p. 291): "Financial crises occurred with remarkable frequency in eighteenth-
century England." T. S. Ashton (1959) identified thirteen ­ in 1701, 1710, 1715, 1720, 1726, 1745, 1761,
1763, 1772, 1778, 1788, 1793, and 1797. In the first quarter of the nineteenth century we might add
three more ­ 1810/11, 1815, 1825 (or perhaps five, counting 1803 and 1819). But Hoppit (1986, pp. 51,
56) argues that crises before 1770 in both their origins and effects were restricted to the areas of public
credit and the national debt. In the crisis of 1825, there was a widespread run on the banks in the North.
Subsequently two attempts to introduce notes into Lancashire failed (Pressnell (1956, p. 177).




27
   This was pointed out to me by Olivier Accominotti and Stefano Ugolini.
28
   Accominotti and Ugolini report (in a private communication) that there is evidence that in the London market fills
were sometimes referred to as "first class bills" or "the best bills", holding maturity constant. So, there seems to
have been some discrimination in the London market.

Cameron (1967): "Lancastrians had had several unhappy experiences with bank failures . . . notably in the
crisis of 1788, and these produced lasting effect. The result was that Lancashire was the only country that
had no significant local note circulation of its own" (p. 26). During the period 1750-1830, at least 343
`bankers' (firms describing themselves as such) failed (Pressnell (1956, p. 443). In Lancashire there was a
particular aversion to banks (Hughes (1906), p.37). Pressnell (1956): "The experience of Lancashire with
private banks during the crisis of 1788 encouraged neither the replacement nor even the supplementation
of the bill of exchange by privately issued notes" (p. 174). " . . . created a permanent suspicion of bank -
notes" (p. 174). "The memory of 1788 lived long with the business community of Lancashire" (p. 174). In
1807 following the failure of many banks in Yorkshire, an editorial in the Liverpool Advertiser noted: "We
have ever been of opinion (and our opinion is justified by daily experience) that the circulation of
provincial bankers' paper is highly injurious to the public interest . . . To the honour of Lancashire be it
known, not a single note is issued by any banking house in the county" (quoted by Hughes (1906, p. 38)).

It was not that bank notes were simply not used in Lancashire and surrounding areas. They were actively
opposed. John Gladstone, a merchant from Liverpool, testified before the House of Commons that:

        In fact, there is no local paper issued?

        None that I am acquainted with, in our part of Lancashire: on the borders of the county
        adjoin Yorkshire, there are some country banks that issue promissory notes, but I believe
        not on a large scale.

        Were those notes so issued, countenanced or discouraged by the leading manufacturers
        and merchants of Lancashire?

        Decidedly discouraged, so much so, that I recollect, about twelve months ago, a meeting
        of the manufacturers in Preston [the capital of Lancashire County] was called, for the
        purpose of collecting and sending away all the notes of that description that had go into
        circulation. (p. 217)30


Bank of England bills were only infrequently used in commercial dealings outside London; see Burgess
(1826), p. 27.

3. The Sample of Bills

A sample of bills was collected from the archives of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Corp., Cheshire
Archives, Shropshire Archives, Barclays Archives, Lancashire Archives, Lloyd's Bank Archives (which
includes the Bank of Scotland archives) and the Royal Bank of Scotland archives.31 The bank archives each
cover other banks because these banks are the products of many mergers over the last several centuries.
Barclays, for example, is the product of 250 mergers, amalgamations, or purchases.32 Photographs of the

front and back of each bill were taken and, as discussed below, the indorsements on the back were
counted and analyzed.

What period should be covered to study inland bills of exchange? Pressnell (1956) in his study of English
country banking focuses on the period 1760-1830, although these are "boundaries of convenience rather
than precision" (p. 2). Also, Cameron (1967) in his study of the role of banking's role in industrialization
says: " . . .1750 marks the effective beginning of `country banking' . . . At the other end 1844 is a clear
watershed in English financial history" (p. 15).33 For the sample here, inquiries were made at a number of
archives as to inland bills from 1750-1840. In the sample, discussed below, the earliest bill is 1762 and
the latest is 1850.

     A. Description and Summary of the Sample of Bills

The sample period is 1762-1850. The sample size is 482. The sample can be divided into three groups, as
explained in more detail below. In two groups the bills were accepted by banks, Glyn Mills and Barclays.
For these two groups indorsers risked their own wealth, but there was a bank at the end of the chain. The
remaining group is the complement of the other two.

Table 2 below provides a description of the sample of the full sample and the sample minus bank-backed
bills, called (All Other). For the full sample, the median maturity is three months and the median amount
from Table 2 is £100. This is a very high amount, well out of the range of laborers, for example.34 So, when
inland bills are described as "a hand-to-hand" medium of exchange, that must refer to bills of smaller
amounts. Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics for the bills accepted by the Glyn Mills bank and those
accepted by Barclays Bank. (The panel labeled "All Other" shows that the non-bank-backed bills look like.)

   The Bank Charter Act of 1844 (sometimes called Peel's Banking Act because it was passed under the government
of Robert Peel) restricted the powers of English banks and gave the Bank of England exclusive note-issuing privileges.

   100 in 1825 would correspond to at least 8,000 in today's pounds or about $10,000. See "Five Ways to

Glyn Mills and Barclays bills are on average for smaller amounts and shorter maturities than the other
bills: Barclays: 34 pounds and 1.3 months; Glyn Mills: 51 pounds and 1.67 months; All Other: 307 pounds
and 3.5 months. These significant differences foreshadow what will be found below. To preview what I
expect the regression results to show, here are average signatures in the sample: 4.88 Glyn Mills; 1.52
Barclays; 2.68 All Other. These three groups seem very different, as explained below.

The median numbers of signatures seems low compared to the descriptions cited above. It could be, for
example, that bills with many signatures were less likely to survive because of the wear and tear. But,
further, it is not easy to count the number of indorsements. The photograph below shows an extreme
example. The first image is the front of the bill and the second image is the back of the bill, with the
indorsements. How many indorsements are there on this bill? Signatures were counted only if they were
readable. But on many bills there appear to have been other signatures, but which have faded or worn
away, These could not be counted. Most bills are not so complicated as this example, still the number of
signatures is to some extent ambiguous. Later, we will study the identities of the indorsers in which case
the exact name must be determined.
                                                                                                         20




Figure 2 below shows the distribution of bills by decade and source (e.g., RBS archives) and shows bills for
the three groups. Figure 3 shows the distribution of bills by maturity. Very few bills had a maturity longer
than four months. The maturity distribution is not totally concentrated in bills with a three-month
maturity, as suggested by some sources. Burgess (1826): " . . . except in Lancashire, where the established
practice amongst bankers and traders is, to draw bills at three months; the deviation from which is the
exception to the rule. And in consequence, a bill at three months is considered in Lancashire and part of
Yorkshire, which, as regards bills, is almost half the kingdom, to be a money payment" (p. 24).

Figure 4 shows the distribution of bills by amount. The distribution shows few bills in either the low end
of the distribution or the high end of the distribution. And, as discussed later, the bill amounts even at
the low end are for the most part too high to be used as payment of wages to workmen.

Note that bills accepted by Glyn Mills and Barclays are almost all for maturities less than two months and
for amounts almost all under £100. For Glyn Mills the modal category is between 5 and 20 pounds.

John Gladstone, a businessman from Liverpool, in response to a question about the lowest denomination
of bills that generally circulate testified in 1826 that:35

                        We have [bills] of all denominations: The manufacturers are . . . in the habit of deriving
                        their supplies of banknotes and gold for the payment of their people from shopkeepers,
                        and they draw bills according to the amount that may be convenient for them on their
                        agents in London. Tradesmen of other descriptions are also in the practice of drawing
                        bills for their payments as may suit their convenience, and in consequence we have a
                        considerable amount of small bills; I call them small from 10£ up to 50£; between these
                        sums we have a considerable circulation in country, which pass from hand to hand so fully
                        indorsed that before maturity it is hardly possible to add another name. (p. 222)




35
     In the sample of bills, discussed below, there is a bill indorsed by "John Gladstone".
                                                                                                            24


     B. Comparison to Newmarch's Sample

An important question is the extent to which the sample here is representative. To address this, at least
in part, we can compare the sample here to that of Newmarch (1851). Newmarch (1851) obtained a
sample of 4,367 bills (3,533 of which were inland bills) drawn for a total sum of 1,216,884. This sample
was obtained in 1848 from five "very eminent firms in the City, distinguished for the extent of their
businesses as bankers and as bill-brokers" (p. 147).

Newmarch's (1851) goal was to estimate the amount of bills of exchange circulating in England, for the
years 1828-1847. As Newmarch explained in Appendix XI of Tooke and Newmarch (1857) (Vol. 6): "It was
necessary to ascertain three elements [to estimate the amount of bills of exchange in circulation] . . . first,
the number of bills actually created in each year; second, the Average Sum represented by, or expressed
by, each Bill; and third, the Average Usance [maturity] or Date at which each Bill was drawn" (p. 584). For
the first requirement Newmarch used the accounts from the Stamp Office. For the second and third he
used the sample of 4,367 bills (amounting to a total of 1,218,884) which he inspected.36 Newmarch's
sample covers 1828-1847. Table A2 in the appendix gives stamp taxes on inland bills based on size of the
bill, the basis for Newmarch's first step.

Newmarch (1851), "The scale of duties is adjusted under guidance of a twofold principle; first, the amount
of duty has reference to the amount of the bill; and, secondly, it has reference to the usance [maturity] of
the bill" (p. 145, emphasis in original).37 Newmarch (1851): "Now there is every reason to believe that
scarcely any tax in this country suffers from so few evasions as the stamp duty on bills of exchange. It
may not be the direct interest of the drawer in all cases that the instrument shall be written upon paper
impressed with the full and accurate amount of duty; but there are at least three other parties interested
in the transaction, to whom it is of the utmost possible moment that the requirements of the law be
fulfilled. These parties are the acceptor, the indorsers, and the payee; and it is pretty certain that the
vigilance of parties concerned in these capacities does most effectually secure full compliance with the
Act of Parliament" (p. 145).

Table 2 shows a comparison of the two samples by tax duty. Figure 2 and the regression results beneath
the figure show the comparison.




36
   In Appendix XI of Tooke and Newmarch (1857), Newmarch expanded the sample to 12,687 bills (to the sum of
5,254,100). He examines the period 1830-1853. "I may state, in general terms, that the extensive collection of
data obtained in 1854, did not differ very materially in its resu lts from the data obtained in 1849" (p. 587).

The sample here seems similar to Newmarch's much larger sample. But, since Newmarch says nothing
about the number of indorsements, it is not clear the sample studied here is like Newmarch's sample in
that respect.

   C. Where Did the Sample Bills Come From?

Above I distinguished between bank-backed bills and non-bank-backed bills. Some bills came from non-
bank archives: Cheshire Archives, Shropshire Archives, and Lancashire Archives, but most came from bank
archives. Nevertheless, and this is the point, the bills from bank archives are usually not bank-backed.
The bills of exchange in the bank collections were either sent to the archive after being found amongst
                                                                                                                27


the paperwork of branches found when moving buildings, or they were kept by a member of staff because
they were known to have historical interest. One archivist reported (to me) that: "A large proportion of
the archive was built up in this way. The bank didn't have a real archive until well into the twentieth
century, so items from before this time have generally survived because an individual decided to keep
them somewhere safe because they were recognised as having some historical value."

4. Drawers, Drawees and Indorsers

An agent's willingness to receive a bill from another agent who is endorsing it depended on the receiver
of the bill knowing the identity and credibility of the indorser, especially if none of the prior indorsers
were known to the receiving agent. To transact at par, without information production, the identity of an
indorser had to have been enough information.38 This would occur if the parties regularly transacted
because of a business relationship. Contemporaries noted this, for example, Thornton (1802): "[The bill]
will have circulated in consequence chiefly of the confidence placed by each receiver of it in the last
indorser, his own correspondent in trade. . . " (p. 32). And, King (1916): "In districts where the parties
were known . . . the bills passed from hand to hand with the freedom of currency. Indeed, they were
currency. . . " (p. 31; emphasis in original). Who used these bills such that their identities were mutually
known?

Laborers and ordinary workmen were not involved in the use of bills. Ashton (1945): "At a time when
wage-earning labour was increasing rapidly the provision of the means of payment was one of the most
exacting tasks confronting the employers. Some, like the ironmasters of Furness, had to spend time riding
far afield in search of coin; others turned to substitutes like traders' tokens, shop-notes and direct
payment in goods." What coin was available was used for the payment of wages (Ashton (1945), p. 26
and Pressnell (1956, p. 19)). Indeed, Ashton (1961, p. 105), discussing the activities of Peter Stubs, a file-
maker with numerous workmen, notes that "Generally bills were drawn only on persons of substance--
though in July, 1805, there is reference to one drawn on a person who was only a workman" (p. 26).39 And
Burgess (1826) writes that "Bills, payable after date, circulate amongst the masters of all persons engaged
in agriculture, mines, manufacturers, and commerce. They are scarcely used at all in payment for labour"
(p. 83).

Laborers of all sorts were paid in coin or tokens partly because the amounts were smaller than
transactions among merchants and tradesman. Anderson (1970): " . . in Lancashire [the tokens] were
almost entirely of local issue, never circulating very far" (p. 87). Also, laborers were less likely to be
credible as indorsers. Finally, the literacy rates in Lancashire by occupation show that many literacy rates
below fifty percent (see Sanderson (1972), p. 90). The literacy rate for the Lancashire area shows a labor



38
   Of course, it could have happened that an agent refused to accept the bill because the prospective indorser was
not viewed as a substantial person. Of course, these events are not observed.
39
   Ashton (1968, p. 80) notes that there was a shortage of coin of the appropriate denomination. Gold guineas and
half guineas were too high value. Very little silver came into England. "The dearth o f coin in small denominations
was a serious matter for manufacturers with wages to pay. Many spend days riding from place to place in search of
shillings" (Ashton (1968), p. 80).
                                                                                                           28


force that was less than forty percent literate (Sanderson (1972, p. 85). Illiteracy would make it difficult
to transaction with bills. Illiteracy would have made it difficult to use bills of exchange.

There were, thus, two monetary systems, one using coin to pay wages, and the other using inland bills to
transact among merchants and tradesman. Below I examine what we can say about the identities of
parties in the second system. But I will not be able to say anything about the relationships between two
parties.

Pearson and Richardson (2001) studied business networks in the industrial revolution: "The underlying
importance of shared values helps explain, for instance, why in the early nineteenth century Manchester
and Leeds, despite important religious and political divisions within the middle class, elites generally acted
in business matters as tight known oligarchies with a common and largely pragmatic political economy . .
." (p. 673). In 1801 Manchester and Liverpool had a population of about 80,000 and Leeds had a
population of 124,000 in 1831. In Leeds about 15 percent of the residents were middle-class and "they
were led by a mercantile and professional elite of perhaps numbering several hundred" (p. 662). The
participants in the use of inland bills likely came from this middle class and elite group, with the middle-
class comprising merchants, artisans, and tradesmen.

An example comes from Willan (1970) who studied the activities of Abraham Dent's business in the late
18th century. Dent was a shopkeeper, brewer, hosier, and wine and spirit merchant. All of these activities
involved inland bills of exchange. Dent used bills to pay suppliers of goods and received bills in payment
for goods and for settling accounts. Willan reports that Dent's customers lived nearby, but there were
some that were more distant. These "are . . . difficult to explain; their custom must have arisen from
some personal or trade relationship with the Dents" (p. 20). Willan (1970) does not mention how Dent
paid his employees. Ashton (1961) similarly discusses how Peter Stubs, the file maker from Warrington,
used inland bills to conduct his business with fellow tradesmen and merchants, but paid employees in
coin.

What can we say about the indorsers in the sample here? All in all, we ended up with 482 bills that include
a total of 1,595 signatures. (By "signatures", I mean only indorsers, not payees.) However, we only have
232 usable names because (1) many signatures were not legible, and (2) some people signed more than
one bill. The drawees tend to have bills drawn on London, i.e., the bill be paid in London by a bank out of
the borrower's account. The reason that there are not more of our sample of drawees in London is that
many (137) of the remaining bills were drawn on John Adams & Son (in Selby). There is a "John Adams"
in the Census records who was a timber and iron dealer in Selby, Yorkshire. But he was unmarried (not
widowed) so this John Adams probably was one of the sons. Based on the age of the son, if seems that
the John Adams in earlier Census records was a flax merchant in Selby, Yorkshire.

The drawers, drawees, and payees were catalogued following the layout of a modern check: drawer in
the lower right, drawee (bank) in the lower left, and payee after the words "pay to the order of". The
locations of the drawees (borrowers) correspond to the following distribution:

153 Glyn Mills Hallifax
137 John Adams and Sons (Selby, flax merchant)
                                                                                                               29


29 Barclays
22 John Moss and Company (Haslingden, unknown occupation)
341 Subtotal
141 Less than 10 bills or illegible
482 Total Sample


The locations of the drawers (lenders) are outside London, such as Market Drayton (Shropshire),
Manchester (Lancashire), and Hull (East Yorkshire).

Establishing the identities of indorsers is difficult. A large variety of sources were consulted (see the
Appendix) to try to determine the identities of the indorsers. The process is exceedingly labor-intensive
so not all names were investigated. About the identities of the borrowers and lenders, 39 names were
investigated, of which 28 good matches were made, 8 were ambiguous, and in three cases no information
was found. Regarding the identities of indorsers, 103 were investigated, of which there were 55 good
matches, 90 were ambiguous, and there was no information found in 18 cases. "Ambiguous" usually
means that there was more than one person with that name, or the age of the person was inconsistent
with the date on the bill, in other words with borrowing or lending, when the agents were too young or
too old.

In the Appendix the identities of the 28 matches for the borrowers and lenders are listed. The table shows
that the occupations of borrowers and lenders were merchants (e.g., pig dealer, timber merchant) and
artisans (e.g., currier, spinner). The occupations are consistent with Willan's (1970) description of
Abraham Dent's business activities and Ashton's (1961) description of Peter Stubs' business activities. The
occupations thus appear to be credible individuals, individuals with known businesses. Because of these
occupations, it is quite possible that the parties were doing repeated business with a recognized
counterparty.

We turn now to investigating indorsement chains. Chains of indorsers meant that the bills "circulated
because of the confidence each person had, not only in the person on whom it was drawn, but also in the
person who had drawn it, and in the person from whom he had received it and whose indorsement it
bore" (Ashton (1961), p. 103). But it is not clear that a receiver of a bill needed to know the identities of
the entire prior chain of indorsers, rather than just the person in front of him signing the bill.

Table 3 shows examples of indorsement chains where it was possible to identify indorsers. The indorsers
listed are sequences of consecutive indorsers where information could be found. A chain in the table does
not necessarily start with the first indorser, followed by the second indorser, etc. Further, since the table
contains snippets of chains, the last indorser listed is not necessarily the last for that bill. Rather, it is the
last signature that could be identified in that chain. The chains shown are in sequence, however. The
longest chain shown has four indorsers. The table lists the role of each party, their occupation, location,
and the distance from the last indorser (based information found in the sources listed in the Appendix).
Payees are not part of the chains in Table 3. Distances are from Google maps.
                                                                                                         30


Note the following: (1) the amounts of the bills are typically small, less than £100 and the amounts are
most likely a multiple of ten; (2) the occupations of indorsers are those of merchants and artisans; (3) the
distances between the first two or three indorsers varies from 0 miles to over 100 miles, but usually the
long distances are to accounts often in London. This may mean that the borrower is honoring the debt
by instructing his London banker to pay off the bill. Omitting the cases where the party in the chain is a
bank, we see examples where two parties in the chain were zero miles apart, so it was an indorser in the
neighborhood.

Other than the occupations of parties to a transaction and the distances between them, I have found no
other evidence about relationships. In the table, note that cases [2], [6], and [7] are basically the same
pattern, just with different payees. Vinning and Ames were both banks.40 Down Thornton was a London
banker.

In case [1], the bill was drawn by Richard Spearman of Shropshire & Staffordshire Bank (S&S) on Glyn Mills
and was payable to John Bayley. After Bayley, 10 people or firms subsequently signed the
back. Mallinson, Rhodes Briggs (a bank), and Jones Loyd were the 8th, 9th, and 10th of the 10 subsequent
endorsers after Bayley. Rhodes Briggs was a bank in Halifax Yorkshire.41 Jones Loyd were also bankers.

In case [2], the bill was drawn by Richard Spearman of S&S on Glyn Mills and was payable to Marshall
Hutton & Co. After Marshall Hutton, 7 signed the back. Vinning, Down Thornton, and Ames were the 4th,
5th, and 6th of the 7 subsequent endorsers after Marshall Hutton (the last was not legible). Down
Thornton was a bank in London. Jones Loyd were also bankers.42 Ames & Co. is listed as the London
correspondent for numerous country banks in The Small Edition of the Post Office London Directory, 1843.

Case [6]: This bill was drawn by Richard Spearman of S&S upon Glyn Mills and was payable to Thomas
Whitfield. After Whitfield, four signed the back. Vinning, Down Thornton, and Ames were the 1st, 2nd,
and 3rd of the 4 subsequent endorsers after Whitfield (the last was not legible). Down Thornton and
Ames are as above.

Finally, case [7]: This bill was drawn by Richard Spearman of S&S upon Glyn Mills and was payable to
George Bradbury. After Bradbury, 4 signed the back. Vinning, Down Thornton, and Ames were the 1st,
2nd, and 3rd of the 4 subsequent endorsers after Bradbury (the last was not legible). Down Thornton and
Ames are as above.

Table 3 lists the location of some banks as London. But the bill might be related to another location. The
location of banks is tricky because London banks had agents or correspondents in other parts of the
country who could have acted on behalf of the London bank. Country banks could also have a London
office (see Black (1996)). Pressnell (1956): "The association between country and London banking was,
however, much closer than is conveyed by the terms `correspondent' and `agent'. A number of country

testified before the Committee of Secrecy of the House of Commons in 1797. 43

           Henry Thornton, Esquire, a Member of the House, and a Banker of London; called in, and
           Examined.

           Q. Is your House connected with any Country Banks?

           A. It is; with several.

           Q. Can you specify the places where those Banks are situated?

           A. Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Bristol, Exeter, Scarborough, Litchfield, Stamford,
           Tiverton, Totness, Carlisle. Stockton, Winchester, and a few others, which I do not at
           present recollect.

5. Backing for the Private Money: Bank Loans vs. Personal Wealth

In this section I turn to analyzing the determinants of bill velocity, that is what determines the number of
times a bill changes hands, as measured by indorsements? Ceteris paribus, more indorsements
(signatures) should be associated with longer maturities, smaller amounts, and amounts in round
numbers (multiples of 10). The implicit assumption here is that the identities of the indorsers were enough
information for counterparties to have been willing to receive the bill in payment. We do not observe
bills that were refused. So, conditional on the bill being used in transactions, the above factors should
matter.

As mentioned above, of particular interest is whether bank-backed bills were more liquid, i.e., changed
hands more frequently, than bills backed solely by individuals' wealth. "Bank-backed" means the bill was
a liability of a bank. As discussed above, there are two cases where banks (Barclays and Glyn Mills) were
the payees; they were liable (in addition to the wealth of indorsers). I start by discussing the two bank-
backed cases.

Black (1996) discusses the London Agency System of country banks having London correspondents. Black
(1996, p 116), based on the Post Office London Directory (1802), lists Glyn Mills as having nine country
correspondent banks, and Barclays as having sixteen country correspondent banks. By 1820 these
numbers were thirty-two for Glyn Mills and forty-six for Barclays (Black (1996), p. 118).

     A. Shropshire & Staffordshire/Glyn Mills & Hallifax

Glyn Mills was the bank that backed the bills of Shropshire & Staffordshire Bank.44 In 153 instances in the
sample Glyn, Mills and Hallifax (Glyn Mills) were the drawees\borrowers. Glyn Mills was a famous bank,
founded in 1753 and existing until 1939, when it was acquired by the Royal Bank of Scotland.45 Six
generations of Glyns ran the bank during this entire period; see Browne (1933) and Fulford (1953).

For these 153 bills, Glyn Mills was liable as opposed to honoring the bill from a customer's account. In
the case of bills in this group, the words "To Sir R. C. Glyn Bar.t [Baronet] Mills, Hallifax & Co. Bankers,
London" are pre-printed or handwritten in the lower left corner, i.e., drawee\borrower. If handwritten,
the words are the same or almost identical. On 146 of the 153 bills, the words "For T. Smallwood & R.
Spearman" are pre-printed or handwritten in the lower right corner, i.e., the drawer, with R. Spearman's
handwritten signature immediately below. On these 146 bills, the words "Shropshire & Staffordshire Bank
Market Drayton" are pre-printed or handwritten across the top of the bill. So, Glyn Mills was the drawee
(the acceptor) and, in effect, Spearman was telling Glyn to pay some third party.46 Market Drayton is a
market town in the north of Shropshire close to the Staffordshire border.




44
   Between 1753 and 1970 the bank went by a number of different names, but always included Glyn. See Fulford
(1953) Appendix 1, p. 241, and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.
45
   Newmarch worked for Glyn Mills; see https://www.rbs.com/heritage/people/william-newmarch.html
46
   The other 7 bills in this group were all handwritten by someone other than Spearman. "To Sir R. C. Glyn ..." or
something similar was in the lower left. "Market Drayton" was at the top but not "Shropshire & Staffordshire".
                                                                                                                 36


We know a few things about Shropshire & Staffordshire: Thomas Smallwood, Joseph Warren, and Richard
Spearman dissolved their banking partnership on June 25, 1811.47 Warren was the creditor and/or
indorser on several of the bills in our sample.48 On all the S&S bills the location of the creditor is given as
"Market Drayton", a market town in north Shropshire also known as "Drayton" or "Drayton on Hales". 49
The drawee // acceptor // payor for all these bills is the Glyn Mills & Co. (1753-1970) banking firm in
London, discussed further below.50

As mentioned above, Shropshire & Staffordshire was a bank located in Market Drayton, a town in the
north of Shropshire, close to the Staffordshire border. Lee (1861), a native of Drayton, cites an anonymous
description of Drayton as "a little obscure place with a market on Wednesdays" (p. v).

Below is a picture of a Shropshire & Staffordshire Bank bill.




47
   Norwood (1858) lists the bank Smallwood & Spearman going bankrupt in 1823.
48
   According to Byles (1874), a partner who accepts bill with his own signatur e in a transaction "binds the firm,
whether he sign the name of the firm, or sign by procuration [by designated authority of the partnership], or accept
in his own name, a bill drawn on the firm" (p. 43; emphasis in original.
49
   Today Drayton has a population of about 12,000.
50
   The name of the firm changed many times. See https://www.rbs.com/heritage/companies/glyn-mills-and-co.html
                                                                                                        37




Price (1890) commented on Glyn Mills in the Handbook of London Bankers that this firm " . . . has the
reputation of having a larger business than any other private banking house in the City of London" (p. 65-
66). Cottrel (1991) describes Glyn Mills & Co. as "Unique in many ways: it was a major London agent for
country banks, but also acted as the `railway bank', was involved in foreign lending and undertook long
term loans to domestic manufacturing" (p. 49, n. 2).

Glyn Mills had many relationships with country banks. Indeed, Sir Richard Carr Glyn testified before a
parliamentary committee in 1799, "Third Report from Committee of Secrecy" (p. 142):51

           Does your House correspond with Country Bankers?

           It does. . . I consider myself as an Agent to the Country Bankers in Money transactions.
           Are the Bills of any of the Country Banks with which you are connected, payable at your
           House?
           They are; Bills are drawn upon our House. Notes are made payable at our House.



51
     See Reports from Committees of the House of Commons, Vol. XI, Miscellaneous Subjects, 1782-1799.
                                                                                                                      38


Glyn Mills had four country bank agencies in 1790, thirteen in 1800, and twenty-eight in 1810. By 1815,
Glyn Mills had correspondent relationships with thirty-five banks located in the Cotswolds, Cumberland,
East Anglia, East Riding, the Home Counties, Lancashire, the Welsh Marches, the east Midlands, the north
east, the Potteries, south-central and south-west England, and Scotland. And, by 1830 Glyn Mills had
forty-nine country bank agencies (Fulford (1953), p. 59, 95-101, 246-255). Fulford (1933), Appendix III,
lists the 40 or so banks with whom Glyn & Co. had relationships with. Included there is Smallwood &
Spearman of Market Drayton.52

According to Fulford (1933): "What made for the preeminence of Glyn's during the first fifty years of the
nineteenth century was that the partners laid themselves out to attract and maintain the London agency
for a great number of country banks" (p. 96). In this period the personal reputations and public presences
of bank executives was very important. As Fulford (1933) put it: " . . . Glyn strengthened the repute of
the Bank by his successful career in public life" (p. 16). Burke (1839) describes Sir Richard Carr Glyn as an
"eminent banker of the city of London. . . the 1st bart. [Baronet] of Ewell and Surrey . . . served the office
of lord mayor [of London] in 1798" (p. 448).53 Lisle-Williams (1984) describes Glyn Mills as one of the
merchant banking dynasties. Indeed, Glyn, described by Cottrell (1991, p.31) as "that very particular
`private' bank--Glyn Mills"--as a powerful bank that would go on the be at the epicenter England's global
expansion in the 19th century, forming the first international banks. Cottrell (1991, p. 46) describes this
thusly: "The continuing role, from the 1830s to the 1880s, played by the Glyn in the creation of British
corporate international banks was remarkable . . . " (p. 41).54

"In 1805 Richard Carr Glyn became a member of the Committee of Six, set up to recommend
improvements to the running of the Bankers' Clearing House. . . Under his leadership Glyn, Mills & Mitton
expanded rapidly, from employing 9 clerks in 1793 to 36 by 1815. The partnership undertook financing
activities on behalf of the government during hostilities with France in the 1790s, and also became London
agent for over 40 provincial banks across England."55

Engraved at the top of the bill is Shropshire & Staffordshire Bank, which was the issuing bank. But the
notes are backed by Glyn Mills (lower left corner of the bill). What was the relationship between
Shropshire & Staffordshire and Glyn Mills, other than that Glyn Mills was the London agent for Shropshire
& Staffordshire? Unknown Author (1921) explained:

         The obstacles to commercial intercourse, and the numerous other inconveniences
         attending the limitation of the credit of many English Banks to their own circle, and the
         difficulties of passing their notes beyond it . . . are well known . . several in good credit
         have made their notes exclusively payable in London, with the view of commanding a
         more extended circulation; but it is thought this plan has been adopted by some others,

52
   If Glyn accepted a bill, the final party to the bill need not go to Glyn in London. The final holder could the collect
from a country bank agent (maybe Glyn Mills' agent) who would then collect from Glyn in London.
53
   Richard Carr Glyn (1755-1838) was the eldest son of Sir Richard Glyn (bap. 1711-1773), the founder of the bank.
54
   Glyn, Mills could not continue as a private partnership because of its small size. In 1939 is was acquired by the
Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), but continued to be managed separately. In 1969 it became an RBS subsidiary.

        rather to evade the immediate effect of sudden " runs" upon themselves. . . " (emphasis
        in original; p. 91)

Indeed, the form of the note suggests this because the Shropshire & Staffordshire name and the amount
are engraved on the bill, making it resemble a note of Shropshire & Staffordshire. The payee's name, Glyn
Mills, is also engraved on the note. In effect, Glyn Mills was backing Shropshire & Staffordshire money.
But the details of this arrangement are not known, i.e., how did Shropshire & Staffordshire recompense
Glyn Mills? Shropshire & Staffordshire no doubt held balances with Glyn Mills. See Pressnell (1956, p.
404, 413-415). Nevertheless, Glyn Mills was liable.

We know that Glyn Mills' assets were bills of exchange, either its own or bills purchased in the discount
market. But there is no balance sheet information until after the sample period.56 As Fulford (1953)
wrote, with respect to Glyn's ". . . internal functions and business . . . unhappily such information does not
exist" (p. vi). Indeed, the archives for Glyn, Mills contain no useful information in this regard.57

The Stafford & Shropshire Bank was in an industrial, iron and steel, county. In fact, both counties of
Shropshire and Staffordshire were industrial. See Ashton (1924), Birch (1967), Trinder (1973), and Bailey
(2003). According to Trinder (1967): "For most of the second half of the 18th century more iron was
produced in Shropshire than in any other county in Great Britain" (p. 33).

     B. Barclays, Tritton & Bevan

Barclays, Tritton & Bevan was a London Bank founded in 1694 (according to Price (1890)). Of the 29 bills
drawn on Barclays, eleven were drawn by Gurneys & Company, a bank. Twigg's (1830) lists Barclays as
Gurneys' London correspondent. Of the remaining bills, six are illegible, one is drawn by a country bank
in Suffolk, Four were drawn by Hadwen and Wood, which was a bank in Liverpool, and the rest were
drawn on individuals, the identities of whom I could not trace.

Gurneys & Co. was a family-run bank founded in 1770 by members of the Quaker Gurney family, and
headquartered in Norwich, England, which is in the county of Norfolk (East Anglia). See Figure 1. A
subsequent daughter of David Barclay married Richard Gurney. Pressnell (1956): "John Gurney junior,
nephew of Samuel Gurney, was trained in the banking house of Smith, Bevan, and Bening, London agents
of the Gurneys of Norwich and the forerunners of the modern Barclays Bank" (p. 114). There was a
"pattern of marriage with the Barclay and Bevan families (Ackrill and Hannah (2001)). Gurneys numbered
twenty-one branches by 1830 (Pressnell (1956, p. 127). Later, the firm was merged and became Overend,
Gurney and Company, the largest discount house in London which dramatically failed in the Panic of 1866.
The remnants of this company merged into Barclays Bank in 1896. Gurneys & Co. covered East Anglia,
with about twenty branches. East Anglia is a geographical area in the East of England, comprising the




56
   Browne (1933) shows the first balance sheet published in 1885. Browne (1885-1964) was a partner and later
director of Glyn, Mills & Co. https://www.rbs.com/heritage/people/eric-gore-browne.html

   See https://www.rbs.com/heritage/companies/glyn-mills-and-co.html .
                                                                                                            40


counties of Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. Suffolk and Norfolk are along the eastern coast of
England, bordering the English Channel. See the map below.

The relationship between Barclays and Gurneys appears to have been like that between Shropshire &
Staffordshire and Glyn, Mills. That is, the bills were liabilities of Barclays. Druery (1826) notes in passing:
". . . Bank of Messrs. Gurney, Turner, and Brightwen, whose bills are honoured in the metropolis at
Barclays, Tritton, Bevan and Co . . . "

But there are important differences. First, the bills do not have an engraving of the name Gurneys & Co.
on the top of the bill. Instead, in some cases the name of a Gurneys branch location is engraved there,
e.g., Beccles, a town in Suffolk. And secondly, East Anglia, where the Gurneys branches were located was
overwhelmingly agricultural (e.g., Dodd (1848)), with a low population density (see MacDonald (2017)).
In almost all respects East Anglia was the opposite of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Shropshire and Staffordshire.
Literacy rates lagged the rest of the nation (see Crone (2015)). The schools were of inferior quality and
newspapers had a very low circulation (see Glyde (1956)). In fact, this was the location of the Swing Riots
in which agricultural laborers smashed threshing machines and threatened farmers in 1830-31. See
Hobsbawm and Rudé (1970) and the discussion in Winstanley (2004).

For these reasons bills of exchange in East Anglia were not likely used very extensively. The low population
density meant that fewer people would recognize each other as having enough wealth to back the bill.
And low literacy rates meant that few could read the bills.

    C. Summary

Thus, in the sample there are three situations for bill backing: (1) bills backed only by the personal wealth
of the indorsers, and circulated in the industrial and manufacturing areas; (2) Shropshire & Staffordshire
bills backed by the personal wealth of the indorsers plus Glyn, Mill's assets, and also circulated in the
industrial and manufacturing areas; (3) Gurney bills backed by the personal wealth of the indorsers plus
Barclays, Tritton & Bevan's assets, and circulated in the agricultural area of East Anglia. For these reasons
I expect Shropshire & Staffordshire bills to have the most indorsements, followed by non-bank-backed
bills, and lastly the Gurney bills. This is consistent with the sample averages discussed above.

    D. Indorsements

Figure 6 below shows the distribution of bill signatures in the sample.

Again, the sample does not show bills with 20, 50, or 100 signatures, cases in which paper would be
attached to the bill.

Note the long tail for bills accepted by Glyn Mills, and the modal category for bills accepted by Barclays is
zero.

As noted, ceteris paribus, more indorsements (signatures) should be associated with longer maturities,
smaller amounts, and amounts in round numbers (multiples of 10). Checkland (1954): "By 1819 the bills
seem to have become to some degree standardized in round sums . . . " (p. 130). Note that stamp duty
buckets are a function of bill amount, so they are essentially the same. Ashton (1961) studied the records
of Peter Stubbs, an eighteenth-century file-maker. Ashton noted that "Inland bills drawn with a longer
[maturity] than the ten days of [this example] might sometimes bear a dozen or more indorsements" (p.
104).

    E. Analysis of Liquidity

Simple regressions were run with the number of indorsements (Signatures) on the left-hand side and the
various variables discussed above on the right-hand side. Note that while the payee is the first indorser
on the back of a bill, that signature is not counted in the Signatures variable.

Right-hand side variables include the log of the amount of the bill, maturity and maturity squared,
whether the bill amount is a multiple of ten. Maturity squared was included because a plot of maturity
against number of signatures shows that the maximum number of signatures at each maturity traces out
an inverted parabola with a peak around 2.0-2.5 months. There is dummy variable indicating whether the
bill was a Shropshire & Staffordshire bill that is a liability of Glyn, Mills. And, there is a dummy variable for
bills accepted by Barclays.

Table 4 below shows regressions of the number of indorsements on the above bill characteristics. The
table has OLS regressions, as well as Tobit, Poisson, and Negative Binomial; the last two methods are
commonly used for count data. The results are consistent across methods.

As expected, the number of indorsements is negatively related to the amount of the bill, reflecting the
line between a pure credit instrument and a bill used as money. For the latter purpose, lower amounts
are associated with more indorsements. Indorsements are positively related to maturity, consistent with
Ashton (1945) statement quoted above that: ". . . since each successive holder indorsed it, the more it
circulated the greater the number of guarantors of its ultimate payment into cash " (p. 26). So, if a bill
has a longer maturity, the more indorsements make it safer. The maturity squared term is also significant.
Multiples of ten are also associated with more indorsements. This is a matter of convenience, but still
change may be needed, so there is a potential problem.

The evidence is consistent with DGH: a Shropshire & Staffordshire bill that backed by Glyn Mills is
associated with about two more indorsements on average, ceteris paribus. The DGH theory is that debt
backed by debt, in this case a bill backed by Glyn, Mills' discounted bills held as assets, is the optimal way
to create private money. For non-bank-backed bills, it is imperative that a party taking such a bill in a
transaction know that the indorser (and possibly previous indorsers) have enough wealth to conclude that
there will likely be no losses. This knowledge is essential in order to take the bill. DGH says that the
opposite needs to be the case, namely that no knowledge of the backing is necessary (other than the
backer is a well-known bank) as long as every party to the transaction knows that the other parties do not
find it optimal to produce private information about the debt of Glyn Mills backing the bill. But the results
also show that Barclays-backed bills, related to Gurney, have fewer signatures. As discussed above, this
is most likely because Gurney & Co. was in an agricultural area.

The dummy variable "acceptGlynMills" indicates bills that were liabilities of Glyn Mills. But all these 153
bills were drawn at the same time (1814) and place (Market Drayton). Is this dummy picking up effects of
the year or place? In 1814 the War of 1812 was continuing and there were several battles in between
England and the U.S. in North America. The first steam locomotive went into service. The Anglo-Dutch
Treaty was signed, which returned most of the Dutch Empire acquired by England back to Holland. In
December of 1814, the War of 1812 ended with the Treaty of Ghent. In short, there does not seem to
                                                                                                                  43


have been any events that would have been related to the number of indorsements on the Glyn Mills bills.
For example, there was no financial crisis or any significant event with the Bank of England.

Market Drayton (Shropshire) also was apparently not special, although there is a little information.58
Some evidence does suggest that it was a typical market down. Popp (2007) studied the firm of John Shaw
& Sons of Wolverhampton and commercial travelling in early nineteenth century England. The firm was
a hardware factor, selling and distributing. This involved marketing the goods, which required travelling.
Popp studied the itineraries of these trips. The list of stops for a Liverpool area journey in November 1814
lists twenty-four towns where Shaw stopped. One of these was Market Drayton.

Also, it could be that Glyn Mills had more wealth than any of the indorsers to other bills, but Glyn Mills
also had an unknown amount of other liabilities. And Glyn Mill's leverage could not have been known and
hence it would not be known that there was more wealth in any meaningful sense. According to Bailey
(2003), speaking of joint-stock banks: "Balance sheet data and information relating to the internal
operation of institutions were regarded by many contemporaries as essentially private in nature. Indeed,
the idea of the public disclosure of balance sheets was anathema for many bankers" (p. 71). The Report
of the 1836 Select Committee on Joint Stock Banks pointed out that "The Law does not provide for any
publication of the liabilities and assets of these Banks, nor does it enforce the communication of any
balance sheet to the proprietors at large".59 This is consistent with the argument of Dang, Gorton,
Holmström, Ordoñez (2017) that banks want to keep such information secret to maintain information-
insensitivity. Moreover, Glyn Mills was not a joint-stock bank, but a private bank.60

Glyn Mills was a very reputable bank and this no doubt played a role.61 Glyn Mills was run by generations
of partners of substantial stature (e.g., members of Parliament, mayor of London, Sheriff; see Browne
(1933) for details. In addition, Glyn survived the panics of 1793, 1825, and 1847 (also 1857 and 1866).62
Hoppit (1986) identified 1792/3 as the worst financial crisis of the century (1986, p. 55). The outbreak of
war on the continent in 1792 caused uneasiness with rising bankruptcies and an unstable stock market
marking the end of the year. The events of 1792 were a full-blown run and Glyn Mills (then called Glyn
and Hallifax) suspended payment to creditors. Fulford (1953) describes the stoppage as temporary. No
financial assistance was received from the Bank of England. Glyn Mills also survived the Panic of 1825.
Only two of the country banks with which Glyn Mills had accounts failed "and such loss was quickly made

   According to Everitt (1974): "There are few adequate histories of the market towns of England . . . " (p. 29).

   Modern financial reporting developed in the U.K. in the late nineteenth century; See Bryer (1993) and Parker
(1990). But business historians are not convinced of the usefulness of late nineteenth century financial statements,
never mind the first half of the century. See Arnold (1996).
61
   The Hillington Collection of French decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City was formed
by Charles Mills, a partner at Glyn, Mills, and bankers to the royal family. See Rorimer (1960)
62
   Some authors refer the events in 1797 as a crisis, but the narratives of Glyn Mills do not mention this episode.
James (2012) says that country banks did not experience a large number of failures. There is no agreement among
scholars about which events constituted bona fide crises in the eighteenth century. James (2012) includes 1810\1811
and 1815/1819 as crises.

up by new Country Bank accounts - - -formerly kept with London banks which had failed" (Fulford (1953,
p. 110).

The sample period includes the Panics of 1793 and 1825. But the sample has no bills for 1793 and only
one bill for 1794 (1.5 months, 86.70 pounds, two signatures, so nothing unusual). Similarly, the sample
has no bills for 1825 and only one bill for 1826 (6 months, 333.33 pounds, one signature, so nothing
unusual). The Country Bankers Act of 1826 also occurred during the sample period. The sample has 207
bills 1826 or earlier, and 275 bills after 1826. However, all Glyn Mill and all Barclays bills are prior to 1826,
whereas almost all other are after, so a date dummy using 1826 is basically the same as whether a bill was
accepted by Glyn Mills or by Barclays or not. Regression bears this out. I also considered using the years
when the Bank of England was restricted from paying out gold, 1797-1821, but this is a subset of the
earlier time period and thus does not provide additional information for the same reason.

6. Conclusion

The heartland of the Industrial Revolution supported a dense network of business relationships, in which
merchants, manufacturers, and tradesmen needed a form of money. Private bank notes were not used
because banks were not credible. They were undercapitalized and frequently failed. Coin was scarce and
what was available was used to pay laborers. The need for "money" among merchants, manufacturers,
and tradesmen was filled by inland bills of exchange. Inland bills were credibly information-insensitive
debt conditional on the identity of the bill profferer because joint liability meant that all indorsers risked
their wealth to guarantee the bill being offered in a transaction.

A sample of 482 inland bills was studied and the identities of borrowers, lenders, and indorsers was
studied to the extent the identities could be determined. Indeed, bills were used by merchants,
manufacturers, and tradesmen. Unlike a bank, which issues liabilities backed by assets, short-term debt
backed by loans, the inland bill of exchange was evidence of a loan, backed by the wealth of the parties
to the bill. A higher velocity of a bill, more indorsements, was associated with smaller amounts, longer
maturity, and bills of a round amount, multiples of ten.

DGH have argued that the optimal design of private money is debt backed by debt. In the context here
that would mean that bills backed by banks would be more liquid than bills backed by personal wealth.
In the case of personal wealth, information about the parties to the bill was important in order to believe
that the bill was near riskless. Bank-backed bills, i.e., Glyn Mills, were more liquid (relative to non-bank-
backed bills) even though no one knew anything about the Glyn Mill's balance sheet, quality of assets, or
leverage. If no one knew anything about the bank (other than its reputation) and everyone knew that no
one knew, because it was too costly to produce private information, Glyn Mills backed bills would more
liquid. Bills backed by Barclays, however, had lower velocity, likely because Gurney was in an agricultural
area. The evidence is consistent with this.

If there is a shortage of safe debt so that the private sector needed to create such debt, e.g., securitization,
what is the best way? Suppose Google issued short-term debt. Provided not too much was issued it would
be rated AAA. Would this debt be efficient? Based on the history of inland bills of exchange, the answer
is no. It would be better to back such debt with debt.
