                                           ABSTRACT

We examine the effect of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
Children (WIC) on the quality of household food purchases using the National Household Food
Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) and propensity score matching. A healthy
purchasing index (HPI) is used to measure nutritional quality of household food purchases. WIC
foods explain the improvement in quality of food purchases, not self-selection of more nutrition-
conscious households into the program. The improvement in purchase quality was driven
entirely by WIC participating households who redeemed WIC foods during the interview week.
There was no significant difference between WIC-participants who did not redeem WIC foods
and eligible non-participants. In this sample, there is no evidence that lack of access to clinics has
adverse effects on participation nor is there evidence that HPI depends on supermarket access. A
supervised machine learning process supports our main conclusion on the importance of WIC
foods.

1. Introduction

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is the

nation’s third largest food assistance program (Morgan 2015) but focuses narrowly on pregnant,

postpartum, or breastfeeding women; infants; and children up to five years of age. The program

provides food assistance, nutrition education, breast feeding support, and referrals to health and

other services (USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) 2016). WIC foods are intended to be

supplemental and address nutritional gaps in the recipients’ diets.1 Participation in the program

involves frequent visits to a WIC clinic for other services.      Typically, at least one clinic

appointment is required within a three-month period.

       The program began in 1974 and its reach has grown with time. Recent estimates indicate

that WIC serves half of U.S. infants and close to 30 percent of children, pregnant women, and

postpartum women (Oliveira and Frazão 2015). WIC targets lower income households, those with

incomes below 185 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, but participants in some higher-

income households are adjunctively eligible by having previously qualified for participation in

another assistance program such as Medicaid (Thorn et al. 2015). That said, in 2014 only a small

fraction, less than two percent, of participants were from households with income over 185 percent

of the federal poverty level. The overwhelming majority, nearly three quarters, were in households

with income below 100 percent of the poverty threshold (Thorn et al. 2015).

       That WIC is associated with improvements in birth, health, and nutritional outcomes has

been documented in numerous studies, with birth outcomes receiving the most attention. Reviews

of this literature include Owen and Owen (1997), Fox et al. (2004), Devaney (2010) and Black et

al. (2012). That said, selection bias is a concern in this work because nearly all studies compare

participants to eligible non-participants (Gordon and Nelson 1995; Besharov and Germanis 2001).
                                                                                                   4


If participation is more attractive to those who are concerned about nutrition and/or otherwise

exhibit behaviors contributing to better health, then the beneficial effects of the program could be

overstated or spurious. Conversely, there is evidence that participants in WIC are more likely to

have characteristics associated with poor health outcomes relative to eligible nonparticipants,

which could result in published findings that understate beneficial effects of the program (Bitler

and Currie 2005a).

       Nevertheless, the emerging evidence is that the effects of WIC on birth outcomes are robust

to selection bias (Currie and Rossin-Slater 2015). Recent studies have examined birth outcomes

using empirical strategies designed to address selection bias and continue to show that WIC is

beneficial. Strategies include models with maternal fixed effects (Sonchak 2016; Currie and

Rajani 2014) and instrumental variables models (Gai and Feng 2012). Others exploit the staggered

deployment of WIC across counties during the early stages of the program (Hoynes, Page, and

Stevens 2011) and compare outcomes from mothers transitioning into and out of the program over

multiple births (Figlio, Hamersma, and Roth 2009).

       There has been less direct attention on the role of selection bias in estimating the effect of

the program’s nutritional outcomes. Overwhelmingly, studies that have examined nutritional

outcomes find that WIC participation is associated with improvements in dietary quality, nutrient

intakes, and/or biochemical indicators of nutritional adequacy across a number of different datasets

and time periods (see Fox et al. 2004; Black et al. 2012). The evidence of nutritional improvements

is noteworthy because WIC foods are prescribed to the individual. Once the foods are in the home,

other household members could consume them resulting in program leakage. It could also be that

WIC households are healthier. Because of the selection issue, it is possible to argue that those

attracted into the program would have purchased the supplemental WIC foods anyway, and that
                                                                                                 5


despite the large body of evidence showing a strong association between the program and

improved diet, the program’s actual benefits in terms of meaningfully augmenting nutrition are

limited.

       Assessing how selection might explain the nutritional outcomes of WIC is especially

important now. WIC foods account for about 70 percent of program costs (Oliveira and Frazão

2015) and WIC is one of several nutrition and health programs targeted for cuts in a recent White

House budget proposal (Aisch and Parlapiano 2017). The supplemental nature of WIC foods has

led some to question whether the WIC food packages are sufficiently meaningful to the overall

diet of pregnant women to alter birth outcomes and even whether the birth outcomes being

considered would be sensitive to the level of nutrition supplementation that WIC provides (Joyce,

Gibson, and Coleman 2005). Others have conceded the possibility that the food packages may be

an incentive that induces pregnant women to participate in the program and that it is other program

features, such as education and health referrals, that could be responsible for mitigating the

likelihood of poor outcomes (Bitler and Currie 2005b).2 Thus, evidence on whether WIC foods

matter is important to understanding the mechanisms by which the program leads to better health.

       The question we address in this paper is whether participation in WIC meaningfully alters

food choices in a way that would be conducive to improvements in diet. We address this question

using USDA’s National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS). FoodAPS

provides a relatively small but nationally representative sample of U.S. households and includes

information about where households shop for food, the availability and types of food stores in the

communities where these households are located, and household eligibility and participation for

food assistance programs (USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) 2017a). Additionally,

FoodAPS contains detailed information about factors that may influence food purchases such as
                                                                                                6


socioeconomic characteristics of the household, number of individuals residing within the

household, and racial composition. An advantage of the FoodAPS data is that they permit us to

look at food purchases directly and see how they differ among participants who did and did not

use WIC to purchase foods. Since the sample was not stratified by time of month or date of

delivery of WIC benefits, the samples of WIC households using or not using their WIC benefits

should be nearly random.

       To determine how WIC contributes to the nutritional quality of household food purchases,

we use an adaption of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), a broadly accepted measure for the overall

quality of an individual’s diet and apply it to each household’s food purchases. Because we are

assessing purchases and not dietary intake, we term this measure the healthy purchasing index

(HPI). FoodAPS provides a detailed record for participating households during an interview

period (typically a week). These purchase records include information about what foods were

purchased, where they were purchased, and whether purchases were made using benefits from

nutrition assistance programs such as WIC. Moreover, FoodAPS includes nutrient values for the

food items contained in the household’s purchase record. This permits application of the HEI over

these purchases to obtain the HPI.

       Given the lack of data on a valid instrumental variable that could be used to help identify

the effect of WIC participation, we use propensity scores to match WIC participating households

to eligible non-participating households. We then estimate the average treatment effect on the

treated (ATT) and show that WIC participation is associated with modest but statistically

significant improvements in nutritional quality of household food purchases. This finding is

consistent with earlier work showing an association between WIC participation and improved

nutritional outcomes. Next, we compute the ATT among participants who redeemed WIC benefits
                                                                                                  7


for foods during the interview week and those who did not. We find that the improvement in

nutritional quality of food purchases is driven entirely by households who redeemed WIC foods.

We found no meaningful program effect on the purchases of WIC participating households who

did not redeem WIC foods. In sum, we present evidence that WIC foods are the most plausible

explanation for earlier findings of a positive association between WIC participation and nutritional

outcomes. Moreover, we find no evidence to support the contention that this association can be

explained by systematic differences among WIC and comparable non-WIC households.

       We conduct several robustness checks on this finding. First, food retailers who accept WIC

benefits as payment carry healthier foods. It is plausible that differences in shopping venue could

explain this finding. Hence, we redo the analysis using a sample comprised only of households

who shopped at a WIC approved retailer during the interview week and reach the same conclusion.

WIC foods continued to explain the difference in purchase quality in this follow-up analysis.

       Second, our finding could be due to a secondary selection issue wherein some WIC-

participating households have characteristics that make them more likely to fully redeem WIC

benefits. To assess this, we exclude food items procured on shopping trips where WIC accounted

for a majority of the value of a household’s purchases, recompute the HPI, and redo the analysis.

When the WIC shopping events are excluded, the ATT among those households who redeemed

WIC foods is no longer significant. Again, this supports the conclusion that WIC foods explain

the improvement in nutritional quality, not self-selection of more nutrition-conscious households

into the program.

       While propensity score matching is a well-established method, one weakness is that the

researcher must specify a relationship between the likelihood of program participation and

observed covariates. As a third robustness check, we use an “honest” random forest that places no
                                                                                                 8


restrictions on model complexity but that does penalize overfitting to derive the ATTs (Athey,

Tibshirani, and Wager 2017; Athey 2017; Wager and Athey 2018). This approach uses machine

learning methods to identify proximity of participating and non-participating households and

thereby sidesteps the requirement of a researcher-supplied functional specification.

       A secondary aim of this paper is to use the rich information FoodAPS contains about the

commercial food environment to understand whether geographic barriers impact WIC

participation.   Specifically, we look at whether inadequate access to WIC clinics limits

participation and whether the HPI differs meaningfully for participants without access to

supermarkets. We find little evidence from the FoodAPS data that these barriers pose significant

hurdles to program participation and effectiveness.

2. Data and Methods

FoodAPS contains a total of 4,826 households who completed the survey between April 2012 and

January 2013 (USDA ERS 2017a). Among the 4,826 households who took part in FoodAPS, there

were 1,007 households with at least one member who was categorically eligible for WIC and who

met other program requirements for income or adjunctive eligibility through participation in

Medicaid or other qualifying assistance program. Our focus is on this subsample of FoodAPS

households. Of these 1,007 eligible households, 461 households were participants in WIC.

Households recorded purchases in food-at-home and food-away-from-home food diaries. We

further restricted the WIC-eligible sample to those households with at least one food-at-home event

during the interview period and those that constituted complete cases over all measures reported

in Table 1.
                                                                                                 9


          As shown in Table 1, our analysis sample includes 928 households. Of these, 505

households were eligible for WIC but did not participate in the program and 423 participated. Of

the 423 participating households, 152 used WIC benefits on one or more purchase occasions during

the interview period and 271 did not. It is important to emphasize that household purchases are

only observed during the week of the interview. Thus, an observation that a WIC household did

not use WIC for purchases cannot be taken as evidence that the household failed to redeem its

WIC benefits. All we can determine is that benefits were not used during the week in question.

          FoodAPS contains information about household characteristics that may affect WIC

participation and food choice. As shown in Table 1, these characteristics include educational

attainment, monthly income, marital status, presence of different categories of WIC-eligible

individuals, and household racial and ethnic composition. Most of these measures are based on

the characteristics of individuals in the household, which are then aggregated up to the household

level.3

          In addition, we are able to examine two geographical barriers: access to supermarkets and

access to WIC clinics. Supermarket access could be one barrier that influences both participation

in WIC and food choices in general. To designate households without easy access to supermarkets,

we use USDA’s tract-level measure indicating limited access to supermarkets based on vehicle

travel (USDA ERS 2017b). Second, as demonstrated by Rossin-Slater (2013), access to WIC

clinics is another determinant of WIC take-up. Since the FoodAPS dataset does not provide

information on clinic access, we assembled a list of WIC clinic locations. This involved collection

of data on clinic locations across numerous state WIC agencies. To correspond temporally to the

FoodAPS data collection period, we used 2012-2013 locations if available, but only the 2015-2016

locations were available for some states. We supplied the resulting geocodes for WIC clinics to
                                                                                                 10


USDA-ERS personnel who spatially joined the clinic locations to the FoodAPS households and

provided a file with radial distances from each household to the nearest WIC clinic within that

household’s state of residence. We then measured clinic access as a binary variable taking the

value of one if the household was within one (ten) miles of a clinic and located in an urban (rural)

tract.4

Measuring the Healthy Purchasing Index (HPI)

As noted earlier, the HPI measure we use for nutritional quality is based on the HEI. Specifically,

our measure is based on the HEI-2010, which reflects diet quality in terms of conformance to the

2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (USDA FNS 2010). The HPI measure we use differs

primarily in that (a) it is computed over food purchases as opposed to food intake and (b) it is

measured at the household as opposed to the individual level. Nevertheless, this measure still

provides a baseline measure of a household’s ability to meet dietary guidelines from its food

purchases. The HEI, and by extension the HPI used here, assesses 12 dietary components

(Guenther et al. 2013). These include nine adequacy components and three moderation

components. The adequacy components reflect (1) total fruit, (2) whole fruit, (3) total vegetables,

(4) greens and beans, (5) whole grains, (6) dairy, (7) total protein foods, (8) seafood and plant

proteins, and (9) fatty acids. The moderation components include (1) refined grains, (2) sodium,

and (3) empty calories. A higher value for each component of the index indicates a healthier

nutrient intake. Moderation components are inversely coded so that lower consumption of these

items leads to higher scores. The overall HPI measure computed over these 12 categories ranges

from 0 to 100. Again, higher values of the overall index indicate healthier food purchases.

          The FoodAPS survey collected detailed information about all foods purchased by the

household over the course of seven days. The primary respondent in each household participated
                                                                                             11


in two in-person interviews and up to three telephone interviews (Ver Ploeg et al. 2015). The

dataset contains information on food items purchased or otherwise acquired, including brand, and

package size, which allowed items to be matched to the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for

Dietary Studies or the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (USDA ERS

2017a). Economists at the USDA’s Economic Research Service developed computer code and

intermediate datasets that aggregated these nutritional values into the HEI components and

computed an overall index value at the household level. These datasets and computer code were

then made available for our use in this research and were used to compute the HPI index we use

as the outcome measure in this study.

Characteristics of the WIC and Eligible Non-WIC Samples

As shown in Table 1, the mean HPI score for WIC and eligible non-WIC households are virtually

identical at 50.259 and 50.388, respectively. The last two columns of the table break the WIC

households down into those who redeemed WIC benefits during the sample period and those who

did not. Here the difference in HPI is meaningful. The average HPI computed over those who

redeemed WIC foods is much higher at 55.958 in comparison to the average of 47.062 computed

over those who did not. This is not surprising because foods provided by WIC help participants

meet dietary guidelines. Nevertheless, the apparent importance of WIC foods to the magnitude of

the index is striking and will receive further attention below.

       One thing that is noteworthy from Table 1 is that there are important differences between

the WIC and eligible non-WIC samples. The average number of WIC-eligible individuals is

similar between the two groups but on average, WIC households contain higher numbers of infants

and eligible women than did non-WIC households. WIC households have lower levels of

educational attainment, a lower percentage of married couples, and much lower household
                                                                                                  12


incomes. The proportion of Hispanic households is much higher among the WIC sample and the

proportion of African American households is slightly higher. Finally, access to WIC clinics is

higher among WIC households (40.4 percent compared to 35.8 percent) but a larger proportion of

WIC households did not have access to a supermarket (22 percent compared to 14.5 percent).

       To assess households’ subjective evaluation of dietary quality, FoodAPS included the

primary respondent’s self-assessment of whether the household is following a healthy diet. As

shown in Table 1, a slightly higher percentage, 40.9 percent, of WIC households reported a healthy

diet in comparison to 38.2 percent of the non-WIC households. Nevertheless, given the differences

between the WIC and non-WIC samples, the interesting question remains whether WIC truly

improves the healthiness of food purchase for participants or whether participants self-select into

WIC because of preferences for healthier foods such as those provided by WIC. To answer this

question, we use a matching algorithm to estimate the ATT of WIC participation.

Matching WIC Households to Eligible Non-WIC Households


As noted earlier, estimating the impact of WIC on nutritional quality is difficult with observational

data such as FoodAPS because the treatment selection (in this case, WIC participation) is often

influenced by subject characteristics. Consequently, baseline characteristics of treated subjects

could differ systematically from those of untreated subjects. Therefore, to understand the effect of

participation in WIC on HPI, we must first account for the systematic differences in baseline

characteristics between WIC participants and eligible non-participants.

       Matching methods provide a way to reduce selection bias among observational data

(Rosenbaum 2002; DiPrete and Gangl 2004). The goal is to find a group of non-treated individuals

who are similar to the treated individuals in all baseline characteristics – then focus attention on
                                                                                                          13


estimating the effect of interest and consider all variables other than the treatment variable as

potentially confounding. Balancing the vector of characteristics across treatment reduces the

influence of confounding variables. Therefore, matching mimics a randomized experiment

(conditional on a set of observables) so that the effect of the treatment is established (Drichoutis,

Nayga, and Lazaridis 2009).

        Matching methods are discussed at length in Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983). The matching

algorithm we use constructs an artificial control group among eligible non-WIC households that

have similar characteristics as those of WIC participants. Let 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 indicate the treatment, which

equals one if household i participated in WIC (treated case) and zero if household i is WIC-eligible

but does not participate in WIC (control case). Define HPI outcomes as 𝑌𝑌0𝑖𝑖 and 𝑌𝑌1𝑖𝑖 for the

associated treatment status 0 and 1. The treatment effect for an household i can be written as: 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 =

𝑌𝑌1𝑖𝑖 − 𝑌𝑌0𝑖𝑖 . However, we do not know 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 because we can only observe the outcome of either 𝑡𝑡1 or 𝑡𝑡0

(we only observe 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 𝑌𝑌1𝑖𝑖 + (1 − 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 )𝑌𝑌0𝑖𝑖 ), but not both. Therefore, we can estimate the average

treatment effect on the treated (ATT) as 𝑡𝑡𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 = 𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌1 |𝑇𝑇 = 1) − 𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌0 |𝑇𝑇 = 1). Understanding the

effect of WIC participation on those who ultimately participated is the relevant policy question in

our study, not the effect of WIC participation averaged across all households regardless of whether

or not they participated in WIC. Hence, we focus on the estimation of ATT in our analyses.

        Notice that the term 𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌0 |𝑇𝑇 = 1) is not observed because we do not observe the WIC effect

on households who are not on WIC. Moreover, if one tries to substitute this with 𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌0 |𝑇𝑇 = 0), it

would lead to self-selection bias (Drichoutis, Nayga, and Lazaridis 2009). We can assume that

selection into treatment depends on observable covariates as long as the following two strong

ignorability assumptions in treatment assignment are satisfied: (1) (𝑌𝑌1𝑖𝑖 , 𝑌𝑌0𝑖𝑖 )⊥ 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 ; and (2)

0<𝑝𝑝(𝑋𝑋) < 1. The first condition implies that selection is solely based on observable characteristics
                                                                                                     14


and that all variables influencing treatment assignment and potential outcomes simultaneously are

observed by the researcher (Caliendo and Kopeinig 2008). The second ensures a common support

(to rule out perfect predictability of treatment given X) between the treatment and control groups.

Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) further demonstrated that under the assumptions of strong

ignorability, treatment and control groups are exchangeable. The average treatment effect for the

treated is estimated as 𝑡𝑡𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 = 𝐸𝐸{𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌1 |𝑋𝑋, 𝑇𝑇 = 1) − 𝐸𝐸(𝑌𝑌0 |𝑋𝑋, 𝑇𝑇 = 0)|𝑇𝑇 = 1}, where the outer

expectation is taken over the distribution of baseline covariates in the treated group (Rosenbaum

and Rubin 1983). Therefore, outcome analysis on the matched data tends to produce unbiased

estimates of treatment effects due to reduced selection bias through the balancing of the

distributions of observed covariates.

        In this study, we use nearest neighbor propensity score matching (PSM). Propensity score

matching has been popularly applied in economics, statistics and medical research (Hong and Yu

2008; Ye and Kaskutas 2009; Wyse, Keesler, and Schneider 2008; Staff et al. 2008). PSM forms

matched sets of treated and untreated subjects who share a similar probability to be treated

(Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983; 1985). We use a logistic regression model to estimate the propensity

score. Specifically, WIC participation status is regressed on observed household characteristics.

Afterwards, we use the “Matching” package in R to obtain the matched samples (Sekhon 2011).

The algorithm we use matches each treatment household to a control household with replacement.

We restricted matches to nearest neighbor within a caliper as small as 0.01, but our central findings

and the overall quality of matches are robust to caliper restrictions. Consequently, the matched

samples we report below include all WIC participating households in the sample or subsample that

had common support. Once the matched sample is formed, the treatment effect can be estimated

by directly comparing outcomes between treated and untreated subjects in the matched sample.

3. Results

In this section, we first present results from the logistic regressions that we use to model WIC

participation. Second, we assess the quality of our matches by checking the balance between the

WIC and eligible non-WIC samples. Third, we then present the ATT of WIC participation and

assess Rosenbaum sensitivity of the ATT to hidden bias or unobserved heterogeneity. Fourth, we

assess robustness of our main findings by repeating the analysis for a sample containing only

households who shopped at a WIC-approved retailer and again using a modified HPI that excludes

the majority of WIC purchases. We then present information on differences in ATT by self-

reported healthiness of purchases and by access to supermarkets. Finally, we present the ATT

estimates derived through an alternative generalized random forest algorithm.

Determinants of WIC Participation

Marginal effects from the logit models used to form the matched samples are reported in Table 2.

The model in Table 2 includes state fixed effects (not reported). These fixed effects are included

because earlier studies show that states with stricter WIC eligibility rules have lower take-up

(Bitler, Currie, and Scholz 2003; Swann 2010). To formally test whether the existence of state

effects matters, we conducted a log-likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without the

state effects and reject the null hypothesis of no state effects.

        Table 2 shows that households with higher income and the highest levels of educational

attainment are less likely to participate in WIC. Hispanic households are more likely to participate

in WIC. Household composition is also important. Specifically, households with eligible infants

and women are more likely to participate in WIC. These findings are largely consistent with earlier
                                                                                                  16


work that has examined WIC participation. For example, there is evidence that WIC take-up is

lower for children age 1 to 4 (Bitler, Currie, and Scholz 2003; Tiehen and Jacknowitz 2008) and

higher among eligible postpartum women (Tiehen and Jacknowitz 2010). Earlier work also shows

higher rates of participation among Hispanic households (Bitler and Currie 2004; Bitler, Currie,

and Scholz 2003). WIC take-up is higher among socially disadvantaged women (Tiehen and

Jacknowitz 2010; Swann 2010; Bitler, Currie, and Scholz 2003).

       We find no evidence that access to WIC clinics affects participation among households in

the FoodAPS sample. This is in contrast to Rossin-Slater (2013) who finds that access to clinics

increases WIC food benefit take-up. However, Rossin-Slater (2013) has a much larger sample

from a single state and exploited information about opening and closing of clinics, information

which we were unable to obtain for the more geographically diverse FoodAPS sample. That we

do not find a significant effect of clinic access could be due to differences in program delivery and

clinic access across the many states represented in FoodAPS. The model in Table 2 does not

include a covariate measuring supermarket access, but we look further at the issue of supermarket

access in a follow-up analysis below.5 In sum, we do not find evidence that geographic barriers

(i.e., in terms of clinic access) meaningfully affect WIC participation in this sample.

Assessing the Quality of Matched Samples

As explained above, the goal of propensity score matching is to obtain a dataset that is similar to

one that would result from a randomized experiment. For this reason, we want the distribution of

covariates to be the same between the matched treated and control groups. One way to check this

is assess the balance post-match. We use the standardized difference measure proposed by Rubin

(1991). For each explanatory variable in the logit model, the standard difference of the sample

means in the treated and matched controls are presented in Figure 1. The overall mean difference
                                                                                               17


before matching lies between 0.4 percent and 80.4 percent for WIC households and eligible non-

WIC households. The bias is reduced to between 0.4 percent and 13.0 percent in the post-match

sample.

       Since the covariates include not only continuous variables, but also binary variables, a

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test based on 2,000 bootstrap iterations is employed to provide correct

coverage as recommend by Sekhon (2011). Based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, before

matching, the unbalanced variables are household income, households of Hispanic ethnicity, the

existence of a WIC eligible woman in the household, and the number of WIC-eligible children in

the household. After matching, these differences are reduced and there is no longer significant

imbalance between WIC households and eligible non-WIC households. We also use a two-sample

t-test, as proposed by Caliendo and Kopeinig (2008), to check if there are significant differences

in covariate means between treated and matched. These two-sample t-tests provide additional

evidence that covariate balance is achieved at the 5 percent level (see Appendix 1).

       Finally, we test the assumption of common support by checking the distribution of the

propensity scores for the treatment and control groups, as exhibited in Figure 2. As shown in

Figure 2, almost all the treated observations could be matched with non-zero propensity score

control observations and we restricted the matched samples to the region with common support.

Effect of WIC on Nutritional Quality of Household Purchases

Table 3 presents the ATT estimates for the effect of WIC participation regardless of whether or

not households redeemed WIC vouchers during the interview week, the effect of WIC participation

for households who had a WIC food redemption, and the effect of WIC participation for

households who did not have a WIC food redemption. The control group in all these analyses
                                                                                                18


comprises those who are eligible but non-WIC participants.          We estimate a positive and

statistically significant ATT of 2.742 for WIC participation. As noted above, the HPI ranges from

0 to 100. Given that the average HPI value for WIC participants is about 50.259, this estimate

suggests that WIC participation improves the nutritional value of purchases by about 5.5 percent.

This finding is consistent with earlier work showing that WIC participation is associated with

improvements in diet quality, nutrient intakes, and biochemical indicators of nutritional adequacy

(e.g., see review by Fox et al. 2004).

        To shed light on the importance of WIC foods, Table 3 also reports ATT estimates for the

sample of WIC participating households who used WIC benefits to redeem foods during the

interview week and those households who did not. The ATT is much higher at 9.443 among the

households who redeemed WIC foods. In contrast, the ATT for the sample of WIC households

who did not redeem WIC foods is -0.843.

        It is not surprising that the ATT is higher when WIC foods are redeemed. After all, foods

eligible for purchase through WIC are those that help recipients meet dietary guidelines. The

important finding is that there is no evidence that WIC participation improves nutritional quality

among those participating households who do not redeem benefits. If households with healthier

food preferences self-selected into the program, we should see a higher ATT even when WIC

benefits are not redeemed. The ATT from this group is small and not statistically different from

zero.

        As noted above, the HPI we use to assess quality of household purchases is an aggregate

of the 12 HEI components. Table 4, reports ATT estimates for each of these components estimated

from the matched sample of WIC households redeeming WIC benefits. Table 4 suggests that

households redeeming WIC foods scored significantly higher on total fruit, whole fruit, whole
                                                                                                 19


grains, dairy, seafood and plant protein, refined grains, and empty calories. In interpreting the

table, recall that empty calories and refined grains are inversely coded with lower consumption of

these items resulting in higher component scores. This is not surprising because these categories

are emphasized/deemphasized in the WIC food packages. Earlier evidence shows reduced intakes

of fats and added sugars among WIC participants (Basiotis, Kramer-LeBlanc, and Kennedy 1998;

Wilde, McNamara, and Ranney 1999; Kranz and Siega-Riz 2002; Siega-Riz et al. 2004). The 2009

changes to the WIC food packages resulted in increased purchases of whole grain products (Oh,

Jensen, and Rahkovsky 2016).

Rosenbaum Bounds to Assess Hidden Bias

When referring to hidden bias, we assume that some characteristics are unobserved and are not in

the vector of covariates used in the matching model. Propensity-score matching estimators are

based on the assumption that selection is on observable characteristics. This means that conditional

on the observed covariates, the process by which units are selected into treatment is independent

of unmeasured variables that affect the outcome variable. In order to estimate the extent to which

such selection on unobservable or hidden bias may affect the estimates, we conducted a

Rosenbaum bounds sensitivity analysis (Rosenbaum 2002; DiPrete and Gangl 2004; Drichoutis,

Nayga, and Lazaridis 2009). This method assesses the sensitivity of the significance levels of the

ATT and estimates the magnitude of hidden bias it would take to change inference assessments

from statistical significance to insignificance. Details about computing Rosenbaum bounds can

be found in Rosenbaum (2002) and DiPrete and Gangl (2004). We used the “rbounds” package in

R to conduct the sensitivity analysis (Keele 2010). Tables 3 and 4 present Rosenbaum’s gamma,

the measure of hidden bias that that could potentially switch an inference decision at the 5 and 10

percent critical values.
                                                                                                 20


       Gamma is interpreted as the magnitude by which an unobserved variable would need to

affect the odds ratio of treatment in order to cause an inference decision to switch from being

significant to insignificant. As the Rosenbaum test reveals, our ATT from the sample of all WIC

participants switches from being statistically significant to insignificant at a gamma value of 1.13

and 1.17 at the 5 and 10 percent levels, respectively. This indicates that the estimate would remain

significant at the 10 percent level in the presence of hidden bias up to 17 percent. Table 3 shows

that the significance of the large ATT estimated for the sample of WIC households who redeemed

WIC benefits is very robust to hidden bias with gamma values of 2.82 and 3.05 at the 5 and 10

percent levels, respectively.

       The statistically significant ATTs on the component measures estimated from this

subsample in Table 4 are also robust to hidden bias. The refined grain component is the most

sensitive with a gamma of 1.22 corresponding to the 5 percent critical value. Gammas for the

other component scores range from 1.28 to 2.25 at this critical value. Hence, the ATTs on most

of the significant component measures would remain significant at the 5 percent level even in the

presence of substantial hidden bias.

Additional Evidence on the Importance of WIC Foods

To summarize, the evidence presented so far supports the conclusion that the improvements in

nutritional quality attributable to WIC participation are driven by WIC food packages and are not

simply a reflection of selection bias. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the FoodAPS

sample was not stratified by time of month or date of delivery of WIC benefits. For this reason,

the samples of WIC households redeeming and not redeeming their WIC benefits should be nearly

random. Indeed, these two groups of households have very similar characteristics as exhibited in

the last two columns of Table 1.6
                                                                                                 21


       However, there are three potential issues that deserve further attention. First, WIC foods

must be redeemed at WIC approved retailers. If these retailers stock healthier foods in general,

then differences in shopping venue could account for some of the improvements in nutritional

quality attributable to the subsample that redeemed WIC foods. Second, our finding could reflect

a secondary selection problem wherein some households who enroll in the program are

systematically more likely to only partially redeem food benefits. This could occur if shopping

venues available to the household stock some but not all of the foods in the WIC package or if

some households deem some WIC foods to be undesirable. Third, infant formula is included in

the calculation of HPI. The inclusion of infant formula in HPI could affect the measures of HPI

and its components.

       To address the first issue, we restricted the sample to include only participating and non-

participating households who shopped at a WIC-approved retailer during the interview period.

This restriction resulted in the removal of three households from the eligible but non-participating

sample and four households who were on WIC but did not redeem WIC benefits during the

interview week. Thus, it is unlikely that venue explains the results because the overwhelming

majority of our sample shopped at a WIC approved retailer. However, the exclusion of these few

households did alter the matched samples as can be seen by comparing the numbers of observations

in Table 5 to those in Table 3. Nevertheless, as shown in Table 5, the ATT estimates are very

close to those reported above. For WIC participants without regard for redemptions, the ATT

estimate was 2.671. For those who redeemed and did not redeem foods during the interview week,

the estimates were 9.385 and -0.963, respectively. Thus, in comparison to Table 3, no materially

different conclusions are reached from the analysis summarized in Table 5.
                                                                                                 22


       To address the second issue, we re-estimated the ATT from the original matched samples

in Table 3 but using an HPI that excludes items from shopping events where WIC redemptions

accounted for more than 50 percent of the total expenditures. In FoodAPS, each shopping event

is flagged as to whether WIC benefits were redeemed during the purchase event and the dollar

value of WIC redemptions is indicated.7 Unfortunately, FoodAPS does not provide item-level

information on which items were purchased with WIC benefits and which were purchased using

other forms of payment. However, of the 273 WIC purchase events, the overwhelming majority

were solely WIC events. These could be identified by the fact that the total value spent on the

shopping occasion was equal to the dollar value of WIC redemptions.8 In only 28 shopping event

cases did WIC redemptions account for less than half of the total value of the food purchases.

Thus, by excluding majority-WIC shopping events, we effectively remove most WIC foods from

the HPI calculation.

       As shown in Table 6, when this revised HPI is used as the outcome, there is no longer a

significant WIC effect. Among all WIC participants without regard for redemptions, the ATT

estimate is -0.087. For those who redeemed and did not redeem foods, the ATT estimates are

1.420 and -0.843, respectively. The estimate for households who did not redeem WIC foods

matches that in Table 3 because these households acquired no foods through WIC during the

interview week and so the HPI score remains unchanged for these households. The magnitude of

each estimate is close to one index point and not statistically different from zero, suggesting that

there is no difference between WIC and eligible non-WIC households once WIC foods are

effectively removed from the measure of nutritional quality. Again, this reinforces the conclusion

above that WIC foods are the best explanation for observed improvements in dietary outcomes
                                                                                                 23


associated with the program, not systematic differences in the characteristics or behaviors of

participating and eligible non-participating households.

       Finally, to address the third concern about infant formula, we re-estimated the ATT from

the original matched samples but excluding infant formula from the HPI calculation. The results

are presented in Appendix 2. As shown, there was no meaningful difference in ATT when infant

formula was excluded from HPI. Somewhat surprisingly, the ATT in Appendix 2 for total dairy is

slightly higher. This could be explained by the fact that some of the formula items were non-dairy,

specialty formulas. Also, exclusion of infant formula removes energy from the index calculation,

which can increase component scores. Thus we conclude that the primary findings are robust to

the exclusion of infant formula.

Additional Insights on WIC from FoodAPS

FoodAPS includes the response to a self-assessed question about whether the household is

following a healthy diet. As reported in Table 1, the proportion responding yes to this question is

similar across WIC participants and eligible non-participants but is a bit lower among those who

redeemed WIC benefits during the reporting period in relation to those who did not. As a follow-

up, we matched those with yes and no responses to this question separately to eligible

nonparticipants to obtain ATT estimates for each group. For those responding yes, the ATT is

3.720 (Std. Err=1.710) and is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. For those responding

no, the ATT estimate is about 1.5 index points lower at 2.137 (Std. Err=1.474) and is not

significantly different from zero. Nevertheless, this is not a substantial difference in the ATT

estimates and the fact that these estimates are similar provides some additional context to the

selection issue we explore above.
                                                                                                24


       Another concern is whether households in lower income neighborhoods without access to

nearby supermarkets may benefit less from nutritional programs like WIC. Given the geographic

component of FoodAPS, we explore the heterogeneity that may exist because some households

have limited access to supermarkets. We match 93 WIC households with limited supermarket

access and 330 WIC households with supermarket access to eligible non-WIC households. We

estimate the ATTs for each subgroup. The ATT estimate from the limited access subgroup is

2.340 (Std. Err=1.971) and is not statistically different from zero while the ATT from the subgroup

without limited access is 2.984 (Std. Err=1.417) and is significant at the 5 percent level. Given

the similarity of these ATT estimates, there is no compelling evidence from this sample that

nutritional improvements from WIC are adversely affected by supermarket access.

Robustness Check Using Machine Learning

With propensity matching, we assumed a logistic function between the likelihood of WIC

participation and the covariates. In reality, this relationship can be complex and unknown, and

assuming a parametric relationship can lead to biases (Busso, DiNardo, and McCrary 2014). Thus,

to further check the robustness of our findings presented above, we apply an alternative method, a

non-parametric supervised machine learning approach called the “honest” random forest that

places no restrictions on model complexity to derive the ATTs (Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager

2017; Athey 2015; Wager and Athey 2018). An “honest” tree splits a randomly selected subsample

for the use of model structure estimation. Therefore, the asymptotic properties of treatment effect

estimates within the splits are the same as if the partition had been exogenously given (Athey,

Tibshirani, and Wager 2017; Athey and Imbens 2016; Wager and Athey 2018). We use an

algorithm developed by Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager (2017), which is available in the R package

“grf”.9 Since we are not concerned about the interpretability of the prediction model, we included
                                                                                                  25


additional covariates to check if they can improve estimation.10 Essentially, these covariates help

us detect similarities among WIC participants and among eligible non-participants and assign them

to different groups (leaves). This method relies on a type of residual-on-residual regression in the

leaves to eliminate the effect of confounding. Intuitively, if our main findings from the propensity

score matching analysis are a result of the true data-generating process, we should not see different

effects when we use the alternative approach provided through this machine-learning based

method.

       Generalized random forest estimates are reported in Table 7 and are consistent with the

main results discussed above.11 Specifically, we find similar ATTs on the overall WIC sample

(ATT=2.267), the sample that redeemed WIC (ATT=7.720), and the sample that did not redeem

WIC (ATT=-0.903). These results confirm our conclusion that only those who redeemed WIC

observe a significant WIC effect, or that the WIC package is the driver of increased HPI. Our

examination of the HPI that excluded majority WIC purchase events yields an ATT of -0.109,

which is close to zero, statistically insignificant, and similar to that reported in Table 6. This

supports our conclusion that WIC-provided foods are driving the improvement in diet and that this

improvement is not simply a reflection of healthier households selecting into the program. When

reviewing the effect of WIC on the HPI components, the list of components with positive and

statistically significant improvements is similar to that reported above and includes total fruit,

whole grain, dairy, seafood and plant protein, sodium, and empty calories. The total vegetables

component was negative in Table 4 and is negative and significant in Table 7. The estimate for

the total-vegetable component is notable because at the time the FoodAPS data were collected,

white potatoes were not permitted for WIC purchases (Oliveira and Frazão 2015). White potatoes

are also the most widely consumed fresh vegetable in the United States (USDA-ERS 2017c). The
                                                                                                 26


exclusion of white potatoes from WIC-eligible fresh vegetables is a plausible explanation for the

negative ATT on the total vegetable component. There is also evidence that WIC recipients prefer

to purchase fruits than vegetables with their WIC vouchers and CVV (Andreyeva and Luedicke

2015).

4. Limitations

There are a few limitations in this study. One is that other members of the household could

consume foods purchased with WIC benefits. Unfortunately, it is not possible to study the

consumption of foods among household members using FoodAPS data. If there exists program

spillover from WIC recipients to non-recipients, the improvements in purchases we measure may

not accrue exclusively to the targeted individual. Even though our study finds a meaningful effect

of WIC foods on the healthiness of purchases, we are unable to make the connection between

healthier purchase and consumption or better health. This would be an important area for future

research with data availability.

         Another limitation is that FoodAPS was conducted between 2012 and 2013, during which

time a few states were moving to the Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) system. We find evidence

that most WIC purchase events were exclusively WIC purchase events in that all or most items

were purchased with WIC benefits. The availability of EBT could facilitate the spread of the

benefits over several shopping events. At present, most states have adopted EBT. To the extent

EBT facilitates a more complete redemption of WIC benefits, our findings may underestimate the

effect of WIC foods on purchase quality.

         Finally, the FoodAPS datasets constitute a unique and valuable source of data but there are

some constraints inherent in their use. First, FoodAPS is cross-sectional, which makes it difficult
                                                                                                 27


to access longer-term effects of WIC. For example, we find that WIC households had healthier

purchases only when WIC benefits were redeemed. It would be incorrect to conclude that other

aspects of WIC, such as nutrition education, are unimportant because such a conclusion would

require follow-up with time. In addition, FoodAPS contains a relatively small sample of WIC

households. Because of this, further heterogeneity tests were not possible given limited statistical

power.

5. Conclusions

Children of low-income households tend to lag behind other children on a wide range of health

outcomes. They also tend to be food insecure and have inadequate intake of important nutrients.

As previously discussed, the role of WIC in improving birth, health and nutritional outcomes has

been studied extensively. The findings of these studies generally suggest that WIC participation is

associated with improved outcomes. However, most earlier work showing beneficial effects of

WIC on diet have been unable to convincingly determine whether the observed beneficial effects

on diet are due to the program or to self-selection into the program.

         We addressed this important topic using the FoodAPS data and found that households

participating in WIC have higher HPI value in comparison to eligible non-participating

households. While this finding is consistent with earlier findings linking WIC to improvements in

diet quality, we found that this difference is driven entirely by households who redeemed WIC

foods during the interview week. Importantly, we did not find any difference between WIC

participating households that did not redeem WIC foods and WIC-eligible but non-participating

households. Moreover, there was no difference in purchase quality when majority WIC shopping

events were excluded from the HPI calculation. These findings suggest that WIC foods explain
                                                                                                    28


the improvement in relative quality of household food purchases, not self-selection of more

nutrition-conscious households into the program. This is the key contribution of the present study.

       To be clear, it is not surprising to find that household purchases were healthier when WIC

program benefits were used to purchase foods. After all, foods eligible for purchase under WIC

are specifically designed to help beneficiaries meet dietary guidelines. Instead, the evidence

against self-selection being an explanation for improvements in the quality of purchases lies in two

main findings. First, WIC households had healthier purchases only when benefits were redeemed.

During weeks when benefits were not redeemed, the nutritional quality of purchases among WIC

households was no different from that of eligible non-participating households. Second, among

those redeeming WIC benefits, the improvement in purchase quality disappeared once WIC

purchase events were excluded from the purchase quality index. After exclusion, there was no

longer a difference between those households who redeemed WIC foods and eligible

nonparticipating households. Taken together, the evidence presented here suggests that foods

provided by WIC can explain most if not all of the improvement in the quality of food purchases.

There is little if anything left that can be explained by systematic differences in the characteristics

of participating and non-participating households.

       Access to the FoodAPS data permitted us to look at food purchases, the first link in a chain

connecting WIC participation to better child and maternal health outcomes. Earlier studies have

looked at links further along this chain such as diet quality, indicators of nutritional adequacy, and

birth outcomes. The focus on purchases is important because we were able to examine the point

in the chain where behaviors related to self-selection into the program would be easiest to detect.

Had there been evidence of healthier purchases either among participating households who did not

redeem benefits or among the non-WIC purchases of households who did redeem benefits, it would
                                                                                               29


have supported an argument that WIC households would have been likely to make healthier

purchases regardless of the program. We found evidence of neither. Thus, our findings suggest

that WIC-provided foods are central to the beneficial program outcomes documented in earlier

studies. Moreover, our findings on purchase quality align nicely with earlier findings on diet

quality.

       Overall, the findings of this study point to the importance of the WIC program in helping

participants acquire the foods needed for a healthier diet. The ability of WIC to continue serving

eligible households could be curtailed, however, if current proposals to significantly cut WIC

funding push through. This issue becomes even more relevant for eligible households when

considering that WIC is different from other welfare programs in that it is not an entitlement

program. Not everyone who is eligible for WIC assistance is guaranteed to receive it because the

reach of the program depends on adequate funding.

Endnotes

  1. In 2012 and 2013, the average dollar value of WIC foods was $45.00 and $43.26 per

     recipient per month, respectively (USDA FNS 2018). Benefits by household would be

     higher because there can be more than one WIC beneficiary per household. The average

     household size of WIC participants in April 2014 was 4.1 persons (USDA FNS 2017).

  2. Since this debate, WIC food packages have been updated. The revised food packages

     include new food categories (e.g., fruits and vegetables, whole-grains, and infant foods),

     adjusted maximum purchase quantities, and optional food substitution policies to

     accommodate dietary behaviors of ethnic groups (USDA FNS 2011). The revised food

     packages were implemented in 2009, several years before FoodAPS.

  3. Educational attainment reflects the highest attainment of anyone in the household. The

     number of WIC infants and WIC children is based on individuals aged 0 to 1 and 1 to 4,

     respectively. A binary measure is used to indicate the presence of a WIC eligible

     woman. This is set to one if there was a pregnant woman in the household, there was an

     infant being breastfed, or if there was a birth within the household within the last three

     months. There is the potential for underreporting WIC-eligible women since WIC

     provides postpartum benefits for six months but FoodAPS flags birth events within the

     past three months.

  4. Our use of one and ten mile radii for urban and rural tracts is analogous to the definition

     used to identify limited access to supermarkets for purposes of defining food deserts (see

     USDA ERS 2017b).

  5. We did not include supermarket access to avoid the causal loop. The majority of

     supermarkets take WIC. It is unclear whether households take up WIC because they
                                                                                              40


   have access to supermarkets or whether they shop at a supermarket that takes WIC

   because of WIC participation.

6. The two groups of households differ statistically only on the household members

   classified as African American (at 0.05 level).

7. In October 2009, the USDA revised the WIC food package and introduced cash-value

   vouchers (CVV) for fruits and vegetables. Since FoodAPS does not separately identify

   CVV, the relatively small value recorded for fruits and vegetables expenditures when

   WIC benefits were used may reflect misreporting of the vegetables and fruits

   expenditures when using the CVV (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and

   Medicine. 2017). Therefore, our estimates of the effect of WIC benefits may be

   underestimated (i.e., a lower bound).

8. The number of shopping events will not match the number of households because

   households can have multiple shopping events during the interview period.

9. The “grf” package version used in this study is 0.9.5.

10. These additional covariates included alternative measures of supermarket accessibility,

   household use of nutrition information, number of meals consumed at home during the

   interview period, and additional indicators of household economic status in addition to

   those covariates listed in Table 2. The trees were also estimated using only the covariates

   in Table 2, but results (not reported) are similar to those reported below in Table 7.

11. Appendix 3 presents the generalized random forest estimates of the ATTs without infant

   formula.
