                                              ABSTRACT

We incorporate trade imbalances into a quantitative model of bilateral trade in manufactures, dividing
the world into forty countries. Fitting the model to 2004 data on GDP and bilateral trade we calculate
how relative wages, real wages, and welfare would differ in a counterfactual world with all current
accounts balancing. Our results indicate that closing the current accounts requires modest changes
in relative wages. The country with the largest deficit (the United States) needs its wage to fall by
around 10 percent relative to the country with the largest surplus (Japan). But the prevalence of nontraded
goods means that the real wage in Japan barely rises while the U.S. real wage falls by less than 1 percent.
The geographic barriers implied by the current pattern of trade are sufficiently asymmetric that large
bilateral deficits remain even after current accounts balance. The U.S. manufacturing trade deficit
with China falls to $65 billion from its 2004 level of $167 billion.

       Theories of international trade typically assume trade balance. Yet any newspaper

reader knows that trade is far from balanced, a source of great unease among the citizens

of deficit countries. We incorporate imbalances into a quantitative model of trade flows

to calculate what relative wages, real wages, the manufacturing share of GDP, and the

pattern of bilateral trade would look like in a counterfactual world with all current accounts

balancing. While our exercise does not point to what policy would eliminate the imbalances,

it does suggest the magnitudes of the long-run adjustments that such a policy would entail.

       We conduct our analysis using data for 2004 for the world, dividing it into forty “coun-

tries.”1 Table 1 lists the countries, their GDP’s and several diﬀerent external balance mea-

sures.2 The table begins with the broadest measure, the current account balance, followed

by the balance on goods and services, ending with the balance on manufactures.3 The

United States has by far the greatest current account imbalance, running a deficit of $664
   1
       We took the fifty largest, as measured by GDP in 2000, grouping all others into a “country” labeled

ROW. Due to poor data we moved Saudi Arabia, Poland, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Puerto Rico,

and the Czech Republic into ROW as well. To mitigate the eﬀect of entrepôt trade, which our approach

here is ill-equipped to handle, we have combined (1) Belgium, Luxembourg (which we pulled out of ROW),

and the Netherlands, (2) Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, and (3) China and Hong Kong

into single entities. The result is forty entities, which we henceforth refer to as countries, spanning the

globe.
   2
     Sources are as follows: GDP is from the World Bank (2006), the current account balance and balance

on goods and services are from IMF (2006), trade in manufactures (unilateral and bilateral) is from United

Nations Statistics Division (2006). The most recent bilateral trade data are for 2004; hence all of our

analysis is based on that year.
   3
     A well known statistical discrepancy results in nonzero current account balances and trade balances for

the world. For analytical reasons, we want to remove this discrepancy. Rather than force it all into ROW,

we instead attributed one fortieth of it to each country. Since we measure bilateral trade in manufactures

from the importer side, the trade balance of the world in manufactures is zero by construction.



                                                     1
billion or nearly 6 percent of its GDP.4 The countries with the largest current account

balances, Japan, Germany, and China (in that order), collectively run a surplus of $362

billion. For the largest players, the trade balance in manufactures is the main piece of the

overall current account. It’s the focus of our analysis here.

       While unilateral imbalances command considerable attention, the U.S. obsession with

China’s trade suggests that bilateral trade imbalances are also a major concern. The last

two columns of Table 1 report each country’s bilateral trade surplus in manufactures with

the United States and with China. Note that the U.S. trade deficit with China is one third of

its total deficit in manufactures while China’s surplus with the United States is larger than

its overall trade surplus in manufactures. China is running a manufacturing trade deficit

with the world less the United States. Note in particular that China runs sizable deficits

with many of its neighbors in the Asia Pacific region. Its largest deficit is with Japan. The

United States runs deficits with most countries. Our analysis yields predictions about how

these bilateral imbalances would respond to an elimination of unilateral current account

imbalances.

       Table 2 reports gross manufacturing exports and imports as well as the manufacturing

trade balance. It also indicates what the manufacturing trade surplus would have to be

in order to set current account balances to zero, holding fixed other components of the

current account. Note that by far the largest adjustment is required for the United States,

an increase in net exports of manufactures from a deficit of over $485 billion to a surplus
   4
       Among the deficit countries in 2004, the U.S. current account deficit is large even relative to GDP.

Only Australia, Greece, and Portugal have larger deficit to GDP ratios. Several small countries run current

account surpluses that are much larger fractions of their GDP’s, however. The Bureau of Economics

Analysis reports that the US current account deficit rose to $857 billion in 2006.

of $179 billion. The next largest adjustments are decreases in net manufacturing exports:

Japan’s and Germany’s surpluses each fall to just over $100 billion while China’s falls to

$36 billion. In this paper we explore the implications of achieving this particular set of

trade balances in manufactures.

       Our methodology builds on a recent literature that integrates the gravity equation exhib-

ited by bilateral trade flows into general equilibrium.5 This research provides a framework

for tracking the implications of various counterfactuals and policy experiments for diﬀerent

countries of the world, recognizing the role of trade barriers in fragmenting world markets.

We put such a model of bilateral trade to work to assess the counterfactual experiment

of simultaneously removing current account imbalances from each country. We examine

the resulting bilateral imbalances, relative wages, real wages, welfare, and manufacturing’s

share in these forty economies.

       While our theoretical framework is one that has been used before in modeling bilateral

trade, we depart from a central feature of the gravity specification. The standard approach

has used sundry geographical, historical, linguistic, and political variables as indicators of

bilateral resistance to trade. Instead, we treat bilateral resistance for each country pair as

a parameter which we identify, in combination with other parameters of the model, directly

from current bilateral trade data, letting the bilateral trade flows speak for themselves.6

       Contributions include Eaton and Kortum (2002), Anderson and van Wincoop (2003), Redding and

Venables (2004), and Chaney (2006).

    Equation (15) in Eaton and Kortum (2002) provides a hint that one can go a long way without imposing

structure on trade costs. They show how the share of spending on domestic producers provides a simple

statistic for a country’s gains from trade. Furthermore Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum (2003) show

that the bilateral trade matrix was a suﬃcient statistic for the matrix of trade costs in simulating a model

of individual producers in international competition. Recent work by Waugh (2007) pursues a related




                                                     3
    A drawback of the standard approach for our analysis here is that the commonly used

indicators for bilateral resistance are typically symmetric, often with the implication that,

the error component aside, trade should balance bilaterally. By treating bilateral resistance

as a parameter that we infer from data we impose no structure, not even symmetry, on the

determinants of bilateral trade. China suggests a major deviation from symmetry with its

large manufacturing trade surplus with the relatively distant United States in combination

with its large deficits with its neighbors.

    Our attempt to quantify the implications of eliminating current account deficits comes

with two important disclaimers. First, our exercise is pure comparative statics. We oﬀer

no explanation for why the current account deficits exist or what market response or policy

intervention would close them.7 We simply use current data to parameterize a static model

of bilateral trade flows and calculate the new equilibrium with zero deficits. We hope that at

some point our framework can be integrated into a dynamic model that incorporates capital

flows as well as flows of goods and services. Second, in focusing on trade in manufactures

we do not model trade in nonmanufactures. Since nonmanufactures include such diverse

items as soy beans, crude oil, hip hop, and patent royalties (for the last two, bilateral trade

data are limited anyway) we defer modeling their determinants for future work. For now

we simply treat each country’s nonmanufacturing trade deficit as a parameter that we take

from the data.

    In this first respect our work resembles Obstfeld and Rogoﬀ (2005), who also employ a

static trade model to examine the implications of eliminating current account imbalances.

Focusing on real exchange rates and the terms of trade, they ignore real wages and welfare,
approach, in a model with capital accumulation, for assessing the contribution of trade to development.
   7
     Padamitriou et al. (2006) provide an excellent review of the debate about the causes and consequences

of the U.S. deficit.

which are central to our analysis. Furthermore their quantitative analysis employs a stylized

three-region model with much symmetry imposed. In contrast, our framework can grapple

with an arbitrary number of countries while capturing the asymmetries apparent in the

GDP and trade data. We thus capture much more tightly geographic features of the world.

Where comparable, our results are closest to what Obstfeld and Rogoﬀ call a “very gradual”

unwinding, or a decade-long adjustment.

      While our framework can quite handily deal with a multitude of countries, its analytic

essence derives from the two-country model of trade and unilateral transfers of Dornbusch,

Fischer, and Samuelson (1977). We explore the connection between our analysis and this

earlier literature in the Appendix, showing how a marriage of our techniques and theirs

can deliver a sensible back-of-the envelope calculation about the implication removing a

transfer from the rest of the world to the United States.



1       World Equilibrium

Consider a world of N countries (with n denoting an importer and i an exporter), a con-

tinuum of diﬀerentiated goods, and a constant elasticity of substitution aggregator (with

parameter σ). Under these conditions, several theories of international trade lead to a

gravity equation of the form:

                 Ti (ci dni )−θ
(1)     π ni = PN
                                −θ
                k=1 Tk (ck dnk )

where π ni is country i’s share in country n’s spending. Eaton and Kortum (2002) derive

such an expression (their equation (10)) from a Ricardian model in which Ti reflects the

absolute advantage of country i, ci the cost of inputs there, and dni ≥ 1 the additional

“iceberg” cost of delivering goods to n from i. The parameter θ, which in the Ricardian

                                              5
model reflects comparative advantage, governs the sensitivity of demand to cost.8

       We apply this equation to bilateral trade in manufactures among our forty countries.

Multiplying it by total spending on manufacturing in each country n, denoted by XnM , and

summing across the destinations i sells to, gives us the goods market clearing conditions:
                    X
                    N
(2)      YiM    =         π ni XnM ,
                    n=1

where YiM is country i’s gross production of manufactures.

       If trade balances, as is often assumed, then XiM = YiM . Since our focus here is on the

yawning deficits and surpluses in manufactures, we don’t impose this condition. Instead we

simply acknowledge the deficits that we observe, DiM = XiM −YiM in our general-equilibrium

formulation.

       To recognize (i) that manufactures are only one component of final expenditure and

(ii) that much of the gross output of manufactures goes into making manufactures we need

two additional parameters. We denote the share of final spending on manufactures as α

and the share of value added in manufacturing gross production as β. We are following

Alvarez and Lucas (2006) in treating final demand as an aggregate of manufactures and

nonmanufactures, with manufactures having a share α.

       Denoting the price index of manufactures in country i as pi , we can rewrite (1) as:

                    Ti (wiβ p1−β
                             i   dni )−θ
(3)      π ni   = PN           β 1−β
                                            ,
                                         −θ
                   k=1 Tk (wk pk dnk )
   8
       As Eaton and Kortum (2002) point out, equivalent formulations emerge under Armington assumptions,

as in Anderson and van Wincoop (2003), or monopolistic competition, as in Redding and Venables (2004).

In the first case Ti is the share of country i’s goods in preferences while in the second it is the number

of goods that country i produces. In either case, the parameter θ is replaced by σ − 1. Yet another

formulation follows from specifying a Pareto distribution, with parameter θ, in the model of Melitz (2003),

as in Chaney (2006).


                                                    6
where wi reflects wages in country i.

       Eaton and Kortum (2002) show (their equation (16)) that with a CES aggregator for

manufactures the price index in country n is given by:
           "N                      #−1/θ
             X        β 1−β
(4) pn = γ       Ti (wi pi dni )−θ       ,
                    i=1

where γ is a constant that depends on only the parameters θ and σ. Thus we can rewrite

the trade share (3) as:
              Ã              !−θ
                wiβ p1−β
                     i   dni
(5) π ni = Ti                    .
                   pn /γ

       We denote the total labor supply in country i as Li , which we treat as exogenous. Under

perfect competition final output, or GDP, is Yi = wi Li while final spending is Xi = Yi + Di ,

where Di is the overall trade deficit.9 To connect final spending with production and

spending on manufactures, we write total demand for manufactures by country i as the

sum of final and intermediate demand:

         XiM = αXi + (1 − β)YiM = YiM + DiM .

Solving for manufacturing production yields
               ∙                 ¸
        M    α              1 M
      Yi =      wi Li + Di − Di .
             β              α

Adding DnM to YnM gives country n’s total purchases of manufactures:
             ∙                         ¸
       M   α                 1−β M
     Xn =      wn Ln + Dn −       Dn .
           β                   α
   9
       Our analysis is consistent with an arbitrary number of factors as long as there are no systematic factor-

intensity diﬀerences between manufactures and nonmanufactures. In this case Li represents a (column)

vector of factor endowments and wi (when it multiplies Li ) a (row) vector of factor rewards or (when it

appears without Li ) as an index of factor rewards. In keeping with the Ricardian origins of our model we

nevertheless refer to the factor input as “labor” and its reward as the “wage.”


                                                        7
Substituting these expressions into the goods market clearing conditions (2) we get:


                                  ∙                   ¸
                    1 M X
                           N
                                                1−β M
(6)     wi Li + Di − Di =     π ni wn Ln + Dn −    Dn .
                    α     n=1
                                                 α

      Taking as given (i) the trade imbalances Di and DiM , (ii) labor supplies Li , (iii) para-

meters of technology Ti , (iv) parameters of trade costs dni , and (v) parameters α, β, and

θ, an equilibrium is a set of wages wi and prices pi that satisfy (4) and (6), with π ni given

by (5).

      We can resolve for the equilibrium under counterfactual trade imbalances, denoted Di0

and DiM0 . We denote the post adjustment value of any variable x as x0 and the change in

             b = x0 /x. The counterfactual wages and prices must satisfy the market clearing
its value as x

values of GDP for the Y ’s and trade shares for the π’s. What’s neat about this represen-

tation is that, aside from GDP and bilateral trade data, we only need values for the three

parameters α, β, and θ.

      It is straightforward, using Theorems 1, 2, and 3 of Alvarez and Lucas (2006), to prove

                                         b and pb, to these equations, up to the normalization

i.e. world GDP Y is treated as the numeraire.

      The particular exercise we conduct here is to ask what would happen if the manufac-

turing trade deficits had to adjust to set all current accounts to zero. That is, for each

country n we set:


        DnM0 = DnM + CAn


where CAn is country n’s original current account surplus and DnM its original manufactur-

ing trade deficit in 2004 (column 4 of Table 2 presents −DnM0 ).10 In our counterfactual, we

are fixing the values of the current account net of the manufacturing trade balance as well

as the trade balance on goods and service net of the manufacturing trade balance. What

that means is that these magnitudes are fixed as a fraction of world GDP.
 10
      In doing so, we set each country’s total counterfactual trade deficit to:


        Dn0 = DnM0 + Dn − DnM .




                                                       9
2     Calibration and Computation

Aside from data on 2004 GDP’s (for the Y ’s) and on 2004 trade shares (for the π’s) to

stick in (7) and (8), we need values for the parameters θ, α, and β.

    We set θ = 8.28 as estimated in Eaton and Kortum (2002) using price data. We also

consider the lower value of θ = 3.60 obtained in Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum

(2003).

    We can calibrate α calculating for each country:

             βYnM + DnM  V M + DnM
      αn =              = n        ,
              Yn + Dn     Yn + Dn

where VnM is manufacturing value added (available for most of our countries from World

Development Indicators). We calculate the ratio of manufacturing value added plus the

trade deficit in manufactures to GDP plus the overall trade deficit on goods and services.

Averaging this ratio across countries in our sample (for which data on manufacturing value

added was available) yields α = 0.188.

    Notice that β n = VnM /YnM . From United Nations Industrial Development Organization

(2006) we have data for many of our countries on both manufacturing value added and

manufacturing gross production. Averaging this ratio yields β = 0.312.

                                                       b and pb. With 40 countries, run-
    A simple iterative procedure provides the solution w

ning this procedure in GAUSS on a good quality laptop, the solution is obtained almost

instantaneously.

    For each country i = 1, . . . , 40, we present the change in a set of outcomes, presented as

the ratio of the counterfactual value to its original value. The wage change for country i is

       bi itself, which also equals that country’s change in GDP. County i’s counterfactual

                   bi Yi . Since we also solve for pbi , we can express the change in the

                pbi        1 + Di /Yi

Counterfactual bilateral trade share of country i in n can be constructed from the original

shares using

                    bi−θβ pbi −θ(1−β)
               π ni w
     π 0ni = PN           −θβ −θ(1−β)

Thus the counterfactual bilateral trade flow of n’s imports from i is

                          β n            β

Finally, the counterfactual share of manufacturing value added in GDP is

      ViM0   α (Yi0 + Di0 ) − DiM0
           =                       .

3    Results

Table 3 reports the changes to relative wages, real wages, and welfare that our exercise

claims are required to achieve the target manufacturing trade deficits reported in Table 2.

Note that these numbers imply less than a 5 percent increase in the wage for either China,

Germany, or Japan, the big surplus countries, and a 7 percent decline for the United States.

In other words, despite the large U.S. trade deficit, the results imply that achieving balance

is associated with a fairly modest 10 percent decline in the value of the U.S. dollar relative

to the currencies of the big surplus countries (assuming the adjustment takes the form of

an exchange rate realignment, holding wages fixed as expressed in the local currency).


                                                11
   The associated changes in the real wage, reported in column 2, are negligible for these

large countries. There are two reasons why the real wage eﬀects are so attenuated. For one

thing, the trade share data imply a huge “home bias” in manufacturing (that is, countries

spend a disproportionately large amount on domestically produced goods) so that domestic

manufactures, produced with local labor, dominate the manufacturing price index. For

another, with manufactures constituting less than twenty percent of final expenditure, the

nontraded sector dominates the overall price index.

   The third column reports the change in real expenditure taking into account the change

in the deficit. Here the eﬀects are more pronounced, and largely dominated by the change

in the current account itself. Together the second and third columns indicate a small

“secondary burden” of adjusting current account deficits. Countries that must reduce their

deficits experience a lower real wage, so real expenditure falls by more than the drop in

transfers from abroad, with the opposite for countries that expand their deficits. But the

gain or loss of the transfer itself overwhelms the real wage adjustment in its eﬀect on

welfare.

   We’ve solved for wages in the new equilibrium of a 40 country trading system. How

well could we have predicted each country’s wage change just from its own existing current

account? Figure 1 plots the wage change in Table 3 against the current account deficit in

Table 3 relative to GDP. The relationship is generally downward sloping but not monotonic.

While Algeria and Norway have smaller surpluses than Switzerland relative to their GDP,

they require a much larger wage increase due to their relative isolation. At the other

extreme Portugal runs a larger deficit than Australia but needs less of a wage decline to

adjust. The direction of the wage change is in accordance with the direction of the required

balance except for France, where the wage goes up slightly despite its current deficit.


                                            12
   A trade deficit in manufactures crowds out domestic manufacturing. Since our coun-

terfactual experiment involves adjustments in manufacturing trade deficits, it has con-

sequences for manufacturing’s share of production. The last column of Table 3 reports

the change in the manufacturing share of GDP resulting from the closing of the current

account deficit. The results indicate the largest increase in the United States, of 4.7 per-

centage points. The direction of the change is always predicted by the sign of the current

account surplus, with deficit countries needing to produce more and surplus countries less.

But the magnitudes are quite diﬀerent as a consequence of the changes in relative market

sizes implied by relative wage changes.

   How does the overall adjustment get reflected in bilateral deficits for manufactures?

Table 4 reports the actual and counterfactual bilateral deficits for both the United States

and China with each other country. Note that the U.S. deficit with Japan and South

Korea virtually disappear while the U.S. deficit with Germany swings toward a significant

surplus. A large deficit with China nevertheless remains. At the same time China continues

to run large deficits with Korea and Japan. These varied responses reflect asymmetries in

the bilateral resistance measures indicated by current trade patterns. Projecting these

asymmetries into post-adjustment world still means that there is enormous room for large

bilateral imbalances even in a world with overall balance.

   How much do our results depend on our choice of the parameter θ? Using the smaller

value of θ = 3.60 from BEJK (2003) implies that more wage adjustment is necessary (since,

in that case, trade shares are less responsive to wages). With this lower value, the U.S.

wage falls by 18 percent relative to the China’s and by about 20 percent relative to Japan’s

and Germany’s. Nevertheless the decline in the U.S. real wage barely exceeds 1 percent.




                                            13
The implications for bilateral trade flows are nearly invariant to the choice of θ.11



4        Conclusion

We have asked what a static trade model has to say about the magnitudes of adjustments

needed to close current account imbalances as they stood in 2004. By assumption the

manufacturing sector bears the full burden of adjustment, which means that we are likely

providing an upper bound on the required changes there. Given our baseline parameters,

U.S. GDP must fall about seven percent relative to world GDP, while GDP in the major

surplus countries rises by two to four percent. With a smaller elasticity (meaning trade

shares are less responsive to costs), these adjustments are roughly doubled. In either case,

the decline in real wages in the United States is muted, around one percent, since most

goods can’t be traded and even those that could be are often purchased from domestic

producers in a large economy like the United States. According to our static analysis, the

main welfare cost of eliminating the current account deficit is simply the loss of the free

lunch, i.e. the loss of goods that we currently consume but do not pay for until later. That

cost is on the order of six percent of GDP.




  11
       Our analysis does not acknowledge any delay in the response to the counterfactual experiment that

we conduct. We have not introduced any frictions in getting from here to there. Ruhl (2005) provides

an explicit dynamic model to reconcile the observed short-run and long-run responsiveness of trade flows

to changes in policy. Our lower value of θ may better reflect a short-run response and the higher one a

long-run response.

A     A Two-Country Example

With just two countries our analysis collapses to a version of the two-country model of

trade and unilateral transfers of Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (DFS, 1977). We

show how that framework can be used to deliver a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the



                                            16
wage adjustment required to achieve a zero current account between the United States and

the rest of the world.

      Now the world consists of just two countries: the United States and ROW (denoted

with a *). As above there are a continuum of goods z ∈ [0, 1]. Labor endowments are L

and L∗ . Following DFS we assume Cobb-Douglas preferences. Following their notation the

productivity of labor in the United States relative to ROW is A(z) where the goods are

ordered so that A(z) is decreasing in z. Markets are perfectly competitive. We treat the

wage in ROW w∗ as the numeraire.

      If the relative wage of the United States is ω = w/w∗ then the United States will

produce goods z ∈ [0, z] and ROW will produce the rest, where the threshold good satisfies

(9)     A(z) = ω.

To close the model we typically impose trade balance so that the value of US imports

I = (1 − z)wL equals the value of its exports E = zw∗ L∗ , or

              z L∗
(10) ω =           .
             1−z L

An equilibrium is a pair (ω, z) satisfying (9) and (10).

      In fact, the same equilibrium arises if the United State runs a trade deficit, D = I − E.

Then spending by the United States is X = wL + D and spending by ROW is X ∗ =

w∗ L∗ − D. Goods market clearing requires

        (1 − z)(wL + D) = z(w∗ L∗ − D) + D

which reduces to (10). The allocation of world production is determined by comparative

advantage and has nothing to do with which country is spending more or less. This case

captures the argument put forward by Ohlin.

                                               17
     This neutrality arises because we have not introduced any home-bias in expenditures

so what is transferred would have been spent the same way by transferrer and transferee.

Suppose instead that consumers in both countries allocate a fraction α of their spending

to tradable goods, with the rest spent on nontradables. Nontradables are produced with

local labor under constant returns.

     The goods market clearing condition becomes

       α(1 − z)(wL + D) = αz(w∗ L∗ − D) + D

or

          z L∗    (1 − α)D
(11) ω =       +              .
         1−z L   α(1 − z)w∗ L

An equilibrium pair (ω, z) now must satisfy (9) and (11). Relative to D = 0, a positive

deficit shifts up (11) for any given z, thus leading to an equilibrium with a higher US

relative wage ω and lower z. The intuition is that a positive deficit increases US spending

and hence spending on nontradables. To meet this extra demand US workers shift out of

the tradables sector and into the nontradables sector. As they do so, remaining workers

in the tradable sector specialize in producing a narrower range of products, for which US

relative productivity is higher. Thus, the relative wage of US workers goes up.

     The share of US GDP originating in the tradables sector is
                              µ       ¶
          αz(wL + w∗ L∗ )          L∗
       λ=                 = αz 1 +      .
               wL                  ωL

Relative to the case of D = 0, this share is lower if D > 0. The deficit crowds out the

tradable sector.

     What is less apparent in the model, yet perhaps more important, is what happens to

the US real wage. A small share of tradables α, which is a necessary condition for the

                                            18
deficit to have large eﬀects on the relative wage, also implies a large share of spending on

goods whose price exactly parallels changes in the wage. Thus, real wage changes will arise

only through tradables. And, in a big country like the United States, even many tradable

goods are purchased locally. We now parameterize a version of the DFS model that renders

it the two-country version of the model considered in the main text.

     The parameterized probabilistic formulation of the Ricardian model developed in Eaton

and Kortum (2002) projects onto a 2-country worlds as
            µ ¶1/θ µ        ¶1/θ

     A(z) =                      .
             T∗          z

Hence, from (9) we have

               T ω −θ
       z=               .
            T ω−θ + T ∗

     Consider the equilibrium (ω, z) resulting from the current deficit of D, generating ob-

served GDP’s of Y = wL and Y ∗ = w∗ L∗ . Under some counterfactual deficit D0 the

resulting equilibrium would be (ω0 , z 0 ). Letting ω
                                                    b = ω0 /ω, the counterfactual equilibrium

must satisfy

       Using data for the United States in 2006 (in US$ trillions) we have Y = 13.2, Y ∗ = 33.9,

E = 1.4, I = 2.2, and D = 0.8.12 Furthermore, according to the model

          z    E/(Y ∗ − D)
             =             = 0.27
         1−z   I/(Y + D)

(hence z = 0.21 and α = 0.2). Using the estimate of θ = 8.28 from Eaton and Kortum

               b = 0.96, approximately a 4% decline in the US relative wage. Using the
(2002) we find ω

                                          b = 0.92. In either case this change in relative
value of θ = 3.60 from BEJK (2003) yields ω

wages is largely cushioned by a change in prices so that the real wage in the United States

does not fall much.

       To see the eﬀect on prices we need to take a stand on labor requirements in each country.

A natural specification consistent with our specification of A(z) is


         a(z) = T −1/θ z 1/θ


and


         a∗ (z) = T ∗−1/θ (1 − z)1/θ .


In the United States, the resulting prices of tradables are p(z) = wa(z) for z ≤ z and

p(z) = w∗ a∗ (z) for z ≥ z. Integrating over these prices, the exact price index for tradables

in the United States (given Cobb-Douglas preferences) is

                  £                 ¤−1/θ
         p = e−1/θ T w−θ + T ∗ w∗−θ       .

       These numbers are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis except for GDP in ROW which was taken

from World Bank (2006), assuming that world GDP grew at the same rate as US GDP from 2005 to 2006.

Letting the counterfactual price index be p0 and pb = p0 /p, we get

           ω −θ + (1 − z)

Taking into account non-tradables, the change in the real wage is (b  p)α . The U.S. real
