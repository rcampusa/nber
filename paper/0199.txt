                           FAMILY MIGRATION DECISIONS



1.       Introduction

         Following a more general tradition, past economic studies of migra-

tion did not distinguish between personal and family decisions.1 With the

emergence    of   detailed household panel data and of modern family economics,

such    inaccury   is no longer admissible. This paper joins a few very recent

attempts to analyze migration      in the awareness   of the family context.2 In

contrast to most of them, my focus is exclusively on the family context. The

paper defines family ties relevant to migration decisions and explains their

effects on the probability of migration,      on consequent changes in employ—

merit   and earnings of family members, as well as on family integrity      itself.
Hopefully, the paper provides material for a missing chapter on family         economics

as well as an addition to the economics of      labor supply arid of human capital

formation.
         The   analysis starts       explicit recognition that net family gain
                                 from an

rather than net personal gain (of the "head"?) motivates migration of house—
holds. Of course, this distinction disappears         when   the (independent) house-
hold consists of a single person. In a family         consisting   of one member (i1)

       1Perhaps one reason is that the distinction between person and. family
is viewed as a sociological rather than economic issue. Indeed, sociological
research on migration considers the family quite explicitly as a collection
of individuals (cf. Long, 1972, l971, 1975). The most recent survey of the
economic literature (Greenwood, 1975) does not even mention the family context
of migration.

       2DaVanzo (19714, 1976), Kaluzny (1975), Polachek and Horvath (1976),
Sandell (1975). With the exception of DaVanzo (19714), these papers' were
not available to me      prior to the first draft in 1975. The current version
benefitted from the new findings and contains references to them.

mobility       takes      place when                 = B. — C. > 0        ,   where G. is the net real income

gain   from        migration, B. returns and C. costs, all appropriately discounted.

When   two     or more members are                present    in the family and the migration decision

requires that all move, the decision variable becomes Gf =                                       —            where
                                                                                            Rf       C.   ,

         Presumably,             families tend to be               less   mobile than persons unencumbered
by   spouse        and   children.      The economic basis for this phenomenon, or at least
theory, is that in               nuclear         families returns from migration (ZR.) increase
less than costs (Ec.) as I increases with the presence of spouse and children.
Demographic research (Long, 1975) confirms the inhibiting effect of i > 1
and especially            of the presence of children, with somewhat weaker effects of
their   numbers on family migration. One source of locational specificity in

the presence of children is their schooling. Locational choices of the family

are   influenced by access              to schools which the family                  prefers   and can afford.

Once    children are         placed at such schools the costs of geographic mobility are

augmented. Long's research (1975) does, indeed, show that it is not so much

family size (when i > 2                     ),   but   the presence of school—age children that in-

hibits family migration. By the same token, the prospective schooling of

children may well be a factor accelerating mobility of the family when the

children       are     still of       pre—school age.
         In order to focus on the prototype of the economic problems arising
when i     >       1   , I abstract from the presence of children in the analytical model.
In    it I consider         only two streams of costs and returns, so                      that      Gf =     G1
                                                                                                                   +   G2 ,
where   the subscripts refer to husband and wife. Costs and returns should be
understood to include both monetory and                             nonnionetary    components, even if            the

latter appear to be slighted because they are more difficult to identify.
The presence             of children is not dismissed in the empirical analysis.

2.       Moving as a Fami]j

         To simplify the exposition, let us first aggregate all potential des-

tinations into one. Now, in order for the family to move G > 0                   .   If
and      have   the same sign, marital status does not affect the behavior of
husband and wife. Differences arise only when the signs of                    and G2 differ.
In   that case Gf > 0         means that one spouse moves along with the other even
thoui    his (or    her) "private" calculus1       dictates   staying. The net loss of
the "tied" mover must be smaller than         the net gain of the other spouse to

result   in a net family       gain from moving.     Conversely, if   the   signs differ
and Gf < 0      ,   one   member of the couple would have moved, were it not for the
potential loss the other would suffer which exceeds the gain of the would—be—
mover. The      result is one "tied" stayer. In         both cases the "tied" partner

is one whose absolute value of loss (gain) is less than the absolute value

of gain (loss) of the other partner.5

         The   incidence of "tied" movers and        stayers can be   seen in this simple
example: Let the average probability of a geographic move of adult men or
women, when separate, be about 16         percent over the relevant period. If            the

sign of        is independent (in probability) of the sign of G2, only 2.56               per-
cent   of all families will migrate without conflicting "private" incentives,


           "private" optimum Is the maximal          potential personal gain in the
absence of family ties, to be distinguished           from the actual personal gain
or loss, given the family decision.
         5Note the implicit simplifying assumption that the family's perceived
gain from migration (Gf) is the unweighted sum of the separate gains (Gj. +
G2) frczn migration  to a place. If "male chauvinism"            the wife's "G"
receives a lesser weight in family decisions. This would not basically affect
our model, though it may affect the empirical magnitudes. Even without "male
chauvinism", a dollar of wife's current gain receives less weight than a
dollar of husband's current gain, because what matters is the present value
of the gain, and the Ga are defined as present value.
                                               —




and 70.56 percent of families will             stay without      conflict. In the remaining

26.88 percent of all families, one member is moving or staying contrary to

his "private" calculus of gains and losses. The allocation of these "tied

persons" among movers and stayers cannot be gauged in this illustration.

However,      Table 1      provides an answer if we are willing to assume that               and

      are   pb.ired randomly from distributions that are identical and normal. In
this case 7.5        percent of the families move6 and 2/3 of them (7.5 —              2.56 =   5%)

contain "tied movers", while 92.5 percent stay with about one quarter of them

(92.5 —      70.56      22%) containing "tied stayers". The major point of this

example      is the dramatic drop of the migration rate from 16% to 7.5% merely
by the random pairing of spouses. As will be shown, the irthibiting effect
of marital status is reduced, but not eliminated when the special assump-
tions of this illustration are            relaxed. Except that, at the opposite extreme,

if the      gains (or losses) of men always dominated the losses (or gains) of
women, or if      the   pairs of gains were perfectly positively correlated, the
proportion of        men    (and therefore   of women) migrating would be the same whether

they   are married or not.
            To consider the matter in        greater   generality, drop the assumption of
independence between the signs of                  and G2 and simply assume a bivariate
distribution of             and G2, with means and variances            l' °   2' 2'   and   cor-
relation p12. Now, the probability of migration of persons, or the "private"
probability of each spouse is P(G. > 0) the area in the distribution of
                                                       ,



G. to the right of G. =           0 ,   in Figure 1. The size of this area is inversely
related to the standardized value of G =                   0 , namely



               figure appears in Table 1(b) on the assumption that G1                  and G2
are   uncorrelated (s = 0) and equal, on average (k = 1).

migration probabilities are identical for each sex. Yet the probability of
family migration is different, because it is related to CVf and CVI. < CV.

In other words, when the two gains (or losses) are perfectly correlated or

when one spouse's gain (or loss) is negligible, and is therefore always dominated

by the other, the overall frequency of migration is not affected by marital

status.

              It is    clear also that              CVf
                                                            =

the      maximum      value     of the square root expression is unity. In general there

is a deterrent effect of marital status which is stronger the lesser (or the

more negative) the correlation of                                    and             For p < 1     ,    the minimum
value of CVf is reached when k = 1

to       CVI, for several values of p and k. In the bottom—hand panel of Table 1

we can     get   some notion of the orders of magnitude in the reduction of the

family     migration     probabilities as parameter p is decreased and                  k   increased.

can   be   inspected in a normal          probability    table. These are      listed   in the

bottom     part of Table 1 for values of k for 0 < k              <   1    and. of p, for
—lp+l
           It    appears from the table that an equalization              of work   experience of

men and women, and presumably a consequent equalization of the distribution

of gains from migration (that is, an increase of k toward 1) brings about a

reduction in family propensities to migrate, provided p ,                     the   correlation

among      gains from migration of         spouses, remains unchanged. The deterrent

effect     of a higher k is stronger at lower correlation levels; for given levels

of k the stronger the correlation the less the deterrent effect of marriage

on migration.

           It is also easy to see that the higher the correlation p, the smaller

is the incidence of tied spouses: their "public" (family) decisions                         are

largely      consistent with their "private" gains from migration. At the same

time, k ——        the   ratio of women's to men's gains ——        affects     the distribution,

rather than the incidence of tied partners among movers and stayers: The

closer women's gains to men's (k +                1),   the fewer the number of tied movers,

but the larger the number of tied starers (of both sexes), since the total

number      of   movers is smaller. With low levels of Ic, there is little deterrence

to    migration and most of the migrating families contain "tied" women. Note,
however, that the seriousness of the conflicts between Gf and. G.

with k —    a   matter which potentially affects family stability when migration
opportunities arise. This matter is discussed in section 4 below.
       Since "tied" persons in the family are those whose gains from migra-
tion are (in absolute value) dominated by gains (or losses) of the spouse,
there are reasons to believe that wives are more likely than husbands to be
the dominated ("tied") partners. The assumption that k <     is especially
                                                                       1

plausible for the labor market components of G.: On the return side larger
gains (or losses) are likely to accrue to persons with greater market earning
power. On the cost side, foregone earnings are also higher for             such   persons.
Moreover,   the return from migration is likely to be smaller for persons whose
labor force participation is discontinuous. Thus, the absolute value of G
is larger for husbands than for wives. Indeed, within the family, higher
market earning powers of husbands induce a lesser market participation, lower
market earnings, and a diminished migration payoff for the wife. The lesser
net payoff to wives may also result from a larger non—market component in
opportunity costs of migration acquired in non—market activity.
       Consequently, wives are more likely to be tied movers in migrating
families while husbands, if they         are tied at all, are more likely to be tied

stayers than tied movers. This is most likely to happen when the wives con-

tribution to family       income derives from a job. Of course,        the larger the

contribution and     the   stronger job attachment, the greater the deterrent effect

on family   mobility.
       If husbands'       gains   (or losses) from   migration   usually exceed the losses

(or gains) of the wife (k <        i),   an analysis which disregards family      status
will not err much in explaining migration behavior of men, especially if

their wives are     not   employed, but   will be quite wrong in     analyzing the behavior
                                          —10—




of women, especially of married women who migrate. In our example, as many
as two—thirds of the women movers might move for family reasons only, while
at most one—quarter of the women stayers are "tied".
          Judging by Table 1, and assuming that the distribution of gains from
mobility are related to distributions of wages expected over longer periods
of time, we may guess at current U.S. levels of k at a little over one—quarter:
.1 is the ratio of working wives to husbands' annual earnings,6 and since
labor     force participation of wives is about .5, the ratio for all families

is .2. p would be .5       if   the correlation between the education of spouses

is used as a guide, and .3 or less judging by the correlation of wages in

couples with working wives. If so, marital status (k —               .25,   p   .3) may

reduce migration propensities of all families by as much as 20 percent. P

Presence of working wives (k =        ., p   =    .3)   should reduce it by as much as

,Ct   7

          As already   noted,   trends toward equalization of labor market experiences

of men and women (k increasing toward            i)   cause reductions in migration pro-

pensities in stable families. But, we will be shown, they also create greater

instability. Trends in p and their effects are not obvious.8 Even if marital endogazny

(similarity of traits) were to increase, the effects on migration would not

be clear, unless endogamy were to extend to most detailed occupational charac-

teristics of spouses.
       6The estimate is .37 if l97 figures are used (Table 39 in CPS, P—60,
No. 101). I am grateful to Larry Long for the estimate and the references.
       Tlnterestingly, the BI report on migration in 1962—1963 (Special Labor
Force Report No. 14) states that migration of married men (wife present) was
almost one—third less than that of other men, at ages 18 to 6.
       8The correlation between husband's earnings and wives' labor force
participation has been changing secularly from negative to positive, at least
below median earnings of husbands (see Manpower Report of the President, 1975,
p. 59). This may suggest an upward trend in p.
                                          —11—




         At anr rate, inferences about the effects of p should be qualified
due to its necessarily restricted definition in Table 1: It represents a
correlation of gains from outmigration , since a single (aggregated) destina-
tion was assumed. If payoffs beckon in different destinations, p loses its
meaning altogether, and the family migration problem is magnified.

3.       Several Destinations

         Since   more than one destination is generally open to potential migrants,

G. should be defined as the maximum G over all possible            destinations. Then
the   relevant personal G1max and G2max may      refer to different destinations,
say   D1 and   D2, and a conflict arises even when G1            and           are both posi-
tive. For the family decision, however, Gf =                 +     must   be maximized,
and this may result in the family not moving, or         moving to D1, D2, or         even

D3
     where   neither of the personal gains is maximized but the sum of both is
the greatest.
         Thus in families who migrate, even the "dominating" partner has a gain
                                                                 max
      at destination, which is on average smaller      than            , the   optimal gain
he would have got in a different        destination. If both gains are      positive,
neither is as large as it      would   have been if   each   of the partners went to his
(her) optimal destination. In this sense, both spouses are "tied" to some
degree, although the partner whose gain is larger will tend to be closer to
his optimum. The previous conclusion that the "dominated" partner loses by
migration need no longer be true: Both lose relative to their "private"
potential, and the "dominated" spouse loses more,9 but both may gain, even
in a "private" sense (they always gain as a family) relative to origin.

         9For   a focus on   this matter see R.H. Frank (1976).
                                       —12—




       The divergence of the two G. among destinations is most likely to arise

when both are   motivated   by job opportunities. For the spouse that is not

working, attachment to origin is probably a more important factor affecting

migration decisions than differential pull of various destinations. For

working couples the compromise involved in finding a destination which maxi-

mized family gains at the expense of the potential advancement of each worker

creates more ties: Now both rather than one spouse are "tied" in migration.

As shown in the next section, the larger magnitude of ties,1P the greater the

potential for family breakup caused by migration opportunities.

      We may conjecture that to the extent that both G are motivated by job

opportunities, the dissimilarity in locational specificities of spouses that
                         max might be reduced by a tendency for such families
gives rise to G. < G.

to locate in large, diversified labor markets. Thus, it may well be that

growing   job motivation of wives will weaken the tendency toward far—flung
suburbanization, not only because of the negative effects of wage prospects
on fertility, but also because of a need for greater proximity to large, di-
versified labor markets.
       The expectation of becoming a tied spouse, which characterized most

women until very recently, may have had some influence on women's initial

occupational choices. The preference for occupations which are most easily

transferable geographically may have contributed in part to the concentra-

tion of women in such traditional occupations as teaching, nursing, and secre-

tarial work.11

       10Note the more general definition of a "tie": Tied movers are not
only those with negative gains. Ties are defined and measured bi discrepancies
between actual and maximum potential private gains. Presence as well as
degree of "tiedness" are relevant, as shown in section 1, below.
          11 Cf. Long (19714) for this

         But as the dramatic recent increases in family                            instability    get embed-

ded   in expectations, the incentives for such                           prior   adjustments will   be   re-

duced. More immediately, as shown in the next section, the growing risk

of marital instability reduces incentives of spouses to compromise locationally.

Consequently, in a classic case of self—fulfilling expectations, differential

migration incentives amplify marital instability, once it is anticipated.


l.       Migration and            Family      Stability

         The    relation between marital status and migration is a two—way street
not only under uncertainty, as will be shown. As we                                inquire    about the effects
of locational decisions on marital status, the criterion Gf =     +    >0

remains a necessary, but no longer a sufficient condition for migration as

a family.
         The magnitude of ties in migration can be measured generally by the
sum T = (G1m             —
                             G1)
                                   +
                                        (G2m
                                                  —
                                                      G2)    ,   where           is the potential optimal
"private" gain, while G. is the individual gain (or loss) from optimal family
migration.         In    the special case of a single destination                         =
                                                                                              G1m     and

        = 0    ,   hence         T =
                                       —G2
                                             .   T is nothing else          but a measure of tne negative
"private"      externality imposed by family                      migration.
         As   will be shown, the family internalizes this externality so long as
      < M , where            M   = M1 + M2 , the        family gain from marriage. When ITt                 >M ,

the family cannot assimilate the externality. It dissolves; one spouse moves,
the   other stays. M.              is the gain from marriage —— the difference between full
wealth   when married and full                   wealth     when single. A necessary and           sufficient
condition      for a marriage to dissolve is when family wealth is                             expected to be
less than the sum of each partner's wealth when they are separated (Becker,
1975). In          the   context of migration the criterion for dissolution becomes:

where    G1 and                 may refer to different destinations (including origin

as one of them).

          The meaning of inequality (2) is seen more easily when we revert to the

simpler    case of a single destination. Let 2 be the "tied" partner, thus
     =                      = 0        and         =            <   0       and                                 Substituting

in    (2), the condition for a breakup is simply:

This condition holds regardless of the family's decision whether to move or

not. In each case the           "injured" party may                   find       it to its benefit to break
away rather than       to   adhere to the "majority" rule.

partner    1 is better off moving and                  could        not be bribed to stay even if he got

all   of 2 from 2. But might he not bribe                           2 to move with him and                      be still
better off? No, since giving all of M1 to 2 would not suffice, according to
(2a).     In this case 1        is better off moving alone, while 2 is better off staying
alone.

family would be expected to stay if it did not dissolve, it will dissolve under

the   same condition (2a). It is important to keep in mind that whether the
family    moves    or stays, the left side of inequality (2) represents gains from
marriage    CM1 + M2)        and from        migration (G1 + G2)when moving and zero when

staying. The right hand side represents migration gains (zero for stayers)
                                         —15—




for separated partners. Now, with M1 + M2          <    , partner 2 leaves and cannot
be bribed by partner 1 to stay, nor will partner 2 induce 1 to come along,
as this would make 2 even worse off than if he (or she) stayed.
       To repeat, in the single destination case, family breakup occurs as
soon as the gain (or loss) of the dominated ("tied") partner exceeds the total
family gain from marriage. In the general case, breakup occurs when the sum
of ties T exceeds the sum of gains from marriage M. Under these conditions,
the gains from migration lead each of the spouses to follow their "private"
opportunities separately.
      The conditions (2a) for breakup due to migration decisions are rather
stringent.    The smaller of the gain (G1) or loss (G2) (in absolute value)

from migration must exceed the sum of the gains from marriage. The more general

condition (2), with more than one destination, makes marital breakup more

probable, as the right side of inequality (2) must exceed that in (2a). Since

multi—destination possibilities are      more plausible for two—earner families,

migration—caused    break—ups are also   more likely in such families. This is

especially   true if   the prospective stability of marriage is uncertain, regard-

less of location. If p is the life—time probability of preserving the marriage,
the dissolution contingent on migration         decisions becomes more plausible when

either M or p are small, since !TI > pM expected gains from marriage is more
likely the smaller each. Since (M1 + M2) as well as p are likely to grow11
with the duration of marriage and the presence of children, dissolutions due
to migration     would decline with duration of marriage and are less    likely when
children   are   at home, apart from the decline of the frequency of migration.

       While single (never married, or separated a long time ago) persons

reside in a locational equilibrium, this is not true of the "private" as

distinguished from the family equilibrium of married people. One or both

             11The mechanism may be selectivity as well as growth.
of the partners may be foregoing a private gain or incurring a private loss
from migration as a trade—off against the gain from marriage. Marital dis-
solution    restores or creates new "private" incentives, thereby causing, for

a time, greater mobility of separated men and women than of those not only

married,    but also of those never   married. With the passage   of time, the dif-
ferences between never married,    and separated former spouses tends to disappear.

         In the case of the newly remarried, as in the case of newly married

people, a change in migration equilibrium will also result in increased initial

migration, but with the passage of time the differences from the behavior of

those married once for a longer time disappears. Thus marital instability,

whatever its source, creates "disequilibrium" migration incentives, while the

differential migration incentives of spouses creates marital instability.

         The theoretical discussion and the following empirical evidence in

this paper indicate the way in which the initial (and expected) comparative

advantages of family members in market and household activities tend to be

reinforced    by family   labor mobility decisions. The adverse effects on the

labor   market experience of some married women may   be   seen as "social oppres-
sion"   from a "private" point of view. Such a view, however, fails to note

that the behavior we analyzed is a product of family welfare maximization.

This is pareto—optimal since "private" market losses can be       internalized by
the   family, that is compensated by a redistribution of gains. However, when

the   sun   of separate real incomes exceeds family real income, the optimal adjust-

ment is family dissolution, a growing phenomenon which is in part traceable

to the changing division of labor among the sexes.

                       PART   II.   IMPLICATIONS AND FINDINGS


       The following examples provide clear empirical illustrations of the
concepts of "tied" spouses and of the distinctions between personal and family
gain in migration analysis:
       (1) A BLS survey of persons unemployed in April 1962,12         the
            incidence and attitudes of tied spouses: the unemployed were asked
             whether they would accept a job in another area comparable to the
             one they lost. A positive answer was given by 30% of the married
             men, 21% of the single women, and only 8% of the married women.
             Most people who said "no" cited family, home, and. relatives as
             reasons   for the reluctance to move. However, one quarter of the
             women singled     out their husbands'     job   in the present area   as
             the   major deterrent    factor, while only 3% of        the husbands mentioned
             their wife's job as such a factor. If this finding for the un-
             employed can be generalized to the entire population, 30% of
             families would move and 30% —        8%   = 22%    or two—thirds of the
             wives of moving families would be         "tied movers", while 25% out
             of 70% of wives in families of stayers declared themselves to be
             "tied stayers". (Surprisingly, these figures are rather close
             to the numbers produced in the hypothetical example on p.4 ).


       (2)   The importance of the distinction between personal and family gains
             from migration was      first   shown in a study by Julie DaVanzo (1972).
             Using 1960 Census data aggregated into nine Census divisions the
             study estimated gross migration flows of men and women as functions
             of "prospective" personal family gains. It was suggested in our
             discussion that analysts looking at personal gains are most likely

                 to misinterpret the behavior of women. The study by DaVanzo shows
                 that men's gains explain migration of men in regressions with
                 R2    3l . When family gain is substituted, the R2 increases
                 to .39. The for female migration functions using their own
                 gain was only .21. It increases to .32 when men's gains are
                 substituted in the same regressions, and to .141 when family gains
                 are used.


1.      Marital Status

        If family ties       deter migration, as our     discussion suggests, then husband.-

wife families should migrate less frequently than persons without spouses.

An excellent demographic study by Larry H. Long (19714) documents this difference

very clearly with data on annual migration rates reported in the U.S. Census

Current Population Surveys and averaged over a six—year period (1966—1971).

T&ole 1, borrowed from Long's study, shows that in each age group annual migra-

tion rates (col's 2 and 3)           of   husband and wife families in which the husband

was 25 —   614   years   old were less than rates of men without wives (single, widowed,

separated, and divorced).

        The behavior of the youngest families (husband's age less than 25)

constitutes an exception, which can be explained by the concept of changes in

locational equilibrium. Life—cycle events such as completion of schooling,

entry into the labor force, family formation, or dissolution create new in-

centives and opportunities for migration. Conversely, people also migrate

to   start a career and. to marry. Since the youngest married couples are,
practically by definition, most recently married, their migration rate is
high. Table 2 shows that migration rates decline with duration of marriage
steeply    at first and      again   after 5—9   years of marriage.

         Another interesting distinction shown in Table 3 is that between never
married singles      (s) and   other not married persons. (0).        With the exception

of   men under 25, single men have higher mobility rates than married men,
though   the   margin is small. Rates of "others" are much higher than those of
married men)3 It seems plausible          that   the different     durations of marital

status contribute to     the much    higher migration propensities of "others" (sepa-

rated,   divorced,   widowed): Their status is on average about six years

while the duration of singleness is by           definition   (never—married) the longest

of all   the groups including      those current].y   married.
         A factor which further depresses the rate of singles is that many of

them (1O—5O% of the single men and        3O—10% of    single    women) live in parental

households or     with other close relatives. This is another example of familial

ties   which deter migration: As shown in          Table   1, relatives of heads     living
in their household have lower migration rates than heads of households who

are married,     wife present. Despite the fact that a smaller proportion of

single women live with parents or relatives, single women migrate less than

single men, and      indeed    less than married women (Table 3)       especially   at younger

ages. Whether this finding reflects a greater economic dependence of single

women on   their   families cannot be determined from the data.


2.       Wife's Employment Status

         Conflicting incentives about migration and           about   choices of destina-

tion are   most    likely to emerge when   both    husband and    wife   are   jobholders,
especially     when wife's job attachment is strong and her           contribution to family


             exceptions are widowed persons, but they tend to be much older
         13The
than each of the other groups.

income sizeable. This is not to deny the possibility of conflicting non—
pecuniary motives. Unfortunately, an empirical classification of families

by such criteria is not available, while employment status of spouses is

reported in a number of surveys.

       All the surveys show higher migration rates of families where the wife

is not employed outside the home than in families where the wife is employed

(Table i). As Long (19714) noted, the evidence confuses cause and effect when

employment status is reported during the survey week, and migration, if any,

during the preceding 12 months. Such findings are partly biased since, of the

women who worked at the place of origin and lost their job through migration,15

many did not, or not immediately, regain employment at destination.

       The proper comparison is by employment status which precedes migra-

tion. Table 5   (top   left panel) shows migration rates of families during a

five—year period following 1965,   by   age of husband and employment status of

wife. With the exception of the youngest couples, migration rates are lower

in families in which the wives were employed than in families with wives who

did not work in 1965. The least propensity to move is shown in families in

which wives' job attachment is strongest, here (col. 3) identified by the

wifes' employment both in 1965 and 1970.

       In young couples (husband's age up to 29 in 1965) where wives worked

in 1965 (but not in 1970), migration rates were not lower than in families

where the wives did not work in 1965. This finding is confirmed in the NLS

sample of young men (next section, Table 7) and can be explained by: (1) in-

vestment aspects of migration: Largest investments with biggest (lifetime)


       15lncreasingly states define this phenomenon as job loss, making the
worker eligible for unemployment insurance. The effect is to lower the cost
of migration and increase the incidence and duration of the wife's enemploy—
ment at destination.

          are

the early career building of the husband is evidently seen to be larger at this
stage   than in   later mobility, outweighing the possible adverse, but      weaker

effects on the market earnings of the wife. (2) Wives' participation in the

labor market is highly transitory at the child—bearing stage. Significantly,

Table 5 shows that in young families where wives had a strong attachment to

their market work (employed both in 1965 and         1970), the   deterrent effect on

migration is visible even in the youngest families (compare col. 2 & 3):

Evidently, a rise in investment costs ——        in   this case, larger foregone earnings

of wives —— does reduce migration rates. Nevertheless, the deterrent effect

on migration, even of wives who are more strongly attached to the labor force,

is weaker at younger ages, reflecting the strong incentives to invest in market

careers of husbands.

          Table 6 shows an interaction of wife's employment status and distance

of migration in their effects on migration rates: Migration rates diminish

with distance, but     they decrease more strongly in families with       working wives

than in other families. Indeed for the nearest relocations (within counties),
migration rates are higher in two—earner than in one—earner families. As
Long (l97) puts      it:   "Having a wife who works may inhibit long—distance
movement, but appears to promote short—distance movement". These findings,
incidentally, hold for employment status reported after (Table 1) as well as
before moving (Table 6).
          A   search hypothesis can account for the higher local mobility rate of
two—earner families, and the progressively lower mobility rate of two—earner
compared to one—earner families at increasing distance. If search costs in-
crease with distance (e.g., when repeated travel is required), the incentives

to search prior to migration are weaker at longer distances for the spouse
with the   lesser expected returns from migration. With low G2, migration is

not   deterred. However, the larger wife's earnings, hence potential net losses
(G2 < 0)   deter more families from both search and       migration   at longer d.is—
tances. At short distances, commutes for search purposes and for job pur-
poses, adjustments in residence for such purposes, as well as visits with
friends    and   relatives are all   feasible. Job search is therefore not restricted
to    one earner and greater (residential) mobility follows almost as a matter
                  16
of arithmetic.

          Consistent   evidence is provided by findings that in contrast to long

distance   migration which is positively related to education of husband, short
distance (within counties) moves are inversely related to it (Manpower Report,
l97).      The converse is true of wives' labor force participation and of their

education. (See Tables 1 and T.) Apparently, where the female to male wage

ratio is higher, migration, if any, is shorter, as the incidence of tied

husbands is greater. Short—distance search is a preferable alternative to

a potentially large      loss   at longer distances.


3.        The Family Context in Multivariate alysis

          Some of the well—established findings in empirical migration studies

are: the positive effects of education and the negative effects of family

size,   particularly the presence of school—age children)7 In studies of

labor force behavior, mothers' labor force rates are lowest when the children,

by Long (19714), namely that many of the wives work in order to upgrade family
housing.

are   of pre—school age and they increase substantially when children are en-
rolled in   school. Thus, the positive effect of education (or of wage level)

of husband on his migration. reflects not only greater "private" gains from
migration, but also an intra—farnily substitution effect. The greater compara-
tive advantage in the husbands' market work leads to lesser market work of
the wife and, therefore, to fewer obstacles to family migration. Similarly,
the pre—school status of young children signifies not only a lesser loca-
tional attachment of the family, but also little labor market attachment of
the mother, hence again a lesser obstacle to geographic mobility. Moreover,

intertemporal substitution is also at work: Anticipated locational attachment

related to schooling of children may well induce a speedup of migration in

young    families.
          Obviously,   age of parents and of children, education of husband, fer-

tility, and    labor   force behavior of wife are   all   interrelated. Whether and

to    what extent each of these factors affects migration is a question re-

quiring multi—variate statistical analyses.         Several recent studies provide
evidence in the      form of multiple regressions or several—way cross—tabulations

 of data: On the whole the biases created by        left—out variables tend to be

minor,    and most of the variables appear to be relevant.

          Thus Long (1972) finds that school—age children reduce migratiOn not

 merely because their parents are     older    than the parents of pre—schcol children:

 At each age (of parents) and at each family size, the effect is pronounced.

 Also,   given ages of parents and children, numbers of children have a (weak)
 negative effect on migration. Similarly, separated and divorced women migrate
 more readily than married women not merely because they are less likely to

 have    children: At each age   of mother and number and     ages   of children, their
                                            —31—




migration rates are higher. Based on regressions for NLS women who were 30—
414 years old in      1966,   Sandell (1976) summarizes the net effects of wife's
employment status in 1967 and of the children's age composition on fainil.y
migration in the subsequent five—year period as follows:

         In   regressions of migration probabilities of families in the Michigan

Income Dynamics Sample, Polachek         and Horvath (1976) also find separate effects
of   wife's market work, her education, and        of   the presence of school age    children.
Consistent    with our    discussion,   the stronger the wife's labor force attach-

ment and    the    more important her   earnings, the greater the negative effects on
fami).y migration. Polachek and Horvath measure           their variables by wives'

occupation     ("menial" vs. higher level) and education.         As already     mentioned,
husband's     education has a positive effect in all studies, and. is not much

         In   our current NBER study19 of work experience as it shapes the life-
time evolution of wages, we find that husband's labor force turnover is posi-
.ve1y associated with labor market activities of the wife. Both in Coleman—

association   between wives' l&Dor force participation as well as wives' educa-
tion and   husbands'quit, but not layoff experience. A somewhat weaker rela-
tion is found also in the youngest NLS cohort. This suggests that the wife's
contribution   to family income permits greater scope for search activities and

job choices of the husband. Evidently, a strong market position of the wife

simultaneously encourages job mobility of the husband and discourages geo-

graphic mobility of the family.20 This intra—family relation suggests at least

one interesting implication: If migration is, in part, a consequence of job

turnover rather than conversely, the probability of job—related migration

(more precisely, the joint probability of quit and migration) will not show

the deterrent effects of wives' market work as clearly as the (conditional)

probability of migration ()      given    a quit (Q),     since   P(QIThI) = P(Q)    .




and the two terms on the right are affected in a contradictory fashion by

wife's employment status.

         Table I compares regression effects on joint, conditional probabilities

of migration, and on probabilities of quit of the older (i:LS), younger (CR)

and youngest (ITLS) cohorts    of men. Family variables,           especially   wives' employ-
ment and education have positive effects on quits of husbands, negative effects

in the conditional regressions for quit—related migration, and weak                effects    in

the regressions of joint probabilities. mong              the   youngest men, wife's work

has no significant effect on     migration,      as   we also found in the Census data

(Table 5;   Cf.   discussion on p.   ).     The presence of school—age children in-

hibits migration in the multiple regressions as            well. Again, families         of

the   youngest men are exceptions. The family variables have no effect in lay-
off   regressions, not shown in the Table.


       2OThis may be an additional factor in the greater residential mobility
of    two—earner families.
                                             —33—




        A possible explanation of the lay—off case is that unemployment brings
a reduction in opportunity costs of migration which outweighs most of the
potential loss         in wives'   earnings. Unemployment of husbands   makes "tied

movers"    out of some of the working       wives.

          Generally, the      regressions confirm the previously described        effects
of   marital status, of its recency, and of other           family variables. It should
be noted, that the small numbers           of migrants in the sample produce statistics

with   low levels       of significance.


          Effects      of Migration on Family Employment Status

          Since unemployment reduces opportunity costs of migration, it              is   not
surprising to find that the migration rate of the unemployed is higher than
the migration rate of the employed.21 We do find, however, in both the C—R
and NLS    data that the migration rate of those who quit exceeds the rate of those
laid—off (temporary layoffs excluded). This suggests that some quits                  are

motivated    by migration —— indeed,        one half of the quits who migrated acquired

the new job before quitting. Layoffs, however, are not likely to be induced

by migration      opportunities.
          As we   would expect, men who migrate have higher unemployment rates than
non—migrants both at origin and at           destination (see Table 8). In        the NLS

sample, origin unemployment rates              migrants   whose wives worked (at origin)

were 6%    points higher      than rates of non—migrants, compared to a 2% differen-

tial for migrants whose wives did not work in the period prior to migration.
Similarly, the average duration of unemployment of stayers was               3   months, while

unemployment      at    origin of movers with non—working wives was     1   months and       with

working wives 5 months:        It takes a greater amount      of unemployment and a   longer
local search     before   "tied" husbands    are induced   to move. This is an interesting
                                                                                      22
example   of   the effect of dual job families on the volume of unemployment
        While family ties tend to lengthen the unemployment           of   husbands prior
to migration, they create unemployment among wives at destination. As shown
in Table 8, migrating husbands        also   have higher unemployment rates than others
at destination, but their unemployment is reduced relative to what it was at
origin:23      this, after all, was the      purpose of migration. In contrast, wives
of   migrants have unemployment rates        at origin that are   no greater than those

of   wives of   stayers, but the rate is much higher at destination (Table 8).

Reflecting     the lesser effect on family income, wife's search for a new job at

destination is either less intensive prior to migration or postponed until

after migration.

         The unemployment of women migrants at destination is either a result

of job loss at origin, or of labor force entry at destination by women who

did not work in the period prior to migration. This does not mean that,

in sum, more women migrants are in the labor force at destination than at

origin. The opposite is true: The lower panel of Table 5 showed that labor

force rates of wives who migrated are smaller than the labor force rates of

stayers within 12 months after migration. While the effects are strongest

immediately after migration, they last at least several years: It was shown

in Table 5      (upper right panel) that only !o%     of   the younger migrant wives

who   worked at origin (in      1965) were employed at destination (in 1970), compared


          standard example is the "added worker effect", where unemployment
of husbands induces labor force entry of wives, which augments the unemploy-
ment of women.
          23Table   8,   panel (c).

to 50% of stayers who continued to work. For older wives the percentages who
continued to work were 65% for migrants and 80% for stayers.
          It was   noted   previously that migration rates of two—earner families
diminish with distance more rapidly than in single earner families. Employ-
ment rates of wives diminish with distance as well (see Tables 5 and                 6).   They
diminish    not only   because   fewer families with working wives move longer dis-
tances: As Table       6   shows, employment rates of wives who worked in 1965 de-
clined    for   movers much more than   for   stayers, and    for long—distance (inter-

state) movers most. In contrast, roughly the same proportion (about 25%)

of wives who were not employed in 1965         worked   in   1970,   regardless of   migra-
tion status and location.

          It was argued before that incentives for search prior to migration

are weaker for tied movers and prior search is costlier the more distant the

destination. And search at the unfamiliar destination can be prolonged and

unsuccessful. Consequently, the lesser search prior to migration is one pos-

sible explanation of the adverse effect of distance on wives' employment.

In addition, husbands' gains from migration increase with distance, and both

such gains and the probability of migrating long distances increases with

the education of the husband. Therefore, the intra—family income and sub-

stitution effects induce levels of wives' labor supply inverse to distance

and make decreases in their labor supply a positive function of distance.

         Both unemployment and labor force withdrawal are results of tied

migration of working wives. If employment and earning opportunities turn out

to be meager or inferior at destination, withdrawal from the labor force is

a likely possibility. Reduction in wives' market labor supply following migra-

tion is    induced   not only by the decrease in the wife's (expected) wage            rela-
tive to    that of the husband's, but also by an increased family demand for
                                        —3T—




non—market     activity necessitated by setting up a new household in a new environ-
ment. The last factor may only temporarily remove women from the labor force.
In sum, migration results in both temporary interruptions and     long—term   with-
drawals from work.
         The contrast between job motivated and tied migration is seen not only
in the comparison of effects on work experience of migrating spouses, but
also   in   the comparison of single with married women migrants. As Table 5,
panel B indicates, in contrast to married women, single women migrants have
higher   labor force rates at destination than at origin. Another vivid illus-

tration of family ties in migration is provided by the Polachek and Horvath

study of the Income Dynamics data: They find that families with husbands

receiving high wages move toward areas with fewer women in the labor force,

while families in which the wife has a     high wa€e tend to move toward   areas

with   better   opportunities for women, as measured by a higher percentage of

women    in the labor force and by lower unemployment rates.   This   is evidence
that the effect of existing family ties on work experience following aigra—
tion   is symmetrical for each of the sexes. It    is the incidence and magnitude
of   ties, rather than their effects that differs among the sexes.

         Not   only tied movers but also tied stayers experience a redu.ction in
the market earnings potential. By definition, "tied" stayers fail to exploit
potential gains from labor mobility. The confinement of job mobility to the
local labor market, often at short distances, reduces the scope for job change
and the quality of the job match. If so, we may expect both a lesser propensity
to change jobs on the part of working wives, as well as a greater vulnerability
to layoff. Given a job loss, the lesser scope for search results in reduced
wage aspirations, more unemployment, and labor force withdrawals. Although
the implied duration of unemployment can be shorter because of reduced acceptance
                                      —38—



wages and/or    labor force withdrawals, its incidence is likely to be
greater.
          In two studies of job mobility in 1955 and 1961, the Current Popula—

tiori   Survey found that the proportion of job changers among working women was
20—30%    smaller than among men. But, since women work almost 20%    fewer weeks

during    the year, the proportion of job changers does not appear to   be dif-

ferent among the sexes per unit of    time. Still, the conclusion that women's
(purposive)    job mobility is smaller than men's is correct: Women's job tenure

is on average half the length of men's tenure. In view of the just quoted

statistics on job change, this reduction in tenure is due entirely to labor

force withdrawals. As is well known, job turnover declines rapidly with tenure.

Consequently, if frequency of job change of women were the same as that of

men at each level of tenure, women would be observed to have a larger overall

frequency of job change per unit of time since their tenure is shorter. Evi-

dently, their job mobility is lower than that of men at comparable levels of

tenure. This inference is confirmed in Table 9: For each level of tenure,

except the earliest, the job change rate of women (col. 14)   is   less than the

rate of men (col. 5), even though the men are about 10 years older. Total

separation rates of men (not shown here) are only slightly larger than in

ccl. 5. Total turnover among women is twice as high as job mobility in the

first 2 years of tenure, and the proportional excess increases with level of

tenure (compare col. 1 with 1). The difference is, of course, due to labor

force withdrawals. Note that their rate (col. 2) is largely unrelated to tenure,

in contrast to job mobility rates, which decline. Note also that reported

"quits for family reasons", an independent statistic, is very close to the

estimate of labor force withdrawals. The former does, of course, imply the
                                          —39.-

latter, though     not   always ——   for   example, migration need not imply a withdrawal

from the labor force, though it very frequently does.
         Census tabulations of unemployment by source suggest that most of the

excess of female over male unemployment is due to the unemployment of labor

force entrants, and       especially   of re—entrants. However, among the unemployed

who worked prior to unemployment, job leavers represent about one—third of all

unemployed women (over 20 years of age), while they amount to only one—sixth

to one—fifth of the comparable category of unemployed men: .Iost likely, this

is a reflection of the family, rather than of job motivated quits. Such

"exogenous" quits of women (or men) tend to involve unemployment to a larger

degree than job—motivated quits, which occur usually after workers have lined

up the next job.


5.       Gains and Losses in Earnings

         As has been documented in many studies (Greenwood, 1975),         geograhic
migration usually increases earnings of men. However, effects on employment

of wives suggest that earnings of wives may suffer. Indeed, Galloway (1963)

was the first to find that interregional migration was associated with a de-

crease in the earnings of women (he did not distinguish marital status).

         In the N Report (1976), Sandell finds that between 1967 and 1911,

incomes of migrant husbands increased by $l,l7 per year more than incomes of
nonmigrant husbands, while incomes of migrant families increased by $952

per   year. The difference (— $222) represents the average loss of wives. The

wives' income loss is partly a result of a reduction in labor supply and partly

a reflection of lesser wage growth of tied migrants. Adverse effects were also

found   both   in the growth of annual earnings as well as in wage      rates of
migrant wives by Polachek and Horvath (1976) in the Michigan Income Dynamics
Panel for 1968—1969 migrants.
         Losses of migrant wives' earnings (relative to earnings of non-migrant
wives) diminish with the passage of time, as do the differences in weeks
worked, as Sandell reports. Initial uninformed search and family demands
connected with setting up a new household are temporary and account for the
initially strongest declines in employment and. earnings of wives. A conclu-
sion for the study of gains from migration is that, although conceptually less
appropriate,   they are   discernable in earnings of husbands more quickly (though
not   immediately after migration) than in family      incomes.
         While migration of tied wives interrupts their work experience and

reduces their wage progress, gains       from   migration are larger for married   than
for other men, according to regressions using the various panel data (C—R,
NLS, and. MID). The gains are larger especially in families with "tied" wives:
Thus Ann Bartel (1975) finds in        the Coleman—Rossi data that where wives worked

at    origin (but not at destination) husbands received the largest gains ($122
per month). Gains were      much    smaller ($51 per month) where wives did not work
at origin (but did at destination). Gains of husbands were average when wives
had unchanged employment status. Similarly, in the NLS sample men in their
twenties whose wives had large earnings receive larger wage gains than other
migrating husbands of wives        who worked at origin.

         The positive effects of marital status on migration gains       of men,

especially    of husbands   of working women (prior to migration) reflect family
ties:     Potential losses of wives raise the acceptance wage of migrating hus-

bands. Both     results follow: the probability of migration diminishes and the
"private" gain of the purposive job seeker increases.
                                      —




        We may conclude that the intra—family trade—off in gains and losses

from migration involves mutual causality: Gains of husbands induce a reduction

in labor supply and earnings losses of wives, while the potential losses of

wives' migration reduces migration but increases the gains of husbands in

families which move.


6.      Migration,   Family Stability and Trends

        The empirical evidence described thus far reflects the internalization

of family ties which, in the context of migration, can be viewed as an externality

to   the family member in'his (her) "private" capacity. As we   argued in the

theoretical   discussion, conflicting "private" locational incentives cannot
always be   reconciled, and prospective or actual migration leads to family dis-

solution. Conversely, when families disintegrate for whatever reason, loca-

tional equilibrium changes for many of the separated and divorced persons and

migration follows.

         We have seen the stronger migration propensities of divorced and separated

persons compared to others in some of the data cited before. Evidence on

temporal sequences which would reflect migration—caused family breakup is

difficult to come by. We are able to get some inferences only from one data

set: The Coleman—Rossi panel provides chronological data on labor mobility

and on family formation and dissolution over a period averaging 15 years ——

from completion of high school to the mid—thirties of a sample of about 1,000

men. In this sample:

         (1) Less than 2 of the marriages dissolved by separation or
              divorce in an average year. However, in a 12—month period
              bracketing a geographic move (inter—state) of the respondent
              (husband), 5% of the families broke up.
          (2) About 8% of the married men moved to another county in a
               random year, but 19% moved in years bracketing marital breakup.

Although each of        the   comparison reflect causality running in either direction,
the   first more nearly shows the effect of mobility on faini3.y integrity, while

the second is more likely to convey the effect of marital breakup in creating

a locational disequilibrium, which underlies the high              mobility   rates of separated

and   divorced    persons.

          By increasing the incidence of tied spouses, trends toward equaliza-

tion   of labor market experience of men and           women may   contribut to a decrease
in   migration rates of married couples, as well as to an increase in marital

instability of migrants as well           as of stayers.2 However, increases        in marital
instability,     whatever their source, stimulate migration of persons, and. trends

of   divorce and     separation   are   strongly   upward.

          It appears, on balance, that rates of migration in           the U.S. have been
relatively stable since World War II, with a slight decline noticeable since
1960. Thus       total   residential moves declined from 20.1% to 17.7%        between 1960

and 1975.       In   the five year period 1970—1975, intercounty moves declined

from ll.i. to 10.8% and interstate moves from 3. to 3.0% (CPR, 1976).

Without complete multivariate analysis, it is difficult to tell how much

changes    in   the family contributed to the trends. Obviously, several other

factors worked in conflicting directions: Growing education of husbands should

have increased migration, but the growing education of wives may               have   pro-

duced the    opposite effect. Upward trends are also predicted by declining family

        2lThe effect of the intra—fainily relative earnings on family stability
is not restricted to episodes of migration. Cf. Becker (1973) and Santos
(1975)    for analysis and      documentation.

size, but the consequent aging     of   the population would work in the opposite

direction. Improved transportation and         communication may reduce costs of

migrating, but may   also   reduce incentives to do so by substituting commuting

for migration.

                               SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS


        The subject of this paper was the exploration of the effects of family
ties on migration, of the effects of migration decisions in the presence of
such ties on employment and       earnings   of family   members,   and   on   family   stability.

Ties are   defined   only in   relation to migration decisions: In the case of a
single (aggregated) destination, ties exist when individual ("private") gains
of family members differ in sign. The tied. person is one whose gain (or loss)
is   smaller in absolute value. In the more general case of several potential

destinations, ties exist so long as the gain of at least one spouse in the

family's optimal location is less than his or her "private" maximum. In this

case both spouses can be "tied", although the discrepancy from the private

optimum is likely to be larger for the spouse with the smaller gain. Indeed,

the discrepancy is a measure of the magnitude of the tie. It is a measure

of the negative externality which the decision to move (or to stay) imposes

on the family members in their individual capacities.

          These   externalities are   usually,   but not always, internalized by the
family.     They are   absorbed   without undermining family    integrity so long as

the sum of the ties is less than the gains from marriage. Otherwise, the

family dissolves, and at least one person moves. The theorem that families

move whenever family gain is positive and stay when it is negative must,

therefore, be amended: The sign of the family gain is a necessary, but not

sufficient condition, for the decisions to move or not to move as a family.


(1)       The presence of family ties deters migration of families, even though

          It creates "tied" movers as well. Since gains or losses from migration
                                  —




are increased by job mobility, two-earner families are more likely to
be   deterred   than   single-earner   families. Single earners in husband-

wife families are almost always men, so it is families        with working
wives   whose migration is most likely to be inhibited.

        pirical evidence on the effects of marital status confirms these
propositions: Married persons are less likely to move than singles,
and the mobility of separated and divorced parents ("others") is by
far the highest. The mobility of singles is dampened by the fact that
many of    them are "tied members of households headed by parents or other
close relatives. In contrast, the mobility of "ot'ers" is auiented
by their relatively recent change of marital status which        creates   a

change of locational equilibrium. The same effect, of course, holds
for newly married couples.
     Evidence on lesser migration rates of families with working wives
is   ebundant. The deterrent      effects are stronger when wife's attachment
is   more permanent, and when she is more educated. In contrast, when

families are classified by education of husband, they are more likely

to move: Educated husbands' contribution to family income is larger

and   their gain from migration is morelikely to outweigh their wifes'
losses.
        The deterrent effect of wife's employment and of her education
increases with distance, while husband's education is positively re-

lated to the distance of migration. At shorter distances (intra—

county    moves), wives earnings actually permit more inensive search
activities of husbands. Indeed, search of both spouses is not inhibited,
since residential changes or commutes can accommodate job changes of
                                      _147_



      each. According to our     analysis,    where the female to male   earnings

      ratio is higher, the incidence of immobilized husbands        increases.

      Consequently, local mobility    increases relative to long—distance migra-

      tion.

             Since earnings of wives permit a greater scope for purposive

      search of husbands, working wives increase the probability of husbands'

      job change     (by quit). Job changers are more likely to migrate than
      those who do not quit; thus wives' work exerts indirectly a positive

      effect on migration, as well as the negative effect already described.

      The deterrent effect of wives' employment is, therefore, less clearly

      observed in the unconditional than in the conditional (or quit) probability

      of   family   migration.


(2)   Migration tends to reduce the unemployment of men and to increase the

      unemployment of women, since women tend to be tied movers. But to the

      extent that men are tied, unemployed men with working wives tend to

      search longer at origin than unemployed husbands of non—working wives,

      even if they eventually migrate. Migrating wives experience increases

      in unemployment, reductions in employment, and labor force withdrawals

      at destination, and these effects increase with distance. The reasons,

      some of which have already been stated are: Postponement of job search

      until after the move, change in intra—family income and substitution

      variables, and at least temporary increases      in family   demand for house-

      hold   activities. Not only tied movers, but also tied stayers experience
      adverse effects in the labor market: The restriction         of job mobility

      to   short distances reduces the scope of job search and opportunities
                                          — I8—




      for   advancement and increases the probability of job mismatch,

      unemployment and labor force withdrawal.

             We   may conclude that the growth of two—earner fathlies increases
      unemrloyment of both sexes, but primarily of women. By interrupting
      the   continuity of women's work, tied migration               leads to slower growth
      of   wages over the life cycle. The          adverse effect on wage growth can occur
      even without discontinuity of employment since the mere interruption
      of job tendure reduces incentives of worker and                 employers for job—
      srecific investments. Tied migration rants next to child—rearing as
      an imn.ortant danpening influence in the life—cycle wage evolution of

      souses, family location decisions cn be a challenge to f_'tily
      integrity. Usually, these externalities are                  internalized by   the fsniiy.
      However, when the externality (T)           exceeds       the gain from marriage (H)
      the marriage dissolves. The likelihood of a hreakmo occasioned by
      location decisions is increased when marital stability is uncertain
      for other reasons: If p        is   the probability of preserving the marriage
      (regardless of location), then the expected gain from marriag.e is rU,
      and the condition for breakup is T > pH      Thus, the less stable the

      marriage     the greater its vulnerability to tied migration decisions.

             Tnen an   unstable   marriage dissolves, each of the spouses follows

      his   or her (old or new) private       optimal location. Thus, not only do

      migration     incentives contribute to       instability, but instability ——

      whatever its source —— increases migration. The                  increasing equalization
                              — 19_




of    labor   market   attachments of men and   women creates   an   increase
in migration     ties, thereby deterring migration as well as con-

tributing to marital        instability. At the same    time, the dramatic

recent trend.s in       marital instability stimulate   migration of

separated persons. The net effect on migration rates is unclear,

but    the effects on marital instability are reinforcing. In turn,
feedbacks on women's labor supply reinforce the upward trends in
their market employment.
