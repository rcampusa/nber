I. Introduction

       The employment relationship between a Ô¨Årm and worker often gives rise to rents or

quasi-rents. These rents may arise because it is costly to form a successful Ô¨Årm-worker

match or because of speciÔ¨Åc investments undertaken by Ô¨Årm and worker after match for-

mation. Alternatively, rents may derive from the Ô¨Årm‚Äôs product market power, its ability

to secure nonlabor inputs on favorable terms, or employer responses to eÔ¨Äort elicitation

and other incentive problems.

       When the Ô¨Årm and worker make investment decisions that inÔ¨Çuence the amount of

rents to be split, privately optimal choices potentially diverge from joint wealth-maximizing

(or socially optimal) outcomes. Grout (1984) analyzes the prototypical situation of a

Ô¨Årm and a union that bargain over employment and wages after the Ô¨Årm undertakes an

investment with a sunk cost component. The Ô¨Årm, rationally anticipating that the union

will extract some of the incremental quasi-rents generated by the investment, chooses less

than the joint wealth-maximizing amount of investment. If the Ô¨Årm and union can enter

into a binding agreement that speciÔ¨Åes investment, as well as employment and wages, joint

wealth-maximizing outcomes result.

       The literature on speciÔ¨Åc capital in the employment relationship identiÔ¨Åes contract

enforcement and asymmetric information problems as important reasons for separation out-

comes that fail to maximize joint wealth.1 The same contract enforcement and asymmetric

information problems that induce ineÔ¨Écient separation behavior are also likely to induce

ineÔ¨Écient investment in match-speciÔ¨Åc capital. Becker‚Äôs (1975, pp. 26-37) discussion,

for example, stresses the need for long-term contracts with an appropriate compensation

    Parsons (1986, especially pages 819-827) reviews this literature. Hall and Lazear (1984)

catalog a variety of contracting arrangements that potentially achieve eÔ¨Écient separation

behavior but are rendered infeasible by informational constraints.

structure to achieve wealth-maximizing behavior with respect to separation decisions and

speciÔ¨Åc human capital investment.

       This paper analyzes a diÔ¨Äerent, but related, reason for potentially ineÔ¨Écient invest-

ment outcomes. The analysis rests on two observations. First, trade in the labor market

is a costly economic activity for both Ô¨Årms and workers. As remarked above, these costs

imply the existence of ex post rents or surplus upon the formation of a desirable match

between a Ô¨Årm and worker. Second, many of the investment decisions that inÔ¨Çuence the

size of the ex post rents associated with a particular match take place prior to match

formation.

       As examples of these prior decisions, Ô¨Årms choose particular locations, they build

facilities with certain characteristics, and they choose particular production processes. In-

dividuals choose whether to participate in the labor market, whether and where to relocate,

and whether to undergo speciÔ¨Åc training to improve their suitability for a particular job or

type of job. In this paper, these prior investment decisions govern the quality distribution

of jobs and the quality distribution of workers that emerge in the labor market equilib-

rium. Here, ‚Äújob quality‚Äù means any attribute of a job that workers care about including

productivity, working conditions, location, and so forth. Likewise, ‚Äúworker quality‚Äù means

any attribute of individuals that Ô¨Årms care about.

       To capture the idea that match formation is costly, I cast the analysis in the framework

of search theory. To capture the role of prior investment decisions, I assume that Ô¨Årms

undertake costly job creation activities prior to forming a match with a worker. Section

II develops a bare-bones model along these lines that illuminates the central insight in

the paper. The analysis considers a one-period search model of the Diamond-Mortensen-

Pissarides variety.2 Firms and workers meet randomly according to a bilateral matching

    Diamond (1981,1982), Mortensen (1982ab), and Pissarides (1984, 1990) are some of the

process and split the surplus associated with successful meetings according to a simple

sharing rule. Unlike previous work in this vein, the model incorporates the costly creation

of jobs that are heterogeneous ex ante.

    The analysis reveals that the quality distribution of jobs is generally ineÔ¨Écient in the

decentralized search equilibrium, with an excessive relative supply of inferior jobs. The

analysis also highlights a fundamental tension between the condition for an eÔ¨Écient mix

of jobs and the standard condition for an eÔ¨Écient total supply of jobs in two-sided search

models. The tension arises from the mixing of heterogeneous jobs that are endogenously

supplied to the search environment. This mixing feature is the key characteristic that

distinguishes the search environments considered here from most other search models.

    Section III extends the eÔ¨Éciency analysis of the job quality distribution in several

directions. Section III.A considers endogenously determined search intensity on the part of

Ô¨Årms and search costs that vary with job type. This environment leads to a modiÔ¨Åcation

of the relative supply eÔ¨Éciency condition, but it does not eliminate the basic tension

between relative and total supply eÔ¨Éciency conditions. Section III.B shows that perfect

ex ante sorting of heterogenous jobs into separate search markets does remove the tension

between relative and total supply eÔ¨Éciency conditions. Section III.C extends the analysis

to encompass endogenous quality determination on both sides of the market. It turns

out that two-sided endogenous quality determination compounds the incompatibility of

eÔ¨Éciency conditions in the search equilibrium with decentralized wage bargaining.

    Section IV investigates whether there exists any wage structure that simultaneously

achieves an eÔ¨Écient number and mix of jobs. The analysis provides an aÔ¨Érmative answer,

shows that eÔ¨Éciency requires a uniform (expected) wage across jobs, and explains why this

wage structure is unlikely to result from a decentralized wage determination process. When

the quality distribution is endogenous on both sides of the market, eÔ¨Éciency requires equal

expected wages across jobs of diÔ¨Äerent productivities (where the expectation is calculated

over the distribution of worker types) and wages that fully reÔ¨Çect expected productivity

diÔ¨Äerences that stem from worker traits. Relative to the eÔ¨Écient wage structure, de-

centralized wage bargaining entails too much compression of worker-related productivity

diÔ¨Äerentials and too little compression of job-related productivity diÔ¨Äerentials.

    Section V develops an analytical solution to the basic model with heterogeneous jobs

and homeogeneous workers under isoelastic schedules for the cost of job creation. The

analytical solution facilitates a quantitative analysis of the potential productivity and

welfare consequences of alternative wage-setting regimes.

    Section VI inquires into the nature of an optimal employment tax and and subsidy

structure, i.e., an industrial policy, given that wages are determined by decentralized bar-

gaining in the basic model. The analysis derives the structure of an optimal industrial

policy and shows that this structure induces a spreading of wage diÔ¨Äerentials across jobs

relative to the decentralized equilibrium with no industrial policy. It follows from the anal-

ysis in sections IV and VI that (i) wage compression under an optimal wage determination

mechanism and (ii) wage spreading induced by an optimal industrial policy layered on

top of decentralized bargaining provide alternative mechanisms for achieving an eÔ¨Écient

number and mix of jobs.

    Section VI also considers solutions to parametric versions of the model that are de-

signed to assess the welfare implications of alternative wage-setting and industrial policy

regimes. Reasonable parametrizations of the model suggest that an eÔ¨Écient wage or op-

timal tax structure can substantially alter the job distribution and thereby bring about a

large increase in average labor productivity. However, sizable wage and productivity dif-

ferentials among identical workers do not imply large welfare gains associated with a move


                                              4
to an eÔ¨Écient job distribution. As a related point, the size of welfare improvements that

result from a movement to the eÔ¨Écient job distribution exhibits little connection to the

size of productivity improvements. Higher unemployment and greater job creation costs

generate this wedge between the productivity gains and welfare gains associated with the

move to an eÔ¨Écient job distribution.

    The contrast between outcomes under decentralized wage determination and outcomes

under the eÔ¨Écient wage structure points toward an eÔ¨Éciency-enhancing role for a central-

ized wage-setting institution. Section VII considers an institution in which a labor union

and an employer confederation bargain over the parameters of the wage structure prior

to job creation and search. Numerical calculations indicate that centralized wage deter-

mination exhausts much, sometimes nearly all, of the potential eÔ¨Éciency gains associated

with moving to Ô¨Årst-best outcomes. Under reasonable constraints on wage-setting and en-

forcement powers, the centralized bargaining authority substantially compresses the wage

structure relative to outcomes under decentralized bargaining. The analysis provides an

eÔ¨Éciency rationale for centralized wage-setting institutions and an explanation for why

they tend to compress the wage distribution.

    Section VIII brieÔ¨Çy discusses the relationship between the analysis in this paper and

related work. Section IX oÔ¨Äers some concluding remarks.


II. The Quality Distribution of Jobs


A. A Bare-Bones Search Model with Costly Job Creation

    Real-world economies present a wide range of potential job creation opportunities. Po-

tential jobs diÔ¨Äer in the attractiveness of their attributes and in the costs of their creation.

To model these aspects of the job creation process, assume that Ô¨Årms competitively sup-



                                               5
ply I types of jobs according to the cost-of-creation schedules C i (J i ), i = 1, 2, . . . I, where

C i (J i ) denotes the total cost of creating J i jobs of type i. The marginal cost schedules

are positive and increasing for positive values of J i .

       These assumptions about the cost-of-creation schedules admit a range of interpre-

tations regarding ex ante heterogeneity among Ô¨Årms. One interpretation posits ex ante

identical Ô¨Årms and a job creation technology that requires a job-type speciÔ¨Åc input subject

to a rising supply price. Another interpretation posits Ô¨Årms that have diÔ¨Äerent job creation

costs and some scarce factor at the Ô¨Årm level. Under this interpretation, the degree of het-

erogeneity amongs Ô¨Årms determines the convexity of the cost-of-creation schedules. This

second interpretation also implies positive expected rents for infra-marginal job-creating

Ô¨Årms.

       The analysis below presumes that job types diÔ¨Äer in terms of anticipated productivity,

but the form of ex ante heterogeneity is inessential for the central results. It will be

convenient to order job types by y i , the ouput of a type-i job when matched to a worker.

UnÔ¨Ålled jobs produce nothing.

       The economy also contains L workers, each of whom produces y i when matched to a

type-i job in the market sector. Unmatched workers receive an imputed income z in the

nonmarket sector.

       Workers and Ô¨Årms engage in a single round of search, during which they meet ran-

domly in pair-wise fashion. The aggregate number of meetings obeys the CRS matching

technology

                              M (L, J) = aL1‚àíŒ± J Œ± ,     0 < Œ± < 1,                             (1)

where J equals the total supply of jobs, and where the parameter a is such that aL1‚àíŒ± J Œ± <

L, J in equilibrium.3 It follows from this technology and the random meeting assumption
3
    Equation (1) is the standard speciÔ¨Åcation of the matching technology that underlies mod-

                                                 6
that each worker Ô¨Ånds a job with probability Pw = a(J/L)Œ± , each Ô¨Årm Ô¨Ålls a vacancy with

probability Pf = a(J/L)Œ±‚àí1 , and that (J i /J) equals the fraction of meetings involving

type-i jobs.

    Upon meeting, workers and Ô¨Årms engage in a (nonsymmetric) Nash bargain to deter-

mine the division of the match surplus. In particular, wages solve
                    max
                           (wi ‚àí z)Œ≤ (y i ‚àí wi )1‚àíŒ≤ ,   for i = 1, 2, . . . , I,
                    wi
where Œ≤, 0 < Œ≤ < 1, is a parameter that determines the fraction of the match surplus

obtained by the worker.4

    This completes the speciÔ¨Åcation of the model. Equilibrium entails an equality ‚Äì for

each job type ‚Äì between the expected proÔ¨Åt associated with a vacancy and the cost of

creating the marginal vacancy.


B. The EÔ¨Éciency Condition with a Single Job Type

    Consider the eÔ¨Éciency properties of job creation behavior when there is a single job

type. To compute equilibrium job creation, observe Ô¨Årst that the value of a vacancy is

given by

                 V = Pf (y ‚àí w) + (1 ‚àí Pf )0 = a(J/L)Œ±‚àí1 (1 ‚àí Œ≤)(y ‚àí z),               (2)

using the deÔ¨Ånition of Pf and the wage equation implied by the Nash bargaining problem,

                            w = Œ≤y + (1 ‚àí Œ≤)z = z + Œ≤(y ‚àí z).                          (3)

    In equilibrium, the value of a vacancy equals the cost of creating the marginal job,

                  Pf (1 ‚àí Œ≤)(y ‚àí z) = a(J/L)Œ±‚àí1 (1 ‚àí Œ≤)(y ‚àí z) = C  (J),              (4)

ern interpretations of the Beveridge curve relationship between unemployment and vacan-

cies. See Blanchard and Diamond (1989) and Pissarides (1990).

  This parametrization of the bargaining solution is common in search equilibrium models;

see, e.g., Pissarides (1990). Kalai (1977) provides an axiomatic justiÔ¨Åcation.

                                              7
which implies the equilibrium job supply function


                              J = J( a , L , Œ± , Œ≤ , y , z ).                           (5)
                                      (+) (+) (?) (‚àí) (+) (‚àí)


    To determine the eÔ¨Éciency properties of (4) and (5), consider a social planner who

chooses job creation to solve

                        max
                                aL1‚àíŒ± J Œ± y + [L ‚àí aL1‚àíŒ± J Œ± ]z ‚àí C(J).                 (6)
                         J

The Ô¨Årst-order condition to this problem states that the socially optimal supply of jobs

satisÔ¨Åes

                         Pf Œ±(y ‚àí z) = a(J/L)Œ±‚àí1 Œ±(y ‚àí z) = C  (J),                    (7)

    Comparing (4) to the social optimality condition (7), we obtain the following eÔ¨Éciency

characterization of equilibrium job creation:

               
                   Œ≤ < 1 ‚àí Œ± ‚áí equilibrium job supply is too high;
                   Œ≤ = 1 ‚àí Œ± ‚áí equilibrium job supply is socially optimal;              (8)
                   Œ≤ > 1 ‚àí Œ± ‚áí equilibrium job supply is too low.

Condition (8) reproduces the standard condition for eÔ¨Écient participation behavior in two-

sided search models with a CRS meeting technology. This condition extends directly to

inÔ¨Ånite-horizon models that encompass capital accumulation, endogenous search intensity,

stochastic match quality, and a variable labor force (Hosios, 1990, and Pissarides, 1990,

chapter 7).

    To interpret the eÔ¨Éciency condition, observe that Ô¨Årms‚Äô job creation decisions involve

negative and positive trading externalities: each additional job reduces the match prob-

ability for Ô¨Årms, Pf , while simultaneosly increasing the match probability for workers,

Pw . The relative size of these externalities depends on Œ±, which can be interpreted as the

elasticity of Ô¨Årm-worker meetings with respect to the number of jobs created. Thus, the

                                                8
creation of one additional job causes gross output to rise by the fraction Œ± of the expected

surplus associated with an additional job. It is socially optimal to create an additional job,

if this increment to expected gross output exceeds the cost of creating the job. In equil-

birum, Ô¨Årms create additional jobs to the point where their fraction, (1 ‚àí Œ≤), of expected

match surplus equals the cost of an additional job. Thus, the wage determination process

induces eÔ¨Écient job creation behavior by Ô¨Årms only when (1 ‚àí Œ≤) = Œ±.


C. The EÔ¨Éciency Conditions with a Multiplicity of Job Types

      With multiple job types, equations (2)-(4) generalize directly, yielding


                           V i = Pf (y i ‚àí wi ) = a(J/L)Œ±‚àí1 (1 ‚àí Œ≤)(y i ‚àí z),                      (2 )


                             wi = Œ≤y i + (1 ‚àí Œ≤)z = z + Œ≤(y i ‚àí z),          and                   (3 )

                      Pf (1 ‚àí Œ≤)(y i ‚àí z) = a(J/L)Œ±‚àí1 (1 ‚àí Œ≤)(y i ‚àí z) = C i (J i ),              (4 )

for i = 1, 2, . . . , I.

      Equation (4 ) governs the equilibrium quality distribution of jobs. To evaluate the

eÔ¨Éciency properties of this quality distribution, consider the net social beneÔ¨Åt of converting

one type-l job to a type-h job, where h > l:


                              a(J/L)Œ±‚àí1 (y h ‚àí y l ) + C l (J l ) ‚àí C h (J h ).                   (9)


To determine whether the equilibrium quality distribution is eÔ¨Écient, evaluate (9) at the

decentralized outcome. From the equilibrium job supply conditions (4 ),


             C l (J l ) ‚àí C h (J h ) = a(J/L)Œ±‚àí1 (y l ‚àí y h )(1 ‚àí Œ≤) = Pf (y l ‚àí y h )(1 ‚àí Œ≤).   (10)


Substituting this condition into (9) yields


                                          a(J/L)Œ±‚àí1 (y h ‚àí y l )Œ≤                                  (11)

                                                      9
as the net social beneÔ¨Åt of upgrading the quality distribution of jobs, evaluated at the

decentralized equilibrium outcome. This expression is positive under any wage bargain

that provides workers with at least part of the match surplus. Thus, we have proved that

equilibrium job creation produces an excessive relative supply of inferior job types in the

following sense: Holding the total number of jobs Ô¨Åxed, eÔ¨Éciency improves by shifting the

mix of jobs towards higher productivity types.

    The reason for an excessive relative supply of inferior jobs is clear. According to (10),

Ô¨Årms obtain only a fraction (1‚àíŒ≤) of the extra expected surplus generated by upgrading the

quality distribution, but they incur all of the additional costs. In consequence, the private

incentives confronting job creators confer an inadequate premium on quality. Ironically,

greater bargaining power on the part of workers worsens the quality distribution of available

jobs.

    We can now appreciate the fundamental tension between the condition for an eÔ¨É-

cient mix of jobs (Œ≤ = 0) and the standard condition for an eÔ¨Écient total supply of jobs

(Œ≤ = 1 ‚àí Œ±). If government policy and labor market institutions channel job surpluses to

Ô¨Årms so as to produce an eÔ¨Écient job mix, Ô¨Årms will devote too many resources to job cre-

ation. Conversely, if government policy and labor market institutions support a bargaining

environment that balances the positive and negative trading externalities implied by (1),

Ô¨Årms will create an excessive relative supply of inferior jobs. Beginning from a situation

where workers have substantial bargaining power (Œ≤ ‚â• 1 ‚àí Œ±), a further increase in their

bargaining power worsens eÔ¨Éciency along both dimensions.

    To complete this discussion and lay the groundwork for later results, I draw on the

preceding analysis to fully specify the socially optimal and decentralized equilibrium job

supply behavior. The socially optimal supply of jobs is the solution to the I-equation

Equations (12) and (13) will prove useful in the analysis below.


III. The Quality Distribution in Alternative Environments


A. Search Technology and Search Intensity as a Function of Job Quality

    Because the opportunity cost of an unÔ¨Ålled job increases in job quality, Ô¨Årms with

better jobs are motivated to search more intensively. In addition, Ô¨Årms oÔ¨Äering better jobs

may Ô¨Ånd it easier to attract workers at any given level of search expenditures. Introducing

these factors into the model clearly shifts the equilibrium quality distribution toward better

jobs. One might suspect, then, that plausible modiÔ¨Åcations to the search technology would

overturn the eÔ¨Éciency characterization developed in section II. I now show that section

II‚Äôs central eÔ¨Éciency result continues to hold under a simple and natural formulation of

the search intensity decision.

                                                 11
    To develop the argument, modify the bare-bones model as follows. Let M (L, sJ) =

aL1‚àíŒ± (sJ)Œ± , 0 < Œ± < 1, be the number of meetings between Ô¨Årms and workers, where sJ

equals the aggregate eÔ¨Éciency units of search eÔ¨Äort supplied by Ô¨Årms. Let si denote the

eÔ¨Éciency units of search for a Ô¨Årm oÔ¨Äering a type-i job. For each eÔ¨Éciency unit supplied,

there is a probability M (L, sJ)/sJ of meeting a worker, so that the meeting probabilities

become

                                    Œ±‚àí1                                              Œ±
      Pfi = si /sJ M (L, sJ) = asi sJ/L     ,          i = 1, . . . , I,   and Pw = a sJ/L .


    Firms choose search intensity to maximize the net vacancy value

                                 Œ±‚àí1 i i
                      V i = a sJ/L    s (y ‚àí wi ) ‚àí œÉ i (si ),       i = 1, . . . , I,


where œÉ i (¬∑) is positive, increasing and strictly convex for each i with œÉ i (0) = 0. To capture

the idea that search is less costly for better job types, assume œÉ h (x) ‚â§ œÉ l (x) for h > l

and x ‚â• 0.

    Under these assumptions, the search-intensity behavior of Ô¨Årms obeys the Ô¨Årst-order

condition,


     œÉ i (si ) = a(sJ/L)Œ±‚àí1 (y i ‚àí wi ) = a(sJ/L)Œ±‚àí1 (1 ‚àí Œ≤)(y i ‚àí z),           i = 1, . . . , I.   (14)


According to this condition, optimal marginal search cost is higher for Ô¨Årms with better

jobs. It follows that eÔ¨Éciency units of search per job rise with job quality for two reasons

‚Äì greater incentive to search and lower search costs.

    Endogenous search intensity leads to the slightly modiÔ¨Åed equilibrium job supply

conditions,

where an asterisk denotes a function evaluated at the privately optimal search intensity.

                                                 12
    We can now analyze the eÔ¨Éciency properties of the equilibrium quality distribution in

the same manner as before. Holding search intensities and the supplies of other job types

Ô¨Åxed at equilibrium levels, consider the net social beneÔ¨Åt from converting one type-l job

to a type-h job, h > l:

                                                                                       
         a(sJ/L)Œ±‚àí1 sh‚àó (y h ‚àí z) ‚àí sl‚àó (y l ‚àí z) ‚àí œÉ h‚àó + C h (J h ) + œÉ l‚àó + C l (J l )

                                                I
                                                                     ‚àÇPfi
                                +(sh‚àó ‚àí sl‚àó )         J i (y i ‚àí z)        | i i‚àó .
                                                i=1
                                                                       ‚àÇs s =s

Evaluating at the equilibrium outcome, this expression becomes proportional to

                                                     I  i‚àó i 
       h‚àó   h         l‚àó   l
                                    
                                  h‚àó   l‚àó
                                                      s J
        s (y ‚àí z) ‚àí s (y ‚àí z) Œ≤ ‚àí (s ‚àí s )(1 ‚àí Œ±)J              (y i ‚àí z) ‚â° Œ¶(Œ≤),
                                                    i=1
                                                         sJ


where Œ¶ is a continuous function of Œ≤, satisfying Œ¶(0) < 0 and Œ¶(1 ‚àí Œ±) > 0.

    The Ô¨Årst term of Œ¶, analogous to (11), captures the direct eÔ¨Éciency gain from up-

grading job quality. This eÔ¨Éciency gain now reÔ¨Çects the greater productivity and greater

search intensity of the better job. The second term captures the eÔ¨Éciency loss implied

by greater search for the upgraded job. The resulting increase in aggregate search inten-

sity reduces the match probabilities for all Ô¨Årms. This eÔ¨Éciency loss equals the expected

reduction in the number of matches times the average ex post surplus on Ô¨Ålled jobs.

    Using the properties of the Œ¶(¬∑) function, we can now see how endogenous search

intensity modiÔ¨Åes the eÔ¨Éciency characterization. First, with endogenous search intensity,

channeling all match surplus to Ô¨Årms (Œ≤ = 0) no longer produces an eÔ¨Écient mix of

jobs. Instead, Œ≤ = 0 now leads to an excessive relative supply of better jobs. Conversely,

Œ≤ = 1 ‚àí Œ± implies Œ¶ > 0 and an excessive relative supply of inferior jobs. Second,

applying the intermediate value theorem, there exists a Œ≤ ‚àà (0, 1 ‚àí Œ±) that produces an

eÔ¨Écient job mix. Hence, there remains a fundamental tension between the condition for

                                                       13
an eÔ¨Écient number of jobs (Œ≤ = 1 ‚àí Œ±) and the modiÔ¨Åed condition for an eÔ¨Écient mix of

jobs (Œ≤ < 1 ‚àí Œ±). I conclude from this analysis that the central eÔ¨Éciency result in section

II does not stem from unduly restrictive assumptions regarding the search technology.5


B. Ex Ante Sorting of Jobs into Separate Search Markets

       Neither endogenous search intensity nor easier search by better Ô¨Årms resolves the basic

tension between relative and total supply eÔ¨Éciency condtions. These modiÔ¨Åcations to the

search environment leave intact the crucial feature of the bare-bones model: the mixing of

endogenously supplied heterogeneous jobs. To appreciate the crucial nature of the mixing

feature, it is helpful to consider a model in which Ô¨Årms are perfectly sorted along the

quality dimension into separate search markets. Location, for example, is an important

job attribute that may be easily distinguished ex ante.

       Suppose that workers are initially distributed among locations. Prior to searching

for a job, workers can migrate between locations at a cost that may diÔ¨Äer among workers

and that may be contingent on destination and initial location. Job quality diÔ¨Äers across

locations, but ‚Äì the critical assumption ‚Äì it is identical for all Ô¨Årms at a particular location.

After migration, job creation and search take place as in the bare-bones model.

       Modifying the previous analysis to incorporate equilibrium conditions for intermarket


5
    The analysis in this section, and elsewhere in the paper, presumes that Ô¨Årms cannot

eÔ¨Äectively announce and commit to wage oÔ¨Äers prior to meeting as an instrument for

increasing arrival rates of workers. Barring an inÔ¨Ånite elasticity of worker arrivals with

respect to the promised wage (which would eÔ¨Äectively restore an auction market), it does

not appear that ex ante wage oÔ¨Äers will generally produce an eÔ¨Écient job mix in search

equilibrium. However, ex ante wage oÔ¨Äers have a potentially important bearing on the size

of the equilibrium departure from socially optimal outcomes.

                                               14
mobility, one obtains the following conditions for eÔ¨Écient equilibrium job supply:


                                       Œ≤ i = 1 ‚àí Œ±i ,


where i indexes location and job quality. These conditions are simply the multi-market

version of the standard condition (8), and they reduce to (8) when the available search

technology is the same across locations. These conditions simultaneously achieve eÔ¨Éciency

along relative and total supply margins under perfect ex ante sorting of jobs. The ex ante

sorting eliminates the mixing of heterogeneous jobs that caused the tension between relative

and total supply eÔ¨Éciency conditions in the previous models.

    This brief discussion provides some insight into how other modiÔ¨Åcations to the search

environment would aÔ¨Äect the tension between total and relative supply eÔ¨Éciency condi-

tions. Reputational mechanisms, for example, might facilitate the ex ante sorting of jobs

in an environment with repeated transactions by the Ô¨Årm. Informational imperfections

related, for example, to the experience-good nature of job quality would hamper ex ante

sorting. In general, any mechanism that failed to achieve perfect ex ante sorting of jobs

along all dimensions that workers care about would fail to eliminate the tension between

relative and total supply eÔ¨Éciency conditions in the decentralized equilibrium. As a fur-

ther point, since Ô¨Årms‚Äô incentives to advertise or disguise their quality depend on their

relative position in the job quality distribution, there would seem to be considerable scope

in richer models for a variety of equilibria with endogenously determined degrees of ex ante

sorting.


C. Endogenous Quality Distributions on Both Sides

    The eÔ¨Éciency analysis extends straightforwardly to endogenous quality determination

on both sides of the market. Consider, Ô¨Årst, a symmetric speciÔ¨Åcation that incorporates

heterogeneity in worker quality and participation costs in a manner that mirrors the treat-

                                            15
ment of heterogeneity in job types and creation costs. Let Ln denote the number of type-n

workers who choose to participate, and let L denote the total number of worker partici-

pants. Let f ni denote the output produced by a match between a type-n worker and a

type-i job.

    In this environment, nonsymmetric Nash bargaining implies the wage equations

                  wni = z + Œ≤(f ni ‚àí z),        i = 1, . . . , I and n = 1, . . . , N.    (16)

Hence, wages reÔ¨Çect job-related and worker-related productivity diÔ¨Äerentials with equal

force in the equilibrium with decentralized wage determination.

    Evaluated at the equilibrium outcome under decentralized Nash bargaining, upgrading

the job quality distribution enhances eÔ¨Éciency whenever

                                N
                                
                          Œ±‚àí1
                 Œ≤a(J/L)              (Ln /L)(f nh ‚àí f nl ) > 0       for any i = h, l;
                                n=1


and upgrading the worker quality distribution enhances eÔ¨Éciency whenever

                                 I
                                 
               (1 ‚àí Œ≤)a(J/L)Œ±      (J i /J)(f mi ‚àí f pi ) > 0 for any n = m, p.
                                 i=1


It follows that relative job supplies are eÔ¨Écient if, and only if, Œ≤ = 0; whereas relative

worker supplies are eÔ¨Écient if, and only if, Œ≤ = 1.

    The same tension between eÔ¨Éciency requirements arises when workers make human

capital investment decisions prior to job matches. To see this point, assume that workers

can achieve human capital level h at a cost K(h), where K(¬∑) is increasing and convex. Let

f i (h), f  (¬∑) > 0, denote worker output on a type-i job. Under these assumptions, privately

optimal worker investment decisions satisfy

                                                      I
                                                      
                                                 Œ±
                                                                               
                       K (h) = z + Œ≤a(J/L)                  (J i /J) f i (h) ‚àí z ,
                                                      i=1


                                                  16
but socially eÔ¨Écient human capital investment requires

                                                I
                                                
                                           Œ±
                                                                         
                       K (h) = z + a(J/L)             (J i /J) f i (h) ‚àí z .
                                                i=1


Clearly, too little human capital investment occurs unless Œ≤ = 1.

    Thus, the basic message is the same in both the participation and human capital

investment models. When wages are determined in a decentralized manner, there is a

fundamental tension between the requirement for an eÔ¨Écient mix of workers and the re-

quirement for an eÔ¨Écient mix of jobs. Both the eÔ¨Écient worker mix and the eÔ¨Écient job

mix conditions diÔ¨Äer from the standard condition for an eÔ¨Écient total supply of workers

and jobs. Since both workers and Ô¨Årms are likely to extract part of the match surplus,

both worker quality and job quality are too low in the decentralized equilibrium.


IV. The EÔ¨Écient Wage Structure


A. EÔ¨Écient Wages with an Endogenous Job Quality Distribution

    Thus far, the eÔ¨Éciency analysis of the job quality distribution assumes that wage

determination occurs in a decentralized manner as the outcome of independent Nash bar-

gains. A natural and important line of inquiry considers how the eÔ¨Éciency characteristics

of the job quality distribution are aÔ¨Äected by alternative bargaining solutions and by la-

bor market institutions that facilitate centralized wage determination. Here, I address

an important question related to this line of inquiry: What are the properties of a wage

structure that induces an eÔ¨Écient number and mix of jobs? I consider the consequences

of centralized wage bargaining between Ô¨Årms and workers in section VII.

    We can represent an arbitrary wage determination mechanism by a set of parameters

{Œ≤ i }Ii=1 that govern the sharing of match surplus for each job type. Positive levels of

participation by workers and jobs require 0 ‚â§ Œ≤ i ‚â§ 1 for all i. In terms of these sharing

                                            17
parameters, private job supply decisions in the bare-bones model satisfy


      Pf (1 ‚àí Œ≤ i )(y i ‚àí z) = a(J/L)Œ±‚àí1 (1 ‚àí Œ≤ i )(y i ‚àí z) = C i (J i ),                 i = 1, 2, . . . , I.   (4 )


      As before, (9) expresses the net social beneÔ¨Åt from converting one type-l job to a

type-h job, h > l. Combining (4 ) and (9) yields a restriction on any pair {Œ≤ h , Œ≤ l } that

induces an eÔ¨Écient relative supply of the two job types; namely, Œ≤ h /Œ≤ l = (y h ‚àí z)/(y l ‚àí z).

More generally, the complete set of sharing parameters brings about an eÔ¨Écient mix of

jobs if, and only if,


                        Œ≤ i+1 /Œ≤ i = (y i ‚àí z)/(y i+1 ‚àí z),             i = 1, 2, . . . , I ‚àí 1.                   (16)


      An eÔ¨Écient number of jobs requires equivalence between the total supply condition

(12.b) and a suitably generalized version of (13.b),

                   
                    I     Œ±‚àí1 
                               I                     I
                                                     
                       k               k  k k
                  a   J /L       (1 ‚àí Œ≤ )J (y ‚àí z) =   J k C k (J k ).
                      k=1                      k=1                              k=1


Thus, a set of sharing parameters brings about an eÔ¨Écient total supply of jobs if, and only

if,
                                    I
                                                          I
                                                           
                                           k   k
                                Œ±         J (y ‚àí z) =            (1 ‚àí Œ≤ k )J k (y k ‚àí z).                          (17)
                                    k=1                    k=1


      The unique set of surplus sharing parameters that solve (16) and (17) is given by

                                                   I      k       k
                            i                      k=1 (J /J)(y       ‚àí z)
                         Œ≤ = (1 ‚àí Œ±)                                          i = 1, . . . , I.                    (18)
                                                        (y i ‚àí z)

This equation generalizes the standard eÔ¨Éciency condition (8) in Diamond-Mortensen-

Pissarides models to encompass multiple, endogenously supplied job types. (See Hosios

(1990) and Pissarides (1990).) The new term in this condition multiplies (1 ‚àí Œ±) by the

ratio of the weighted-average match surplus to match surplus for a type-i job. Hence,

                                                            18
under an eÔ¨Écient wage structure, better jobs grant a smaller share of match surplus to

workers than inferior jobs. There is no apparent reason for a wage structure with this

characteristic to emerge in a fully decentralized setting.

    It is useful to translate (18), which is a statement about the structure of eÔ¨Écient

sharing parameters, into a direct statement about the wage structure. Since wi = z +

Œ≤ i (y i ‚àí z), the eÔ¨Écient wage structure implied by (18) is


                                      I
                                      
                      i
                    w = z + (1 ‚àí Œ±)         (J k /J)(y k ‚àí z),   i = 1, . . . , I.     (19)
                                      k=1



Hence, under the eÔ¨Écient wage structure, all job types oÔ¨Äer a wage equal to the opportu-

nity cost of workers‚Äô time, plus the fraction (1 ‚àí Œ±) of the average match surplus. Here,

the ‚Äúwage‚Äù is appropriately interpreted as encompassing nonpecuniary aspects of worker

compensation; in other words, the eÔ¨Écient wage structure entails full equalization of job-

related utility diÔ¨Äerences.

    At Ô¨Årst sight, the result that an optimal wage structure completely compresses pro-

ductivity diÔ¨Äerentials might appear to violate the classical eÔ¨Éciency dictum that wages

fully reÔ¨Çect productivity diÔ¨Äerentials. But the classical dictum pertains to productivity

diÔ¨Äerentials associated with worker traits, whereas (19) pertains to productivity diÔ¨Äeren-

tials associated with job characteristics. Complete wage compression generates an eÔ¨Écient

job mix in this model, because it enables Ô¨Årms to capture all rents that derive from up-

grading job quality. As we saw in section II.C, the inability of Ô¨Årms to capture these rents

under decentralized bargaining induces an excessive relative supply of inferior jobs. Wage

compression resolves this problem.

    The favorable consequences of wage compression in this search model contrast sharply

with their adverse consequences in eÔ¨Éciency wage models based on eÔ¨Äort elicitation prob-

                                                19
lems.6 Bulow and Summers (1986), for example, develop a model with imperfect moni-

toring of worker eÔ¨Äort in primary sector jobs and costless monitoring in secondary sector

jobs. If it is infeasible for workers to post performance bonds or otherwise ‚Äúbuy‚Äù jobs, the

resulting equilibrium entails a wage premium for primary sector jobs and, consequently,

an ineÔ¨Éciently low level of primary sector employment. In this type of eÔ¨Éciency wage

model wage compression causes secondary sector employment to expand at the expense of

primary sector employment (Bulow and Summers, 1986, page 392), which further worsens

the already ineÔ¨Écient composition of economic activity.

       Table 1 illustrates how various factors inÔ¨Çuence the eÔ¨Écient sharing parameters, the

wage, and the resulting distribution of job types. The table entries are computed from

(4 ), (18) and (19) assuming that C i (J i ) = g i (J i )Œ≥ , g i , Œ≥ > 0 for i=1,2. This speciÔ¨Åcation

implies positive job creation for both types in the equilibrium with decentralized wage

determination.

       Row (7) of the table shows that lower quality jobs are sometimes squeezed out entirely

by an eÔ¨Écient wage structure. It can be eÔ¨Écient to eliminate lower quality jobs, even when

these jobs entail large amounts of surplus ex post. The remaining rows indicate how the

job supply elasticity parameter (Œ≥), the elasticity of matches with respect to job creation

(Œ±), and the opportunity cost of worker time aÔ¨Äect the eÔ¨Écient distribution of job types

and the range of the eÔ¨Écient sharing parameters among active job types.

       To sum up, the eÔ¨Écient wage structure entails full compression of job-related pro-

ductivity diÔ¨Äerentials ‚Äì that is, equal wages among identical workers. EÔ¨Écient wage

compression involves a smaller fraction of match surplus accruing to workers on better

jobs. Relative to the equilibrium outcome under decentralized bargaining, the eÔ¨Écient

wage structure induces larger relative supplies of better jobs and, possibly, a truncation

from below of the job quality distribution. In the light of these results, section VII below

considers the potential eÔ¨Éciency-enhancing role of centralized wage-setting institutions.


B. EÔ¨Écient Wages with Two-Sided Endogenous Quality Distributions

    Although the algebra is tedious, one can generalize the preceding analysis of the eÔ¨É-

cient wage structure to accommodate two-sided endogenous quality distributions. For the

symmetric, two-sided quality model in section III.C, the eÔ¨Écient wage structure exhibits

the following properties:

                     N
                                                N
                                                 
                            n        i+1,n
                           (L /L)w           =         (Ln /L)win ,   i = 1, . . . , I ‚àí 1, and           (20)
                     n=1                         n=1

         I
                                                I
                                                 
                 i          i,n+1      in
               (J /J)(f             ‚àíf )=              (J i /J)(wi,n+1 ‚àí win ),   n = 1, . . . , N ‚àí 1.   (21)
         i=1                                     i=1

According to (20), the eÔ¨Écient wage structure equalizes expected wages across jobs with

diÔ¨Äerent productivities, where the expectation is calculated over the distribution of worker

types. This condition is a simple and natural generalization of condition (19). According to

(21), the eÔ¨Écient wage structure fully reÔ¨Çects expected productivity diÔ¨Äerences that stem

from worker traits. Putting the pieces together delivers the following theorem: relative to

the eÔ¨Écient wage structure, the wage structure under decentralized bargaining entails too

much compression of worker-related productivity diÔ¨Äerentials and too little compression of

job-related productivity diÔ¨Äerentials.


V. Analytical Solutions for Parametric Versions of the Model


    With suitable assumptions about the form of the job creation cost functions, one can

obtain explicit analytical solutions for the quality distribution of jobs and the structure

of wages in the decentralized equilibrium of the basic model. One can also solve for the

eÔ¨Écient wage characterized in section IV and the resulting quality distribution.

                                                            21
    Figure 1 displays the decentralized equilibrium and eÔ¨Écient quality distributions of

jobs under the assumption that the creation cost schedules satisfy

                              C i = g i (J i )Œ≥ ,    i = 1, . . . , 100.

In constructing the Ô¨Ågure, I have chosen the g i parameters to produce a uniform distri-

bution of job types in the decentralized equilibrium. (g1 is set to one ‚Äì a normalization.)

The search eÔ¨Éciency parameter (a) is set to achieve a 5% unemployment rate in the de-

centralized equilibrium with Nash wage bargaining (Œ≤ = .5). The least productive job is

set to 110% of the workers‚Äô reservation value, and the most productive job is set to deliver

a value of roughly .43 for the standard deviation of log wages in the decentralized Nash

outcome. This value corresponds to the standard error of the residual in a regression of

log hourly wages on an extensive set of experience, education and sex controls for the U.S.

manufacturing sector in 1987. See Figure 1 in Davis and Haltiwanger (1991).

    Table 2 displays other outcomes that correspond to the job distributions displayed

in Figure 1. Table 3 shows that the welfare gains aÔ¨Äorded by an eÔ¨Écient wage structure

are much smaller than the gains in average labor productivity. For example, consider the

decentralized equilibrium with Œ≤ = Œ± = .5, so that the total supply eÔ¨Éciency condition

holds. Relative to this decentralized equilibrium, an eÔ¨Écient wage structure raises average

labor productivity by more than Ô¨Åve percent (from 126.8 to 133.4), but it raises net per

capita income by less than one-half percent (from 119.12 to 119.66). The main reason

for this large gap between productivity and welfare gains is the much higher level of

unemployment under the eÔ¨Écient wage structure.


VI. Tax Policy with Decentralized Wage Determination


A. The Structure of the Optimal Policy

    As in many other models that generate wage diÔ¨Äerentials among identical workers,

                                                    22
the search models in this paper imply an eÔ¨Éciency-enhancing role for employment tax

and subsidy policies that alter the composition of economic activity. In the bare-bones

model, the optimal tax structure achieves the same number and mix of jobs as the eÔ¨Écient

wage structure, but it magniÔ¨Åes rather than eliminates pre-existing wage diÔ¨Äerentials.

In contrast to models where eÔ¨Äort elicitation problems underlie wage diÔ¨Äerentials among

identical workers (e.g., Bulow and Summers, 1986), optimal policy in the search model

need not entail an absolute subsidy to high wage/high productivity jobs. Nor is the size

of the welfare improvement induced by an optimal policy closely related to the magnitude

of pre-existing wage diÔ¨Äerentials.

      To derive the optimal tax structure in the basic model, Ô¨Årst reformulate equations

(3 ) and (4 ) to incorporate type-contingent employment taxes (subsidies, if negative):

                       wi = Œ≤(y i ‚àí T i ) + (1 ‚àí Œ≤)z = z + Œ≤(y i ‚àí z ‚àí T i ),     and          (22)

               Pf (1 ‚àí Œ≤)(y i ‚àí z ‚àí T i ) = a(J/L)Œ±‚àí1 (1 ‚àí Œ≤)(y i ‚àí z ‚àí T i ) = C i (J i ),   (23)

for i = 1, 2, . . . , I.

      As before, expression (9) describes the net social beneÔ¨Åt of ugrading the job quality

distribution. Evaluating (9) at (23), and setting the resulting expression to zero, implies

that the optimal tax structure satisÔ¨Åes

                                             
                       T i = T i+1 + Œ≤/(1 ‚àí Œ≤) (y i+1 ‚àí y i ),    i = 1, . . . , I ‚àí 1.        (24)

According to (24), the optimal tax structure favors more productive jobs, and the size of

the diÔ¨Äerential subsidy increases in the workers‚Äô share of match surplus and in the size of

the productivity diÔ¨Äerential.

      It follows from (22) and (24) that wage diÔ¨Äerentials equal

                                                    Œ≤
                                     wi+1 ‚àí wi =       (y i+1 ‚àí y i )                          (25)
                                                   1‚àíŒ≤

                                                    23
under the optimal tax structure, but they equal


                                        wi+1 ‚àí wi = Œ≤(y i+1 ‚àí y i )                                        (26)


in the decentralized equilibrium with no taxes and subsidies. Thus, the optimal tax struc-

ture causes job-related productivity components of wage diÔ¨Äerentials to increase by a factor

of (1 ‚àí Œ≤)‚àí1 relative to the no-tax equilibrium.

    The level of optimal taxes is pinned down by the eÔ¨Écient total supply requirement,

                             I
                                                            I
                                                             
                                    k   k
                         Œ±         J (y ‚àí z) = (1 ‚àí Œ≤)             J k (y k ‚àí T k ‚àí z).
                             k=1                             k=1


This restriction, in combination with (24), implies

                                            I
                                                                           I‚àí1
                                                                            
          I              ‚àí1                         k         k
        T = (1 ‚àí Œ≤)           (1 ‚àí Œ≤ ‚àí Œ±)         (J /J)(y ‚àí z) ‚àí Œ≤               (J k /J)(y I ‚àí y k ) .   (27)
                                            k=1                             k=1


Recall that the eÔ¨Écient job distribution is the solution to (12.a) and (12.b). Equations

(24) and (27) determine the tax structure that sustains this eÔ¨Écient distribution in the

equilibrium with decentralized wage determination.


B. Numerical Experiments under Alternative Tax Policy and Wage-Setting Regimes

    Table 3 displays equilibrium outcomes under the optimal tax structure when wages are

determined according to decentralized bargains. For comparison, the table also displays

outcomes under two alternative regimes ‚Äì decentralized wage bargains with no taxes and

the eÔ¨Écient wage structure with no taxes. As in Table 1, the job creation cost schedules

are C i (J i ) = g i (J i )Œ≥ for i=1,2. The welfare measure in Table 3 is per capita income net

of job creation costs.

    Several aspects of the table merit discussion. First, in line with equations (25) and

(26), the optimal tax structure causes wage diÔ¨Äerentials to expand, often by large amounts.

                                                        24
As the table veriÔ¨Åes, the eÔ¨Écient wage structure achieves the same job distribution and

per capita income level as the optimal tax structure, but it eliminates pre-existing wage

diÔ¨Äerentials among identical workers. Thus, if earnings equality is viewed as desirable,

wage compression dominates the optimal tax policy as a tool for achieving socially desirable

outcomes.

       Second, an eÔ¨Écient wage or optimal tax structure can substantially alter the job

distribution and thereby bring about a large increase in average labor productivity. For

example, in row (2) of the table an eÔ¨Écient wage or optimal tax structure reduces low-

productivity jobs‚Äô share of the total from 37% to 21%, resulting in a 3.7% increase in

productivity.

       Third, sizable wage and productivity diÔ¨Äerentials among identical workers do not

imply large welfare gains associated with a move to the eÔ¨Écient job distribution, as illus-

trated by row (7). As a related point, the size of welfare improvements that result from a

move to the eÔ¨Écient job distribution exhibits little connection to the size of productivity

improvements. Compare, for example, rows (3) and (4).

       Fourth, gains in per capita income typically fall well short of gains in average labor

productivity as a result of moving to an eÔ¨Écient wage or optimal tax structure. The

relatively small improvement in per capita income can be understood as follows. Equation

(4 ) implies that better jobs cost more to create in the ineÔ¨Écient, no-tax equilibrium. The

relative cost of creating better jobs rises further as the economy moves toward the eÔ¨Écient

mix of jobs. Thus, the gains from higher average productivity at the eÔ¨Écient job mix are

partly oÔ¨Äset by the higher average cost of job creation. In addition, when Œ± = 1 ‚àí Œ≤,

unemployment is always higher at the eÔ¨Écient outcome.7 Holding Ô¨Åxed the number of

7
    More generally, unemployment is typically higher at the eÔ¨Écient outcome unless Œ± is

substantially less than 1 ‚àí Œ≤.

                                              25
jobs, an increase in average job productivity raises the expected cost of the congestion

externality associated with creating one more job of either type. Thus, upgrading the

quality distribution of jobs implies a decline in the eÔ¨Écient number of jobs and a rise

in unemployment. On net, the increase in average job creation costs and the rise in

unemployment oÔ¨Äset much of the gain in average labor productivity.

    Fifth, the scope for welfare improvements engineered by an eÔ¨Écient wage or optimal

tax structure is greater when the total supply eÔ¨Éciency condition (Œ± = 1 ‚àí Œ≤) fails to hold.

To see this point, compare rows (1), (3), (5) and (6) in Table 2 with rows (2), (4) and

(7). In the Ô¨Årst set of rows Œ± = 1 ‚àí Œ≤, and welfare gains range from 1.5-3.5% of initial per

capita income; in the second set of rows Œ± = 1 ‚àí Œ≤, and welfare gains range from .1% to

.7% of initial per capita income.

    Finally, and unlike eÔ¨Éciency wage models based on eÔ¨Äort elicitation problems, the

optimal subsidy for high wage jobs is not closely related to the size of the wage diÔ¨Äerential.

Indeed, the optimal policy sometimes calls for a tax on employment in both job types. This

outcome can arise when weak bargaining power by workers (Œ≤ < 1 ‚àí Œ±) results in too much

job creation and overly congested search by Ô¨Årms. While this particular outcome might

seem implausible, the general point is that the size of the optimal employment subsidy

depends crucially on the search technology and relative bargaining power, as well as on

the size of the productivity diÔ¨Äerentials between job types.


VII. Wages and Job Quality with Centralized Wage Determination


    In the context of the basic model, consider a labor union and an employer confeder-

ation that bargain over the wage structure prior to job creation and search. All workers

belong to the union, and all Ô¨Årms belong to the employer confederation. Assume that the

labor union and employer confederation act as perfect agents for their respective member-


                                             26
ships.

       Since workers are risk-neutral and identical, it follows that the labor union wants to

maximize wages plus the imputed value of leisure. In contrast, the employer confederation

consists of Ô¨Årms that may diÔ¨Äer in terms of both job creation costs and job quality.8 This

heterogeneity implies potential conÔ¨Çict among Ô¨Årms regarding preference orderings over

alternative wage structures. I assume that the employer confederation fully circumvents

these conÔ¨Çicts and seeks to maximize aggregate net proÔ¨Åts. In principle, side payments

within the employer confederation can be used to insure that all Ô¨Årms share in the proÔ¨Åt

gains from centralized bargaining.

       Given these preferences, the labor union and employer confederation engage in a

(possibly nonsymmetric) Nash bargain over the wage structure, with threat points deÔ¨Åned

by outcomes under decentralized bargaining. Denote the threat point outcomes for workers

and Ô¨Årms by W (Œ≤) and F (Œ≤), respectively, where Œ≤ equals the worker‚Äôs share of match

surplus in the decentralized Nash bargaining outcome. Let Œ≤ c denote workers‚Äô share of the

(additional) surplus that results from centralized bargaining.

       Formally, the centralized wage bargaining problem is

                                                             Œ≤c                                  1‚àíŒ≤ c

for i = 1, . . . , I.

      I have been unable to make much progress in deriving general characterizations of the

solution to (28)-(29), so I turn immediately to the results of a numerical analysis. Ta-

ble 4 shows wage structure, per capita income, job distribution, and average productivity

outcomes for a particular parametrization of the model under three alternative wage de-

termination regimes. The top row of the second panel reports outcomes under the eÔ¨Écient

wage structure. Remaining rows report outcomes under decentralized or centralized Nash

wage bargaining for diÔ¨Äerent values of Œ≤ and Œ≤ c . Recall that Œ≤, workers‚Äô share of match

surplus in the decentralized wage bargain, determines the threat points in the centralized

Nash bargain and thereby inÔ¨Çuences the wage structure outcome.

      Three results stand out in Table 4. First, centralized bargaining increases average

labor productivity to the level that prevails under the Ô¨Årst-best outcomes with an eÔ¨Écient

wage structure. Second, centralized bargaining exhausts a large fraction of the potential

gains in net per capita income associated with a move to Ô¨Årst-best outcomes. Indeed, when

bargaining power is equally distributed in the underlying decentralized bargaining regime

(Œ≤ = .5), centralized bargaining reaps essentially all potential eÔ¨Éciency gains. Third,

centralized bargaining has dramatic eÔ¨Äects on the wage structure. Wages diÔ¨Äerentials

diminish sharply as a result of centralized bargaining when Œ≤ equals or exceeds .5. For

small values of Œ≤, centralized bargaining produces large wage diÔ¨Äerentials opposite in sign

to the diÔ¨Äerentials that prevail under decentralized bargaining.

      To understand this last result, note that the centralized wage structure eÔ¨Äectively

punishes Ô¨Årms that create low-quality jobs by granting a relatively small portion of match

surplus on these jobs. This pattern arises for all values of Œ≤ and Œ≤ c . Evidently, when Ô¨Årms

                                                        28
garner most of the rents in the decentralized bargaining regime (i.e., when Œ≤ is small), this

punishment aspect of the centralized wage structure manifests itself in especially stark

fashion.

    The wage structure results in Table 4 bear out one problematic aspect of the cen-

tralized bargaining problem as formulated in (28) and (29). For example, to implement

the wage structure outcomes illustrated in Table 4 for Œ≤ = .2, the bargaining authority

must Ô¨Årst identify low-productivity jobs and then force these jobs to pay higher wages. In

practice, limitations on available information, veriÔ¨Åcation ability, and enforcement powers

are likely to render these wage structure solutions infeasible. Motivated by these consid-

erations, it would be useful to formulate centralized wage bargaining problems that entail

weaker informational and enforcement requirements.


VIII. Related Work


    This paper was originally presented at a conference in honor of Assar Lindbeck that

took place in Stockholm in June 1995. Earlier drafts of the paper were circulated in

1992 and 1993. The current draft is essentially identical to the 1995 version, except for

this section and an improved ordering of the material in earlier sections. At this juncture

(August 2001), some brief remarks on how this paper Ô¨Åts with concurrent and later research

are in order.

    Between the Ô¨Årst draft and the 1995 draft, I became aware of three other papers

that also model search environments with endogenously supplied heterogeneous types.

Published versions of these papers appeared as Acemoglu (1996), Bertola and Caballero

(1994) and Sattinger (1995). Portions of the analysis in Acemoglu (1996) overlap closely

with this paper. In particular, he independently proved that a search equilibrium with

decentralized bargaining leads to under investment in job and worker quality. See his


                                             29
Proposition 2. More generally, the mixing of heterogeneous types that are endogenously

supplied to search environments is an important theme in Acemoglu (1996) and several of

his other papers.

    Ljungqvist and Sargent (2000, pages 582-589) study an inÔ¨Ånite-horizon version of the

bare-bones model in Section II. They show that several of my results carry over to the

steady state in an inÔ¨Ånite-horizon setting. In particular, (a) the search equilibrium with

decentralized wage setting exhibits an excessive relative supply of inferior jobs (unless Ô¨Årms

capture the entire match surplus), (b) there is a fundamental tension between the relative

and total job supply eÔ¨Éciency conditions of the same form as derived above, and (c) perfect

ex ante sorting of diÔ¨Äerent job types into separate search markets eliminates the excess

relative supply of inferior jobs and resolves the tension between total and relative supply

eÔ¨Éciency conditions. Following Moen (1987), they also show that under certain conditions

competitive wage announcements by Ô¨Årms prior to search can eÔ¨Äectively separate the

markets in the optimal way and achieve an eÔ¨Écient total and relative supply of jobs.

    Another related line of work, associated most closely with an important series of pa-

pers by Caballero and Hammour (1998, e.g.), explores the macroeconomic implications of

relationship-speciÔ¨Åc investments by capital and labor. These investments ‚Äì which may but

need not derive from costly match formation ‚Äì give rise to hold-up problems, or ‚Äúappropri-

ability‚Äù problems in the language of Caballero and Hammour. As they show, unresolved

appropriability problems can lead to a number of bad macroeconomic outcomes including

under investment by appropriated factors, undesirably slow adoption of new technologies,

delayed job creation and excessive unemployment in response to bad shocks, and bottle-

neck problems in response to good shocks. They also emphasize that the failure to resolve

appropriability problems at the micro level often gives rise to policy and institutional

responses at the macro level.


                                             30
       It is useful to relate selected results in this paper to the perspective and analysis of

Caballero and Hammour. First, the excessive relative supply of inferior types in search

equilibrium with decentralized wage setting can be seen as one manifestation of the generic

tendency to under investment in environments with unresolved hold-up problems. Second,

the fundamental tension between relative and total supply eÔ¨Éciency conditions shows that

it can be impossible to achieve eÔ¨Écient factor supplies with decentralized wage setting.

While ex ante sorting mechanisms relax this tension, they are unlikely to operate per-

fectly in real-world settings. Third, industrial policy (Section VI) and centralized wage

determination (Section VII) are two possible institutional responses to the appropriability

problems created by costly match formation. My analysis shows that these institutions

can improve upon fully decentralized outcomes, but it should be emphasized that they

bring their own problems that are largely ignored in this paper.9 Fourth, the eÔ¨Écient wage

structure analysis in Section IV suggests that the requirements for fully eÔ¨Écient factor

supply patterns are highly demanding and hard to achieve for any institution.

       My analysis also points to a potentially important limitation of the models emphasized

by Caballero and Hammour. In their models, labor typically appropriates a portion of the

quasi-rents generated by capital, or vice versa. While each factor is susceptible to ap-

propriation, only one factor suÔ¨Äers appropriation in equilibrium. In contrast, my analysis

shows that search environments with two-sided endogenous heterogeneity exhibit simulta-

neous appropriation of each factor by the other, but along diÔ¨Äerent investment margins.

In other words, countervailing powers to appropriate by capital and labor do not fully net

out when match formation is costly and both sides undertake speciÔ¨Åc investments. As a

consequence, there is under investment on both sides of the market.

    For empirical evidence that centralized wage bargaining compresses the wage structure

and thereby alters the distribution of jobs, see Davis and Henrekson (2001).

                                               31
    In this regard, the Caballero and Hammour paradigm seems quite apt for traditional

industrial settings in which capital or labor is fairly homogeneous. However, modern

production and employment relationships often involve highly speciÔ¨Åc investments by Ô¨Årms

and workers along several distinct dimensions, as well as costly match formation and

breakup. Hence, institutional and policy responses that achieve a rough ‚Äúbalance‚Äù between

the appropriation powers of capital and labor may work reasonably well in traditional

industrial setting but quite poorly in other settings that seem increasingly important in

modern economies.

    There are also other diÔ¨Äerences between the consequences of appropriation problems

emphasized by Caballero and Hammour and results in this paper. For example, the appro-

priating factor is typically under employed or partially excluded from the joint production

sector in the models of Caballero and Hammour. In contrast, under employment of the

appropriating factor is not a general feature of the search models considered here. Table 2

illustrates this point for the basic model with heterogeneous jobs and homogeneous work-

ers. Under decentralized wage setting, labor appropriates quasi-rents from Ô¨Årms, which

leads to under investment in job quality but higher ‚Äì not lower ‚Äì employment for the

appropriating factor.


IX. Concluding Remarks

    The basic logic developed in this paper can be summarized in a few sentences. In

search equilibrium with decentralized wage determination, Ô¨Årms recover only a fraction

of the increases in ex post surplus that they generate by improving job quality ex ante,

but they incur all of the costs. Hence, Ô¨Årms under invest in job quality from a social eÔ¨É-

ciency standpoint. Likewise, workers‚Äô inability to fully capture increases in match surplus

generated by their ex ante investments lead them to under invest in human capital. The



                                            32
resulting search equilibrium exhibits excessive relative supplies of inferior jobs and inferior

workers.

    Absent some policy intervention or institutional response, it is generally impossible

to achieve eÔ¨Écient supplies of heterogeneous workers and jobs in a search environment

with decentralized wage bargaining. The restriction on wage bargaining required for an

eÔ¨Écient total supply of workers and jobs conÔ¨Çicts with the restriction required for an

eÔ¨Écient relative supply of diÔ¨Äerent job types, and both conÔ¨Çict with the restriction required

for an eÔ¨Écient relative supply of diÔ¨Äerent worker types. Interventions in the form of an

optimal tax and subsidy policy or a centralized wage-barganing authority can, in principle,

substantially improve matters and drive the economy to more eÔ¨Écient or even Ô¨Årst-best

outcomes.

    The details of a particular search model are likely to represent a very crude approx-

imation to the costly transaction process that takes place in actual labor markets. But

the key feature of the search models in this paper seems important in real-world labor

markets; namely, that Ô¨Årms and workers incur substantial sunk costs that aÔ¨Äect job and

worker quality prior to meeting (or prior to negotiating worker compensation). This pa-

per works out some key implications for the quality distributions of jobs and workers,

the wage structure, and the potential eÔ¨Éciency-enhancing role of centralized wage-setting

institutions that follow from the existence of these sunk costs in search equilibrium.

    While the models in this paper facilitate the transparent development of these im-

plications, they are too simplistic to provide a solid basis for assessing their quantitative

importance. In some work in progress, I explore the eÔ¨Äects of alternative bargaining en-

vironments and government policy choices in dynamic search models with endogenous job

quality distributions. The analyis focuses on expected job duration, rather than produc-

tivity, as the aspect of quality that diÔ¨Äerentiates jobs. This focus is motivated by the


                                              33
apparently strong desire for stable jobs by workers in many sectors of the economy, and by

the observation that job loss often entails large pecuniary and nonpecuniary losses. In this

type of dynamic search environment, there is a natural policy role whereby job creation

subsidies and job destruction taxes can be used to improve the mix and number of jobs.

Notes:
 (i) The job creation cost coeÔ¨Écients are set to achieve a uniform distribution of job types
    in the decentralized equilibria.
(ii) The search eÔ¨Éciency parameter is set to deliver a Ô¨Åve percent unemployment rate in
    the decentralized equilibrium with Nash bargaining (Œ≤ = .5).
(iii) The lower bound of the job productivity distribution is set to 110% of workers‚Äô reser-
    vation value. The upper bound is set so that the standard deviation of log wages
    equals .43 in the decentralized equilibrium with Nash bargaining (Œ≤ = .5).
(iv) See Figure 1 for a display of the job quality distribution in the various regimes.

 Notes:
  (i) The decentralized outcome is the solution to the model in section II with two job types.
       It solves equations (3 ), (13.a) and (13.b). The optimal tax/subsidy outcome solves
       the same model with a tax/subsidy policy that produces an eÔ¨Écient distribution of job
       types. It solves equations (12.a), (12.b), (22), and (23). The eÔ¨Écient wage structure
       outcome solves (12.a), (12.b) and (19).
 (ii) Table entries are computed assuming that C i (J i ) = g i (J i )Œ≥ for i = 1, 2. In solving
       for per capita income, additional parameters are scaled as follows: L = 10, a = .7 and
       g 1 = 1.

                                                   40
(iii) Per capita income is calculated net of job creation costs.
(iv) The invariance of the job distribution with respect to Œ≤ in the decentralized equilibrium
     is a special implication of the functional form chosen for job creation costs.

Notes:
 (i) Wages obey (20) and quantities solve (12.a) and (12.b) in the eÔ¨Écient wage-structure
      regime. Wages obey (3 ) and quantities solve (13.a) and (13.b) in the decentralized
      bargaining regime. Wages solve the constrained optimization problem (33)-(34) in the
      centralized bargaining regime, and quantities then follow from (34).
