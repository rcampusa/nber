                                          ABSTRACT

This paper constructs a multi-sector model to take explicit account of the very sharp change in the
relative price between non-IT and IT goods. The model is calibrated to the Japanese economy, and
its solution path from 1990 on is compared to Japan's macroeconomic performance in the 1990s.
Compared to the one-sector analysis of Japan in the 1990s in Hayashi and Prescott (2002), our model
does slightly better or just as well in accounting for Japan's output slump and does worse in
accounting for the capital-output ratio. We also show that, to revive a 2% long-term growth in
percapita GDP, Japan needs to direct 10% of private total hours to the IT sector.

1.      Introduction

We live in a world where IT goods, such as computers and communications equipments, are

continuously getting cheaper than the rest of the goods, at a relentless rate. As shown in Figure

1 for Japan, the relative price of IT goods to non-IT goods in 2000 is one-eightieth of what it was

in 1960.1

      The rapid change in the relative price creates potentially serious problems for the one-good

world of macroeconomics. The Hicks aggregation theorem, which allows a bundle of many

goods to be treated as if it is a single good, is no longer valid. If the relative price of two goods

is not constant, the utility function and the production function must have those two goods

as separate arguments. One could invoke the theory of aggregation of heterogenous capital

goods to have a single variable representing capital in the production function, but that single

index, called the capital services index, is different from the simple sum of the capital stocks, as

Jorgenson and Griliches (1967) first pointed out.

      For both the (aggregated) capital stock and the capital services index, the growth rate is a

     1 See   the text below for the definition of non-IT and IT goods and how the relative price is calculated.



                                                                 2
weighted averages of the growth rates of individual capital stocks. The weights are the value

shares for the capital stock and the user-cost shares for capital services. The difference can be

substantial when non-IT capital and IT capital are to be aggregated. IT capital’s user cost is

much higher than non-IT capital’s because IT capital depreciates fast physically and in value. If

the stock of IT capital is growing fast, the growth rate of capital services is higher than that of

the capital stock by a substantial margin, even if IT capital’s value share is small. In the growth

accounting typically practiced in macroeconomics, the contribution of capital is measured by the

growth rate of the aggregated capital stock. The TFP (total factor productivity) growth calculated

by the macro growth accounting, therefore, confuses genuine TFP growth with the contribution

of IT capital to the growth of capital services.

   Hayashi and Prescott (2002) showed that Japan’s great stagnation in the 1990s is well-

accounted for by the standard neoclassical growth model with a TFP slowdown in the 1990s.

Their one-good model, however, does not explicitly take into account the relentless decline in the

relative price of IT goods. It is possible that the decline in TFP growth, which is the cornerstone

of their analysis, is contaminated by the confusion with capital services and the capital stock.

   The purpose of this paper is to do a multi-sector version of the Hayashi-Prescott one-sector

exercise. Besides government, there are two market sectors — non-IT and IT sectors — and the

household sector producing service flows from owner-occupied housing and consumer durables.

By definition, the TFP growth for household and government is zero. In Section 2, we present

our multi-sector accounting system matching this multi-sector model. Our data shows, not

surprisingly, that the TFP growth in the IT sector is much higher than that in the non-IT sector.

We confirm in Section 3 that the TFP growth rate by the macro growth accounting is indeed

higher than the genuine TFP growth, which a weighted average of the sectoral TFP growth rates.

However, the two TFP growths show similar movements, with a marked decline in the 1990s.

Section 4 presents the multi-sector growth model. It distinguishes between non-IT capital and

IT capital in the production function. In Section 5, following Hayashi and Prescott (2002), we

calibrate the model to the Japanese economy in the 1984-89 period and report results from the

simulation of the model from year 1990 on. The multi-sector model does well in accounting for

the output slump of the 90s but less well than the one-sector model for the rise in the capital-


                                                   3
output ratio in the 1990s. The model’s prediction about the long-run output growth depends

on how much resources are directed to the IT sector. If the allocation of hours between non-IT

and IT sectors remains at the (97.2%, 2.8%) breakdown of year 2000, the long-run percapita GDP

growth rate is 1.1%. To raise it to 2.0%, the private labor allocation must move in favor of IT,

from (97.2%, 2.8%) to (90%, 10%). Section 6 is a brief conclusion.




2.          The Multi-Sector Accounting Framework

The theoretical model to be presented later in the paper is a multi-sector model with two market

sectors (non-IT and IT goods-producing sectors) and two non-market sectors (the household

and government sectors). This section describes how the model’s empirical counterpart, a

multi-sector accounting system, is constructed. Its production account is derived from the 47-

sector system developed in Jorgenson and Nomura (2005) (hereafter, JN).2 Its final demand

components, too, are from the KEO Database.

     2 It   builds on the 43-sector KEO Database, which is a comprehensive productivity database for the Japanese economy

maintained at the Keio Economic Observatory (KEO), Keio University, Japan. It consists of a time-series of input-

output tables and detailed inputs of capital and labor. See Kuroda, Shimpo, Nomura, and Kobayashi (1997) for a

detailed documentation. From the 43 industries in the KEO database, JN separates out three IT producing industries —

computers, communications equipment, and electronic components — to form 47 industries.



                                                                4
    By way of establishing the notation, Table 1 shows value added (also called net output in

the productivity literature) at producer prices and their breakdown into factor costs for the

four sectors. We define the IT sector ( j=2) as consisting not only of the three IT industries in

JN’s 47 industries (which are computers and peripherals, communications equipment, and elec-

tronic components), but also of computer software. The software sector is defined narrowly as

computer programming and other software services: custom software, pre-packaged software,

own-account software, games, and other software, excluding data processing and other related

information services.3

    Real value added of the IT sector, Y2t , is the translog index of value added of these four

industries.4 Similarly, we define real value added of non-IT sector Y1t as the translog index

of value added of all the industries except the IT sector, household, and government sectors.

The price indexes of value added at producer prices, P jt (j = 1, 2), are derived by dividing the

aggregated nominal value added by real value added in each sector.

    As in JN (Jorgenson and Nomura (2005)), the household sector produces rental service of

owner-occupied housing and consumer durables with no labor input. Those rental services are

consumed by the household sector itself, by definition. Nominal production, PHt YHt , equals

factor costs, which consist entirely of the user costs of owner-occupied housing and consumer

durables. The government sector produces government service that is consumed by the govern-

ment itself, by definition. The imputed nominal value of government services, PGt YGt , is defined

   3 We   estimate the output and inputs of computer software sector as follows. In the Japanese 2000 benchmark input-

output table produced by Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, production activity of

software sector is not divided from information services (851201), although the commodity of software (8512011) is

separated. We estimate production of the software sector using the activity in 851201. The own-account software is not

included in the production of software (8512011) of the Japanese 2000 benchmark IO table and still is not capitalized

in the Japanese National Accounts by Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), Cabinet Office. For output and

inputs of own-account software, we use the estimates in Nomura (2004b).
   4 In   general, let Y jt and P jt be real value added and the associated price index of sector j in period t. The translog

quantity index Yt is defined as
                                                               X
                                                   ∆ ln Yt =       v̄ jt ∆ ln Y jt ,
                                                               j

where ∆ ln Yt ≡ ln Yt − ln Yt−1 and v̄ jt is the two-period average share of sector j’s nominal value added in total nominal

value added.



                                                               5
as capital costs and the value of labor input, where capital costs include not only consumption

of public capital but also total capital service cost of publicly owned capital. Table 2 report

sectoral shares of nominal value added. The imputed prices of value added P jt for those two

nom-market sectors ( j=H,G) are defined by dividing nominal value added by the quantities Y jt

(j=H,G), which are defined in Equation (2.5) below.5

    Various capital assets can be divided into two groups, depending on their sectoral origin.

The non-IT capital or asset 1 is those assets produced in the non-IT sector, while the IT capital or

asset 2 are produced in the IT sector.6 Since value added is at factor costs, it can be divided into

payments to asset 1 (non-IT capital), asset 2 (IT capital), and labor. We use vKijt for the factor share

   5 In   JN, the government and household sectors have intermediate inputs to produce their non-market services. In

this paper, to simplify the production functions, we treat these intermediate inputs as government consumption and

household consumption of non-IT good (i=1) at the final demand, respectively, so that there is no intermediate inputs

for these sectors.
   6 In   JN, the most detailed asset classification has 102 assets. Of those 102 assets, to reflect the definition of the

IT sector mentioned above, the IT capital in this paper is composed of electronic computer and peripherals, wired

communication equipment, wireless communication equipment, other communication equipment, custom software,

pre-packaged software, and own-account software.

Capital and Labor

Each sector utilizes many different capital assets. At the most detailed level of asset classification,

the real capital stock and capital services are identical. However, when assets are aggregated

into broader classes, the two are not the same, as first pointed out by Jorgenson and Griliches

(1967). The real capital stock is the simple sum (valued at some base year prices) of those assets

that belong to the broader asset class in question, while capital services aggregated over those

assets is an index (e.g., the translog index) constructed from the user costs and the real capital

stocks of those assets. The user costs of capital fully reflect the heterogeneity in productivity

within the broader asset class.

    For the 47 sectors, JN calculated the real capital stock and the translog index of capital

services for non-IT and IT assets.7 Those quantities are aggregated into our four broader sectors

(j = 1, 2, H, G) to obtain the real capital stock and the translog capital services index for the

   7 The   user costs in JN incorporate the Japanese tax structure. The detailed formula is given in Nomura (2004a, ch.3),

where he considers capital consumption allowance, income allowance and reserves, special depreciation, corporate

income tax, business tax, property tax, acquisition taxes, debt/equity financing, and personal taxes on capital gain and

dividend. Nomura (2004a, ch.3) measures effective tax rates and tax wedges, based on estimated before-tax and after-tax

rates of return. This estimate gives the effective tax rate for capital income τkt in our model.


                                                                7
non-IT and IT assets. For asset i (i=1 for non-IT or 2 for IT) in sector j in period t, we use Kijt

for the real capital stock and Ki∗jt for the capital services index.8 The ratio QKij ≡ Kijt
                                                                                        ∗
                                                                                            /Kijt , which

converts real capital stock into capital services, is called the capital quality in the productivity

literature. It captures the heterogeneity within the asset class mentioned above. Going back to

Table 1, the rental rate ri jt is defined to satisfy the relationship


                      P jt ri jt Kijt = nominal value of capital services for asset i in sector j.                (2.1)


    By definition, for any sector j ( j = 1, 2, H, G), the IT capital stock K2jt and IT capital services

K2∗ jt do not include land. Land would be in non-IT capital, but we do not include land in K1jt

and K1∗ jt ; see below for how we account for land as non-IT capital. Despite the exclusion of land

from K1jt , the rental rate r1jt of non-IT capital includes land rent.

    The labor equivalent of real capital stock is total hours worked. Labor input differs from

hours worked because it is an index of labor inputs of various kinds, distinguished by worker

characteristics such as education. JN calculated total hours worked and the translog index of

labor input for the 47 industries.9 We can aggregate those quantities into our four broader sectors

(j = 1, 2, H, G). We use L jt for total hours worked in sector j and L∗jt for the translog index of

labor services. The labor quality QLjt (j=1,2,G) is L∗jt /L jt . Nominal hourly wage rate in sector j, W jt ,

is defined to satisfy

                                      W jt L jt = nominal labor costs in sector j.                                (2.2)




   8 JN   use symbol K for capital services and Z for the real capital stock.
   9 JN   utilizes the KEO Database, which classifies workers by sex, age (eleven classes), educational attainment (four

classes for males, three classes for females), employment class (three types: employees, self-employed, and unpaid

family workers), and industry (forty-three). See Kuroda, Shimpo, Nomura, Kobayashi (1997, ch.4) for more detail.

Productivity

To account for the role of land in the measurement of TFP (total factor productivity), we introduce
                                                                                     ∗
a variable, ϕ jt , which converts the translog capital services index without land, K1jt , into one

with land for sector j. For each sector, we can define two measures of TFP growth, one (the

“pseudo” TFP growth) that takes neither the capital and labor quality nor land into account (vTjt )

and the one (the “genuine” TFP growth) that does (vT∗
                                                   jt
                                                      ). They are defined as

                                          X
                    vTjt = ∆ ln Y jt −            v̄Kijt ∆ ln Kijt − v̄Ljt ∆ ln L jt ,                                                   (2.3a)
                                          i=1,2
                                          X                                                                    
                    vT∗
                     jt = ∆ ln Y jt −             v̄Kijt ∆ ln QKijt Kijt − v̄K1jt ∆ ln ϕ jt − v̄Ljt ∆ ln QLjt L jt ,                     (2.3b)
                                          i=1,2


where v̄Kijt and v̄Ljt are the two-period average cost shares of capital and labor in value added. So

the genuine TFP growth vT∗
                        jt
                           is related to its pseudo cousin vTjt as

                                             X
                             vT∗    T
                              jt = v jt −            v̄Kijt ∆ ln QKijt − v̄Ljt ∆ ln QLjt − v̄K1jt ∆ ln ϕ jt .                             (2.4)
                                             i=1,2




                                                                      9
Both versions of TFP growth recognize the heterogeneity in productivity between the non-IT and

IT capital. The genuine TFP growth further takes into account the heterogeneity within each

broad asset class. It also incorporates the labor heterogeneity and the contribution of land.

   Quantities of services produced by the household and government sectors are defined as the

translog index of factor inputs in sector j (j=H, G):

                                  X                                                  
                   ∆ ln Y jt =           v̄Kijt ∆ ln QKij Kijt + v̄Ljt ∆ ln ln QLjt L jt + v̄K1jt ∆ϕ jt ,   (2.5)
                                 i=1,2

where labor input in the household sector is zero: LHt = 0.

   Table 5 reports two measures of TFP growth, vTjt and vT∗
                                                         jt
                                                            , and aggregate TFP growth for the

privete sector. By construction, the genuine TFP growths for the household and government

sectors are zero. The pseudo TFP growths, vTjt ( j=H,G) differ from 0, thanks to the exclusion of

quality change and land. For the two market sectors (non-IT and IT sectors), Figure 2 displays
                            jT∗
the genuine TFP growth vt         ( j = 1, 2). The rapid IT productivity growth is in stark contrast to

the stagnation of the non-IT sector. As noted in Jorgenson and Nomura (2005), the IT growth

has accelerated in the second half of the 1990s. The dotted line in the Figure is the TFP growth

of the IT sector when software is not included. The inclusion of software, while raising the

value-added share of the IT sector in the 1980s and after as shown in Table 2, pulls down the

TFP growth.

   Our estimate of consumption is based on the time-series of input-output tables in the KEO

Database. To define the value at before-tax prices, we deducted net indirect tax from C1Ht . The

consumption tax rate τct is calculated as the ratio of the total value of net indirect tax to P1t C1Ht .

Investments are calculated from the fixed capital formation matrix in Nomura (2004a).

   Physical depreciation rates δi jt for asset i in sector j are aggregated from the depreciation

rates for 95 produced assets and 16 consumer durables used in JN. For each asset i (i = 1, 2), the

depreciation rate can differ across sectors and over time because the asset composition within

each sector varies. Nevertheless, the aggregated depreciation rates reported in Table 7 are fairly

uniform across sectors, except for the non-IT asset of government, which includes infrastructure.

3.    Aggregation over Sectors and Assets

We have calculated, in Table 5, the TFP growth for each sector and the private sector as a whole

that takes into account the heterogeneity between the two assets (non-IT and IT capital). In

contrast, the growth accounting in the macro literature (see, e.g., Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare

(2001) and Hayashi and Prescott (2002) (hereafter HP)) is so wedded to the one-sector paradigm

that the aggregate capital input is defined simply as the value of nominal capital stock deflated by

the output deflator. In this section, we apply this ”macro” growth accounting to the multi-sector

dataset described in the previous section.

     For real private GDP (real aggregate value added) at factor costs, we use the translog index.

That is, let (P jt , Y jt ) be the value-added deflator and real value added in sector j (j = 1, 2, H) from

our multi-sector dataset. We calculate aggregate real value added Yt as the translog index over

industry value added.10 The growth rate of private real GDP has already been reported in Table

5. The implicit GDP deflator is defined as the ratio of nominal aggregate value-added to Yt .

     The solid line in Figure 3 is real GDP per working-age population (the number of persons

aged 20-69) thus calculated from our multi-sector system, detrended at 2% (which has been the

  10 We   also calculated the Fisher chain index and found it to be virtually identical to the translog index.

long-run growth rate for the leader country (the U.S.) over the past century) and normalized to

100 for 1990. It shows that real private GDP Yt grew much faster than 2% until 1991 but slower

than 2% thereafter. Just to show that the basic picture remains the same, the Figure also shows, in

the dotted line, the similarly detrended official real GDP per worker from the Japanese national

accounts (on the SNA93 basis).11 There are a number of definitional differences between our

GDP and the official Japanese SNA93 GDP: the official SNA93 GDP includes the government

sector while our GDP doesn’t; our GDP is a (translog) chain index while the official GDP is a

fixed-weight Paasche index;12 service flows from consumer durables are included in our GDP,

and so forth. Compared to the official GDP, our measure shows slightly less growth in the 1980s

and a slightly severer slump in the 1990s.

    Another macro variable of interest is the capital-output ratio. The macro growth accounting

typically uses the GDP deflator to convert nominal into real. That is, the aggregate capital stock

Kt is defined as the ratio of the total nominal value of the capital stocks in sectors 1, 2, and H

to the GDP deflator defined above. So the capital-output ratio Kt /Yt equals the ratio of private

  11 The SNA refers to the System of National Accounts.         The SNA93 is a set of rules and standard for national accounting

recommended by the United Nations in 1993.
  12 Currently,   the official SNA93 chain index is available only since 1994.

where Ki jt is the capital stock of asset i in sector j and Pit is the deflator for value added in

sector i (see Table 1). Figure 4 shows, in the solid line, the capital-output ratio thus calculated

from our multi-sector dataset. It shows a 25% rise from 2.62 in 1990 to 3.28 in 2000. The official

capital-output ratio, with the capital stock as well as nominal GDP from the Japanese SNA93, is

the dotted line. It is much lower and shows a much slower rise in the 1990s. The most important

reason for the difference is that the depreciation rates in our multi-sector accounting system are

lower.13

    The macro growth accounting as practiced in HP (Hayashi and Prescott (2002)) is based on

the following identity:
                                                                        θ/(1−θ)       

                                            Nt                      Yt                Nt

where Nt is the working-age population (persons aged 20-69) and At is the “macro” TFP defined

  13 Nomura (2004a, Chapter 2) argues that the depreciation rates in the Japanese SNA are too high.          Other reasons include

the following. Our measure of nominal capital stock does not equal the nominal capital stock valued at investment

goods prices. Own-account software and pre-packaged software are included in our measure of the capital stock.



                                                                15

                                                             t   .                                       (3.3)


Our measure of aggregate labor Lt is aggregate hours worked in the three private sectors. Table

8 shows the HP growth accounting applied to our multi-sector dataset with θ = 0.362 (the

capital share parameter used in HP). Despite the substantial differences in the definition, the

overall picture is the same as in HP: both per capita output growth and the TFP growth slowed

down to less than 1%, the capital-output ratio increased, and labor input declined in the 1990s.

Comparing the “macro” TFP growth (the growth rate of At ) in this table to the aggregate TFP

growth reported in Table 5 (see the column labeled “private” for either the pseudo TFP or the

genuine TFP), we see that the “macro” estimate is biased upward, although the movement over

time is similar.

4.     The Two-Sector Growth Model with Consumer Durables

This section presents our theoretical model to be confronted with the data from the multi-sector

accounting system. Main features of the model are the following.

• Consistent with the multi-sector accounting system, there are two market-provided goods

     (non-IT goods and IT goods) and two non-market goods (government services and household

     services). The IT goods are not consumed. Government services do not enter the household’s

     utility function.

• The two market goods (non-IT and IT goods) are internationally tradable. We assume that

     the country is small enough not to influence the relative price of IT goods in terms of non-IT

     goods. This means that the relative price is exogenous to the model.

• Unlike in HP (Hayashi and Prescott (2002)), where the capital stock includes claims on the

     rest of the world, we separate external assets from domestic capital. The time path of external

     assets is treated as exogenous. This means that both net income from abroad and net exports

     are exogenous to the model.14

• Unlike in HP, labor supply is exogenous. The sectoral allocation of total labor, too, is ex-

     ogenous. We are forced to make this assumption because the market equilibrium is one of

     near-complete specialization under the observed relative price if labor is allowed to move

     freely between sectors.

     We now turn to a more detailed description of the model.


Households

The stand-in household’s utility function is
                                             X
                                             ∞
                                                    βt Nt u(c1t , dt ), β ∈ (0, 1),                                 (4.1)
                                              t=0

where Nt is working-age population, c1t is per-worker consumption of good 1 (the non-IT good),

and dt is the service flow (from owner-occupied housing and consumer durables) produced by

  14 Recall   from national income accounting that the net increase in external assets equals the current account and that

the current account is the sum of next exports (the trade balance) and net income from abroad.


                                                               17
the household. If Kit is the quantity of private capital stock i obtained from investment in good

i (i = 1, 2), the household sets aside µit Nt dt of it as capital input for producing Nt dt units of

household services. These capital input requirement coefficients (µ1t , µ2t ) depend on the rental

rates of capital (see below). We allow two distorting taxes, the consumption tax (the tax rate: τct )

and the tax on capital income (τkt ). Labor supply is exogenous to the model, so the tax on labor

is not distortionary and is lumped into the lump-sum tax τht . The household’s budget constraint

is

                  (1 + τct )Nt c1t + [K1,t+1 − (1 − δ1 )K1t ] + Pt [K2,t+1 − (1 − δ2 )K2t ] + (FAt+1 − FAt )

                            ≤ w1t L1t + w2t L2t + wGt LGt + [r1t (K1t − µ1t Nt dt ) + Pt r2t (K2t − µ2t Nt dt )]     (4.2)

                            − τkt [(r1t − δ1 )(K1t − µ1t Nt dt ) + Pt (r2t − δ2 )(K2t − µ2t Nt dt )] − τht + NIt ,

where Pt is the relative price (the price of good 2 in terms of good 1), δi is the depreciation rate of

asset i, FAt is foreign assets in terms of non-IT goods (good 1), w jt is the wage rate measured in

good 1 paid by sector j, L jt is labor supply to sector j, rit is the rental rate for asset i (so the rental

price in terms of good 1 of asset 2 equals Pt r2t ), and NIt is net income from abroad measured in

good 1.15

       In terms of the notation of Tables 1 and 6, Pt = P2t /P1t , c1t = C1Ht /Nt , dt = YHt /Nt , w jt = W jt /P1t ,

Ki,t+1 − (1 − δi )Kit = Ii1t + Ii2t + IiHt (i = 1, 2), and µit Nt dt = KiHt (i = 1, 2). In the data, the rental

rate ri jt depends on sector j because of the asset heterogeneity within the broader asset classes of

non-IT and IT capital, but in the model, which does not recognize this heterogeneity, the rental

rate does not depend on j.

       Let βt Λ−1
               t be the Lagrange multiplier. Being the reciprocal of the shadow price of the budget

constraint, Λt measures the wealth of the household. The FOCs (first-order conditions) for

     15 This   budget constraint implies that the household does not pay the consumption tax on purchases of non-IT and IT

goods to be used for household production. If this counterfactual assumption is to be avoided, we would have to treat

those flow of durables purchases separately from investments in the capital stock to be rented out to firms, but that adds

another co-state variable to the system. Our numerical procedure for computing the perfect foresight equilibrium path

cannot handle more than one co-state variable.

where

                               Pdt ≡ [(1 − τkt )r1t + τkt δ1 ]µ1t + Pt [(1 − τkt )r2t + τkt δ2 ]µ2t                           (4.7)

is the imputed price of household services in terms of sector 1 output.16 The user costs are

(1 − τkt )rit + τkt δi rather than rit , because household production is not taxed.

     (4.5) and (4.6) yield

                                                              Λt+1
                          (Euler equation)                         = β[1 + (1 − τk,t+1 )(r1,t+1 − δ1 )],                      (4.8)
                                                               Λt

                                (arbitrage)                      =                                 .                          (4.9)

The first of these two equations will be referred to as the Euler equation because it describes how

the household wealth Λt evolves over time. The second equation will be called the arbitrage

condition governing the portfolio of the two assets K1t and K2t .

     We can solve (4.3) and (4.4) for (c1t , dt ) as a function of the consumption tax rate τct , the

imputed price (Pdt ), and the shadow price Λt :

                           (Frisch demands)               c1t = c1 (τct , Pdt , Λt ), dt = d(τct , Pdt , Λt ).              (4.10)

This demand system, with the shadow price Λ replacing income, is called “Frisch demands”.

Use of Frisch demands enforces the household FOCs (4.3) and (4.4) in the equilibrium conditions.

     The input requirement coefficients (µ1t , µ2t ) for producing household services can be made

endogenous, as the solution to the cost minimizing problem:17

                                       min Pdt s.t. Fd (ϕHt QK1Ht µ1t , QK2Ht µ2t ) = 1,                                    (4.11)
                                       µ1t ,µ2t

  16 It   equals PHt /P1t in the notation of Section 2.
  17 The constraint in the problem can also be written as F (ϕ QK            µ1t Nt dt , QK  µ N d ) = Nt dt due to constant returns
                                                           d Ht 1Ht                       2Ht 2t t t

to scale.


                                                                   19
where Fd is a linear homogeneous production function for household services, QKiHt (i = 1, 2) is

the capital quality defined in Section 2 to capture the asset heterogeneity, and ϕHt is the factor

accounting for land in asset 1. By definition, there is no TFP growth in household production,

so the production function is stationary. We write the solution as
                                             !                                                     !

    µ1t = µ1                                   /(ϕHt Q1Ht ), µ2t = µ2                                /QK2Ht .   (4.12)

Firms

The technology of the two market sectors is described by the constant-returns-to-scale production

functions


                                  Y1t = Y1 (ϕ1t QK11t K11t , QK21t K21t , QL1t L1t ; A∗1t ),                    (4.13)

                                  Y2t = Y2 (ϕ2t QK12t K12t , QK22t K22t , QL2t L2t ; A∗2t ),                    (4.14)


where Kijt is the amount of privately-held asset i rented by sector j in date t and A∗jt is the level of

technology. The capital quality QKijt converts the capital stock into capital services, QLjt measures

the quality of labor in sector j, and the factor ϕ jt accounts for land. The FOCs are

              ∂Y1t             ∂Y1t             ∂Y2t          ∂Y2t          ∂Y1t            ∂Y2t
      r1t =         , Pt r2t =       , r1t = Pt       , r2t =       , w1t =      , w2t = Pt      .              (4.15)
              ∂K11t            ∂K21t            ∂K12t         ∂K22t         ∂L1t            ∂L2t

The Government

The government collects taxes to finance government expenditure in goods and services (the

sum of government consumption and investment) in two goods, G1t and G2t , and payments to

hire labor LGt used for producing government services. The lump-sum tax τht is adjusted to

meet the government budget constraint. In terms of the notation of Table 6, G1t = C1Gt + I1Gt

and G2t = I2Gt . Neither the government production function nor breakdown of government

expenditure between consumption and investment needs to be specified, because it does not

affect the equilibrium of the private sector.

Market Equilibrium

The market equilibrium conditions are:


                                    (asset 1)       K11t + K12t + µ1t Nt dt = K1t ,                               (4.16)

                                    (asset 2)       K21t + K22t + µ2t Nt dt = K2t ,                               (4.17)

               (RC)        Nt c1t + [K1,t+1 − (1 − δ1 )K1t ] + Pt [K2,t+1 − (1 − δ2 )K2t ]
                                                                                                                  (4.18)
                                                                = (Y1t − G1t ) + Pt (Y2t − G2t ) − NXt .

Here, the label “RC” stands for resource constraint and NXt is net exports in terms of good 1.


Equilibrium

We can now define competitive equilibrium. Take as given:

• a government policy {K1Gt , K2Gt , LGt , G1t , G2t , τct , τkt }∞
                                                                  t=0
                                                                      ,

• labor supply to each sector {L1t , L2t }∞
                                          t=0
                                              ,

• external assets {FAt }∞
                        t=0
                            and net exports {NXt }∞
                                                  t=0
                                                      ,

• the relative price {Pt }∞
                          t=0
                              ,

• the capital and labor quality and the land conversion factor {QKijt , QLjt , ϕ jt }∞
                                                                                     t=0
                                                                                         (i = 1, 2; j =

   1, 2, H, G),

• the technology level {A∗1t , A∗2t }∞
                                     t=0
                                         .

A competitive equilibrium given an initial condition (K10 , K20 ) is a sequence of factor prices,

{r1t , r2t , w1t , w2t }∞
                        t=0
                            , the household wealth {Λt }∞
                                                        t=0
                                                            , and associated quantities, {K1,t+1 , K2,t+1 , K11t , K12t ,

K21t , K22t }∞
             t=0
                 , such that the Euler equation (4.8), the arbitrage condition (4.9), the firm’s FOCs

(4.15), the market equilibrium conditions ((4.16)-(4.18)) are satisfied, where (Y1t , Y2t ) in those

conditions are given by (4.13) and (4.14), c1t in the RC (resource constraint) and dt in the asset

market equilibrium condition are given by (4.10), and (µ1t , µ2t ) in the asset market equilibrium

condition are given by (4.12).

    In this definition, the government budget constraint is not an equilibrium condition, because

the lump-sum tax τht is assumed to meet the constraint. The household budget constraint is


                                                           21
not included, because it is implied by the government budget constraint, the factor exhaustion

condition that value added equals factor payments (an implication of the linear homogeneity

of the production function and the marginal productivity conditions), the market equilibrium

conditions, and the identity that the increase in external assets, FAt+1 − FAt , equals net exports

NXt plus net income from abroad NIt .


Implications of The Cobb-Douglas Technology

In what follows, we assume the Cobb-Douglas form for the production functions. So (4.13) and

(4.14) can be written as

                                   θ11             θ21          1−θ11 −θ21
                                                                                        θ11  θ21 1−θ11 −θ21
          Y1t = A∗1t ϕ1t QK11t K11t        QK21t K21t       QL1t L1t             = A1t K11t K21t L1t        ,   (4.19)
                                   θ12             θ22          1−θ12 −θ22
                                                                                        θ12  θ22 1−θ12 −θ22
          Y2t = A∗2t ϕ2t QK12t K12t        QK22t K22t       QL2t L2t             = A2t K12t K22t L2t        ,   (4.20)


where
                                                   θ1j         θ2 j  1−θ1 j −θ2 j
                             A jt ≡ A∗jt ϕ jt QK1jt        QK2 jt        QLjt           , j = 1, 2.             (4.21)

This shows that, for the Cobb-Douglas technology, the production function can be defined for

the capital stocks, with an appropriate re-definition of the TFP term. The growth rate of A∗jt is the

”genuine” TFP growth rate, vT∗
                            jt
                               , of Section 2. The above expression of the production function

makes it clear that what matters for equilibrium is the “pseudo” TFP growth rate, vTjt , which

equals the growth rate of A jt defined here.

   We will also assume the Cobb-Douglas form for the household production function Fd in

(4.11):

                                                             γ         1−γ        γ    1−γ
      Fd (ϕHt QK1Ht K1Ht , QK2Ht K2Ht ) = A∗H ϕHt QK1Ht , K1Ht QK2Ht K2Ht      = AHt K1Ht K2Ht ,                (4.22)


where
                                                             γ    1−γ
                                           AHt = A∗H ϕHt QK1Ht QK2Ht      .                                     (4.23)

The utility function u(c1t , dt ) is linear logarithmic:


                                       u(c1t , dt ) = µ log(c1t ) + (1 − µ) log(dt ).                           (4.24)


With these functional-form assumptions for household, the Frisch demands (4.10) and the de-


                                                              22
mand for capital inputs for household production (4.12) become

Thanks to the unit elasticity in both the demand for and the supply of household services, a

change in AHt does not affect the demand for assets µit Nt dt in household production. Combining

(4.22), (4.26), and (4.27), we obtain

                                                              γ        1−γ

which states that the value (in terms of good 1) of household production does not depend on the

pseudo TFP AHt .


Detrending

With the Cobb-Douglas technology and the linear-logarithmic preferences, it is possible to trans-

form the system so that it involves only the growth rates, but not the levels, of the TFPs. To this

end, define two trends:

               1−θ22     θ21                θ12    1−θ11

    X1t ≡ A1t v        A2tv Nt , X2t ≡ A1tv A2t v          Nt with v ≡ 1 − θ11 − θ22 + θ11 θ22 − θ12 θ21 .                  (4.29)

The Transition Path and the Steady State

From this set of equations, we can define a first-order dynamical system (k1 , k2 , λ), namely a

mapping from (k1t , k2t , λt ) to (k1,t+1 , k2,t+1 , λt+1 ), as follows.

  i) Given (k1t , k2t , λt ), use eight equations, (4.33)-(4.35) to solve for eight unknowns (r1t , r2t , k11t , k21t ,

     k12t , k22t , y1t , y2t ). Intuitively, this enforces that the country’s marginal rate of transformation

     between the two goods be equated to the world relative price. This step also gives (r1t , r2t )

     as functions of (k1t , k2t , λt ). Write them as: rit = ri (k1t , k2t , λt ) (i = 1, 2).

 ii) Given (k1t , k2t , λt , y1t , y2t ), use (4.37) to calculate zt+1 .

iii) Substitute ri,t+1 = ri (k1,t+1 , k2,t+1 , λt+1 ) into (4.31) and (4.32). Given the value of zt+1 ob-

                                                             24
     tained in the previous step, three equations — (4.31), (4.32), and (4.36) — can be solved for

     (k1,t+1 , k2,t+1 , λt+1 ).

The initial condition for the system is that the initial values for the two state variables (k1t , k2t )

are given. Given an appropriate initial value for the co-state variable λt , we can generate the

solution path using this mapping from (k1t , k2t , λt ) to (k1,t+1 , k2,t+1 , λt+1 ).

    This dynamical system is autonomous (i.e., the mapping from (k1t , k2t , λt ) to (k1,t+1 , k2,t+1 , λt+1 )

is stationary or time-invariant) if the forcing or exogenous variables — `1t , `2t , X1,t+1 /X1t ,

X2,t+1 /X2t , Nt+1 /Nt , τkt , τct , ψ1t , ψ2t , pt , and νt — are constant over time. The steady state or

the equilibrium of this autonomous system can be determined uniquely from the above equa-

tions by dropping the time subscript, as follows. Dropping the time subscript in (4.31) pins

down r1 , the steady-state value of r1t . Given r1 , use the steady-state version of (4.32) to obtain

r2 . Given r1 and r2 , use (4.33) to calculate (k11 , k21 , k12 , k22 , y1 , y2 ). Use the rest of the equations,

(4.34)-(4.37) to pin down (k1 , k2 , z, λ).

    When we simulate the model in the next section, we will assume that the exogenous variables

become constant either asymptotically (for `1t , `2t , νt ) or after some fixed date (which is year

2000 in the simulation below), so the detrended system is asymptotically autonomous. The

appropriate initial value of the co-state λt is the one that guides the detrended system to approach

the steady state in the long run (as time goes to infinity). This particular solution path satisfies

relevant transversality conditions.

    Given the solution path for the detrended system, we can back out the equilibrium of the

model before detrending using (4.30). This determines:


                                  Y1t , Y2t , K1t , K2t , K11t , K12t , K21t , K22t , r1t , r2t , Λt .


The value of household production, Pdt YHt , can be determined from this by (4.28). All these

endogenous variables are determined independent of the psudo TFP for the household sector,

AHt . The breakdown of Pdt YHt between price and quantity does depend on AHt and can be

obtained from (4.26).

    The steady-state or the balanced growth path associated with the steady-state or the equilib-

rium of the detrended system has the following features.


                                                                  25
• The sectoral allocation of capital for each asset i (i = 1, 2) is constant, because the trend in Kijt

   does not depend on j.

• Obviously,
                                                                   P2t    X1t
                            Y1t ∝ X1t , Y2t ∝ X2t , Pt (≡              )∝     , Nt Λt ∝ X1t .             (4.39)
                                                                   P1t    X2t
   Thus if, as is the case in the calibrated model below, X2t grows much faster than X1t thanks

   to the rapid IT productivity growth, the relative price of IT goods declines rapidly and the

   growth of relative output level Y2t /Y1t is as rapid as the decline in the relative price.

   are constant. This is because, in addition to (4.39), we have Pdt YHt ∝ X1t by (4.28).

• It then follows from (4.26) that
                                                                                 

   Let Yt be the translog index of real private GDP constructed from (P jt , Y jt ) ( j = 1, 2, H) with

   P2t = P1t Pt and PHt = Pdt Pt for some arbitrary path of P1t (which doesn’t affect the index),

   and let vYj be the steady-state value of the value-added shares discussed above. Then the

   steady-state growth rate of real private GDP is given by

                      vY1 × gX1 + vY2 × gX2 + (1 − vY1 − vY2 ) × (γgX1 + (1 − γ)gX2 + gH ),               (4.42)

   where gX j is the long-run growth rate of X jt and gH is the long-run growth rate of AHt .

   Douglas technology equals         1−θ21 −θ22 Pt Y2t /L2t   for all t. In the steady state, it equals

                               w1t                       1 − θ11 − θ21 y1 /`1

   where (p, `1 , `2 ) are the constant long-run values of (pt , `1t , `2t ). It can be easily seen from

   tracing out the procedure for calculating the steady state explained above that y1 /`1 and y2 /`2

                                                              26
     do not depend on (`1 , `2 ) (an implication of the constant-returns-to-scale technology and the

     small country assumption). Thus the steady-state wage ratio between non-IT and IT sectors

     does not depend on the allocation of labor between the two sectors.

     We close this section by commenting on our assumption that the relative price (Pt ≡ P2t /P1t ),

which is internationally given, is projected to grow at precisely the rate given by X1t /X2t , which

is determined by the domestic TFP growth rates in non-IT and IT sectors (see (4.29)). This is

not as far-fetched as it might seem. As Jorgenson (2003) finds, the rapid decline in IT prices is

common to G7 countries. If, as Jorgenson and Nomura (2005) argue, this relentless decline is

rooted in developments in technology (primarily in semiconductors) that are widely understood

by technologists and economists, it would not be too unrealistic to assume that the TFP growth

rate in the IT sector in Japan is as high as it is elsewhere in the world.




5.     Calibration and Results

The detrended dynamical system described in the previous section has a set of parameters and

exogenous variables. In this section, we calibrate the detrended system and specify the paths

of exogenous variables. We will then discuss the steady-state properties of the system. The

equilibrium of the model in levels can be obtained by solving the detrended system and then

multiplying the solution by appropriate time trends. The last part of this section examines

the transition dynamics thus calculated. As in Hayashi and Prescott (2002), the calibration is

based on data for 1984-1989 in principle, and the transition dynamics is set off from 1990. The

presumption of this simulation exercise is that the representative agent learns, all of a sudden

in 1990, about the paths of the exogenous variable from 1990 on. The prior expectations about

the exogenous variable from 1990 on are whatever is consistent with the 1984-89 values of the

endogenous variables of the model.




                                                 27
Calibration

The detrended dynamical system has nine parameters (β, µ, γ, δ1 , δ2 , θ11 , θ21 , θ12 , θ22 ). These

parameters are calibrated as follows.

 θij (i, j = 1, 2): These are capital shares, whose values for selected years are reported in Table 3

   for the non-IT and IT sectors. Given that β is estimated from the 1984-1989 data (see below),

   we should use the 1984-1989 averages. However, as seen from the Table, the factor shares of

   IT assets tend to increase in the 1990s. For this reason, we use the 1990-2000 averages.

 γ: It is non-IT capital’s (asset 1’s) share in household production. Its values for selected years

   are reported in Table 3 for the household sector. We use the 1990-2000 average.

 µ: From the parameterized Frisch demands (4.25), µ equals (1 + τct )P1t YHt /((1 + τct )P1t C1Ht +

   PHt YHt ). We use the 1990-2000 average; the 1984-89 average is similar.

 δi (i = 1, 2): The depreciation rate for each asset differs slightly across sectors in data, as shown

   in Table 7. For each asset and for each year, we take the weighted average of the depreciation

   rates over three sectors, j = 1, 2, H, with the capital stocks of that asset in three sectors as

   weights. We then use their 1990-2000 averages for δi (i = 1, 2). The calibrated values thus

   calculated are: δ1 = 6.8% and δ2 = 30.5%. The IT capital depreciates much faster. Again, their

   1984-89 averages are similar.

 β: From the Euler equation (4.8), the parameterized Frisch demands (4.25), and the marginal

   productivity condition for asset 1 in sector 1 under the Cobb-Douglas production function,

   we can derive

           Λt+1                           Y1t                    (1 + τct )P1t C1Ht + PHt YHt
                = β[1 + (1 − τk,t+1 )(θ11      − δ1 )] with Λt =                              .           (5.1)
            Λt                            K11t                              P1t Nt

   Following Hayashi and Prescott (2002), we take the sample average over 1984-1989 of both

   sides of this Euler equation and then solve for β. In taking the sample averages, θ11 and δ1

   are year-dependent values in data, not the calibrated values of them.

   There are eleven exogenous variables in the detrended system: the growth rates of (X1t ,

X2t , Nt ), the relative price (pt ), the two tax rates (τkt , τct ), exogenous labor ratios (`1t , `2t ) (where


                                                      28
` jt = L jt /Nt ), the government-expenditure-to-GDP ratios (ψ1t , ψ2t ), and the net export-to-GDP

ratio (νt ). Their values from year 1990 to 2000 are set to their actual values. Their paths beyond

year 2000 are projected into the future as follows.

 ` jt (allocation of hours): We consider two scenarios for the labor ratios `1t ≡ L1t /Nt and `2t ≡
                                                                                                         L1t +L2t
  L2t /Nt . In either scenario, the total hours devoted to the private sector, `1t + `2t =                 Nt ,       are as

  in the data for t = 1990, 1991, ..., 2000, and remains at its year 2000 value for t > 2000. The two
                                                                                                          ` jt          L jt
  scenarios differ in the allocation of private total hours between non-IT and IT,                     `1t +`2t   =   L1t +L2t

  ( j = 1, 2), for t = 2001, 2002, ....

                                                                                  L1t               L1,2000
  Scenario A The allocation is the same as in 2000.                  That is,   L1t +L2t   =   L1,2000 +L2,2000   for t =

       2001, 2002, .... As shown in Table 4, the ratio in 2000 is 97.2% for non-IT and 2.8% for

       IT.

  Scenario B The allocation gradually converge from (97.2%, 2.8%) to (90%, 10%). More specif-

       ically, for t = 2001, 2002, ...,
                                                                      !
                                            L1,2000 + L2,2000                  L1,2000 + L2,2000
               `2t − `2,t−1   = 0.1 × 0.9 ×                   − `1,t−1 , `1t =                   − `2t .
                                                  N2000                              N2000

       The steady-state distribution of 90% of private total hours for non-IT and 10% for IT is

       chosen because it implies a steady-state real private GDP growth of about 2.0%.

 Nt (working-age population): We assume zero growth, so Nt = N(2000) for t = 2001, 2002, ....

 X1t and X2t : They are the time trends defined in (4.29) and depend on the “pseudo” TFP levels,

  A1t and A2t defined in (4.21). For the non-IT sector (j = 1), we assume no productivity growth,

  so A1t = A1,2000 for t = 2001, 2002, .... For the IT sector, we set the growth rate of A2t after 2000

  to the average growth rate in 1995-2000. As Dale Jorgenson forcefully argues in his recent

  writings (see, e.g., Jorgenson (2003) for G7 countries, Jorgenson and Nomura (2005) for Japan

  in particular) and as verified in Table 5 and Figure 2, the TFP growth in the IT sector has

  accelerated after 1995. We are thus assuming that this acceleration after 1995 was anticipated

  in 1990 and that the enhanced IT growth is expected to continue into the future.

 τkt (tax rate on capital): Its conceptually appropriate definition is the so-called effective tax rate

  on income from capital, which includes taxes on capital at both the corporate and personal levels

                                                       29
  and incorporates various other features of the tax code such as accelerated depreciation, tax-

  free reserves. As mentioned in footnote 7, this tax rate was calculated in Nomura (2004a). The

  value beyond 2000 is set equal to its 2000 value of 50.0%, which is close to the crude estimate

  of 48% used in Hayashi and Prescott (2002).

 τct (consumption tax rate): Its measurement was already discussed in Section 2. The value

  beyond 2000 is its 2000 value (9.8%). The tax rate is higher than the statutory rate of 5%

  because the tax base is assumed to be P1t C1Ht , which is narrower than the actual tax base.

 ψit (government share of good i): The values beyond 2000 are the 2000 values.

 pt (the relative price): The detrended relative price in data does not show a trend since 1970.

  The value beyond 2000 is set at its average over 1990-2000. As discussed at the end of the

  previous section, this amounts to assuming that the differential in TFP growth between non-IT

  and IT is common to all countries in the world.

 νt (net exports/GDP ratio): The country’s foreign asset measured in non-IT goods, FAt , evolves

  according to

                                      FAt+1 = (1 + rt )(FAt − NXt ),

  where rt is the interest rate on foreign assets. Letting fat ≡ FAt /(Y1t + Pt Y2t ), this equation can

  be written as
                               1                                     1 + rt
                                    fa = fat − νt , 1 + r̃t ≡                         .
                             1 + r̃t t+1                        Y1,t+1 +Pt+1 Y2,t+1
                                                                    Y1t +Pt Y2t
  We assume that this 1 + r̃t is constant and is equal to the ratio of 1.05 to 1.007 (one plus the

  long-run growth rate of X1t ). The value of νt beyond 2000 is set as:

                      νt = −0.01 + xt−2000 × (ν2000 + 0.01) for t = 2001, 2002, ....

  This x is set so that the present discounted value of νt (t = 2000, 2001, ...) with the discounting

  factor of 1/(1 + r̃t ) equals fa2000 . We take FA2000 to be the nation’s external assets at the end of

  1999 (84.735 trillion yen in nominal terms). x thus calculated equals 0.9422. Thus, the trade

  balance is assumed to gradually declines to −1% of GDP (excluding household production).

   As explained in the previous section, the path of AHt (the pseudo TFP for household produc-

tion) does not affect the detrended system, but it does affect the breakdown of Pdt YHt (value of

                                                  30
household production in terms of good 1) between price and quantity. We assume no change in

AHt beyond year 2000. The calibrated parameter values and projected growth rates are shown

in Table 9.

Results

Under the calibrated parameter values and projected path of exogenous variables, we can nu-

merically solve (i.e., simulate) the model as explained in detail in the previous section. We first

examine the steady-state properties of the model solution. Table 10 reports our steady-state

results under the two scenarios about the allocation of private total hours between non-IT and

IT sectors. As explained in the previous section, the steady-state value of the wage ratio w1t /w2t

does not depend on the allocation of private hours. Under our calibration of the model, it equals

0.9670. So there is no strong incentive for workers to emigrate between non-IT and IT sectors in

the steady state. As shown in the table, the steady-state percapita GDP growth rate depends on

the given allocation of labor. This is because the sectoral allocation of labor affects the sectoral

                                                             31
allocation of value added. The “macro” capital-output ratio, on the other hand, is not sensitive

to the labor allocation.

there is a unique initial value for the co-state, λ1990 , such that the system converges to the steady

different steady-state growth rates under the two scenarios, the detrended path of real GDP

diverges eventually, as shown in the Figure, but the difference is not apparent until around

2003. For either scenario, the model’s ability to track GDP is rather impressive. The model

does far worse for the capital-output ratio (K/Y), as seen in Figure 6. The simulated K/Y under

either scenario echoes the rapid rise in data, but the rise is not steep enough. Compared to the

one-sector model of Hayashi and Prescott (2002), our multi-sector model is less able to account

for K/Y. One possible reason is our assumption that labor allocation is exogenous. Shutting

down the labor margin reduces returns from investment.




6.    Conclusion

We have constructed a multi-sector growth model that takes explicit account of the differential

TFP growth rates between non-IT and IT goods. Our model is capable of accounting for Japan’s

output slump in the 1990s, and is less successful than the one-sector model of Hayashi and

Prescott (2002) in accounting for the sharp rise in the capital-output ratio in the 1990s.

     Can IT be Japan’s savior? What this paper has done is merely provide an accounting frame-

work for answering the question. We have provided a mapping from the labor allocation and the

relative price between non-IT and IT sectors to the long-run GDP growth rate. To endogenize the

labor allocation and the relative price and to thereby determine the country’s industry structure,

one would need a dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model composed open economies.
