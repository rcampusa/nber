Using a unique con dential data set with industry-level disaggregation of U.S. cross-border
securities claims and liabilities, we nd that the growing U.S. securities are also increasingly
intermediated by tax haven nancial centers (THFC) and by less regulated funds. These securities
are risky and respond to tax rates and regulation, suggesting tax avoidance and regulatory
arbitrage. Issuers are mostly intangible-intensive multinationals, and investors require a high
Sharpe ratio, suggesting search for yield. In contrast, safe Treasuries are mainly held by the
foreign o cial sector and increased with quantitative easing policies. Facts on private securities are
rationalized through a model where multinationals with heterogeneous default probabilities
endogenously choose to shift pro ts and are funded by global intermediaries with endogenous
monitoring intensity. A fall in the costs of global funds, by increasing rms' pro ts, shifts the
distribution of entrants toward riskier ones and also reduces intermediaries' incentives to monitor
both the extensive (fraction of monitored rms) and intensive margin, hence raising ex post risk.
Firms appear elusively safe.

      border securities claims and liabilities, we find that the growing U.S. securities are also

      a model where multinationals with heterogeneous default probabilities endogenously
      choose to shift profits and are funded by global intermediaries with endogenous mon-
      itoring intensity. A fall in the costs of global funds, by increasing firms' profits, shifts
      the distribution of entrants toward riskier ones and also reduces intermediaries' incent-
      ives to monitor both the extensive (fraction of monitored firms) and intensive margin,
      hence raising ex post risk. Firms appear elusively safe.

1         Introduction
The large and growing capital flows of dollar-denominated securities between the United
States and the rest of the world and its consequences for the macroeconomy have long been
and still are an important part of research in international finance (reviewed in the next sub-
section). Yet, no paper has studied the micro origins, especially the motives and incentives,
behind these flows. This was due to a lack of reliable data with an exact quantification of the
inflows and outflows across years and countries and with granular information on investors,
issuers and asset type.
        In this paper, we use a unique, granular, and confidential data set derived from the Treas-
ury International Capital (TIC) reporting system (annual survey of US portfolio securities
claims on foreigners, and annual survey of U.S. portfolio securities liabilities to foreigners)
which collects data on U.S. residents' holdings of foreign securities and on foreign residents'
holdings of U.S. securities. By delving into the micro motives for the dynamic of the flows
geography, we also consequentially draw a new global securities' risk map, with important
implications also for firms' funding decisions abroad.
        Our analysis proceeds in three steps. We first examine country-level flows per type of
assets and issuers and draw a set of macro facts. Motivated by those we inspect further the
sectorial level securities flows and draw an additional set of quantitative facts that speak
more closely of the micro motives. The granularity of our data indeed allows us to match
them with sectoral measures of risk, Sharpe ratios and intangibility. Drawing on all of the
above facts we construct a model to rationalize the facts.
        It is important to stress that our data represent the most accurate available measure-
ments of U.S. cross-border asset positions. The confidential TIC data are based on required
reporting by all significant U.S. custodians and U.S. end-investors holding securities abroad
and by all significant U.S. custodians and issuers of U.S. securities held by foreigners.1 Hence,
contrary to data used in previous studies and extracted from industry analysts' reporting,
credit agencies, or other private industry reporting, our data represent an official source with
extremely broad and granular coverage.2

       At the country level, we find that U.S. privately held capital flows, which are largely
dollar-denominated, are increasingly intermediated by tax havens financial centers (THFC
hereafter) and non-bank financial institutions. In contrast, safe assets, namely U.S. Treas-
uries, are mainly held by foreign official investors.3 Figure 1 presents a first glance of the
facts for securities flows into a THFC, which we then detail further below. The figure shows
the trends for the period 2007-2018 in U.S. securities claims and liabilities to the Cayman
Islands, the THFC that accounts for the largest proportion of the flows.4 Both claims and
liabilities have increased significantly (first two panels on the top of the figure), particularly
so for equities (third panel in the bottom) and for US-dollar denominated assets (fourth
panel on the bottom). To give a sense of the magnitude and significance of the increase,
note that U.S. equity claims on the Cayman Islands have seen a 700 percent increase over
the period 2007-2018 and liabilities have increased 483 percent in equities and 108 percent
in corporate debt.
       The increase in U.S. securities claims and liabilities channelled through THFC has been
particularly marked around 2010. Around that year there were important financial reforms
throughout advanced economies, ranging from the Dodd-Frank Act (approved in 2010), to
the end of the banking secrecy approved by the G20 leaders in 2009 to the Basel III agree-
ments also in 2010. Many of those reforms included restrictions on portfolio management
and increased investors' protection, both of which have encouraged investors and mutual
funds to shift their activity to less regulated financial centers. The growth has been lar-
ger for equities of multinationals or investment funds with foreign residence.5 Notably, the
majority of U.S. equity shares in the Cayman Islands is in less-regulated mutual funds.
       As for Treasuries, the safe assets, over half ($4.1 trillion out of $6.7 trillion as of December
2019) of those are held by the official sector. Overall Treasury holdings (that is, official and
   3
     The TIC system collects data separately by country for foreign official and private investors, but break-
downs by country for foreign official and private holdings are not published.

     As noted above, data are not separately released by country for official and private flows. But total
Cayman Island official foreign exchange reserves and U.S. foreign exchange reserves are both minimal, and
as a result these data overwhelmingly represent private investment flows.
   5
     An important caveat is that some of the increase from 2011 to 2012 represents an expansion in the
reporting universe that accompanied the introduction of the TIC SLT in 2011. See Brandner and Judson
(2012) and Bertaut and Judson (2014) for more details. Note this would not systematically explain a growth
concentrated in equities.

private holdings combined) are dominated by Japan and China, with other large holders in
emerging markets and also the euro area. Their growth picked up at the time of quantitative
easing policies or during the euro area sovereign crisis. Scarcity of safe Treasuries, coupled
with the higher returns paid by U.S. Treasuries compared to German Bunds, fostered their
demand.
      Next, we move to examine the patterns in sector-level data. Before that we check for
correlations in the aggregate data using standard global financial and dollar cycle regressions
(results are presented in Appendix C).6 That literature has so far focused on the macro
determinants of flows. Our regressions include traditional variables, such as the growth rate
of the VIX, dollar exchange rate, Federal Funds Rate or shadow rate, Excess Bond Premium,

                                                                                                                                    4
and the Variance Risk Premium (VRP), but also new ones such as uncertainty measures. In a
nutshell we find that privately held flows mostly react to the VIX and uncertainty measures,
while Treasuries, mainly held by the official sector, also react to the dollar exchange rate.7 All
in all, however most of those macro variables do not seem to have much predictive power and
they would not provide any rationale for as why flows gravitate primarily toward countries
specialized in tax and regulatory arbitrage.
       Motivated by all of the above macro findings we move to search for the micro origins of
the flows geography by examining facts at the sector level. For this part we focus on private
securities, as those are the ones mostly gravitating toward THFC.8 The goal of this part of
the analysis is to sort securities according to issuing firms' characteristics. Using the unique
granularity of our dataset we match our securities data with estimates of industry-level risk
and uncertainty metrics metrics and Sharpe ratios.9 Risk and uncertainty of privately held
U.S. liabilities (debt and equities) are higher in THFC and have increased over time. Also,
the distribution of liabilities' risk across countries shows a shift rightward in 2019 compared to
2007 and is more similar between THFC compared to non-THFC. This overall suggests that
assets issued and intermediated through THFC are associated with riskier firms. Second,
Sharpe ratios have also increased, especially in THFC, suggesting that investors buying from
there are searching for yield rather than for safety.
       Given the above facts we conjecture that firms holding intangible capital, which are
typically riskier, might have incentives to seek out funding in financial centers with large
availability of highly liquid investors, possibly in search for yield. Given the nature of their
activity it is also easier for those firms to seek funds in locations that are not near their
headquarters. Note also that section 23A of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits firms to use
intangible capital as collateral for loans. This provides an additional strong incentive for
those firms to seek funds else-where and could explain why their debt or equities appear
riskier. To this purpose we further match our securities data with an intangibility index
and indeed we do find that the risky flows intermediated through THFC correlate with the

     In some cases we include Treasuries for robustness checks.
   9
     We measure risk with realized volatility at the industry level and uncertainty with the proxy proposed
in Gopinath and Stein (2018). Sharpe ratios are given by excess returns at industry level divided by the
volatility of the excess returns. Data described in detail in the appendix section.

intangibility index.10 Those firms therefore seems to be the ones which can best exploit the
regulatory and tax advantage. To check this we run a regressions of U.S. liabilities at country
and sector level against the statutory corporate tax rate interacted with the intangibility
metric.11 We find lower taxes significantly increase debt held by foreign investors, particularly
so for intangible intensive firms.
       We rationalize the facts related to privately held securities with a model featuring endo-
genous entry in tax havens and endogenous risk-taking. We analyze the possibility of entry
and funding in THFC through global unregulated intermediaries. The model explains the
double occurrence of profit shifting to THFC and the increased risk-taking by the combin-
ation of the increase in global savings/imbalances and tax/regulatory arbitrage. Low rates
prevailed even before 2007, but it is only the regulatory and tax advantage, desirable after the
tightening in industrialized countries' regulation, that can explain the recent concentration
of the risky flows in THFC. To study the interaction of these different factors, we construct
a general equilibrium model with multinationals entering THFC and funded by lightly regu-
lated global intermediaries. Firms are heterogeneous in their default probabilities and choose
whether to shift profits to the THFC, which implies a cost but generates a tax benefit. Firms
fund their activities with risky debt obtained from global intermediaries. These intermedi-
aries have access to a global market for liquidity and, as they are only lightly regulated, can
offer funds at low costs. Loan spreads are chosen based on an incentive-compatible contract
and intermediaries choose their monitoring intensity endogenously. Debt issued in THFC
corresponds to U.S. debt or equity liabilities held privately from investors located in THFC.
       We use the model to examine the effect of an increase in global liquidity on the direction
of flows and on the riskiness of firms' debt. Increasing global liquidity has been discussed
extensively and has been linked with the growth in U.S. liabilities (See Bernanke (2005) or
Summers (2014)). We show that a fall in debt costs, triggered for instance by an exogenous
increase in global liquidity, raises firms' profits. This has two effects. First, a higher fraction
of firms can afford to enter the THFC, leading to a shift in the default distribution of entrants
toward riskier ones. This generates a novel "risk selection" effect. Second, more profitable

     We use the intangibility measure constructed by Peters and Taylor (2017), which combines both R&D
and marketing expenditures.

firms appear elusively safer and global intermediaries endogenously reduce their monitoring
intensity at both the extensive (fewer firms are monitored) and the intensive (each firm is
monitored less) margins. This in turn increases firms' default probabilities and the overall
aggregate risk in each sector. In sum, the model explains well the double occurrence of shifts
in the flows toward THFC and the increase in average risk as well the shift in its distribution.

Relation to Literature The increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) in tax havens
has been noted in a recent literature measuring the extent of profit shifting. Guvenen et
al. (2017) and Tørsløv et al. (2018) both find, using different data sets, that much of the
productivity slowdown observed in the U.S. since 2004 can be explained by profit shifting
and is larger for R&D intensive industries.12 Similarly, Liu et al. (Forthcoming) document
substantial profit shifting through transfer pricing by U.K. multinationals, also concentrated
in the R&D-intensive sectors. Wright and Zucman (2018) examine the evolution of taxes
paid by U.S. multinationals on their foreign profits since 1966 and show that an exorbitant
tax privilege explains half of the U.S. cross-border return differential.13 Our works highlights
the pursuit of risk in addition to the role of regulation and tax arbitration.
      We rationalize the empirical facts through a model, whose novelty lies in introducing
moral hazard contracts with endogenous monitoring intensity (see in Martinez-Miera and
Repullo (2017)) in a model where heterogeneous firms a' la Melitz (2003) enter the THFC also
for funding purposes. The tax advantage provides incentives for entry. Firms are assumed
to be heterogeneous in terms of their default probabilities. Due to this heterogeneity, when
more firms enter, there is a shift in the firms' distribution toward riskier firms. We dub this
new mechanism the risk-selection effect.
      The paper also relates to the literature that study the connection between multi-nationals,
capital flows, and credit frictions: Froot and Stein (1991) focus on informational frictions,
Klein et al. (2002) on constraints faced by bank-dependent firms and Antr`
                                                                         as et al. (2009) on
contracting frictions. We highlight a novel dimension linking multinationals entry and their
risk distribution to moral hazard and endogenous monitoring intensity. The paper is also
related to the theoretical literature on tax competition and profit shifting (see Ottaviano
 12
      See Hines (1996), Hines and Rice (1994) for early work on this front and also Desai et al. (2004).

and van Ypersele (2004) or Krautheim and Schmidt-Eisenlohr (2011)). Our model rational-
izes the emergence of foreign direct investment flows for the purpose of regulation and tax
arbitrage to complement the large literature on the motives of multinational firms.
       In the international finance literature, the research by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2018)
and Obstfeld (2018) began to document the changing landscape of capital flows geography,
including the shift toward tax havens or financial centers. More recently the policy reports
from Bertaut et al. (2019) use the TIC data to document an increasing share of U.S. equity
and debt claims in firms incorporated in low-tax jurisdictions and intermediated through
mutual and hedge funds. Furthermore the policy report by Liu and Schmidt-Eisenlohr
(2019) uses TIC data to document a rapid growth in the use of CLOs, which, contrary to
other safer debt-instruments, facilitate risk-recycling. In this paper we provide a full-fledged
empirical analysis with firms' sorting to uncover the micro origins of the new geography of
flows and rationalize the mechanism with a model.
       Our paper also relates to the literature documenting the increase of cross-border flows
in U.S. dollar-denominated securities and the role of dollar as reserve currency and global
provider of liquidity, (see Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2001), Obstfeld (2004), Gourinchas and
Rey (2010), Goldberg and Tille (2009), Forbes (2010), Gourinchas and Rey (2014), Caballero
et al. (2016) or Gopinath and Stein (2018) among others). Early works attributed the growth
in dollar-denominated debt to the safe haven properties of the U.S. dollar and the specialty
of Treasuries (Caballero et al. (2008), Mendoza et al. (2009), Gourinchas et al. (2011),
among others) and documented the role currency bias in accounting for home bias (Burger
et al. (2018)). Recent papers (Maggiori et al. (Forthcoming) and Coppola et al. (2019)) use
private proprietary data to document that the dollar dominance might be even stronger than
previously thought while documenting as well the increasing role of tax havens. An advantage
of the TIC data is that it provides shares for both inflows and outflows obtained from official
reporting to the U.S. government which allow to document the two-way intermediation and
risky nature of these flows.14 Moreover the granular nature of the TIC data allows us to

     Recent literature notes measurements concerns in the Balance of Payments entries due to the more
complex structure of multinationals. Avdjiev et al. (2018) and Bertaut et al. (2019), for example, note
differences in U.S. cross-border flows based on the nationality rather than on the residence of the ultimate
owner and Coppola et al. (2019) expand for a broader set of countries.

match them with other micro variables and to uncover the incentives behind the shift of the
flows toward THFC.
    In terms of highlighting the risky nature of the growth of U.S. securities, our works relates
to the research of Bruno et al. (2018) and Avdjiev et al. (Forthcoming) which questions the
safe-assets hypothesis for dollar-denominated privately held securities and conjecture that
global banks leverage in dollars to cover for the exposure in dollar assets. We also find that
cross-border flows in dollar-denominated assets are increasing, and uncover new motives
such as tax avoidance and regulatory arbitrage, noting that most of the private flows are
actually risky and related more broadly to non-bank financial intermediaries as well. As for
the outflows of U.S. Treasuries, very safe assets, we find that they are mainly held within
the official sector and sovereign flows and their growth coincides with quantitative easing
policies (Alfaro and Kanczuk (2009) and Alfaro et al. (2014).)
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the main facts. Section 3 contain
the regression analysis of macro determinants and micro origins. In section 4 we present the
model. The last section concludes.



2     Country-Level Facts
We start by documenting some facts from the TIC data at the country level and for different
types of securities, taken from the annual surveys of U.S. portfolio securities claims on for-
eigners (SHC/SHCA) and of U.S. portfolio securities liabilities to foreigners (SHL/SHLA).
These surveys have collected cross-border position data at the individual security level annu-
ally since the early 2000s. The data include information on the security characteristics (type
of security, currency, issue and maturity date, type and name of issuer, country of issuer,
industry of issuer) as well as information on the types of holders. As a result, it is possible
to calculate breakdowns across countries, type of securities (treasuries, debt, equities, ABS,
etc.), type of investors (official versus private) and issuers, and on the ultimate destination
of the claims (equities of multinationals or of mutual funds). Reporting is required by law.
In addition to the annual surveys, the TIC-SLT has collected aggregate monthly data on

cross-border positions since late 2011.15 Appendix A describes the data in detail.
       In the data analysis below, we uncover the main trends, such as the change in the size
of holdings, their main location, and the securities that are most in demand. Facts and
empirical results are reported for both U.S. holdings of foreign securities (referred to as
claims) and foreign holdings of U.S. securities (referred to as liabilities). When reporting
country level data breakdowns in the figures below, we choose the 12 countries that account
for the largest share and we quantify the percentage change over the sample period and the
average percentage change per year for the largest destination of flows. In section 2.1, we
analyze facts and tends at the more granular sectoral level. The data are based on both the
SHL/SHLA (liabilities) and SHC/SHCA (claims) surveys, which collect data on individual
cross-border security holdings from custodians, end-investors, and issuers.16
       First, figure F.1 in Appendix F confirms that both inflows and outflows from and to the
United States have been growing in recent years even further. Figure F.1 shows that tax
havens, and in particular the Cayman Islands, rank in the top 10 destinations for both U.S.
claims and liabilities and that their share has increased over time with a jump around 2010.
       Next we examine the breakdown of the data by country, asset class, currency of denom-
ination, and other features. We start with U.S. claims. Figure 3 shows U.S. cross-border
  15
     In the analysis, when relevant, we use the longest available sample from the "modern survey" era. Since
the liabilities and claims surveys are collected at different times of the year, the samples are slightly different.
  16
     Surveys are conducted annually. "Benchmark" surveys are conducted every five years and have a more
comprehensive reporting panel. Annual surveys are formally designated as SHCA and SHLA.

securities claims by country and security type (on a common scale), for the set of countries
attracting the most U.S. investment. To appreciate the magnitude of the increase, note
that claims in equities have increased 700 percent over the sample period 2006-2018, with
an average annual percentage change of 18.9 percent. Long-term debt claims on the Cay-
man Islands have increased 152 percent, an 8 percent average annual increase. In contrast,
short-term debt claims have declined. Most of the increase in flows was in equities. The
increasing share of equity in total claims emerges also from Figure F.2 in the Appendix,
which shows the time series evolution of the flows. The unprecedented growth of securities
from the Cayman Islands and other offshore centers is evident starting in 2010. Thus, in the
next figures we focus on the sample period 2007-2018 (subject to data availability).
   Figure 4 breaks down the equities claims by type of equity: common stock, fund shares,
and other equity. The Cayman Islands stand alone as receiving the vast majority of U.S.

inflows the form of fund shares, reflecting ownership by U.S. residents of funds (i.e. non-
banks) that intermediate capital in the Cayman Islands. Similarly, figure F.3 in the Appendix
shows that the holdings of common stock and foreign depository receipts are the largest in
the Cayman Islands, too. These claims are most likely holdings of equities by affiliates of
multinationals.
   In summary, recent data show an increase of U.S. claims on THFC, which mainly the
form of equities or corporate debt investments in multinationals or less-regulated funds
intermediated from the Caribbean.
   In terms of currency denomination, Figure 5 shows that asset holdings in THFC are nearly
all in U.S. dollars. Over the sample period 2010-2018, the growth in dollar-denominated debt
claims on the Cayman Islands has grown 129 percent, while in other countries (Europe or
EMEs) the share of foreign currency-denomination has increased since 2012.

       Next we examine U.S. liabilities, an essential dimension of the data for a country whose
global imbalances have been under the microscope for long. Figure 6 shows the breakdown
of foreign holdings of U.S. securities by the official and the private sectors. The most inter-
esting aspect is the dominance of U.S. Treasuries in the foreign official sector. Equities and
corporate debt are instead held by private investors. The growth of Treasuries within the
official sector has increased significantly at the time of quantitative easing policies. Note,
on the other side, that U.S. official securities claims are minimal (and not shown for this
reason).17 This confirms the safe asset hypothesis for U.S. Treasuries. Last, as for claims,
U.S. liabilities privately held in the Cayman Islands are mostly in the form of equities and
corporate bonds and have been growing since 2010.

    At end-2019, U.S. official holdings of foreign securities were about $12 billion. See Table 2 in ht-
tps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/newsevents/news/markets/2019/fxq419.pdf.

       Figure 7 shows the breakdown of U.S. liabilities by country. Again, most of the equities
are held by investors in the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg, while most of the Treasuries
are held by Japan and China and increased at the time of quantitative easing.18 The increase

    Still, from a lower base, the Cayman Islands have seen an increase in liabilities in U.S. Treasuries of 674
percent over the period 2006-2018, with an average annual increase of 18 percent.

in equities and corporate debt over the same period has been 108 percent and 483 percent,
respectively.
   Finally, Figure F.4 in Appendix F shows that most of the debt in the Cayman Islands
is in the form of asset-backed securities (ABS). ABS are a method to recycle risk onto the
market and, as such, they have often been linked to reduced debt monitoring and higher ex
post risk. We will examine the risk profile of THFC assets in the next section.
   To sum up, two main trends emerge from the previous data analysis, beyond an increase
in flows of U.S. securities. First, there is an increase in U.S. private security claims and
liabilities toward THFC. The flows have trended up mostly around 2010, a year in which
most advanced economies tightened prudential regulations. The fact that most of these flows


                                                                                               15
are intermediated through less-regulated funds suggests a link to those events. Second, one
can see an increase of U.S. Treasury securities abroad, mostly held by the official sector and
mostly around the dates of quantitative easing policies.
       These facts together suggest that a combination of macro and micro factors are behind the
recent trends in flows. To further examine the macro side in Appendix C we run regressions
of the monthly flows over variables from the financial and dollar cycle literature19 but also
some new ones related to uncertainty measures.20 The variables include the growth rate of
the VIX, dollar exchange rate, Federal Funds Rate or shadow rate, Excess Bond Premium
and the Variance Risk Premium (VRP). We find that privately held flows mostly react to VIX
and uncertainty measures, while Treasuries, mainly held by the official sector, also react to
the dollar exchange rate 21 . All in all, however most of those macro variables do not seem to
have much predictive power. Beyond that they would surely not provide any rationale for as
why flows gravitate primarily toward countries specialized in tax and regulatory arbitrage.
For this reason we move straight to the analysis of sector-level data by sorting securities
according to characteristics of issuing firms. This will provide the best indicators for the
micro motives of THFC gravitation.


2.1       Micro Origins of Capital Flows: Tax Haven and Risky Firms

The stylized facts in section 2 show that most flows are recently gravitating toward THFC,
suggesting that tax avoidance and regulatory arbitrage might be behind those trends. This
trend has been more marked after 2010, a year in which most industrialized countries
tightened regulations, including investors' protection. The empirical analysis in section C
highlighted that privately issued and held flows are little correlated with most macro vari-
able. The only correlation that appears robust and significant is the one with market risk
and uncertainty. Overall those facts combined suggest that factors, other than traditional
macro determinants, might explain the new geography of the flows and why they gravitated
toward centers specialized in regulatory arbitrage.

   We now therefore examine the micro incentives that might be driving the flows. To this
purpose, we exploit the granularity of the annual TIC survey data, collected at the individual
security level. Specifically, we match our industry-level flow data with the corresponding
volatility risk metrics and Sharpe ratios. Both measures provide us with information on the
incentives behind the shift of flows toward THFC. Higher risk indicates that tax avoidance
and regulation arbitrage are the most likely cause of the shift. A high Sharpe ratio indicates
a search for yield behaviour.
   The analysis in this section uses total U.S. liabilities against other countries, that is,
it combines liabilities against foreign private and foreign official investors (FOI). As noted
earlier, most private U.S. securities are held by private foreign investors, but there are some
notable holdings by FOI that we want to also capture in our analysis. The analysis of realized
volatility, Sharpe ratios, and intangibility focuses on private U.S. liabilities for which these
measures can be calculated. Most importantly, the baseline analysis therefore excludes the
large foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries. However, we provide some analysis where we
include U.S. Treasuries in the analysis, assigning a risk and Sharpe ratio of zero to these
holdings. When including U.S. Treasuries in the analysis, the difference in the average risk
of debt holdings between tax havens and non-havens, documented below, becomes much
more pronounced. Then, the average risk of tax havens is substantially higher than that of
non-havens, as the latter have much larger holdings of save U.S. Treasuries.


2.1.1   Risk and Sharpe Ratios of U.S. Liabilities

As a measure of risk we use yearly realized volatility at the firm level which is aggregated to
the industry level based on NAICS codes. Realized volatility is given by the square root of the
sum of squared daily stock returns in a given year. Yearly Sharpe ratios are computed first at
firm level using yearly averages and standard deviations of daily excess stock returns. They
are then aggregated by taking means at the industry level. Both variables are winsorized
at the 1% and 99% level before aggregating them to the industry level. We also use a risk
measure from Gilchrist et al. (2014) that captures time-varying equity volatility for firms
cleaned of the forecastable variation in expected returns, which we label GSZ. The data
appendix presents additional details on the construction of the variables.

                                              17
                                  Given the long standing interest in the determinants of the large and growing US current
account deficit, we start by examining liabilities. The availability of detailed information
on inflows is also another novel aspect of the dataset compared to other security-level data
examined in related literature that focus mainly on claims.

Notes : This figure plots the total realized volatility for U.S. liabilities for the years 2007-2019. The left panel
shows THFC versus non-THFC, while the right panel shows a selected set of countries. For the left panel,
total realized volatility is calculated by multiplying all holdings of THFC (non-THFC) countries in industry
j in year t with the average realized volatility of industry j over the years 2010-2013 and then dividing by
the average U.S. debt liability holdings across the two country groups over the period 2007-2019. For the
right panel, country i's holdings in industry j in year t is multiplied with the average realized volatility of
industry j over the years 2010-2013 and then divided by the average U.S. debt liability holdings across the
five countries over the period 2007-2019.



                                  Figure 8 shows the total realized volatility for U.S. liabilities for the years 2007-2019.
Exact formulas for all the variables below are described in Appendix E. The left panel
compares THFC versus non-THFC, while the right panel shows a selected group of countries.
The total realized volatility at the country-year level is computed by multiplying country
i's holdings in industry j in year t with the average Sharpe ratio of industry j over the
years 2010-2013 and then dividing by the average U.S. debt liability holdings across the five
countries over the period 2007-2019. Our purpose here is to highlight mainly a composition
effect across industries within a country's portfolio. For this reason, we use the average


                                                                                    18
realized volatility for each industry between 2010-2013 when constructing the time series.
Alternatively, one could use time-varying measures of realized volatility at the industry-level.
   The left panel shows that risk has been increasing over time. In addition, it shows that
the flows gravitating toward THFC are significantly riskier than those from other countries.
So the overall growth in U.S. liabilities held by tax havens does not seem to be driven
by an appetite for safe U.S. assets, as it is increasingly concentrated in securities of riskier
industries. To further illustrate the result, the right panel plots again the total risk computed
as before but now shows specific countries. We compare Caymans, Ireland, Luxembourg,
namely some THFC with large holdings of U.S. liabilities, with China and Germany, two
large countries with sizable holdings of U.S. assets. The figure shows higher risk in the THFC
countries. While the figure excludes Treasuries, the finding is consistent with the previously
documented fact that China largely holds Treasuries, hence safe assets.
   Next, we check robustness of our results by examining other risk measures. Specifically we
compute the uncertainty measure from Gilchrist et al. (2014) (GSZ hereafter). The measure
has two advantages. First, it focuses on uncertainty as opposed to risk, thereby providing an
important and complementary aspect compared to the realized volatility. Second, it proxies
idiosyncratic uncertainty using high-frequency firm-level stock market data, a measure that
arguably reflects exogenous changes in uncertainty, rather than the endogenous effects of
informational and contractual frictions. Figure 9 below plots the weighted average GSZ
metric against the weighted average realized volatility in 2019 and for the countries with
the largest holdings of U.S. debt liabilities (at least $50 billion in 2019). The averages are
computed with the same procedure described for the previous figure and like before we
focus on U.S. debt liabilities. The circles around the country names indicate the size of the
positions. The figure shows that average GSZ uncertainty and average realized volatility of
U.S. debt liabilities are highly correlated at the country level. Most importantly, it shows
that both are higher in THFC countries (indicated with letters in red). Hence, in sum both
average risk and average uncertainty of U.S. debt liabilities are higher for tax havens.
   If debt securities issued by U.S. multi-nationals have become increasingly risky and un-
certain it is of interest to examine which compensation is required by investors buying U.S.
assets from THFC. This would indeed inform on whether investors are searching for yield or

for safety.
    Figure 10 plots the total Sharpe ratio of U.S. Debt liabilities for the years 2007-2019.
The left panel shows that the total Sharpe ratios have been increasing over time and again
are higher for THFC countries. Total Sharpe ratios are higher for THFC, indicating that
investors from THFC get compensated for the additional risk they take on and suggesting
some search-for yield as opposed to search for safety. As before, to further illustrate our
findings, in the right panel we plot the trends in the total Sharpe ratios comparing three
THFC, namely Caymans, Ireland and Luxembourg, with China and Germany. Again, we
highlight the significantly higher total Sharpe ratios in the THFC countries.
    The connection between the shift to tax havens and an increase in risk will be rationalized
in the model that we present in Section 3. In there, we argue that the double coincidence
of an increase in global liquidity and a tax arbitrage induces multi-nationals to issue debt
abroad through global intermediaries located in THFC and that this debt is increasingly
risky. The reason for the increased risk is due to a combination of investors' search for yield
and a reduction on intermediaries' monitoring incentives. We will return to this mapping in

2.1.2                       Intangibles and Risky Firms

The incentives to shift profits and to obtain funding in less regulated centers is likely to
be stronger for firms that can more easily move their activities. This is the case for firms
with a high share of intangible assets. Firms heavy on physical capital are more likely to
request funds from local banks which are located closer to their working capital. Additionally
current regulation in the United States does not allow banks to hold intangible capital as
part of capital reserves to be re-deployed during crises, the reason being that royalties and
patents have highly uncertain valuations.22 This implies two things. First, that intangible
firms have higher incentives to search for funds elsewhere. Firms with intangible inputs and
capital hold very risky collateral, something which can prevent them from obtaining funds
in the traditional banking system (see chapter 8 of Haskel and Westlake (2018)). Second the

uncertain nature of their capital makes their debt and equity issuance highly risky.
       We verify those two aspects below, namely whether U.S. liabilities to THFC are not only
riskier but also concentrated in industries with more intangibles and whether tax avoidance
incentives are indeed higher in these industries.
       First, to shed light on the firms' characteristics that make riskier assets flow through
tax havens, we match our data set with an intangibility index that is based on the meas-
ure constructed by Peters and Taylor (2017), which combines both R&D and marketing
expenditures.23 As in the previous figures, we again focus on private securities, in particular
U.S. debt liabilities.
       The recent rapid growth of the intangible-intensive economy is well-known. Less known is
the strong link between intangible-intensive industries and asset-risk and most importantly
between intangible risky assets and tax havens. We are particularly interested in U.S. liab-
ilities, such as debt and equity, often issued by multinationals, that is bought by investors
in THFC. The correlation between securities' risk and intangibility index is illustrated in
Figure 11 that shows the countries with the largest U.S. debt liability holdings in 2019. At
the country-level, there is a strong positive correlation between the average realized volatil-
ity and the average intangibility of U.S. debt liability holdings. The figure also shows how
holdings of tax havens are on average in industries with a higher realized volatility and a
higher intangibility index.
       Figure 12 shows kernel densities of average realized volatility across countries separately
for U.S. debt liabilties held by THFC (red lines) and non-THFC (blue lines), for the years
2007 (dashed lines) and 2019 (solid lines). There are two main takeaways. First, in both
years, the distribution for THFC is shifted to the right from that of non-THFC, implying that
on average THFC hold debt liabilities in riskier industries. Second, both densities shifted to
the right from 2007 to 2017, indicating an overall shift in holdings towards riskier industries
across all countries. Finally, in 2019, the density for THFC is more narrow, which shows
that THFC are more similar in the average risk of their holdings than other countries.
       The model that we present in section 3 not only predicts a correlation between firms'
debt issued and bought in THFC and risk but also has detailed implications for the risk

distribution of firms entering the THFC. If a larger fraction of firms issues debt in THFC,
this raises the default threshold for the debt securities traded there.
       Tax havens have traditionally kept lower corporate tax rates than other countries. It
is therefore legitimate to ask what factors increased incentives to relocate in more recent
years. The growth in the intangible firms' economy can again provides an answer. For
those firms relocation is easier and in some case necessary. Hence, those are the firms that
more easily can exploit the tax advantage. To test this we regress liabilities (debt and

on the interaction term between the corporate tax rate and the average intangibility index
is negative and highly significant in both specifications. The negative coefficient implies
that when a country lowers its tax rate, its holdings of U.S. liabilities in intangible-intensive
industries increase relative to industries with fewer intangibles. This finding confirms that
tax considerations do provide powerful incentives for intangible firms' debt to be held in
THFC. It suggests a complementarity between tax arbitrage and asset intangibility, which
is central to the model we present in the next section where intangible asset intensive firms
issue debt in TFHC.



3     A Model of Multinationals and Risky Funding
Our data have highlighted that, for privately held securities, the recent raise in US imbalances
has been accompanied by a shift in flows toward THFC and by an increase in the risk of
the assets held there. We have also shown that tax avoidance and regulatory arbitrage
are two key factors that contributed to the increase in holdings by THFC and the shift in


                                                      24
THFC holdings towards riskier firms. We conjecture that the increase in global savings in
a world of tax differences and where securities can be intermediated by funds not subject
to capital regulations can explain the double occurrence of profit shifting and the increased
risk. Motivated by this we develop a simple model that captures the main elements described
above and that can rationalize the contemporaneous shift toward THFC and riskier assets.
In the model, heterogeneous firms, in the tradition of Melitz (2003), are combined with a
moral hazard contracting problem along the lines of Martinez-Miera and Repullo (2017).
       In the model, multinationals, heterogeneous in their default probabilities, endogenously
choose, against the payment of an entry cost, to shift profits to a THFC, where they enjoy
a lower tax rate.25 A subsidiary in the THFC allows a multinational to shift profits and to
issue debt through global intermediaries located in unregulated THFC. The entry condition
determines the default threshold for the marginal firm which enters the THFC. Those firms
operate under monopolistic competition, producing varieties which are then aggregated into
a single homogeneous good consumed by households. Each variety is obtained by assembling
intermediate inputs produced within different units of the conglomerate. To produce those
intermediate goods, the conglomerate needs to invest. Investment is funded through risky
debt obtained from global intermediaries. Firms set prices by applying a markup over
marginal cost, where the latter reflect the cost of loan services.
       Global intermediaries have access to a global liquid market of risk-neutral investors that
enjoy a light regulation and can offer funds at low costs. Loan spreads and monitoring
intensity are chosen based on an incentive-compatible contract that affects firms' default
probability and risk. The endogenous choice of monitoring intensity determines both the
extensive (how many firms are monitored) and the intensive margins (how much each firm
is monitored) of monitoring, hence firms' risk. In equilibrium some of the domestic firms
will enter the tax havens; of those entering some are monitored according to their default
probability and some are not; the optimal degree of monitoring for each firm (intensive
margin) will depend upon the safe return paid to global investors and the cost of monitoring.
       Equipped with this model, we examine the impact of an increase in global liquidity,
  25
   Beyond our own facts, there is extensive empirical evidence on the relevance of profit shifting, see e.g.
Guvenen et al. (2017) or Liu et al. (Forthcoming)).



                                                    25
that would fund U.S. imbalances, on the distribution of firms entering the THFC and on
the extensive and intensive margin of risk. A fall in debt costs, triggered for instance by
an exogenous increase in global liquidity channeled through the intermediaries, raises firms'
profits. This has two contemporaneous effects. First, a higher fraction of firms can afford
to enter the THFC. This shifts the distribution of firms that enter the THFC toward those
with higher default probability and generates a novel "risk selection" effect. Second, more
profitable firms appear elusively safer and global intermediaries endogenously reduce their
monitoring intensity, both at the extensive and the intensive margin. This result is consistent
with the fact that the increase in U.S. global imbalances, triggered by a global saving glut,
went together with an increase in the size and riskiness of THFC holdings.


3.1       Model Structure

There are two countries, a large country, F, and a tax haven. We will continue to use the
label THFC. For simplicity, we assume that firms can only produce in the large country. In
the large country, there are two sectors, one producing a homogeneous good that serves as
the numeraire, and one sector with heterogeneous firms producing different varieties.
       Firms are heterogeneous with respect to their default risk and endogenously decide
whether to become multinationals. This requires opening an affiliate in the THFC. Firms
have a fixed cost of entering the THFC, where they benefit from tax savings through profit
shifting.
       Given the heterogeneity in default probabilities, only a fraction of them opens an affiliate
in the THFC. Production is funded through risky debt, whose rate is determined within
an incentive compatible contract with a global intermediary. The latter chooses monitoring
intensity endogenously (see Martinez-Miera and Repullo (2017)). Riskier firms pay higher
credit spreads, with the latter given by the safe rate plus a premium related to the monitoring
intensity. Lenders are global funds located in the THFC, which collect savings worldwide
and issue corporate debt to multinationals.26
  26
   It is possible to include in the model banks operating in the large country. However, to the extent that
banks are subject to regulatory requirements, they would be offering less competitive lending conditions
compared to unregulated global funds. The latter can also access savings world-wide. In equilibrium,
multinationals will only seek funds from the global funds located in off-shore places and banks of the large

3.1.1     Consumers' Preferences

There is a unit mass of identical workers that share the same quasi-linear preferences over
consumption of the two goods:

of risk, r, which denotes their probability of default and which is distributed according to
F (r) = ( rrh ) .


3.1.2     Production of Each Variety

To produce varieties each entrepreneur r has to invest in intermediate inputs. Within the
firm, there are several units that assemble the intermediate inputs. The units have a pro-
ductivity p , which is distributed according to g (p ) = a (p )-( +1) with a > 0 and  > 0.
Each unit of intermediate input has a price Rp and each unit of the firm transforms one unit
of intermediate input into p units of the final good variety. Only units for which p > Rp
will operate. Hence, given an aggregate supply of intermediate inputs, xp , we have that:

                                           
                                               g (p )dp = a(Rp )- = xp ,                                (3)

Investment is funded through loans whose returns are derived from the contractual agreement
described in the next section. Given the return on debt, Rb , the mass of firms that operate
is obtained by the condition Rb = R(xp ). To solve the model, we will use the market clearing
condition between the aggregate demand for investment and the aggregate supply of savings.


3.2    Firms' Pricing Decision

In the homogeneous good sector, firms produce with a constant returns to scale technology
and earn zero profits. In the differentiated good sector, firms produce different varieties
under monopolistic competition, funding production with debt. Firms are heterogeneous in
their riskiness or probability of default, r, which determines the loan rate they pay, according
to the contractual agreement derived in the next section. The probability of default implies
that firms' revenues are stochastic:
                            
                            R          with probability        1-r+m
                            
                       
                       R=                                                                   (5)
                            0          with probability            r-m
                            


where R > 0 are firms' revenues, r  (0, 1) which is distributed according to the density
F (r), and m  [0, p] is the bank's monitoring intensity. Monitoring reduces the default
probability, but, as we discuss later, it entails a convex cost for the lender. Firms' costs of
loans, Rb (r), are heterogeneous and depend upon the firm's default probability. The exact
relation is derived within the contractual agreement solved in the next section.
   Under monopolistic competition, firms optimally charge a constant mark-up over mar-
ginal cost:
                                                
                                       p(r) =      Rb (r)                                   (6)
                                                -1
Firms profits are given by expected revenues, (1 - r + m)p(r)q (r), minus the cost of debt:


                              (r) = (1 - r + m)p(r)q (r) - Rb (r)                           (7)


                                                28
Post-tax profits are given by  E (r) = (1 - t) (r). The marginal tax rate will depend upon
the location of a firm's profits, which is determined endogenously further below. Entering
the tax haven entails lower taxes, and this provides the incentives for firms to enter, but also
entails an entry cost. We discuss the sorting of firms across locations further below.


3.2.1   Debt Rate and Firms' Risk--The Contractual Agreement

Firms are funded by an intermediary that raises funds globally. There is a large set of
risk-neutral investors and a representative risk-neutral intermediary. The latter does not
necessarily represent traditional banks, but can also be thought of as a mutual fund that
sells credit in the market. The intermediary extends debt to firms, but in turn, needs to raise
funds from foreign investors, which are characterized by an infinitely elastic supply of funds
at an expected safe return equal to RS . Intermediary monitoring entails a convex cost, c(m).
Note that since the contract structure applies equally to all firms, for notational convenience
since now on we omit the dependence of the loan rates on firms' default distribution.
   The firms' debt rate, Rb , is determined within an optimal contract between the inter-
mediary and the firm on one side and the intermediary and the international investors on
the other. For this, we follow Martinez-Miera and Repullo (2017). In the optimal contract,
intermediaries choose the monitoring intensity, m, as well as the rate to offer to investors to
maximize the expected profit, net of returns to investors, RI , given intermediaries' incentive
compatibility constraint and the participation constraints of intermediaries and investors.
Therefore the optimal contract reads as follows:


                             max [(1 - r + m)(Rb - RI ) - c(m)]                             (8)
                             {RI ,m}


subject to the intermediaries' incentive compatibility constraint:


                      m = arg max {[(1 - r + m)(Rb - RI
                                                      
                                                        ) - c(m)]} ,                        (9)
                                   m



the intermediaries' participation constraint:


                              (1 - r + m )(Rb - RI
                                                 
                                                   ) - c(m)  0                             (10)

                                                29
and the international investors' participation constraint:


                                     (1 - r + m )RI
                                                  
                                                     RS                                  (11)


   The incentive compatibility constraint (9) characterizes the intermediary's choice of mon-
itoring m , given the rate on the intermediary's external funds, RI , and the loan rate, Rb .
The participation constraints (10) and (11) ensure that the intermediary makes profits in
excess of the market outside option, and net of the monitoring cost, and that international
investors get the required expected return on their investment.


3.2.2   Monitoring Intensity--Extensive and Intensive Margin of Risk

The debt contract can be solved sequentially and by backward induction to deliver the loan
rate and the equilibrium monitoring. The latter is defined by an extensive and an intensive
margin. In equilibrium some firms will be monitored according to their default probability
and some will not. The monitoring threshold will determine the extensive margin of risk,
that is how many firms are not monitored. The degree according to which each firm is
monitored, namely the intensive margin, will depend upon the return on global liquidity and
the cost of monitoring. Finally, the optimal debt rate is a function of firms' risk or default
probability. First, intermediaries choose the monitoring intensity. The first order condition
to equation (9) delivers the incentive-compatible schedule linking monitoring intensity to the
bank margins:
                                           
                                    (Rb - RI ) - c (m ) = 0                              (12)

Given the return on outside funds that satisfies investors' participation constraint:

                                                   RS
                                      RI =                                               (13)
                                              (1 - r + m )

we can re-write (12) as follows:

                                               RS
                                   Rb =                + c (m)                           (14)
                                          (1 - r + m )



                                                30
The latter allows us to determine the loan rate for monitored firms, which will vary according
to their type, r. To determine the loan rate we also assume contestability. By the latter, an
intermediary lending to entrepreneurs of type p = 0 sets a rate equal to the safe return, RS ,
since at a lower rate it will make negative profits and at a higher rate it will be undercut by
another intermediary. Similarly, for all other firms the loan rate will be set at the minimum
given by equation (14). The convexity of the monitoring cost function implies that a corner
solution with zero monitoring materializes when c (0) - (1R S
                                                          -r)2
                                                                0. The latter condition also
determines a cut-off:
                                                        RS
                                        r =1-                                                (15)
                                                       c (0)

below which firms are not monitored as considered safe by the global intermediary. Above the
cut-off firms are monitored according to their probability of default. The default threshold

r defines the extensive margin of risk. The intensive margin of risk or the monitoring
                                                                    
intensity of each project is either zero or positive, when r > r. For monitored firms the
optimal monitoring intensity, m , is obtained by taking first order condition of 14, upon
assuming the following cost function, c(m) = k (m)2 :

                                                          RS
                                    m = r -        1-                                        (16)

Equation 16 provides the intensive margin of risk. To sum up, monitoring intensity is
given by

3.2.3   Endogenous Internationalization and Risk Distribution of Entrants

Firms which become a multinational face an entry cost,  . Whether the firm will interna-
tionalize depends upon the tax saving and its level of profits. Let us define the `profit shifting
cutoff cost level' as the cost level r , for which a firm is indifferent between paying taxes




                                                  31
at home and paying taxes in the tax haven. The cut-off, r
                                                        ~, is determined by the following
condition:

                                                                        
(1 - tF
      i ) [(1 - r + m )p(r )q (~
                               r) - Rb (~    r)] = (1 - tH
                                        r)q (~           i ) [(1 - r + m )p(~    r) - Rb (~
                                                                            r)q (~        r)q (~
                                                                                               r)] + 
                                                                                                (18)
   Using the optimal pricing equation, 6, the above equation leads to:

      i ) (1 - r + m )               r) -  = (1 - tH

                                                                                           r)
                          -1                                                    -1
                                                                                          (19)
                                                      RS
   When substituting the expression for Rb =       (1-r+m )
                                                              + c (m ), one can recover the default
threshold of the firm that is indifferent between opening an affiliate in the THFC or not.
The threshold, r
               ~, identifies the fraction of risky firms that enter the THFC:


               
               (1 - tF                     
                     i ) (1 - r + m )           - 1 Rb (~
                                                        r) -         when        r<r

                                           -1
       (r) =                                                                                    (20)
               (1 - tH ) (1 - r + m )
                                           
                                                - 1 Rb (~
                                                        r)            when       r>r
                                                                                   ~
                     i                     -1


   After substituting the loan rate from equation 14, the default threshold for entrants is
determined by the following condition:

                                
                  (tH    F
                    i - ti )                      ~ + m ))c (m )) = 
                                   - 1 (RS + (1 - r                                             (21)
                                -1

where m is given by equation 16.
   Note that the risk distribution of firms and the extensive margin of risk derived in the
model find a mapping in our data, more specifically with the density distribution shown in
figure 12. In there we have shown that the average risk of firms has increased over time.
In the model this would correspond to a decline in the share of monitored firms. Also the
density of risk seems to be less diversified in THFC, in other words riskier firms are more
concentrated in there. An additional goal of our model would be to replicate those facts.

3.2.4   Global Market Clearing of Debt and Equilibrium

Global demand and supply of debt clears to satisfy the following market clearing condition:

                                                          1

                                                                      )dr = w,                            (22)

where w is the exogenous amount of worldwide wealth and where xp = R-1 (Rp
                                                                         
                                                                           ) is the inverse
             
of R(xp ) = Rp . Given the equilibrium conditions of the model we will now conduct some
comparative static exercises, examining how a fall in the corporate tax, in regulation costs
of global banks and in entry costs of the THFC or a fall in the debt costs can impact the
share of firms endogenously entering the THFC and the extensive and intensive margin of
risk.

    The structure of the model can be summarized in figure 13 below. Below we examine
the implications of the model and how it can replicate empirical stylized facts in two steps.

                                                              33
First, we derive analytically some comparative static exercises by examining the responses
of the risk distribution of entrants and the risk margins (intensive and extensive) to changes
in corporate taxes and regulation costs in the THFC and to the cost of global funds. Next,
we present some simulations that allows us to graphically visualize the same relations for
empirically reasonable parameters.


3.2.5   A Raise in Global Savings Shifts: Profit Shifting and Risk

The growth in U.S. liabilities is associated with an increase in global saving. The latter in
turn reduces the level of long-term real interest rate (Bernanke (2005)) and affects financial
risk (Summers (2014)). Our evidence uncovered that much of those asset flows are chan-
nelled through THFC and are associated with higher risk indicators. Our model can shed
light on the connection between the shift of the flows to the THFC and the increase in debt
risk.


Proposition 1. In presence of a tax advantage, an increase in global savings, which induces
a fall in RS : i) raises the fraction of entrants and shifts its distribution toward riskier firms;
ii) it also increases risk at the intensive and extensive margin.


                                                        
Proof. Since R (xp ) < 0 and since Rp is decreasing in RS we have:

                                       dRS      1
                                           =      
                                                     <0                                       (23)
                                        dw   F (RS )

From equation 21 a decline in RS induces an increase in r
                                                        ~, hence a larger fraction of firms
shifts profits and the distribution of entrants shifts toward riskier ones. This proves part a.
Also an increase in the supply of global savings leads to an increase in investment (visible
from xp = R-1 (Rp
                
                  )) and a fall in the loan rate as per equation:

                                              RS
                                  Rb =                + c (m )                                (24)
                                         (1 - r + m )




                                                34
It also leads to an increase in the number of firms that are not monitored, as per equation
                 RS
r =1-          c (m )
                      .   This leads to an increase in the extensive margin of risk. Finally, a fall in
the safe rate leads to a decrease in the monitoring intensity. To see this total differentiation
of equation 24 leads to:

                            dm               1                          RS
                               S
                                 = - (           
                                                    )[ c"
                                                          ( m  ) -             2
                                                                                 ]-1                    (25)
                            dR         (1 - p + m )                (1 - p + m )

The latter is negative if the cost of monitoring is convex. The joint increase of non-monitored
firms and the fall in monitoring intensity leads to an increase in risk. So an increase in global
liquidity coupled with a tax arbitrage induces more and riskier firms to enter the tax haven
and also reduces the extensive and the intensive margin of monitoring.


To sum up a reduction in debt costs, due to an increase in global funds, allows us to ration-
alize why the increasing U.S. global imbalances has been also increasingly associated with
shifts of flows and risk toward THFC.27 Indeed, an increase in global liquidity intermediated
through mutual funds resident in tax havens induces firms to create an affiliate in a THFC.
The increase in liquidity raises firms' profits for two reasons. First, it directly lowers loan
spreads due to increased liquidity supply. Second, it lowers firms' tax bills due to increased
profit shifting. The ensuing boost in profits induces global intermediaries to economize on
monitoring. This in turn results in an ex post increase of firms' default risk.


3.2.6       Simulations of the Model

In this section we run some model simulation to graphically visualize the above derived
relations for empirically reasonable parameters. Specifically we solve the model for different
values of the global safe rate.
        Figure 14 shows the results. The left panel shows the responses of the entry threshold,
   27
    Note that changes in taxes alone do not unambiguously lead to entry of more risky firms due to two
opposing effects. One the one hand, the tax advantage might induce riskier firms to enter. However,
intermediaries would in turn adjust their monitoring intensity and transfer the higher monitoring costs
onto loan rates. This second effect might neutralize the tax advantage. In the model the elasticity in
monitoring intensity depends upon the assumed cost function. The results are consistent to the fact that is
the combination of the increase in global savings in a world of tax differences that lead to riskier firms in
THFC. Lower entry costs have similar unambiguous effects.


                                                      35
                       Figure 14. Simulation: Changes in Global Safe Rates




 Left panel shows the responses of the entry threshold and the monitoring threshold to change in in safe
rates. Right panel show changes in the relation between monitoring intensity and default probability with
                                     respect to changes in safe rate.

                                         
r
~, and of the monitoring threshold, r, to change in in safe rates, RS . The right panel show
changes in the relation between monitoring intensity and default probability with respect
                                                        
to changes in safe rate. Below the threshold, r, monitoring intensity is zero. Above it,
monitoring intensity increases with the firms' default probability, r. In line with our results
in Proposition 1, a fall in the global safe rate raises the entry threshold (left panel) and
thus shifts the distribution of entrants toward riskier firms. It also raises the monitoring
threshold, implying that the fraction of firms which is not monitored raises. This increases
the extensive margin of risk. And at last, it reduces the monitoring intensity (right panel)
for each project above the monitoring threshold. Note however that the largest effects come
from the shifts in entrants' distributions and from the increase in the extensive margin of
risk.



4       Conclusions
The U.S. global imbalances are a well-known macro trend in international finance. Their
growth is even more puzzling in light of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. A large and influential
literature has addressed the macro determinants of the capital flows and of the global financial
and dollar cycle. Less is known on the micro determinants that explain the direction of the


                                                   36
flows toward specific locations and the riskiness of those assets.
   Using confidential and highly granular data from U.S. residents and foreign residents
holdings of U.S. dollar-denominated assets, we uncover a set of new facts. Private holdings
(inflows and outflows) are mainly intermediated through tax havens/ financial centers, have
increased at around 2010, namely the year of the Dodd-Frank Act and the tightening of
regulation in the most industrialized countries, and are largely intermediated by unregulated
mutual funds. Furthermore, assets intermediated through THFC are riskier and pay higher
Sharpe ratios. These assets are mainly linked to firms operating in intangible-intensive
sectors. The remaining bulk of the flows is represented by holdings of the official sector. The
latter invested mainly in safe assets, such as treasuries, and its holdings grew at around 2012,
in correspondence with the world-wide expansion of liquidity associated with quantitative
easing policies.
   Motivated by the above facts we conduct an empirical analysis at country and sector
level. While we confirm that some of the traditional global and dollar cycle variables, such
as uncertainty indicators, play a role at country level, we find that much of the flows at
sector level are explained by corporate tax differentials and asset intangibility.
   We rationalize the connection between the growing flows of private holdings toward tax
havens and the higher risk of these assets in a model which combines endogenous firms' entry
into tax havens and endogenous monitoring intensity by global intermediaries. We introduce
firms' heterogeneity at the level of firms' default probabilities, hence their riskiness. In the
model, an increase in global savings, by reducing the cost of debt and raising firms profits,
induces more of them to enter tax havens. Contemporaneously, more profitable firms appear
elusively safe and this induces global intermediaries to reduce their monitoring intensity, a
decision which ex post raises firms' default probability.

Notes : This table presents regression results on the aggregate flows into U.S. assets from abroad on monthly
changes in a set of macro controls. The dependent variable is the ratio of foreign private purchases of a type
of U.S. asset over the previous month's holdings of that asset by foreign private investors. Excess BP is the
Excess Bond Premium. Fed Funds R. is the Federal Funds rate or the Wu-Xia shadow rate during the zero
lower bound period. VRP US is the variance risk premium as in Londono and Zhou (2017). The treasury
basis is from Du et al. (2018). EMBI is the emerging market bond index spread. The sample runs at a
monthly frequency from 2002 to 2018. See the data appendix for details. Robust standard errors are shown
in parentheses. Key: *** significant at 1%; ** 5%; * 10%.

B     The Treasury International Capital (TIC) Report-
      ing System

B.1     Overview

The TIC (Treasury International Capital) system collects data on cross-border banking and
securities positions and flows. These data form the basis for U.S. official balance of payments
and international investment position data on portfolio investment, and are also used in the
Federal Reserve's Financial Accounts (Z.1 release) data on rest-of-world portfolio positions
and flows. Reporting is legally mandated.
    For securities positions and flows, the primary TIC forms are: the TIC S, which has
collected data monthly on gross and net long-term securities transactions by instrument
and counterparty since the late 1970s; the annual TIC surveys, which have collected data
on individual securities since the early 2000s; the TIC-SLT, which has collected monthly
aggregate data on long-term securities positions by instrument and counterparty since late
2011; and the TIC BL-2, which has collected--along with custodial banking data--holdings
of short-term securities by instrument and counterparty monthly since the late 1970s.
    Responsibility for the TIC system is shared by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. The Treasury oversees the
TIC system and publishes a wide variety of tables and reports. The Federal Reserve Bank of
New York is responsible for the primary collection and review of the data, and the Federal
Reserve Board of Governors is responsible for additional data review, data adjustments, and
production and dissemination of TIC tables and reports. Board of Governors staff with
direct responsibility for TIC production have access to much more detailed breakdowns of
the data than are available in the published data, and much of the data used in this paper
relies on these unpublished breakdowns.


B.2     TIC Annual Surveys

TIC annual surveys collect security-level data on U.S. residents' debt and equity claims
against foreign residents (that is, foreign securities held by U.S. residents) and on U.S. debt


                                              46
and equity liabilities to foreign residents (that is, U.S. securities held by foreign residents).
Liabilities surveys are conducted each year as of end-June and claims surveys are conducted
each year as of end-December. Data are collected from U.S. -resident custodians, issuers,
and end-investors, and reporting is mandated by law.
       TIC benchmark surveys are conducted every five years (most recently in 2016 for claims
and in 2019 for liabilities); in other years, the reporting panels are limited to the largest
reporters and typically capture 98% or more of the benchmark reporting. The findings of
these surveys are typically published ten months after each reporting date.28 .


B.3        TIC Monthly Securities Holdings Data

The TIC-SLT, the newest form, was introduced in late 2011 to improve timeliness and
frequency of securities holdings data. While in principle it should be possible to estimate
positions based on holdings in the prior period, reported transactions from the TIC-S, and
estimated price changes, experience had shown that this approach applied to annual TIC
survey data rarely produced position information that corresponded to the findings of the
following annual TIC survey. As a result, reliable data on securities holdings were available
only at a low frequency and with very long lags. In addition to providing much more timely
data on securities positions, the TIC-SLT allows for estimation of flows based on the change
in TIC-SLT position, estimated valuation change, and any other changes. In the context
of this paper, it should be noted that the introduction of the TIC-SLT included a great
deal of outreach to managed funds, and resulted in an increase in TIC reporting for these
firms, many of which are domiciled in the Cayman Islands. As a result, increases in Cayman
Islands positions between the 2011 and 2012 annual surveys include some effects from this
increase in reporting.


B.4        Estimating securities flows from position data

As noted above, combining TIC-S data with annual survey positions and estimated price
changes in order to estimate positions for the following survey rarely produce figures that
  28
    TIC annual securities reports and the data collection forms are available at the Treasury's TIC website:
https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/fpis.aspx


                                                    47
match the following year's survey. As a result, Bertaut and Tryon (2007) developed a method
for estimating intra-year positions. Another option for estimating flows is then to calculate
flows as [change in estimated position] less price change. We use these flow estimates, and
their analogues based on monthly SLT data in this paper.


B.5     Public and Confidential Data

As noted above, compilers of the TIC data at the Federal Reserve Board have access to
more detailed breakdowns of the data than are published, and many of the calculations
shown here use these confidential breakdowns. For the aggregate data, most notably we are
able to separate securities liabilities (foreign holdings of U.S. securities) by country and also
by type of holder--foreign official or foreign private. On the claims side, we are able to break
bond positions and flows down by country and also by type of issuer--again foreign official
or foreign private (nearly always corporate).


B.6     Direct Investment

The TIC data do not include direct investment. The Bureau of Economic Analysis, part of
the Department of Commerce, conducts a direct investment survey.



C     Empirical Analysis

C.1     Macro Determinants of Capital Flows: Global Financial and
        Dollar Cycle

The empirical specification below revisits the classical analysis featured in the literature on
the global financial cycle. Our benchmark regression specification takes the following form:

                                       i,a
                                  f lowt   = B Xt + t ,                                     (26)

                                   i,a
where the dependent variable, f lowt   , is the ratio of the capital flows in each asset class
a (treasuries, equities or corporate bonds for U.S. liabilities; long-term debt and equities

                                                48
for U.S. claims) for investor type i (foreign official or foreign private for U.S. liabilities) in
month t over the previous month's position for that asset class and investor. Xt is a set
of macro controls, which include the growth rate of the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), the
change in the excess bond premium (from Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012)), the Fed Funds
rate (or the Wu-Xia shadow rate during the zero-lower-bound period), the U.S. term spread,
the quarterly U.S. unemployment outlook from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the
Federal Reserve Broad Dollar index, the U.S. variance risk premium, VRP (from Londono
and Zhou (2017)), the 3-month Treasury basis (from Du et al. (2018)), the emerging markets
bond index spread (EMBI), and the oil price. The VIX is taken as a measure of risk and
the VRP as a measure of uncertainty. More details on the variables' definitions are in the
data Appendix.
      The baseline sample for U.S. liabilities is at a monthly frequency for the years 2003 to
2018, while the baseline sample for U.S. claims is from 2002 to 2018.29 Monthly flows are
constructed from survey reports following the procedures developed in Bertaut and Tryon
(2007). We present, for each dependent variable, each variable entered one at a time in
the regression in the first column and then all variables in the same regression in the next
column. One well known caveat of those specifications is that some of those variables might
be multi-colinear. This is one additional reason for interpreting those results with caution.
      Table 1 shows results for private foreign holdings of U.S. securities. Equities and corporate
debt respond to some of the global financial cycle variables, while treasuries are unresponsive.
This is well in line with our previous observation that the private sector mainly holds equities
and debt, hence it is plausible that these flows are the most responsive. They seem to respond
solely to the VIX, the VRP and the EMBI, both for liabilities and claims (shown in Table 3).
In other words, the equity and debt demand declines when risk and uncertainty rise. Private
flows seem to be unresponsive to numerous other financial cycle and macro variables. This
suggest that other, rather micro determinants, might be affecting private flows -- a fact that
we examine in the next section.
      Table 2 shows results for holdings of U.S. securities of the foreign official sector for all
asset classes. In this case, it is mostly treasuries which react to some of the global financial
 29
      As mentioned, we try to use the longest "modern" series which differs slightly in collection dates.


                                                      49
cycle variables. During our time period and frequency, in general, they fall when the VIX
and the VRP rise, or when the unemployment outlook and the EMBI spread worsen. Hence,
when US risk and uncertainty raise, the official sector reduces its holdings. U.S. treasuries
also respond to changes in the dollar exchange rate. This last result is in line with traditional
motives of reserve management.
    The effects from the risk and uncertainty measures on flows are economically meaningful.
For example, a one standard deviation increase in the VIX (0.18 points) leads to additional
sales of U.S. equity by foreign private investors of $3.24 billion or 0.1 percent of total asset
holdings. A one standard deviation increase in the dollar (1.4 points) leads to sales of $5.8
billion or 0.18 percent. Looking at foreign official investors, a one standard deviation increase
in the dollar would lead to sales of $7.3 billion of Treasuries or 0.32 percent of their total
holdings.
    All in all, while we find a role for the macro determinants of the global financial cycle,
those variables alone cannot explain the shift of capital flows toward THFC. In light of the
above findings and of the facts uncovered in Section 2, we conjecture that the substantial
shift in private flows toward THFC was largely driven by other factors related to issuers'
and investors' incentives.

G      Simulation
Parameter choice follows past studies and experiment with different values to check the
robustness of our qualitative results. Monitoring costs values are taken from Martinez-Miera
and Repullo (2017). Risk free rates are in lone with annual T-bill rates. The baseline value
of the elasticity of variety is set to 5. This value is compatible with most New-Keynesian and
trade studies that use CES aggregators, as it generates a value of mark-up of 1.2. In some
IO studies, with different production function, the elasticity of substitution is usually around
2. While this value is less in line with our set-up, we experiment with it and confirm the
qualitative patterns in the model. In the U.S. current corporate tax rates are at 27 percent.
However effective tax rates are around 15 percent. We then allow an average distance from
various THFC tax rates of 10 percent. Table 9 summarizes the values.
