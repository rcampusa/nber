                                              ABSTRACT

Beginning in May 2009 we fielded a monthly Internet survey designed to measure total household
spending as the aggregate of about 40 spending components. This paper reports on a number of outcomes
from 30 waves of data collection. These outcomes include sample attrition, indicators of data quality
such as item nonresponse and the variance in total spending, and substantive results such as the trajectory
of total spending and the trajectories of some components of spending. We conclude that high-frequency
surveying for total spending is feasible and that the resulting data show expected patterns of levels
and change.

1. Introduction

        A very extensive battery of questions about spending along the lines of the Consumer
Expenditure Survey (CEX) is not feasible in a general purpose household survey because of space
limitations. In the absence of panel measures of total household spending a large number of empirical
papers have been based on the panel measure of food consumption in the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (PSID).1 However, food consumption as a proxy for total consumption has limitations for
some research questions: in the CEX the fraction of total consumption accounted for by food varies
with income and with age, making it difficult to estimate life-cycle models based on food
consumption.2 An example of measuring consumption with just a few questions – but more than one
– comes from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The first wave of
SHARE included these measures of consumption: Food consumed at home, food consumed outside
the home, telephoning, and total expenditure on non-durable goods and services.3 While the data on
food consumption was useful, the data on total nondurable consumption was deemed unreliable
(Browning and Madsen, 2005).
        As an approach that tries to strike a middle ground between the extensive detail collected in
the CEX and just collecting information on a handful of categories, the Health and Retirement Study
introduced the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS). Collecting total household
spending in a self-administered format (mail survey), the CAMS asks about spending in 36-38
categories and allows respondents to choose the length of the recall period (last month, last 12
months) for most categories. The self-administered nature of the survey has the advantage that
respondents can take the time to think about their answers, even consult records if they are so
inclined, without the social pressure arising from the presence of an interviewer. Hurd and
Rohwedder (2009) show that obtaining useful spending data in a reduced number of spending
categories is feasible. The spending totals aggregate quite closely to CEX totals and the age patterns
of saving derived from the CAMS data (taking total income minus taxes minus spending) are quite
close to the age patterns of savings implied by data on wealth change (Hurd and Rohwedder (2011).

  The last item on this list included a number of cues, prompting respondents to include ‘groceries, utilities,
transportation, clothing, entertainment, out-of-pocket medical expenses and any other expenses the household may have
and to exclude housing payments (rent or mortgage), housing maintenance, and the purchase of large items such as cars,
televisions, jewelry and furniture.’ (p. 318, Browning and Madsen, 2005).


                                                                                                                         2
       However, whenever respondents are asked to recall their spending over a long period of time
(say, one year), recall error becomes very important (Hurd and Rohwedder, 2009). This observation
gave rise to the idea of attempting high-frequency elicitation of spending. Building on our
experience with the CAMS data, we designed a spending module that we administered as part of the
Financial Crisis Surveys that we were conducting in early 2009 in the RAND American Life Panel.
The timing for a high-frequency elicitation of spending seemed particularly suitable in view of the
high volatility in the economic environment which would make it likely that spending would be more
volatile than usual as well. In fact, back in November 2008, just shortly after the large and sudden
drops in the stock markets, about 75% of all households interviewed in the ALP reported reductions
in spending in response to the economic crisis.

       In this paper we describe in detail our survey methods, including an important innovation –
the spending reconciliation screen – designed to catch large outliers that can be more frequent in self-
administered surveys, for example, due to typos, and no interviewer to verify unusually large
numbers. The reconciliation screen allows respondents to review all of their entries and the resulting
total on one screen. Beyond the catching and self-correction of outliers the reconciliation screen also
allows respondents to fine tune their entries, most likely reducing the noise in the data and leading to
more accurate reports overall. Section 2 provides background on the American Life Panel, the
Financial Crisis Surveys and the specifics of the design of the spending survey module. Section 3
reviews unit and item response rates, and various other indicators of data quality. Section 4
concludes.




2. Data and Survey Design


2.1 The American Life Panel
The American Life Panel (ALP) is an ongoing Internet panel survey operated and maintained by
RAND Labor and Population. It covers the U.S. population age 18 and over. Those who do not have
access to the Internet at the time of recruitment are provided with a Web TV (www.webtv.com/pc/),
including an Internet access subscription with an e-mail account. Accordingly the sample does not




                                                                                                       3
suffer from selection due to a lack of Internet access.4 Post-stratification weights are provided so that
after weighting, the ALP approximates the distributions of age, sex, ethnicity, education, and income
in the Current Population Survey. About twice a month, respondents receive an email request to visit
the ALP website to complete questionnaires that typically take no more than 30 minutes to finish.
Respondents are paid an incentive of about $20 per 30 minutes of survey time, and pro-rated
accordingly for shorter surveys. Response rates are typically between 75 and 85% of the enrolled
panel members, depending on the topic, the time of year, and how long a survey is kept in the field.


           Since inception of the American Life Panel in 2006, there have been four sample recruitment
efforts. In this paper we report on high-frequency data collections that were part of the so-called
Financial Crisis Surveys, covering the period from November 2008 following the onset of the turmoil
in the U.S. financial markets, up to the latest survey that was completed in October 2011. Back in
2008 the majority of active ALP panel members had been recruited from the University of Michigan
Survey Research Center’s Monthly Survey (MS). The MS incorporates the long-standing Survey of
Consumer Attitudes and produces the Index of Consumer Expectations. The MS survey is
considered to have good population representation (Curtin, Presser, and Singer, 2005).


2.2 The Financial Crisis Surveys
           The very large stock market declines in October 2008 prompted our first financial crisis data
collection. We designed a survey that was administered to the ALP in November 2008. The survey
covered a broad range of topics, including various dimensions of life satisfaction, self-reported health
measures and indicators of affect, labor force status, retirement expectations, recent actual job loss
and chances of future job loss, housing, financial help (received and given and expectations about
these), stock ownership and value (including recent losses); recent stock transactions (actual and
expected over the next 6 months); expectations about future stock market returns (one year ahead, 10
years ahead); spending changes; credit card balances and changes in the amounts carried over; impact
of the financial crisis on retirement savings; and expectations about future asset accumulation. We
followed up with a second longitudinal interview in late February 2009 covering approximately the
same topics.



4
    This approach has been used successfully in the Dutch CentER panel for many years.


                                                                                                           4
         In our first survey (November 2008) 73 percent of households reported they had reduced
spending because of the economic crisis. These spending reductions are of substantial policy and
scientific interest, and so there is considerable value in a careful measurement of the magnitude of the
reductions. For example the welfare implications of the crisis depend partially on the reduction in
consumption. Furthermore, because of the lack of knowledge of how spending responds to economic
shocks at high frequency, it is important to establish the empirical connection between the triggering
events and the magnitude of consumption reductions. The wide-spread spending reductions prompted
us to re-orient the survey, expanding the collection of information on the components of spending.
         Beginning with the May 2009 interview we established a monthly interview schedule to
reduce the risk of recall error about spending and to collect data at high frequency on items such as
employment, satisfaction, mood, affect and expectations. An objective was to permit detailed
sequencing of events and their consequences.5
         Each month we ask about spending in 25 categories during the previous month.                         Every third
month beginning in July 2009 we ask about spending during the previous three months on an
additional 11 categories plus seven big-ticket items. Spending in these categories tends to be less
frequent such as durables. Taken together, the monthly and quarterly surveys measure total spending
over a three-month period. The categories that are queried monthly amount to about 60% of total
quarterly spending and the categories that are queried every three months account for the remaining
40%. This three-month schedule of two shorter monthly surveys and a longer quarterly survey has
continued to the present.6
         These surveys have several unique aspects. The first and most obvious is that they are
monthly panel surveys. This design permits the observation of the immediate effects of changes in
the economic environment that cannot be captured in low frequency surveys via retrospection. A
second unique aspect is our measurement of a large fraction of total spending on a monthly basis.
This measurement reduces recall bias for high frequency purchases, yet because the surveys cover an
entire year, this measurement also captures low frequency purchases. The use of a reconciliation
screen in the consumption module, described in detail below, reduces noise in the spending data

5
  To further reduce recall error the survey is only available to respondents for the first 10 days of each month, with only
minor variation (e.g. adding the weekend if the 10th falls on a Friday or to accommodate staff work schedules when the
beginning or end of the survey coincides with a major holiday such as New Year). Thus state variables such as
unemployment refer to approximately the first 10 days of a month, not the entire month.
6
  Information about the surveys is given in Appendix Table 1, including survey length, fielding schedule and response
rates.


                                                                                                                              5
substantially, allowing meaningful analyses even in a small sample. Furthermore, the combination of
spending data with a very rich set of covariates, elicited at high-frequency, allows for a wide variety
of analyses, with much more careful information on timing and sequencing of events to investigate
determinants and the effects.
       A total of 2,693 respondents participated in at least one of the 30 interviews from November
2008 through August 2011. The wave-to-wave retention rate has been consistently high throughout
this entire period, averaging 91.0 percent without showing any decline over time. Respondents are
invited to continue to participate in the surveys even if they miss one or more interviews resulting in
a higher retention rate across multiple waves than would be implied by the wave-to-wave retention
rate. For example, 73.0 percent (N=1,966) responded to at least ten of the first 14 interviews.
Beginning with wave 15, facing budgetary constraints, we had to restrict the sample and decided to
exclude the most sporadic respondents, dropping those who had responded to less than five of the
first fourteen interviews, leaving us with 2,338 eligible respondents. Since then another 30
respondents either requested to be dropped from the monthly surveys or they died.
       In this paper we use data from 30 surveys covering the period May 2009 through October
2011. Calculated over the eligible sample of 2,338 respondents retained since wave 15, we obtain a
unit response rate for the spending module that averages 81.7 percent (N=1911) in cross-section over
30 waves. In the interest of maintaining an adequate sample size while at the same time basing
results on an approximate panel sample, we present results for the sample of respondents who missed
at most four of the 30 interviews, resulting in an average sample size of 1,440 respondents per wave,
translating into an average unit response rate for this sample of 61.6 percent per wave. Restricting
the sample to those who completed the spending module in all 30 waves yields a unit response rate of
35.5 percent (N=829).


2.3. Eliciting Total Household Spending
Each month we asked about spending in 25 categories that are purchased at high to middle frequency
every month. Then, every three months we asked about the purchase over the past three months of
11 less frequently purchased categories, and about seven big-ticket items. With possibly a few minor
exclusions the total of the three monthly surveys and the quarterly survey add to total spending over
the quarter.




                                                                                                          6
        The 25 categories queried in the monthly surveys are shown in Appendix Table 2 grouped as
they would have been displayed.7 The grouping by broad types of spending or by frequency of
spending is meant to facilitate placement of reported amounts in the proper category: Respondents
are sometimes unsure about category placement and they are helped by seeing other possibly relevant
categories. The grouping should reduce the risk of either omission or double counting. For example,
the following categories were displayed at the same time because they are associated with household
operations.
                         Mortgage: interest & principal
                         Rent
                         Electricity
                         Water
                         Heating fuel for the home
                         Telephone, cable, Internet
                         Car payments: interest and principal

        A major innovation was the development of a “reconciliation” screen. Outliers are a problem
in self-administered data collection such as Internet interviewing because there is no interviewer to
question extreme values. Therefore, we designed a new strategy for the ALP to help reigning in
outliers: following the queries about spending last month on the 25 items we presented the
respondent with a summary table which listed the responses and added them to produce the implied
monthly spending total. The respondent was invited to review and edit any items. This produced two
very favorable results: most importantly, there was a sharp reduction in outliers which has a large
impact on standard errors of the total that is constructed as the sum of these 25 spending categories.
Also, respondents had the opportunity to improve the accuracy of their entries, including previously
missing entries which should reduce the noise in the data further. We give more details on these
outcomes in the next section. See Appendix Table 4 for a display of the reconciliation screen.
        A natural comparison with our method is the “Cash-Flow Reconciliation” method (Fricker,
Kopp and To, 2012) or the “balance edit” that has been used in the Canadian expenditure survey
(Brzozowski and Crossley, 2011). These approaches have the same objective as the reconciliation
screen of catching and correcting reporting errors. They compare household spending to the sum of
household income and net cash flows into and out of assets, and they challenge respondent reports
7
  In November 2010 (wave 21) we added another monthly category (“other transportation expenses”) in reaction to some
respondents indicating difficulties allocating some of their expenses.


                                                                                                                   7
when there are large discrepancies between the two. One disadvantage of this approach is that just a
fraction of respondents are challenged; yet, measurement error on income, spending or on both could
result in incorrectly challenging some respondents while incorrectly not challenging others. To the
extent that respondents are induced by a challenge to modify possibly correct reports, the procedure
will worsen the data of those incorrectly challenged. The reconciliation screen approach on the other
hand invites all respondents to review and possibly edit their answers and therefore avoids the risk of
misclassification due to measurement error. It is also worth noting that a comparison of spending
with income is not practical when the reference period is one month as is the case in the ALP
Financial Crisis Surveys. This is because the concept of after-tax-income in a month is not well
defined, and income is more likely to fluctuate across short time periods leading to potential
mismatches in the timing of the receipt of income and expenditures.




3. Results


3.1 Indicators of data quality
        In the first 10 days of May, 2009, about 2100 people responded to the survey, which was the
initial survey about spending. This number was fairly constant until wave 15 (May, 2010) when it
declined by about 300 persons. The main reason for the decline is that due to budgetary constraints
some infrequent responders were dropped from the survey.8 Since then the number of observations
has stabilized hovering between 1,750 and 1,850 observations. In a typical wave about 25 people
begin the survey but fail to complete it.


        The measurement of spending, which is the focus of this paper, is embedded in a longer
survey of the effects of the great recession. For the spending part of the survey only, the median time
for completion of the 25 monthly items, including time spent on the reconciliation screen, was about
3.3 minutes. 9 The median time to complete the additional quarterly items (10 items plus 7 big-ticket
items) was about 2.3 minutes.


8
  Many analyses will use the panel aspect of the survey to study change: Infrequent responders have less or no value in
such analyses.
9
  Mean times are not meaningful in a self-administered survey such as an Internet survey because respondents may
interrupt the survey without disconnecting.


                                                                                                                          8
         There is a very substantial age gradient: those age 65 or older take a little more than twice as
much time as those less than 40. As for the variation over time, completion times in the first several
waves were greater by roughly one minute than the typical median, but fairly quickly reached a
steady level.


         Item non-response is generally very low in the ALP and that holds also for the spending
items. Respondents have two opportunities to fill in initially missing answers: first, if someone
leaves a spending category blank an additional screen will appear asking the respondent to fill in the
missing item(s). Then, should the respondent ignore this prompt he or she can still provide the
missing value on the reconciliation screen. The average rate of remaining item non-response across
all waves and all 25 monthly categories is 0.4 percent. Examining the rate of item non-response
averaged across the 25 monthly categories by wave shows that this rate is fairly stable over time,
ranging between 0.2 and 0.5 percent in almost all waves.10 There is some variation across categories
of spending, but it is rather small. For example the category with the highest rate of item non-
response is “heating fuel for the home” (0.6 percent) compared to the lowest rate of 0.3 percent for
“telephone, cable, Internet.” In the reconciliation screen previously missing items are replaced with
the value $0. Respondents have the opportunity to correct this value on the reconciliation screen.
About 13 percent of initially missing values are updated from $0 on the reconciliation screen to a
positive value. In some cases it could be that the initial missing entry was due to the respondent not
having that type of spending or that the respondent left the entry blank, because s/he already
accounted for that type of spending elsewhere in the survey.11 If that was the case – and one could
argue that respondents affirmed this view by not updating the zeros on the reconciliation screen –
then no further imputation for missing values is required. This is the approach we apply in this study
when calculating total spending. Because the rates of item non-response are so low, any other
decision how to deal with missing information would not affect any of the statistics we present in a
material manner.




10
   The highest average rate of item nonresponse was recorded in August 2009 at 0.8 percent and the lowest in February
2011 at 0.1 percent.
11
   A conscientious respondent may feel hesitant entering a zero when s/he had that type of spending (i.e. it was not truly
zero), but had already included it elsewhere.


                                                                                                                             9
         The reconciliation screen invites the respondent to correct entries. In the initial wave that
elicited spending (May 2009), on average 1.8 percent of the entries were corrected (modified or
updated) by respondents (Figure 1). The rate of correction declined steadily until the survey
collected in February 2010. Since then it has fluctuated between 0.6 and 0.4 percent. Although this
may seem like a small rate of correction the effect on outliers can be substantial if the corrections are
for entries that are extreme. In the initial wave in May 2009, 17.0 percent of respondents altered at
least one entry on the reconciliation screen for the monthly items. Four waves later (September
2009), this group had declined to 7.6 percent and has stayed about that size since then. The average
rate of updating is smaller for the quarterly items when calculated over the entire population which is
mainly due to the fact that many more respondents have zero spending in those less frequent
quarterly items and those zeros are not usually updated.12 For the quarterly items the fraction of
respondents updating any quarterly spending items has hovered around its average size of just under
4 percent all along.


         The frequency and magnitude of outliers can be a problem in self-administered surveys
because there is no interviewer to question extreme values. The reconciliation screen is meant to
reduce this problem. A measure of the extent of the problem is the standard deviation of spending:
while some fraction of the measured standard deviation reflects true variation in spending across
individuals, some fraction is the result of measurement error and often it is the result of extreme
outliers. We compare the standard deviation of the sum of all monthly spending items based on
respondents’ initial reports prior to the reconciliation screen to the same measure based on
respondents’ updated reports. Averaging over all 30 waves we find that the standard deviation before
the reconciliation screen is 44% larger than after the reconciliation screen. However, even after
respondents’ own corrections from the reconciliation screen there remain a small number of large
outliers that dominate both the standard deviation before and the standard deviation after the
reconciliation screen in some of the waves. We therefore reviewed some of the largest remaining
outliers. For 22 very large values out of a total of 57,322 respondent-wave observations we then
edited the spending report that produced the outlier using respondent-specific information from



12
   Calculating the rate of updating conditional on positive entries (i.e. excluding the zeros) for the quarterly spending
items gives an average updating rate of 0.6 percent of entries per category.


                                                                                                                            10
adjacent waves. 13 We recomputed the standard deviation of total monthly spending based on initial
reports before the reconciliation screen and also for the reports after the reconciliation screen.
Figure 2 shows the standard deviation before and after the reconciliation screen conditional on the 22
edits.14 In the first two waves the reduction due to the reconciliation screen was very substantial:
from an average of $17.2 thousand to $3.0 thousand. In subsequent waves the reductions varied
between being very small in some waves and sizeable in others, depending on whether respondents
self-corrected some very large outliers. The average standard deviation (averaged over 30 waves and
calculated after the 22 outliers were edited) was 112 percent higher before the reconciliation screen
compared to after. This reduction will have a substantial effect on the standard errors in the
estimation of models of spending.


         Because the corrections induced by the reconciliation screen tend to involve large outliers, the
corrections will reduce mean values of spending. We present the effects of the corrections on the
mean (and the median) in Figures 3, 4 and 5 for the monthly items, the quarterly items and the
quarterly totals (monthly plus quarterly items). The statistics in these figures are unweighted and
cross-sectional to bring out the effect of the reconciliation screen.15 The main observation from these
figures is that the updates from the reconciliation screen do not affect measures of spending at the
median, but they result in lower population averages at the mean in those waves where large outliers
are caught.


Comparison with the Consumer Expenditure Survey

         The CEX has the most authoritative survey measure of spending at the household level. Yet
the level of spending as measured in the CEX is questioned because it is substantially less than
household spending as measured by the National Income and Product Accounts. Nonetheless we will
compare our measure of spending with that from the CEX because the CEX is a household survey
13
   The edited cases were identified usually as one particularly large outlier in a wave where comparisons with that
respondent’s reports in prior and/or subsequent waves suggested that there was an entry mistake. In most cases there was
a decimal error (e.g., $1,000 instead of $100). Both the initial report prior to the reconciliation screen and the updated
report were edited and the observation was included in the calculations for Figure 2.
14
   The standard deviation includes the total mortgage payment including repayment of principal because that is what is
displayed to the respondent on the reconciliation screen. In calculating actual spending we remove principal repayments
based on a follow-up question that queries the respondent about the different components of the mortgage payment
(amount for principal, interest, and other expenses).
15
   We have edited the 22 outliers as described above both in the initial reports (prior to reconciliation screen) and in the
reports after the reconciliations screen.


                                                                                                                         11
and aims for a complete measure of household spending using similar methods to ALP (although in
much greater detail). We choose the calendar year 2010 for this comparison as this is the first
complete year of monthly data on household spending in the ALP. 2010 is also the latest calendar
year for which published tables from the CEX are available. For ALP we calculate spending over a
year by summing all 25 monthly spending items from the 12 monthly surveys and the quarterly
reported spending items from the quarterly surveys referring to 2010. Average spending in 2010 as
reported in the CEX was $42,736.16 Average weighted spending in the ALP was quite close at
$41,553, or 97.2% of CEX spending. The similarity of these levels shows that it is possible to
capture approximately the same amount of spending as in the CEX but using many fewer categories
of spending and, therefore, imposing substantially less respondent burden and cost.


3.2 Trends in spending
To examine trends in spending over time we apply seasonal adjustments and weight the statistics.17
We define three samples: a 30-wave panel sample composed of those who responded to all 30 waves
of the spending surveys (wave 3-32 of the financial crisis surveys); a 26-wave panel sample
composed of those who responded to 26 or more waves; and a cross-section sample composed of
those who responded in a particular wave. When calculating population statistics we exclude from
each wave a small number of observations where the respondent left many spending categories
blank.18 The respective size of these three samples is approximately 830, 1440 and 1900. We focus
the discussion of the quantitative findings on the 26-wave panel sample as it maintains close to
complete panel consistency, while substantially reducing potential selection effects that a strict panel
definition would entail.


Figure 6 shows mean spending on monthly items, seasonally adjusted and weighted for the three
samples. With the exception of the first four waves all samples produce remarkably similar results

16
   We excluded from the CEX published total for 2010 outlays for “Personal Insurance and Pensions,” because we
consider contributions to Social Security and pensions part of savings rather than spending. We also exclude life and
other personal insurance payments because, except for insurance company profit, they represent transfers from one
household to another.
17
   We calculate our own seasonal adjustment factors.
18
   Specifically we exclude a respondent’s observation on the total of the monthly spending categories if he or she did not
answer 6 or more of the 25 monthly categories. For the quarterly items we exclude respondents if they did not answer 6
or more out of the 11 (non-big ticket) quarterly items. Because of the very low rates of item non-response, the resulting
reductions in sample size are small: the cross-sectional sample is reduced by 10 observations per wave on average; the
26-wave panel and the 30-wave panel are reduced by about 20 responses per wave on average.


                                                                                                                        12
both with respect to levels of spending and with respect to trends. Spending on the monthly items
reached a minimum of about $2,170 (nominal) in the May 2010 survey (which measures what
households spent in the month of April) and recovered after that, increasing by about 9 percent from
its minimum. When adjusting for inflation, the recovery since the trough in spending on the monthly
items amounted to about 4.5 percent real.
         There is substantial month-to-month variation most likely due to relatively high standard
errors of the mean associated with our sample size. The 30 wave sample, which has the smallest
number of observations, has a standard error of 74; the 26 wave sample, which has more
observations, has a standard error of 60 and the cross-section, which has the largest number of
observations, has a standard error of 53.19


Figure 7 shows median spending on the monthly items. The level is about $500 lower then the level
of the mean but the trends and patterns over time of the two measures are similar.



These figures do not include spending on durables and other low-frequency items whose pattern and
trend may differ from spending on high frequency items. Figure 8 shows average total quarterly
spending which is the sum of the monthly spending items for the three consecutive months in each
quarter and the quarterly spending items. The statistics are seasonally adjusted and weighted. All
three samples show a decline during the first four quarters of our period of study until reaching a
minimum in the second quarter of 2010; after that they all show spending increases, indicating a
recovery of household spending. Quantitatively there are some differences among the three samples.
The most restrictive sample of those answering in all 10 quarters shows a smaller decline, but it is
also the one that is most likely to suffer from sample selection, so we focus our attention on the
results from the 8-quarter panel which are very similar to those based on the cross-sections. Average
total spending declined from an initial level of $11.1 thousand in the second quarter of 2009 by about
$1,100 or 9.9 percent until it reached the minimum in the second quarter of 2010. Adjusting for
inflation the decline amounted to 12.0 percent real.20 Over the recovery period from II/2009 through

19
   The standard errors illustrate the tradeoff between sample size and panel consistency.
20
   We note a particularly large decline during the first quarter or our survey period. This time coincides with the stock
market reaching its lowest reading during this recession and rising unemployment. This large decline in spending in the
first quarter of our surveys is therefore not implausible. However, the CEX disregards respondents’ first quarterly reports
for concerns about data quality. Our survey design and methods are very different so CEX data quality concerns do not


                                                                                                                        13
the end of our sample period, spending increased by 10.6 percent in nominal terms (as shown in the
graphs) which corresponds to 6.3 percent real. Comparing the level of spending in the last quarter
(III/11: $11,069) of our period of study with initial spending (II/09: $11,114), we find that despite
the recovery, spending in the third quarter of 2011 was still lower compared to the second quarter of
2009, both in nominal terms (0.4 percent less) and in real terms (6.4 percent less).



Figure 9 has median total quarterly spending, seasonally adjusted, and weighted for the three
samples. Compared to the statistics based on the mean, the median shows very similar qualitative
patterns, but at a lower level reflecting the skewed distribution of spending. The medians also show a
minimum in about II-10, and the recovery of spending observed until the third quarter of 2011 still
remained short of the initial spending we recorded, even in nominal terms.


4. Conclusions


        Before the initiation of our financial crisis surveys it was not clear whether high frequency
surveying about a repetitive yet complex topic such as spending was feasible. We were unsure
whether respondents would respond to the survey by attriting or by providing meaningless data.
Neither of these fears appears to have been warranted. Attrition was modest, and, in fact, the main
reduction in sample size occurred when we dropped some 300 respondents from our sample pool.
Measures of data quality such as item nonresponse, time to complete the spending module,
occurrence of outliers (after reconciliation) have been very stable over time suggesting a steady
degree of respondent cooperation over time.
        The reconciliation screen has been an important innovation, especially in a self-administered
survey where there is no interviewer prompting the respondent in case of unusual values. It allows
the respondent to efficiently review his/her prior response and make appropriate changes.
Consequently our level of data cleaning and outlier adjustment in this paper was minimal.21
Furthermore, the reconciliation screen also leads to corrections that do not concern outliers, but that
consist of respondents’ revisions of their initial entries to improve the accuracy of their reports. For

necessarily apply also to the ALP spending data collection. To find out for sure we would have to run a large survey
experiment with different parts of the sample starting to take the survey in different months.
21
   Some surveys engage in a fairly involved “data editing” process prior to data release. In the data we presented in this
paper we did not perform any data edits beyond about 22 most obvious outliers recorded over 30 waves of data collection.


                                                                                                                       14
example a household may correct a spending level from $1000 to $100. This reduction of noise in
the data could not be achieved by ex-post data editing. Especially in small samples like ours this
effect could be important. When fitting models of spending change, these minor corrections could
have a substantial effect on significance levels of estimated coefficients. A topic of future research
will be to investigate the quantitative importance of such changes.

         Basic monthly surveys are shorter, eliciting just a subset of variables. Every three months we
administer a long survey (shaded in grey). The size of the initial eligible sample was N=2,693. Starting
with wave 15 (May10) we restricted the sample to those respondents who had participated in 5 or more
of the 14 prior surveys (N=2,338), excluding the most sporadic of respondents. This decision was
motivated by budgetary constraints. As a result response rates among the (somewhat reduced) set of
eligible respondents is higher on average in wave 15 and beyond.

 Notes: Time to complete the survey is calculated for completed survey responses, excluding any interviews that
 took 2 hours or longer. These respondents presumably interrupted the interview and returned to it later. The
 response rates for each wave are calculated over the initial eligible sample for the two periods and do not adjust for
 the fact that some few respondents declined future participation at some point and therefore were no longer part
 of the eligible sample. For example in Oct11, a total of 2,212 respondents were still eligible and active. The
 adjusted response rate for that wave would be 80.3% (=1,777*100/2212).

This screen shot displays the top portion of the reconciliation screen. The dollar amounts stated at the top
give the sum of the respondent’s answers to the monthly spending questions. All dollar amount fields are
filled with the respondent’s previously provided entries. Any missing categories are filled with a zero.
Using the usual scroll bar to the right of the screen the respondent can scroll through the entire list of
categories and edit any entries. At the bottom is a field that displays the “Total”, an update button to have
the total (displayed at the top and bottom) recalculated and the usual “Back” and “Next” buttons.




                                                                                                          20

Figure 2: Standard deviation of sum of 25 monthly items before and after the reconciliation
screen, cross-section, unweighted.




Note: Average number of observations per wave = 1,911. We edited 22 extremely large values out of 57,322
respondent-wave observations. Edits were subject to sufficient respondent-specific information being available
from adjacent waves to support the determination that a value was indeed erroneous. Many consisted of shifted
decimals (e.g., 10,000 instead of 100). There is a peak in July 2011 in the line depicting the standard deviation after
the reconciliation screen. It is caused by two particularly large values that we decided not to edit. One pertains to a
household that paid off the mortgage ($246k mortgage payment in July11 and no further mortgage payments in
subsequent waves) and one pertains to a household that reports $200k in home repairs and $150k in home
furnishings.
