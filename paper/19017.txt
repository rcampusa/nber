                                                 ABSTRACT

Many seemingly discordant results are reconciled if firm-specific return volatility is characterized
as the intensity with which firm-specific events occur. A functionally efficient stock market allocates
capital to its highest value uses, which often amounts to financing Schumpeterian creative destruction,
wherein creative winner firms outpace destroyed losers, who can be last year’s winners. This elevation
in firm-specific fundamentals volatility elevates firm-specific return volatility in a sufficiently informationally
efficient stock market. These linkages are interconnected feedback loops, rather than unidirectional
chains of causality.

1.     Introduction

Asked to predict the market, JP Morgan famously snapped “Stock prices will fluctuate.”

Finance theory partitions those fluctuations into firm-specific fluctuations, affecting one (or a

few) stocks, and market-wide fluctuation, affecting all (or most) stocks. This partition matters

because firm-specific fluctuations cancel in a diversified portfolio, but market-wide fluctuations

do not – and so are unavoidable risks. This simplifies finance research in two ways. First, asset

pricing models can focus on unavoidable market-wide factors by assuming investors are

diversified, leaving firm-specific fluctuations a residual afterthought. Second, corporate finance

researchers can use event studies, which subtract out market-wide fluctuations, isolating firm-

specific fluctuations associated with events that alter firms’ fundamental values.               Each

subdiscipline’s afterthought is the other’s focus.


       Roll (1988) observes that most fluctuations in US share prices are firm-specific. Morck,

Yeung and Yu (2000) confirm this, but also find market-wide fluctuations far more important in

eaarlier 20th century US data, and in emerging markets, especially where corruption is severe.

Campbell et al. (2001) affirm rising firm-specific risk in US stocks from 1962 to 1997 and explore

its econometric characteristics. Similar increases in firm-specific risk appear in other developed

(Guo and Savickas 2008) and emerging economies (Li, Morck, Yang, and Yeung 2004).


       A large literature exploring these findings can appear inconsistent, but actually coalesce

into a coherent, if tentative, explanation if firm-specific return volatility is characterized as firm-

specific return event intensity. Here, “event” connotes a firm-specific valuation change such as,

if accompanied by a public announcement, an event study might investigate. In this sense, in

                                                  1
an efficient market, firm-specific return volatility necessarily measures the intensity of

information events being capitalized into share prices (French and Roll 1986). A growing

literature exploring these issues has implications about the role of stock markets in economic

development.


        First, firm-specific return event intensity correlates with financial development, and with

market efficiency – particularly Tobin’s (1984) functional efficiency, the stock market’s reliability

in allocating capital to its highest value uses. Institutional changes that plausibly make arbitrage

less costly presage elevated firm-specific return event intensity. This reinforces Roll’s (1988)

argument that firm-specific risk reflects informed investors moving share prices - market

efficiency in action.


        Second, firm-specific return event intensity correlates with economic dynamism, over

time and across countries. Intuitively, more intensive innovation corresponds to more (or more

important) events raising the volatility of firm-specific fundamentals and returns (Chun et al

2008; 2011). Schumpeter’s (1911) creative destruction, in particular, separates the firm-specific

valuations of creative winner firms from those of laggard loser firms. Intensified creative

destruction elevates what we call firm-specific fundamentals event intensity, and an

informationally efficient stock market reflects this in elevated firm-specific return event

intensity.


        Laws, regulations, and other institutional features plausibly affect economic growth in

ways associated with event intensity. Specifically, institutions that render financial markets




                                                 2
more functionally efficient also likely encourage creative destruction and thereby promote

economic dynamism. However, various feedback effects make unidirectional causality unlikely.




2.      R2


The workhorse models of asset pricing theory explain any individual stock’s return with changes

in one or more economy-level common pricing factors. The simplest such framework, the

Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), represents the expected return of stock j as


[1]      ̃              (          )


where          is the return on a fully diversified portfolio of assets and          is the risk-free return.

The coefficient       relates the stock’s return to the sole pricing factor, the equity risk premium

             . Key parameters of [1] are often operationally approximated using Market Model

regressions of the form


[2]


where         is the residual component of stock j’s return not explained by the equity risk

premium and                        and is non-stochastic.1


        The non-stochastic nature of         and the orthogonality of regression [2]’s errors            from

its explanatory variable permits the variance decomposition


1
 The CAPM and Market Model are conceptually distinct. The former derives from a stylized model of investor
behavior; the latter is a purely empirical proposition.


                                                      3
[3]                [   ]        ⏟             [        ]    ⏟               [   ]
                                          -                         -




where             [            ] is the market-wide variation in the stock’s return and                       [   ] is

the firm-specific variation in its return.


         Roll (1988) notes that the regression                  of [2] is


                                                                                    -
[4]                                                                                                      ,
                                                                            -                -



and thus measures both the goodness of fit of the Market Model for stock j’s returns data and

the fraction of the variation in stock j’s return related to market-wide fluctuations. In

econometrics, a lower            indicates a “worse” model, but here this rule-of-thumb fails. A lower

      merely means that more of the variation in stock j’s price is firm-specific – the stock’s

returns are less synchronous with the overall market. From a finance perspective, this is

arguably “good”, in that firm-specific variation is diversifiable. Obviously,


                                      -
[5]
                           -                            -



likewise measures the firm-specific fraction of the risk in stock j’s returns, the stock’s tendency

to move asynchronously from the market. To stress that the Market Model                            is more than a

statistical goodness of fit, we call              stock j’s synchronicity and           its asynchronicity.


         Greater firm-specific return event intensity, as defined in the introduction, corresponds

to higher firm-specific variation in [4] and [5], and thus, all else equal, to less synchronous stock

returns. As we elaborate below, all else is seldom equal.

2.1    R2 over time in the US


Panel A of Figure 1 graphs the annual mean        s of [2] for US stocks from 1926 through 2010.

For each stock in each year, weekly returns are regressed on the CRSP value-weighted market

return. To mitigate data errors, weekly returns are winsorized at 99.9% and weeks with missing

or zero trading volume are removed. Also, firms with fewer than 30 valid weekly returns in a

year are dropped. The mean R2 each year is then calculated as in [3] – first replicating Morck et

al. (2000) and weighting firms by total returns variation, then weighting by beginning-of-year

market capitalization.


       Both mean R2s fall steadily through the mid-1990s, replicating Morck et al. (2000); but

then rise again after 2000, and by 2008 regain levels that, except amid the Crash of 1987, were

unseen since the 1970s. Weighting by beginning-of-year market capitalization produces higher

R2s throughout, consistent with larger firms’ greater importance in the index. Alternative

approaches – not winsorizing, dropping extreme observations, or using the methodology of

Cambell et al. (2001) – all generate broadly similar patterns.

       Panel B links the late 20th century R2 decline to escalating firm-specific variation, more

than declining market-wide variation, though the latter is also detectable in what

macroeconomists dub the Great Moderation (Taylor 2000; Blanchard and Simon 2001). Again,

this pattern reverses, at least temporarily, in the early 21st century. Explanations of why firm-

specific and systematic risk change over time must account for this complete pattern, not just

the trends in the late 20th century.

Panel A of Figure 2 ranks countries by the grand means of their mean R2s for 1995 through 2010.

The lesser synchronicity of higher income countries’ stocks evident in Panel A is confirmed in

Panel B, which graphs each country’s grand mean firm-level R2s against its mean log of per

capita GDP, averaged over the same 1995 to 2010 period. Both panels show the pattern Morck

et al. (2000) observe in the 1990s persisting. Even their reported major anomaly persists:

Japanese stocks’ remain oddly synchronous given the country’s high per capita GDP.


       One major difference between Morck et al. (2000) and Figure 3 is that American stocks,

the most idiosyncratic in the 1990s, became more synchronous over time, leaving its stocks

only the tenth most asynchronous in the figure. Another is that Polish stocks, among the most

synchronous in the word in the 1990s, become quite idiosyncratic over time. Yet another is

South African stocks’ marked asynchronicity, given its relatively low per capita income.

3.     Market Efficiency and Capital Allocation

Higher firm-specific stock return volatility can signify more firm-specific stock return event

intensity. All else equal, this would indicate more nuanced stock price movements more

accurately reflecting similar underlying firm-specific fundamentals events. All else is seldom

equal, but Durnev et al. (2003) nonetheless explore this possibility and find that future earnings

changes better explain the current stock price returns of firms in US industries where stock

returns are also less synchronous. Because the power of future earnings changes to explain

current stock returns is a widely accepted measure of stock market informativeness in the

accounting literature (Collins et al. 1994 and Basu 1997), they conclude that elevated firm-

specific return event intensity reflects more informationally efficient stock pricing.


       Further development of this line of reasoning requires an exploration of the

determinants of market efficiency.        Fama (1970) describes the stock market as more

informationally efficient if share prices adjust faster and more completely to new information.

Informational efficiency can reflect private arbitrageurs gathering new information, reassessing

firms’ fundamental values, and trading to profit from those reassessments (Grossman 1976); or

more meaningful public announcements (Fama et al. 1969); or more energetic insider trading

(Manne 1966). Each can push stock prices towards fundamental values, all else equal, raising

informational efficiency where informed arbitrage is less costly, disclosure fuller and timelier, or

insider trades more informative.




                                                 11
3.1    Private information-based arbitrage


French and Roll (1986) and Roll (1988) argues that firm-specific fluctuations reflect more than

just public news announcements, and credit private arbitrage for much stock price fluctuation.

That is, they attribute firm-specific return volatility to firm-specific stock return event intensity.

Consistent with this, Berry and Howe (1994) detect no relationship between the incidence of

public news and firm-specific stock returns. Although recent work (Boudoukh et al. 2013)

contests this conclusion, we consider it for the moment.


       If private arbitrageurs are an important force pushing prices towards fundamental

values, arbitrageurs’ costs of business affect the informational efficiency of the stock market

(Grossman and Stiglitz 1980). This linkage suggests that higher firm-specific variation in higher

income countries and later 20th century decades might reflect arbitrageurs’ falling costs or

rising trading revenues.


       In a dynamic model with discrete fixed costs of information gathering and processing,

Veldkamp (2006) formalizes this. Competition biases information suppliers towards producing

information useful for estimating the fundamental values of many firms because this has more

buyers than information about one stock. Higher fixed costs of information production

extenuate this, leading to even less production of information about individual firms. Thus,

where arbitrage fixed costs are higher, more investors trade en masse on the same information

about the same subset of stocks, rendering returns more synchronous.


       The economics of the information production industry reconciles several seemingly

discordant findings. Stocks followed by more analysts commove more in the US (Piotroski and

                                                 12
Roulstone 2004) and elsewhere (Chan and Hameed 2006); and changes in their fundamentals

also correlate more closely with changes in the fundamentals of more other firms (Hameed,

Morck, and Yeung 2005). All these findings are consistent with Veldcamp (2006); as is evidence

that analysts’ forecasts contain mainly industry and economy-level information (Schutte and

Unlu 2009; Crawfordet al. 2012).2 Presumably, firm-specific information enters stock prices via

other channels.


         Stocks move more independently after emerging markets lower inward foreign portfolio

investment bariers (Li, Morck, Yang, and Yeung 2004), receive increased equity investment

inflows from the US (Bae, Bailey, and Mao 2006), announce stock market liberalizations (Bae,

Bailey, and Mao 2006), or allow cross-listings or closed-end country funds into the US, UK, (Bae,

Bailey, and Mao 2006) or Hong Kong (Gul, Kim, and Qiu 2010). These findings also fit the

pattern if foreign arbitrageurs raise the intensity and sophistication of informed trading.


         More binding short sale restrictions correlate positively with stock return synchronicity

(Bris, Goetzmann, and Zhu 2007). Arbitrageurs with information that a stock is overvalued

profit from short-selling – borrowing an overpriced stock, selling it, and repurchasing and

returning it after the price falls. Some countries ban short selling, presumably reducing the

value of roughly half of all non-public information. Bris et al. distinguish a downside R2,

measuring stock return co-movement when the market return is negative, from an upside R2,

measuring stock return co-movement when the market return is non-negative. They find short-



2
  The latter add that analysts beginning to follow stocks other analysts already follow generate firm-specific
information


                                                         13
sales restrictions correlating most strongly with their downside R2. Chang, Cheng, Pinegar, and

Yu (2012) replicate this using firm-level data in Hong Kong.


       Who the informed arbitrageurs are is less clear. Malkiel and Xu (2002) find higher firm-

specific return volatility in stocks whose institutional ownership is larger, and argue that this

reflects noise trading by institutions. Chung, Fung, Shilling, and Simmons-Mosley (2011)

advance an alternative explanation more consistent with the noise trading literature (DeLong et

al. 1990): larger institutional investors’ economies of scale better cover the fixed costs of

information (Veldcamp 2006).      Supporting this, they find firm-specific variation positively

correlated with the stakes of hedge funds, a genre of institutional investor thought to specialize

in informed arbitrage (Chun et al. 2011). Piotroski and Roulstone (2004) revisit institutional

investors in general and report higher return synchronicity in stocks with less institutional

trading. Ferreira and Laux (2007) find institutional stakes positively correlated with firm-

specific variation around mergers for firms unprotected from takeovers (Gompers et al. 2003).


       These findings coalesce into Veldcamp’s (2006) theory of fixed costs of information

limiting informed arbitrage. Hedge funds may act as firm-specific information generators, as

may other institutional investors in at least some circumstances. Analysts appear to generate

information the market interprets as more broadly relevant. The roles of other classes of

potential private arbitrageurs remain unclear.       Institutional environments (restrictions on

foreign investors, short sales, etc.) or economic conditions (recessions, etc.) that increase the

net effect of fixed information costs correlate with less independent stock returns.

3.2        Public Information Announcements


Boudoukh et al. (2013), using advanced text analysis software (Feldman et al. 2011), find a

larger fraction of firm-specific stock price movements corresponding to identifiable public news

announcements than did Roll (1988). Their methodology combines machine learning with word

(Tetlock 2007; Loughran and McDonald 2011) and phrase-level text analysis rules to gauge the

tone and relevance to specific companies of some 1.9 million news articles from 2000 to 2009.

This lets them link public news with stock returns far more reliably, and use this information to

explain when stocks move idiosyncratically as opposed to with the market. Their median

estimated stock-level return R2 is 16% on dates their algorithm designates “news days”, down

from 28% on “no news days”.                This linkage suggests that the public release of news, a very

straightforward indicator of events happening, indeed correlates with stock return

asynchronicity


           News services are one source of public information; financial disclosure is another.

Morck et al. (2000) report no correlation between firm-specific return volatility and a measure

of national disclosure standards comprehensiveness. However, comprehensive standards are

unimportant if the numbers are uninformative; and measures of disclosure quality do correlate

with lower synchronicity (Lau, Ng, and Zhang 2012).3 Moreover, firm-specific return volatility

rises after countries adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), especially for

countries with worse institutional environments, where IFRS likely most improves disclosure

quality (Bissessur and Hodgson 2012; Kim and Shi 2012). Also consistent with this reasoning,

3
    Their risk premium volatility, by construction, measures synchronicity.


                                                           15
Durnev, Fox, Morck, and Yeung (2003) find a 1980 increase in US disclosure requirements

raising firm-specific return variation, but only for firms most affected by the change. Once again,

this ties firm-specific return volatility to firm-specific event intensity.


        Jin and Myers (2006) model insiders’ appropriating firm-specific, but not market-wide,

abnormal profits as an explanation of low firm-specific stock return variation in countries where

de facto disclosure standards are low.          Consistent with this, they report economy-level

measures of firm-level disclosure quality positively correlated with firm-specific return variation,

as well as other evidence supporting their model. These findings suggest that differences in the

strength of public investors’ property rights over the wealth their firms generate might help

explain cross-country differences in stock return synchronicity. Also supporting Jin and Myers’

model, Hutton, Marcus and Tehranian (2009) find firm-specific return variation negatively

correlated with accruals management, which they interpret as measuring management’s

preference for opacity, in US firms. Moreover, this relationship vanishes with the passage of the

Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which limits earnings manipulation. The negative correlation between

stock return synchronicity and shareholder rights (Morck et al 2000) is also consistent with Jin

and Myers’ model.


        Corporate disclosure is always partly voluntary. Managers might disclose the bare

minimum consistent with a legalistic reading of the regulations, or take pains to be transparent.

The stocks of US firms with better voluntary disclosure ratings move more independently

(Haggard, Martin, and Pereira 2008); as do those of Chinese firms with a Big Four auditor (Gul,

Kim, and Qiu 2010).      Ferreira and Laux (2007) find firm-specific return variation correlating



                                                   16
positively with corporate governance quality, which they interpret as reflecting investors’

power to demand transparency. A similar interpretation explains higher firm-specific return

variation in Chinese stocks with more dispersed ownership, more foreign ownership, and less

state control (Gul, Kim, and Qiu (2010). These studies permit a reinterpretation of the Li et al.

(2004), Bae et al. (2006) and Gul et al. (2010) findings of increased asynchronicity after foreign

investors enter: more sophisticated investors might demand more disclosure, as well as

intensify informed arbitrage.


       Transparency especially matters to firms needing public equity (Myers and Majluf 1984),

and securities regulations typically require unusually detailed disclosure prior to equity issues.

Dasgupta, Gan, and Gao (2010) report elevated firm-specific return variation prior to seasoned

equity issues (SEOs) and cross-listings, which often precede SEOs, and depressed firm-specific

return variation subsequent to these events.


       These studies link less synchronous stock returns to higher disclosure quality, and to

better voluntary disclosure especially.       Such findings qualify, but need not contradict,

arguments linking informed arbitrage to firm-specific stock return variation. For example,

better disclosure might reduce the fixed costs of information generation, which might replace

rare large corrections with frequent small ones, more readily observable in any given time

window. But regardless of whether events are discovered by private investors or disclosed

publicly, firm-specific return volatility is interpretable as firm-specific return event intensity and

reflects firm-specific fundamentals event intensity.




                                                 17
3.3    Insider Trading


Informed arbitrage and public disclosure are not the only ways private information can enter

share prices. Manne (1966) argues for unrestricted insider trading because insiders, having the

most information about their firm, are best able to engage in informed arbitrage should its

stock become mispriced. However, unrestricted insider trading might also worsen information

asymmetry problems (Bhattacharya and Nicodano 2001), deterring outsider arbitrageurs from

paying for information (Fishman and Hagerty 1992) and leaving its stock less accurately priced.


       Firm-specific return variation correlates with the intensity of insider trading in US firm-

level data (Piotroski and Roulstone 2004); but correlates with the strength of restrictions on

insider trading across countries (Durnev and Nain 2007). These seemingly discordant results are

reconciled by recalling that US insider trading restrictions do not ban insider trading, but

require insiders to refrain from trading until material inside information is made public, and to

disclosure their trades. The incidence of disclosed firm-specific events might thus correlate

with subsequent insider trades in countries with US-style insider trading rules, but not where

insiders freely trade on undisclosed private information.


       Consistent with this reconciliation, Khwaja and Mian (2005) report that Pakistani

insiders’ “pump and dump” trading correlates with elevated stock return synchronicity, perhaps

because such practices deter informed arbitrage by outsiders. Fernandes and Ferreira (2009)

find a country’s first enforcement of its insider trading law elevating firm-specific variation in

developed, but not emerging economies, consistent with insider trading restrictions

encouraging fuller disclosure in developed economies, but not where institutions are

                                               18
chronically unreliable. Bhattacharya, Daouk, and Kehr (2000) argue that, regardless of sporadic

enforcement actions, firm-specific information in many low-income economies seeps slowly

into stock prices via insider trading well before any public disclosure.




4.     Functional Efficiency

The previous section proposes that firm-specific stock return volatility is higher where informed

arbitrage is less costly, disclosure fuller, and insider trading regulations more conducive to

transparency, all else equal. The findings present a prima fascia case for elevated firms-specific

return volatility, all else equal, reflecting fuller and prompter information capitalization into

stock prices. That is, elevated firm-specific return volatility can reflect elevated firm-specific

return event intensity.


       As conceded above, all else is seldom equal, and the assumption that fundamentals

events unfold similarly across firms and over time is excessively strong. Once heterogeneity

across firms, or over time for a given firm, is conceded, an instrumental view of informational

efficiency comes into focus. Informational efficiency is a means to an end, not necessarily an

end per se.


       The social purpose of financial markets is arguably to allocate the economy’s savings to

their highest value uses (Schumpeter 1911). Tobin (1984) defines the stock market as

functionally efficient if stock price changes push the economy towards a microeconomically

efficient allocation of capital, and notes that functional and informational efficiency need not


                                                 19
coincide.     Indeed, Grossman and Stiglitz (1980) and Black (1985) argue they cannot if

information is costly. Thus, tests of how closely share prices obey a martingale (Griffin, Kelly

and Nardari 2013) need not gauge functional efficiency. For example, a casino stock market,

with stock prices set by roulette wheels, might be totally free of momentum effects, mean

reversion, or other such deviations from a martingale, yet generate share prices utterly

unrelated to firm fundamentals and utterly useless in allocating capital to its highest value uses.


        Such considerations shift our focus from informational efficiency to functional efficiency:

Do stock prices that move about more asynchronously better direct capital to its highest value

uses? To explore this, Wurgler (2000) gauges the functional efficiency of a country’s financial

system by the correlation of capital spending with value added across industries. If a country’s

capital spending concentrates in its higher value-added industries, capital flows to where it

creates more new wealth and Wurgler’s measure is near +1. If capital is sprinkled randomly

across sectors, without regard to where its return is higher, the measure is near zero. If capital

perversely flows disproportionately to where its value-added is lowest, the measure drops to

minus one .


       Wurgler finds more functional efficiency in the financial systems of economies with

higher mean incomes, larger financial sectors, and stronger shareholder rights. Most relevant

here, Figure 3 plots Wurgler’s (2000) finding that more asynchronous stock returns correlate

with more functionally efficient capital allocation.

       Durnev et al. (2004) replicate Wurgler’s finding using industry-level US data. Gauging

the marginal value of capital by Tobin’s marginal Q ratio (one plus the estimated NPV of the

firm’s marginal capital project over its setup cost, adjusted for taxes), they find higher firm-

specific return event intensity in US industries where marginal Q is nearer one, and thus capital

allocation more functionally efficient. Allocating capital to its highest value uses should

ultimately enhance overall total factor productivity. Consistent with this, Durnev et al. (2004a)

report higher TFP growth in countries whose stock markets exhibit higher firm-specific return

event intensity.


       These findings motivate further theoretical and empirical reflection on the functional

efficiency of financial markets, its determinants, and its relationship to informational efficiency,

often misconstrued as a normative goal. Most importantly, functional efficiency mandates

considering firm fundamentals, how these change, and how the stock market’s faithfulness in

reflecting fundamental values matters to the real economy.




5.     Fundamentals

The previous section take firm-specific and market-wide fundamental volatilities as given, and

considers how differences in the way stock prices approximate fundamentals might generate

the time series and cross sectional patterns observed in firm-specific and market-wide return

volatilities. Morck et al. (2000) find that stocks exhibit higher proportions of firm-specific

volatility in countries with higher incomes and fewer corruption problems, but control for firm-


                                                22
specific fundamentals variation with a potentially problematic measure of earnings volatility.

Better fundamentals variation measures better explain the relative importance of firm-specific

versus market-wide return volatility in cross-section (Pastor and Veronesi 2003) and panel (Wei

and Zhang 2006; Chun et al. 2008; Irvine and Pontiff 2009) data. These findings necessitate

considering why firm-specific fundamentals volatility – that is, firm-specific fundamentals event

intensity – might vary across firms, industries, countries and time.




5.1    An excess of explanations


Irvine and Pontiff (2009) link elevated firm-specific volatility in fundamentals and returns to

increased competition, arguing that smaller momentary leads or missteps induce more

protracted gains and losses in the more competitive latter 20th century US economy. Supported

by larger increases in fundamentals volatility in deregulated industries, this explanation also

accommodates declining fundamentals returns. Gasper and Massa (2006) similarly argue that

market power lets firms smooth firm-specific earnings fluctuations to lower information

uncertainty for investors, explaining their finding that firms with larger market shares have

lower firm-specific fundamentals and stock return volatilities.


       Pastor and Veronesi (2003) find higher firm-specific earnings volatility in younger firms;

and Fama and French (2004) report a rising incidence of small and newly listed firms, which

have lower and more positively skewed earnings, in the late 20th century. Both suggest that

newer firms have more volatile fundamentals and may be harder for investors to value. Brown

and Kapadia (2007) link the time trend in idiosyncratic return volatility to IPOs; and report

                                                23
persistently higher idiosyncratic volatility in later cohorts of IPOs. They conclude that the

findings of Fama and French reflect riskier firms listing, not smaller firms being riskier.   Fink,

Fink, Grullon, and Weston (2010) find a steady drop in firm age at IPO – from about 40 years in

the early 1960s to less than 5 years by 2000 – and that controls for firm age explain the time

trend in US idiosyncratic return volatility.


       Several studies relate elevated firm-specific return volatility to better corporate

governance. Recall that Ferreira and Laux (2007) find elevated firm-specific return volatility in

firms with higher corporate governance scores, and Gul, Kim, and Qiu (2010) report higher firm-

specific return volatility in Chinese stocks with more disperse ownership, more foreign

ownership, and less state control. If better governed firms are more apt to pursue promising,

but risky, innovative investments (John, Litov and Yeung 2008), these findings might reflect

higher firm-specific fundamentals volatility, as well as greater transparency. Also supporting a

governance effect, Cheng (2011) finds lower firm-specific fundamentals and stock return

variability in firms with larger boards, a widely accepted proxy for poor governance (Yermak

1996; Hermalin and Weisbach 2003; Adams et al. 2010). Malkiel and Xu’s (2002) linking

institutional investor stakes to elevated firm-specific return volatility can be reinterpreted as

institutional investors holding managers to higher governance standards (Shleifer and Vishny

1986). A similar reinterpretation might recast fuller disclosure (Jin and Myers 2006; Haggard,

Martin, and Pereira 2008; Dasgupta, Gan, and Gao 2010) and cross-listing into a regulatory

regime enforcing stronger shareholder rights (Fernandes and Ferreira 2008) as improving

corporate governance.       Adams, Almeida, and Ferreira (2005) find elevated stock return




                                                24
volatility in firms controlled by founders, and argue that these, like firms with small boards,

undertake riskier value-creating investments because they are better governed.


       Cross-country differences in corporate governance might also matter.                Listed

corporations in more corruption-prone economies are more apt to belong to business groups,

and thus have equity cross-holdings, shared directors, and/or a common controlling

shareholder (La Porta et al. 1999). Firms in business group exhibit lower firm-specific return

volatility in Japan (Hamao, Mei, and Xu 2007) and elsewhere (Khana and Thomas 2009). One

possible explanation of this result is that group firms co-insure (Hoshi, Kashyap and Scharfstein

1991) against adverse firm-specific shocks: temporarily successful group member firms prop up

temporarily unsuccessful related firms.


       Japan, which grants bankers substantial corporate governance influence, is an outlier in

Figure 2 – a high income economy where firm-specific return volatility is persistently low

(Morck and Yeung 2003) and dropping through the 1990s (Hamao, Mei, and Xu 2007). Banker

governance influence correlates with Japanese firms pursuing low-risk strategies (Morck,

Nakamura and Shivdasani 2000), and firm-specific return volatility is significantly higher in

Japanese family-controlled firms (Nguyen 2011).




5.2    Creative destruction and firm-specific event intensity


Chun et al (2008, 2011) find that firms in US industries that invest more intensively in

information technology (IT) have less synchronous fundamentals and returns, as well as higher


                                               25
productivity growth. Figure 4 summarizes their findings. Endogenous growth theory (Jovanovic

and Rouseau 2005) links IT to a broad wave of creative destruction (Schumpeter 1911) across

the US economy in the late 20th century: the creative firms that most successfully applied IT in

their sectors profited hugely, leaving unsuccessful innovators and non-innovative incumbents

partially or completely destroyed. Chun et al. argue that elevated firm-specific return and

fundamentals volatilities reflect this wave of IT driven creative destruction magnifying the gap

between winners and losers. Consistent with this, Chun et al. (2013) find this effect fading in

the early 21st century as IT investment plateaus across sectors and the IT boom appeared to

have run its course.

                                             27
       Consistent with this explanation, Irvine and Pontiff (2009) link elevated firm-specific

volatility in fundamental and returns to increased competition associated with deregulation.

Extensive US deregulation in the 1980s exposed creaking, formerly politically sheltered

monopolies (Stigler 1971) to pressure from more innovative entrants.


       A wave of creative destruction also meshes with the firm age effect reported above

(Pastor and Veronesi 2003; Fama and French 2004; Brown and Kapadia 2007; Fink et al. 2010).

A wave of newly listed firms is consistent with a wave of creative destruction because the top

executives of established firms, whose human capital relates to existing technologies, often

block disruptive innovation (Bower & Christensen 1995) and because new firms offer creative

entrepreneurs surer ownership of their ideas (Schumpeter 1911). Finally, Chun et al. (2013)

argue that low returns in listed firms can accompany a wave of creative destruction that

increases the overall productivity of the economy if the owners of creative firms capture much

of the return to innovation prior to their IPOs.


       Also consistent with innovation elevating firm-specific volatility, Kothari, Laguerre, and

Leone (2002) find R&D investments positively related to subsequent earnings volatility. Osinga,

Leeflang, Srinivasan, and Wieringa (2011) find advertising spending correlated to elevated firm-

specific return volatility in pharmaceutical firms, which could reflect either advertising

campaigns either having winner-take-all characteristics akin to R&D races or echoing innovative

success. Bartram, Brown, and Stulz (2012) report higher idiosyncratic return volatility in US

firms than in comparable foreign firms, and link the difference to R&D and patents. Brown and




                                                   28
Kimbrough (2011) link intangible investments to earnings variability, and find R&D especially

correlated with earnings variability in industries where patents are better protected.


       Building on the real option models of Galai and Masulis (1976) and Myers (1977), Cao,

Simin, and Zhao (2008) argue that levered firms’ managers, to maximize existing shareholders’

wealth, favor investments that elevate their firm’s idiosyncratic risk. Cao et al find firm-specific

return volatility positively correlated with Tobin’s average Q, which they interpret as a proxy for

growth options.    They further find that controlling for growth options removes, or even

reverses, the idiosyncratic volatility trend in Campbell et al (2001), and renders insignificant

other explanatory variables, including profitability (Pastor and Veronesi 2003; Wei and Zhang

2006) and firm age and size (Pastor and Veronesi 2003; Fama and French 2004; Fink et al 2010).

Zhang (2010) analogously links firm-specific return volatility to market-to-book ratios and

earnings volatility in industry-level data for the US and nine other high-income countries.

Bekaert, Hodrick, and Zhang (2012) likewise link firm-specific volatility to market-to-book ratios,

business cycles variables, and systematic volatility in G7 country data. To the extent that growth

options arise from new technologies, and that Tobin’s average Q ratios and market-to-book

ratios approximates Tobin’s marginal Q ratio (a theoretically motivated measure of growth

options), these findings also support elevated firm-specific volatility reflecting technological

progress.

5.3     The Importance of functional efficiency to creative destruction


Perhaps most importantly, this explanation links firm-specific return volatility to both market

efficiency and fundamentals volatility. King and Levine (1993) present empirical evidence

supporting Schumpeter’s (1911) argument that an efficient financial system, especially a

functionally efficient stock market, is essential to fast-paced creative destruction. This is

because creative potential entrepreneurs often lack adequate personal or family wealth, and

must raise risk-tolerant capital from others to develop their innovations.


        Creative undertakings are uniquely ill-suited for bank loans because they promise huge

upside potential but entail substantial downside risk. Because banks receive fixed interest,

bankers are unimpressed by upside potential, however huge, but deeply concerned about

downside risk. Creative innovators typically have scant collateral, which bankers value highly.

Even ultimately successful innovators may not generate substantial revenues for many years,

yet bank loans typically require prompt commencement of regular payments of interest and

principal.


        Schumpeter (1911) argues that creative entrepreneurs therefore need economically

efficient financial markets in which to raise capital.4 Stock markets are especially helpful (Atje

and Jovanavlc 1993; Levine and Zervos 1998) because shareholders balance downside risk

against upside potential, demand no collateral, and accept that dividends may not begin for

many years. Even venture capital firms, financial institutions that provide capital to innovators,

 Schumpeter was unimpressed with high finance, viewing highly leveraged banks his era’s financial engineering as
diversions from the financial system’s social purpose (Leathers and Raines 2004).


                                                       30
typically do so with the expectation of recouping their investment plus a profit when the

innovators’ firms go public (Gompers and Lerner 2001), and thus also rely on stock markets.

Once listed, these firms can grow further by issuing more equity; and only much later rely

mainly retained earnings and debt.


       Costly regulations with scant real positive impact on corporate governance render

outside equity capital from either an IPO or a seasoned equity offering (SEO) more costly. The

period from 1975 through 2000 saw a series of sweeping financial liberalizations in the US and

elsewhere that, at first at least, dismantled a broad range of arguably inefficient regulation.

While events after 2000 lead many to conclude that deregulation grew excessive, it seems

plausible that increasing competition among market makers and brokers (Geisst 2012) and an

expanding venture-capital-fund-to-IPO cycle (Gompers and Lerner 2001) improved the

informational and functional efficiency of the US financial system. Similar liberalizations may

have had like effects in other countries (Bekaert, Harvey and Lundblad 2005; Henry 2007).


       This linkage between functional efficiency and creative destruction can also play out

across countries. In countries where corporate governance standards are lower, public equity

capital is dearer (La Porta et al. 1998; Rajan and Zinglaes 1998) and new listings rarer (La Porta

et al. 1998); so entrepreneurs, intent on founding new firms with public equity capital, find

tough going. In such countries, wealthy business families often control vast business groups

(Rajan and Zingales 2003; Morck et al. 2004), whose member firms’ assets are what creative

destruction would destroy (Morck and Yeung 2003). Thus, less firm-specific variation amid

business groups (Khanna and Thomas 2009) might reflect sluggish innovation.



                                               31
       Even Japan fits. Japan’s prolonged economic slowdown after 1990 is attributed to

stalled innovation (Morck and Yeung 2003). Risk-averse bank-influenced firms (Morck et al.

2001) predominate in sheltered backwater sectors, while many family firms are actually run by

first generation entrepreneurs, whom business families adopt as legal sons and heirs (Mehotra

et al. 2013). Perhaps higher returns comovement for bank-linked than family firms (Nguyen

2011) reflects more innovation in the latter.




6.     Noise traders and Systematic Risk
Noise in financial markets is doubtless important in understanding event intensity; however, a

consensus as to how it does so remains elusive. Thus far, our focus is firm-specific events, and

some firm-specific return volatility may well be “occasional frenzy unrelated to concrete

information” (Roll 1988, 566), and Malkiel and Xu (2002) pursue this interpretation. We feel

the weight of evidence now suggests that much, perhaps most, firm specific volatility reflects

information capitalization, but concede that the issue is far from closed.


       Market-wide stock market volatility can likewise reflect macroeconomic events

(Bernanke and Kuttner 2005; Rigobon and Sack 2008) or noise (Keynes 1936; Kindleberger 1978;

Devenow and Welch 1996). Market-wide noise, because it cannot be diversified away, is

potentially economically important to the real economy, and thus to functional efficiency, than

firm-specific noise.


       Thus, DeLong et al. (1990) presume noise trading to be synchronous – driving the whole

market (or at least a broad section of it) to unrealistic heights or depths. Their irrationally

                                                32
overoptimistic noise traders inflate all equity investments above fundamental values, letting

firms issue overvalued shares or, equivalently, lowering their costs of public equity capital.

Their irrationally pessimistic noise traders can likewise depress the all equity investments,

deterring firms from issuing public equity.


       Noise traders can affect the economics of the informed arbitrage business in (at least)

two ways. First, Black (1985) argues that noise traders’ irrational optimism or pessimism can

push stock price away from fundamental values, thereby making informed risk arbitrage more

profitable. Second, DeLong et al. (1990) argue that noise traders can “create their own space”

in the stock market because their shifting optimism and pessimism affect all stock prices

synchronously. This elevates systematic risk, which raises the cost of capital for everyone,

including informed arbitrageurs. If higher capital costs drive enough informed arbitrageurs out

of business, stock markets are left to noise traders, and informational efficiency is

compromised.


       These two effects conflict when noise traders are irrationally optimistic. Irrationally

exuberant share prices cheapen equity capital, which theoretically cuts costs for both informed

arbitrageurs and creative innovators. But heightened systematic risk makes equity dearer,

raising costs of capital for both. Which effect dominates is unclear a priori, though historical

evidence suggests that noise trader optimism often correlates with cheap equity capital

(Keynes 1936; Kindleberger 1978; Shiller 2000; Reinhart and Rogoff 2011). If noise trader

optimism does cut costs of capital, Schumpeter’s (1911) thesis that creative entrepreneurs

lacking substantial private wealth require efficient stock markets can be extended. Perhaps



                                              33
optimistic noise traders, by lowering new entrepreneurial firms’ costs equity, accelerate

creative destruction, thereby elevating firm-specific event intensity. Alternatively, a cost of

capital biased down by noise traders might cause substantial capital misallocation and hobble

long-term growth.


       When noise traders are pessimistic, in contrast, the Black (1985) and DeLong et al. (1990)

effects align. Irrationally dejected share prices and amplified systematic risk inflict a double

whammy on the cost of capital, starving both informed arbitrageurs and creative entrepreneurs

of capital. The latter attenuates the intensity of firm-specific fundamentals events, and the

former renders stock prices less faithful reflections of such events. Pessimistic noise traders

might thus make capital dearer to new entrepreneurial firms, retarding creative destruction,

and to informed arbitrageurs, retarding information capitalization. Either effect could then

decrease firm-specific event intensity.     But working in the other direction, arbitraging

undervalued stocks entails taking long positions, a less costly arbitrage strategy than shorting

overvalued stocks in an irrationally exuberant stock market.


       Much of the evidence above can be cast as consistent with noise traders affecting asset

prices. The elevated systematic risk and depressed firm-specific risk evident in very low-income

countries’ stocks (Morck et al 2000; Jin and Myers 2006) is consistent with noise traders

predominating, though more erratic government policy might also be to blame (Taylor 2000;

Blanchard and Simon 2001). The heightened correlation across asset prices in bear markets

(Ribeiro and Veronesi 2002; Brockman, Liebenberg and Shcutte 2010), especially evident in low-

income countries (Brockman, Liebenberg and Shcutte 2010), also dovetails with pessimistic



                                               34
noise traders both pushing equity prices down and thereby elevating both leverage and

systematic risk, though other explanations associated with fixed information costs (Veldcamp

2006) may also be important.


           How the limits to arbitrage (Shleifer and Vishny 1997) affect return event intensity is

obviously a complicated business, and a full review is beyond the scope of this article. However,

the evidence above of connections to functional efficiency gives the problem very general

interest. Further theoretical and empirical research exploring these connections would be

useful.




7.        Conclusions

In a perfectly informationally efficient financial market, firm-specific return volatility reflects the

intensity of underlying firm-specific events (French and Roll 1986). We call this firm-specific

fundamentals event intensity. If informational efficiency is imperfect, firm-specific return

volatility reflects the capitalization into stock prices of some, but perhaps not all, previously

private information about firm-specific fundamentals events. We call this firm-specific stock

return event intensity.


          A stream of empirical work links firm-specific return event intensity to plausible

indicators of the extent of informed arbitrage: easier short-selling, hedge fund interest,

openness to foreign investors, investor rights, and the like. Another line of work suggests a link

to public announcements – news items and public disclosure documents. Both lines of work


                                                  35
are credible and suggest higher return event intensity when stock prices echo firm-specific

fundamentals events more faithfully. A range of empirical and theoretical arguments can be

reconciled to this thesis, including many that a priori seem discordant.


        One important cause of events that alter firm-specific fundamental values is creative

destruction, in which creative winner firms’ valuations rise and loser firms’ valuations are

destroyed, at least partially. Higher firm-specific fundamentals event intensity can reflect more

vigorous technological progress, as in the late 20th century IT boom in the US, or in more

innovative US industries, or in higher-income economies more generally.


       Causality here is likely neither unidirectional nor straightforward. First, creative

destruction feeds back upon itself. More intensive creative destruction shortens the profitable

product life of an innovation. If this encourages successful entrepreneurs to move on to new

innovations faster, fast creative destruction can encourage yet more creative destruction. But

if the faster evaporation of an innovation’s profits deters further innovation, a negative

feedback results instead. How fundamentals event intensity feeds back upon itself is thus

ambiguous.


       A larger feedback loop connects firm-specific fundamentals event intensity, firm-specific

return event intensity, functional efficiency, and creative destruction. More and larger firm-

specific fundamentals events increase the value of having information the market does not yet

have, and thus increases appropriately informed arbitrageurs’ profits. But more firm-specific

fundamentals volatility also elevates the risk arbitrageurs incur taking large undiversified

positions in stocks they deem mispriced (Shleifer and Vishny 1997). How this risk-return


                                                36
tradeoff affects the intensity of informed arbitrage is ambiguous. If the tradeoff is such that

intensified creative destruction, by elevating firm-specific fundamentals event intensity,

encourages informed arbitrage, the stock market might become more informationally and

functionally efficient. Capital could then flow more reliably to more promising entrepreneurs,

further accelerating creative destruction. But if the elevated firm-specific fundamentals event

intensity instead discourages arbitrage, the stock market might become less informationally

and functionally efficient; and capital would flow less reliably to promising entrepreneurs,

retarding creative destruction. Because noise trader herding can also affect the cost of capital

to informed arbitrageurs and potentially creative entrepreneurs alike, yet another set of

feedback effects arise.


       Institutions, especially those that encourage or discourage private information

generation, informed arbitrage, innovation, and financial development more generally may be

important because they affect which of these many possible feedback effects dominate.

Additional empirical and theoretical work to elaborate, qualify, or refute these hypotheses is

welcome.
