                                              ABSTRACT

Using individual-level data on homeowner debt and defaults from 1997 to 2008, we show that borrowing
against the increase in home equity by existing homeowners is responsible for a significant fraction
of both the sharp rise in U.S. household leverage from 2002 to 2006 and the increase in defaults from
2006 to 2008. Employing land topology-based housing supply elasticity as an instrument for house
price growth, we estimate that the average homeowner extracts 25 to 30 cents for every dollar increase
in home equity. Money extracted from increased home equity is not used to purchase new real estate
or pay down high credit card balances, which suggests that borrowed funds may be used for real outlays
(i.e., consumption or home improvement). Home equity-based borrowing is stronger for younger households,
households with low credit scores, and households with high initial credit card utilization rates. Homeowners
in high house price appreciation areas experience a relative decline in default rates from 2002 to 2006
as they borrow heavily against their home equity, but experience very high default rates from 2006
to 2008. Our estimates suggest that home equity-based borrowing is equal to 2.8% of GDP every year
from 2002 to 2006, and accounts for at least 34% of new defaults from 2006 to 2008.

       U.S. household leverage sharply increased in the years preceding the current economic

recession. The top panel of Figure 1 shows the steady rise in household debt since 1975, which

sharply accelerated beginning in 2002. In just five years, the household sector doubled its debt

balance. In comparison, the contemporaneous increase in corporate debt was modest. The middle

panel shows that the increase in household debt from 2002 to 2007 translated into a striking rise

in household leverage as measured by the debt to income ratio. During the same time period,

corporate leverage declined. The dramatic absolute and relative rise in U.S. household leverage

from 2002 to 2007 is unprecedented compared to the last 25 years.

       One reason for the rapid expansion in household leverage during this period was that

mortgage credit became more easily available to new home buyers (Mian and Sufi (2009)).

However, strong house price appreciation from 2002 to 2006, which may have been fueled by

the availability of mortgage credit to a riskier set of new home buyers, could also have had an

important feedback effect on household leverage through existing homeowners.

       Our central goal in this study is to investigate how existing homeowners respond to the

rising value of their home equity, a channel we refer to as the home equity-based borrowing

channel. This is an important question for several reasons. First, given that 65% of U.S.

households already owned their primary residence before the acceleration in house prices

beginning in the late 1990s, a strong home equity-based borrowing channel may be an important

cause of the rapid rise in household leverage preceding the economic downturn.

       Second, the quantitative strength of the home equity-based borrowing channel is

theoretically ambiguous. House price appreciation may have no effect on homeowner borrowing

because the increase in home equity wealth is counter-balanced with a higher cost of future

housing consumption (Sinai and Souleles (2005), Campbell and Cocco (2007)). On the other

hand, if homeowners are credit-constrained or subject to self-control issues, then house price




                                                1
appreciation may induce households to borrow more (Stein (1995), Ortalo-Magne´ and Rady

(2006), Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2006), and Laibson (1997)).

       Third, to the extent that homeowners use home equity-based borrowing to finance real

outlays such as consumption or home improvement, a large home equity-based borrowing

channel could provide a quantitative explanation for the decline in the U.S. savings rate in the

decade preceding the financial crisis. More broadly, if house prices strongly affect existing

homeowners’ borrowing behavior, then dramatic swings in the housing market may have real

effects on the economy through consumption and mortgage defaults.

       We examine the home equity-based borrowing channel using a data set consisting of

anonymous individual credit files of a national consumer credit bureau agency. The agency has

provided us a random sample of almost 70,000 homeowners living in every major metropolitan

statistical area in the United States. We track these individuals at an annual frequency from the

end of 1997 until the end of 2008. This data set allows us to separate homeowners borrowing

against the rising value of their home equity from renters buying into a hot housing market.

       The bottom panel of Figure 1 plots the growth in debt of 1997 homeowners over time,

and shows that existing homeowners borrow significantly more debt as their house prices

appreciate from 2002 to 2006. While the aggregate trend is suggestive of a link, changes in house

prices and homeowner borrowing may be jointly determined by an omitted variable such as a

shock to expected income growth (King (1990), Attanasio and Weber (1994), Muellbauer and

Murphy (1997)). As a result, proper identification of the effect of house prices on borrowing

requires an exogenous source of variation in house price growth.

       We use two different instruments for house price growth, one based on across-MSA

variation and another based on within-MSA variation. The across-MSA specification uses

housing supply elasticity at the MSA level as an instrument for house prices. MSAs with elastic

housing supply should experience only modest increase in house prices in response to large shifts


                                                 2
in the demand for housing because housing supply can be expanded relatively easily. In contrast,

inelastic housing supply MSAs should experience large house price changes in response to the

same housing demand shock (Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saiz (2008)).

       We confirm this relationship in our data using the land-topology based measure of

housing supply elasticity introduced by Saiz (2008). Using this instrument, the across-MSA

instrumental variables estimate uncovers a large home equity-based borrowing channel. Our

preferred estimate suggests an elasticity of borrowing with respect to increased home equity of

0.60. Alternatively, we find that households borrow 25 to 30 cents on each additional dollar of

home equity from 2002 to 2006.

       An obvious concern with the IV estimates is that MSAs with an inelastic supply of

housing could also experience differential non-house price-related credit demand shocks. A

number of tests mitigate this concern however. First, the borrowing patterns in elastic and

inelastic MSAs closely track each other until 2002 when housing prices accelerated. Second,

there is almost no difference in measures of non-house price credit demand shocks such as

income, payroll, and employment growth between inelastic and elastic MSAs during this period.

       Third, our results are insensitive to non-parametric controls for changes in credit demand

driven by individual income, credit score, age, and sex. Fourth, we find no statistically

significant difference in the growth of credit card balances for homeowners living in inelastic

versus elastic MSAs. This finding suggests that the home equity borrowing channel, and not a

general shift in credit demand, is driving our basic result. Finally, there is no difference in the

borrowing behavior of renters between elastic and inelastic MSAs.

       Our second instrument for house price growth exploits within-MSA variation and uses

the interaction of the 1997 fraction of subprime borrowers in a zip code with MSA level housing

supply inelasticity as an instrument for house price growth. The instrument is motivated by Mian

and Sufi (2009) who show that an expansion of mortgage credit from 2002 to 2005 is associated


                                                  3
with stronger house price appreciation in subprime zip codes compared to prime zip codes,

despite relatively declining income opportunities for subprime areas. Furthermore, as theory

would suggest, the differential house price appreciation in subprime zip codes is present only in

inelastic housing supply MSAs. The interaction of the 1997 share of subprime population in a zip

code with MSA level housing supply inelasticity therefore serves as an instrument for within-

MSA house price growth.1 Our within-MSA estimates are similar to the across-MSA estimates.

           The real effects of the home equity-based borrowing channel depend on what households

do with the borrowed money. We find little evidence that borrowing in response to increased

house prices is used to purchase new homes or investment properties. We also find no evidence

that home equity-based borrowing is used to pay down credit card balances, even for households

in the highest quartile of the 1997 credit card utilization distribution. This finding suggests that

the marginal return to the use of borrowed funds is higher to households than the high interest

rate on credit card debt. While we do not have data on real outlays, these findings suggest that

consumption and home improvement are possible uses of the increased borrowing.

           We use our microeconomic estimates to calculate the aggregate impact of the home

equity-based borrowing channel. We find that a total of $1.45 trillion of the rise in household

debt from 2002 to 2006 is attributable to existing homeowners borrowing against the increased

value of their homes. This translates to 2.8% of GDP per year. This is a conservative lower-

bound estimate given that it is based on a difference-in-differences estimator that ignores any

level effect of house prices on borrowing.

           Given the large effect of house prices on homeowner borrowing, which model of

household behavior is consistent with our estimates? We explore cross-sectional heterogeneity in

the effect to explore this question. We find that homeowners with high credit card utilization

rates and low credit scores at the beginning of the sample have the strongest tendency to borrow

                                                            4
against increases in home equity. In fact, we find no effect of house prices on borrowing for

homeowners in the top quartile of credit score distribution as of 1997. We also find that the

home-equity based borrowing channel is stronger for younger homeowners. We find no evidence

of a differential effect based on either income or gender.

       These results are consistent with a model of credit constraints under the assumption that

low credit scores and high credit card utilization rates serve as indicators for borrowing

difficulty. However, these characteristics may also proxy for individuals with self-control

problems. Our finding that older individuals have a smaller home equity-based borrowing

channel is inconsistent with standard life cycle-based models.

       The increase in homeowner leverage due to the home equity-based borrowing channel

plays an important role in the ensuing financial crisis. Using homeowner default rate data, we

show that borrowing against rising home equity is accompanied by a relative decline in default

rates from 2002 to 2006, especially for low credit score and high credit card utilization

homeowners. However, the relative decline in default rate begins to reverse starting in 2006. By

the end of 2008, the default rate of homeowners experiencing house price appreciation from

2002 to 2006 skyrockets past homeowners experiencing no previous house price appreciation.

       The reversal is especially strong among low credit score and high credit card utilization

homeowners who most aggressively borrow against rising home equity during the housing

boom. These same households also see a sharp relative reduction in auto loans from 2006 to

2008, highlighting the link between homeowner leverage and the drop in durable consumption at

the beginning of the current recession.

       Our findings are related to research on the effect of house price growth on consumption,

refinancing, and borrowing behavior (Case, Quigley, and Shiller (2005), Bostic, Gabriel, and

Painter (2009), Lehnert (2004), Haurin and Rosenthal (2006), Hurst and Stafford (2004),

Campbell and Cocco (2007), Greenspan and Kennedy (2007), Cooper (2009)). Our results


                                                 5
complement this research by using a novel data set and a novel empirical strategy to isolate the

effect of house prices on borrowing. We believe that the empirical strategy we utilize is of first-

order importance given that house prices, borrowing behavior, and consumption are likely jointly

driven by unobservable permanent income shocks. In addition, we are the first in this literature to

examine default behavior as it relates to home equity-based borrowing.

       These issues are important given that declines in housing and durable consumption often

precede economic recessions. Leamer (2008) points out that eight of the ten post-World War II

recessions were preceded by a decline in housing and durable consumption. The current

recession is no different. Understanding the links between housing and the real economy

necessitates a better understanding of the way homeowners respond to fluctuating asset prices.

Our analysis provides microeconomic estimates on homeowners’ response to increased house

values and the macroeconomic effect of the home equity-based borrowing channel. Our findings

are therefore related to models in which housing plays a crucial role in the macroeconomy (Aoki,

Proudman, and Vlieghe (2004), Iacoviello (2005), Jeske and Krueger (2005), Iacoviello and

Manetti (2008), and Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Niewerburgh (2009)).

       The rest of our study proceeds as follows. The next section describes the data and

summary statistics. Sections II through V present results, and Section VI concludes.

I. Data and Summary Statistics

A. Data

       The final data set used in our analysis consists of detailed credit report information from

Equifax for 67,489 homeowners in 2,046 zip codes located in 45 MSAs. The initial random

sample includes a total of 266,058 individuals that live in 3,072 zip codes located in 84 MSAs

covered by the Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss zip code level house price indices as of 1997. We

choose to focus on the FCSW zip codes given the importance of zip code level house prices in

our empirical tests. As noted in Mian and Sufi (2009), these zip codes represent over 45% of


                                                 6
aggregate home debt outstanding. Within these zip codes, we randomly sample individuals at a

rate of 0.45% per zip code. Given the importance of housing supply elasticity as an instrument

for house price growth, we further limit the sample to zip codes located within an MSA covered

by the Saiz (2008) topography-based elasticity measure. This reduces the sample to 189,305

individuals within 2,076 zip codes in 45 MSAs.2

        The Equifax data do not contain an explicit measure of homeownership. Instead, we

measure homeownership by splitting the sample into three groups of individuals based on 1997

credit report information. The first group (34%) contains individuals that have mortgage or home

equity debt outstanding. The second group (9%) contains individuals that do not currently have

mortgage or home equity debt outstanding, but their credit report indicates that they have had a

mortgage or home equity account in the past. The third group (57%) contains individuals that do

not have either a current or previous mortgage account. We define as “1997 homeowners”

individuals in the first two groups.3

        The rate of homeownership among individuals in the credit report data (43%) is

significantly lower than the fraction of households that own their primary residence in census

data (65%). We believe that this difference is driven by the fact that our measures are for

individuals, not for households. As a result, individuals with no current or previous mortgage

debt that live in a home in which some other individual has mortgage debt will not be counted as

a homeowner. In addition, any homeowner with no previous or current mortgage debt

outstanding will be excluded in our definition of homeownership.



2
  In an unreported robustness test, we match the remaining FCSW zip codes to the closest MSA covered by the Saiz
(2008) measure. The correlation between housing supply inelasticity and house price growth is slightly weakened,
but all other results are similar.
3
  The second group includes two types of individuals that we cannot separate: individuals that own their home but
have paid off their mortgage and individuals who previously had a mortgage but are now renters. We choose to
count this group as homeowners given that they have a low probability of moving, which suggests that they are
homeowners who have paid off their previous mortgage. Nonetheless, all results are materially unchanged if we
exclude this group from our homeowner classification.


                                                        7
        There are 81,264 homeowners in our sample. The final restriction we make is to exclude

homeowners that move from their 1997 zip code between 1997 and 1999. Approximately 15% of

homeowners move within the first two years of our sample, at which point the fraction that

moves levels off significantly. We exclude these “transient” individuals since we want to ensure

that when the house price shock hits, the homeowners are living in the zip code we assign them

to initially. This leaves a final sample of 67,489 individuals in 2,046 zip codes located in 45

MSAs.4

        Due to restrictions on the dissemination of individual credit report information, Equifax

only provides us data on these homeowners in groups of at least five individuals. We are free to

sort the data in any way before the groups are formed. The primary data-sort that we utilize sorts

homeowners by their 1997 zip code and then by their 1997 credit score before groups are

formed. This ensures that our unit of observation, a group of 5 homeowners on average, is as

homogenous as possible on observed characteristics. In a few tests where we estimate

heterogeneity of our main effect, we re-sort the data to maximize available variation along the

dimension of interest. For example, we re-sort data by zip code and then age when testing

whether young homeowners behave differently than old homeowners.

        We augment the individual level data with several additional data sets. We use the

following zip code level time-varying sources of data: house price data from FCSW, IRS income

data, employment and payroll information from the Census Business Statistics, aggregate

consumer credit score data from Equifax. All of these additional data sets are described in detail

in the appendix of Mian and Sufi (2009). The IRS data are available only for 1998, 2002, 2003,

2005, and 2006. We add information for missing years by interpolating data prior to 2006 and

extrapolating data post 2006 based on observed time trends. We also use 2000 decennial census

                                                     8
zip code level information on demographics. Finally, the primary measure of topology-based

housing supply elasticity comes from Saiz (2008).

B. Summary Statistics

        Table I presents summary statistics for the sample of 67,489 1997 homeowners grouped

into units containing 5 to 9 individuals. The median home debt (mortgage plus home equity)

outstanding as of 1997 is $88 thousand which is higher than the average amount of $62 thousand

reported in the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances.5 The discrepancy is likely due to two factors:

first, we do not count as homeowners any individual that has never used debt to finance their

home purchase. Second, the 1998 SCF separates out debt used for the purchase of second homes

or residential investment properties, whereas we cannot separate primary residence versus other

residential mortgage debt. Mortgage debt makes up over 85% of total debt outstanding for

homeowners.

        After remaining relatively constant from 1998 to 2002, total debt grows by 34% from

2002 to 2006. This growth is driven almost exclusively by home debt. The increase in leverage

can also be seen in the sharp increase in the total debt to income ratio, which increases by 0.7

from 2002 to 2006, which is almost ½ a standard deviation of the 1997 level. Default rates are

stable from 1998 to 2006, at which point they rise sharply by 3.8 percentage points from 2006 to

2008, which is a doubling of the 1997 level. Table I also includes information on individual 1997

credit score, 1997 credit card utilization, 1997 age, sex, and 2008 income.6

        The housing supply elasticity measure in Saiz (2008) varies from 0 to 3 and is increasing

in elasticity. Our measure is 3 minus the Saiz (2008) measure so that our measure increases in

housing supply inelasticity. Appendix Table 3 shows the inelasticity measure for the 45 MSAs in

our sample. Both the zip code level IRS wage data and the Census business statistics payroll data

 Individual income data are only available from Equifax for 2008. This estimate is based on payroll data that

show growth of about 12% from 2002 to 2006. Employment growth is 8% over the same time

period. One measure from Mian and Sufi (2009) that we use is the fraction of all consumers in a

zip code with a “subprime” credit score, which is defined to be a score below 660 as of 1997. In

our sample, homeowners on average live in a zip code with 31% subprime consumers.

II. The Effect of House Prices on Home Equity-Based Borrowing

A. Theoretical Motivation

        How should an individual homeowner respond to an increase in their house price, all else

being equal? This is the thought experiment that our empirical specification attempts to

implement using instruments for house price growth. The theoretical answer to this question

depends on the underlying model of consumer behavior.

        A useful starting benchmark is unconstrained long-lived homeowners. These

homeowners plan on using housing consumption in the foreseeable future, perhaps due to

bequest motives, and are not credit-constrained when choosing their consumption paths. Sinai

and Souleles (2005) and Campbell and Cocco (2007) show that such households are naturally

hedged against house price fluctuations in the absence of credit constraints or substitution

effects. Any increase in house prices makes future housing consumption more expensive. As a

result, the propensity to borrow out of housing gains is zero.7

        A second possible model is based on short-lived homeowners who do not value housing

bequests very highly and plan on consuming part of their housing capital before death. Such

homeowners would like to borrow against unexpected increases in home equity to finance

consumption, with the propensity to borrow being strongest for older homeowners with shorter

life horizons.




7
 An important caveat is a situation in which homeowners have short expected tenure or a high probability of
moving. In this case, a relative house price shock may be treated as a real wealth shock.


                                                        10
       A third possibility is credit-constrained homeowners who want to borrow more today to

smooth consumption over time, but are unable to do so due to limited collateral. Such

homeowners would borrow more against increases in home equity to relax their budget

constraints (Ortalo-Magne´ and Rady (2006), Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh, (2006)). Finally

following Laibson (1997), homeowners with limited self-control may aggressively borrow

against increased access to housing wealth in order to finance current consumption.

B. Across MSA Empirical Strategy Based on Housing Supply Inelasticity

       Our empirical strategy is designed to estimate the effect of house prices on home equity-

based borrowing. As the aggregate data in Figure 1 show, there is a strong correlation between

house price growth and homeowner debt growth. However, it is possible that omitted time

varying factors drive both house prices and borrowing behavior. Perhaps the most worrisome

time-varying trend is changes in productivity or permanent income.

       Our first empirical test exploits variation across MSAs in housing supply elasticity. The

intuition of the tests is straightforward: for an equivalent housing demand shock, the slope of the

housing supply curve determines that degree to which housing prices rise in an area. The insight

of Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saiz (2008) is that this basic prediction holds under most models of

house price evolution. As long as builders respond to house prices, an increase in housing supply

puts an upper bound on house price appreciation in elastic housing supply MSAs.

       In the top panel of Figure 2, we show evidence consistent with this intuition. We compare

MSAs in the highest and lowest quartile categories based on the Saiz (2008) housing supply

elasticity measure. The most elastic housing supply MSAs experience almost no increase in

house prices from 1997 to 2008. In contrast, inelastic housing supply MSAs experience strong

growth of over 100% from 2001 to 2006. The pattern in the top panel of Figure 2 is also seen in

our first stage estimate in column 1 of Table II, which shows a strong effect of housing supply

inelasticity on house price growth. The magnitude suggests that a one standard deviation increase


                                                11
in MSA housing supply inelasticity leads to a one-half standard deviation increase in house price

growth from 2002 to 2006.

       The bottom two panels of Figure 2 show a graphical version of the reduced form

specification estimates from our empirical model; they show that total debt growth and the

change in debt to income is significantly higher in inelastic MSAs from 2002 to 2006. The

growth rate is 20 percentage points higher and the debt to income change is 0.5 higher in

inelastic MSAs relative to elastic MSAs.

       Figure 2 and the estimate in column 1 of Table II motivate the following first-differenced

instrumental variables specification:

(1)                     0206                                 0206

(2)                      0206                            ,


Where LeverageGrowth0206izm represents the change in homeowner leverage from 2002 to 2006

for individual i living in zip code z within MSA m. Equation (2) represents the first stage, where

the instrument is MSA level housing supply inelasticity (Inelasticity). All standard errors are

clustered at the MSA level.

       Column 2 of Table II presents the instrumental variables estimate with no control

variables. The estimated elasticity of debt with respect to house prices is 0.6 among

homeowners. The estimate is completely insensitive to individual level control variables when

added linearly (column 3) or when added non-parametrically with 50 indicator variables for 2-

percentile bins (column 4). The estimate is reduced only slightly when we include a host of zip

code level census demographic control variables and zip code level controls for the growth in

wages, payroll, and employment (column 5).

       An alternative IV specification using the debt to income ratio also shows a positive effect

of house prices on leverage. The estimate of 1.6 in column 6 implies that a one standard

deviation change in house prices leads to a 1/4 standard deviation increase in the debt to income


                                                12
ratio. As with the elasticity measures, the effect of house prices on debt to income ratios is

completely insensitive to individual level controls (columns 7 and 8), and only slightly sensitive

to zip code level demographics and income patterns (column 9).

        Figure 3 presents the non-parametric plot of the effect of house price growth on debt

growth across the full distribution. It shows the second stage of the IV estimate in column 2 of

Table II by plotting total debt growth from 2002-2006 against predicted house price growth over

the same period. As Figure 3 shows, the effect is close to linear with a slight convexity near the

middle of the distribution. The pattern is also robust across almost the entire distribution,

although the statistical precision is lower at the low end of the house price growth distribution.

        In Table III, we present IV estimates of the effect of an increase in home equity on home

borrowing in dollar units. The first stage estimate in column 1 implies that a one standard

deviation increase in housing supply inelasticity leads to a $30 thousand increase in home equity.

The second stage estimates in columns 2 through 5 suggest that 1997 homeowners borrow 25 to

30 cents on every dollar of additional home equity value. As columns 3 to 5 show, the estimate is

completely insensitive to both individual and zip code level control variables.

        One concern with the findings in Table II, Figure 3, and Table III is the validity of the

exclusion restriction. In other words, it is possible that differential trends in inelastic and elastic

MSAs during this time period would lead to differential borrowing patterns even in the absence

of differential house price growth. Of course, the robustness of our findings to a series of

rigorous control variables partially mitigates this concern, but omitted factors not captured by our

control variables could still be a worry.

        In Table IV, we further examine the exclusion restriction. Panel A presents evidence on

the correlation between housing supply inelasticity and zip code level measures of per capita

payroll, per capita wage, and total employment growth. Our goal in Panel A is to present

evidence on differential permanent income or productivity shocks that may drive household


                                                   13
borrowing and house price appreciation in inelastic areas. There is no evidence of differentially

stronger growth in per capita payroll or employment growth. While there is a positive correlation

between housing supply inelasticity and IRS per capita wage growth over the 2002 to 2006 time

period, this correlation is not robust across the different measures of payroll and employment

growth (columns 1 and 3).

       However, a comparison of the level of income growth from 2002 to 2006 is not

necessarily the proper empirical test. As permanent income theory would predict, what matters

for changes in household borrowing behavior is the change in expected income growth. When

we examine the difference in growth rates between 1998-2002 and 2002-2006, we find no

positive correlation with housing supply inelasticity. Instead, column 4 of Table IV presents

evidence that inelastic MSAs receive a negative payroll shock from 2002 to 2006.

       In Panel B, we conduct additional tests to examine the exclusion restriction. Columns 1

and 4 of Panel B show that the positive effect of house prices on borrowing is driven by an

increase in home (mortgage plus home equity) debt. The effect of house price growth on credit

card balances is statistically insignificant and very close to 0 for the credit card balances to

income ratio. These findings suggest that the channel through which consumers in inelastic

MSAs increase debt outstanding is home-equity related and not a general increase in the demand

for credit. In columns 5 and 6, we examine renters who never buy into the rising housing market

during the sample period. As the estimates show, there is no statistically significant differential

increase in borrowing among renters in inelastic areas.

       While it is impossible to test the exclusion restriction explicitly, there is little evidence to

suggest that the increased homeowner borrowing that we find in inelastic housing supply MSAs

is driven by something other than house prices. The fact that the increased borrowing is

concentrated in home-related debt is consistent with a home equity-based borrowing channel.

Further evidence in support of the validity of the exclusion restriction is presented in Section V


                                                  14
where we focus on cross-sectional heterogeneity in the effect of house prices on consumer

borrowing. As we show there, there is almost no differential effect for high credit score and low

credit card utilization borrowers, which suggests the absence of non-housing related factors

driving our results.

C. Within-MSA Empirical Strategy Based on 1997 Fraction of Subprime Borrowers

       This section presents an alternative IV strategy that exploits within- MSA variation at the

level of zip codes to identify the effect of house prices on homeowner borrowing. The motivation

for this test comes from Mian and Sufi (2009). They present evidence of a securitization-driven

shift in the supply of mortgages for new home purchase from 2002 to 2005 toward zip codes that

have a high fraction of subprime borrowers. Column 1 of Panel A in Table V replicates the basic

finding, which shows a strong positive correlation between new home purchase mortgage growth

from 2002 to 2006 and the fraction of borrowers with a credit score below 660 as of 1997.

       Mian and Sufi (2009) show that higher credit growth for home-purchase mortgages

occurs in subprime zip codes despite declining relative, and in some cases absolute, income

growth in these areas. Furthermore, 2002 to 2005 is the only period in the last 18 years in which

mortgage origination for home purchase is higher in areas with lower income growth.

       In columns 2 to 5 of Table V, Panel A, we replicate another finding of Mian and Sufi

(2009): the relative shift in the supply of mortgage credit for home purchase toward high

subprime share zip codes occurs even in the most elastic MSAs where there is no significant

house price growth. However, the shift in the supply of mortgage credit is stronger in more

inelastic housing supply MSAs that experience strong house price growth. Based on these

findings, Mian and Sufi (2009) argue that house price appreciation cannot fully explain the shift

in the supply of mortgage credit to high subprime areas, but house price growth strengthens the

effect through a collateral feedback mechanism (as in Kiyotaki and Moore (1997)).




                                                15
       Column 1 of Table V, Panel B presents evidence that the shift in the supply of credit

toward subprime share zip codes leads to higher house price growth in subprime zip codes

relative to prime zip codes within the same MSA. Columns 2 through 5 show that this effect is

only present in inelastic MSAs, as we would expect given the intuition on house prices and

supply elasticity in Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saiz (2008). Mian and Sufi (2009) present evidence

that the relative house price appreciation in high subprime share zip codes within inelastic MSAs

is credit-induced: they find that house price growth and income growth are negatively correlated

from 2002 to 2006 and that high subprime share zip codes experience relative house price

growth despite relatively negative income growth.

       Our instrumental variable strategy is designed to exploit credit-induced house price

appreciation in high subprime share zip codes within inelastic MSAs to estimate the effect of

house price appreciation on homeowner borrowing. The exact thought experiment is as follows.

Take two homeowners IP and IS with the same credit score as of 1997. The homeowners live in

the same inelastic MSA, but differ in the neighborhood of residence. Homeowner IP lives in a

prime neighborhood, while IS lives in a subprime neighborhood. We know from Mian and Sufi

(2009) that IS experiences a larger house price increase than IP as a result of the aggregate credit

supply expansion. Let BIS and BIP be the change in household borrowing for IS and IP

respectively during the price boom period. Then the double difference (BIS - BIP) provides one

possible reduced form measure of the effect of house prices on homeowner borrowing.

       However, a concern with this estimate is that despite IS and IP having the same initial

credit score, the fact that they live in different neighborhoods potentially makes them different

on unobserved dimensions. The unobserved dimensions could also affect the borrowing

decisions in a way that makes (BIS - BIP) a biased estimate of the direct house price effect.




                                                 16
       How does one control for the unobserved neighborhood effect of subprime versus prime

neighborhoods? The triple-difference strategy exploits the additional variation in housing supply

elasticity. In particular, as mentioned earlier, the difference in house prices of subprime versus

prime neighborhood disappears in elastic MSAs due to easily adjustable housing supply.

However, the unobserved dimension of neighborhood effects is still operating on homeowners

living in elastic MSAs. Let ES and EP be two homeowners with the same initial credit scores as

IS and IP. ES and EP live in subprime and prime neighborhoods of an elastic MSA respectively.

Then we can control for the unobserved neighborhood effect of homeowners living in subprime

areas by computing the triple difference: [(BIS - BIP)- (BES - BEP)].

       This idea translates into estimating the following reduced form regression equation:

(3)                ,                                      ,


               ,                  ,                   1999, 2000, … , 2008

which examines the growth in y from the base year 1998 to t for individual i living in zip code z

within MSA m. We relate the growth in y to MSA fixed effects, individual and zip code level

control variables (X), the fraction of subprime borrowers (Subprime) in zip code z within MSA m

in 1997, and the interaction between the zip code fraction of subprime borrowers and the housing

supply inelasticity (Inelasticity) of MSA m. The coefficient of interest is .

       Figure 4 presents the estimate of  for years 1999 to 2008. The top panel examines the

relative growth in house prices for high subprime share zip codes in highly inelastic MSAs.

Consistent with the estimates in Panel B of Table V, house price growth is strongest in subprime

zip codes of inelastic MSAs. In terms of magnitudes, the coefficient estimate for 2006 implies

that in the most inelastic MSA, a one standard deviation increase in the 1997 subprime share of

the zip code leads to a 15% increase in house prices from 2002 to 2006.

       The bottom two graphs show a relative increase in debt growth and debt to income ratios

for homeowners living in high subprime share zip codes within highly inelastic MSAs. Once


                                                 17
again, these graphs are based on a triple-difference estimate which compares homeowner

leverage in high subprime share zip codes within inelastic MSAs to both homeowners in high

subprime share zip codes in elastic MSAs and homeowners in low subprime share zip codes in

the same MSA. In terms of magnitudes, the coefficient estimate for 2006 implies that in the most

inelastic MSA, a one standard deviation increase in the 1998 subprime share of the zip code

leads to a 9% increase in debt and a 1/2 standard deviation increase in the homeowner debt to

income ratio from 2002 to 2006.

       Figure 4 suggests that a potential instrument for house prices is the zip code level share of

subprime borrowers as of 1997 interacted with MSA housing supply inelasticity. In Panel C of

Table V, we examine how this instrument is correlated with debt and debt to income levels in

2002. As Panel C shows, homeowners’ debt amounts and debt to income ratios in high subprime

share zip codes within inelastic MSAs are not significantly different than homeowners in high

subprime share zip codes within elastic MSAs prior to the house price acceleration in 2002.

       The results in Table V and Figure 4 together with the results in Mian and Sufi (2009)

motivate the following within-MSA instrumental variables specification:

(4)                      0206                               ,


                  0206

(5)                       0206                                  ,


            ,                    ,


Equation (5) represents the first stage in which house price growth from 2002 to 2006 is

instrumented with the interaction of zip code level subprime share as of 1997 and MSA level

housing supply inelasticity. Equation (4) represents the second stage in which we examine the

growth in leverage for homeowners as a function of predicted house price growth. The control

variables in X include median home value in the zip code and individual credit score, income,

sex, and age. The control variables imply that we are comparing two homeowners with the same



                                                18
age, same credit score, same sex, and same income, but one resides in a high subprime share zip

code within an inelastic housing supply MSA.

        The second stage estimates for both debt growth and the change in debt to income are

presented in Table VI. The estimates from the within-MSA specification are slightly higher than

the estimates from the across-MSA analysis presented in the previous sub-section. The inclusion

of control variables does not change the debt growth specification estimate. However, the effect

of house price growth on the change in debt to income is more sensitive to the inclusion of

control variables.

        The within-MSA approach in Table VI explores a different source of house price

variation relative to the across-MSA approach of Table II. In econometric terms, both the across

and within approaches are local average treatment effect (LATE) estimators with the “local

average” computed over mutually exclusive parts of the house price distribution. Yet the two

approaches produce quite consistent estimates of the effect of house prices on homeowner

borrowing. It should be kept in mind that the majority of the overall house price variation is

across MSAs.8 For this reason, the across-MSA estimate is economically more meaningful,

while the within-MSA estimate serves as a useful robustness check.

III. The Macroeconomic Impact of the Home Equity-Based Borrowing Channel

A. What Are Consumers Doing with Borrowed Money?

        What do homeowners do with the money borrowed against home equity? The question is

important in order to understand the real effects of the home equity-based borrowing channel.

For example, if home equity borrowing is used to pay down other more expensive forms of

consumer credit such as credit card debt, then home equity borrowing may not have a large




8
  Variance decomposition of house price growth from 2002 to 2006 at the zip code level reveals a between-MSA
standard deviation of 0.22 and a within-MSA standard deviation of 0.06. See Table I in Mian and Sufi (2009).


                                                      19
aggregate impact. However, if home equity-based borrowing is used primarily for consumption

or home improvement, then the real and policy implications are substantial.

       We first test whether high house prices lead homeowners to “trade up” by taking a bigger

mortgage to move to a bigger home. Our data records the current zip code of each individual

borrower. We can therefore construct an indicator variable for whether a homeowner moves

from 2002 to 2006. Columns 1 and 2 of Panel A in Table VII show that house price appreciation

is not correlated with the probability of moving. This is true when examining the OLS

specification or when using MSA housing supply inelasticity as an instrument for house price

growth. These estimates are inconsistent with the argument that households are much more likely

to move to new homes after realizing an increased value of home equity. In columns 3 and 4,

respectively, we split the sample into homeowners that move and do not move zip codes between

2002 and 2006. The elasticity of debt growth with respect to house price growth is similar in

both samples. Taken together, the estimates in Panel A are inconsistent with the argument that

homeowners use borrowed money primarily to finance the purchase of new homes.

       In Panel B, we examine whether homeowners use the increased value of home equity to

buy investment properties. This may be a concern given that the percentage of households in the

Survey of Consumer Finances that have outstanding debt on a residential property other than

their primary residence increased from 4.6% in 2001 to 5.5% in 2007 (Bucks, Kennickell, Mach,

and Moore (2009), Aizcorbe, Kennickell, and Moore (2003)). While we do not have data on the

purchase of investment properties, the consumer credit reports contain the number of mortgage

accounts. Under the assumption that consumers must obtain a new mortgage to purchase an

investment property, we should detect any systematic use of increased home equity to purchase

an investment property by examining the number of mortgage accounts.

       Column 1 and 2 of Panel B show that the change in the number of mortgage accounts

from 2002 to 2006 is negatively correlated with house price growth. In other words, our


                                               20
estimates suggest that homeowners in high house price appreciation MSAs are less likely to buy

investment properties. In column 3, we control for the change in the number of mortgage

accounts and find a similar elasticity of debt growth with respect to house price growth. Finally,

in column 4, we exclude any consumer with any change in the number of mortgage accounts and

find a similar estimate of the effect of house price growth on debt growth. Taken together, the

evidence in Panel B is inconsistent with the hypothesis that households use increased home

equity to buy investment properties.

        We do not have individual information on financial assets. However, evidence from the

Survey of Consumer Finances is inconsistent with the view that homeowners use borrowing to

buy additional financial assets.9 According to the SCF, the fraction of families holding almost

every class of financial security declined from 2001 to 2007. This is true of stocks (21.3% to

17.9%), savings bonds (16.7% to 14.9%), and pooled investment vehicles (17.7% to 11.4%).

Only retirement accounts increased slightly (52.2% to 52.6%). Conditional on having a financial

asset, the SCF reports a decline in the median value of financial assets from $29.8 thousand to

$25.3 thousand from 2001 to 2007.

        One additional fact is also inconsistent with the hypothesis that consumers use home

equity-based borrowing to purchase financial assets. As we show in the next section, the home

equity borrowing channel is stronger among low credit quality and high credit card utilization

individuals. Evidence from the SCF suggests that participation among lower income and lower

net worth individuals dropped even more dramatically than the average from 2001 to 2007.

        The evidence is inconsistent with the argument that consumers borrowed against

increased home equity to purchase real estate or financial assets. In Panel C, we explore whether

consumers use increased home equity-based borrowing to pay down outstanding credit card

Kennickell, and Moore (2006)


                                                     21
balances. This is a useful exercise given that the mean interest rate on outstanding credit card

debt is 12.5% according to the SCF (Bucks, Kennickell, Mach, and Moore (2009)). If consumers

do not pay down credit card balances, then it suggests that homeowners derive considerable

marginal utility from the use of home-equity based borrowing.

         Panel C isolates the sample to homeowners in the top quartile of the credit card

utilization distribution as of 1997. The mean credit card balance outstanding among this group is

almost $10 thousand and the mean credit card utilization rate (amount outstanding divided by the

high limit) is 0.71. Column 1 shows an elasticity of home debt borrowing with respect to house

price growth of 0.8 among this sample. Despite the large increase in home-equity based

borrowing and the large amount of outstanding credit card balances, the estimates in columns 2

and 4 show that these individuals do not pay down credit card balances in response to house

price growth.10 While we cannot see the exact use of borrowed funds in our data, the results in

Panel C suggest that the marginal return to the use of borrowed funds is quite high.

         While we do not have direct data on real outlays by individuals, we are able to

demonstrate that consumers do not use home equity-based borrowing to buy real estate or

financial assets, and consumers do not use borrowed funds to pay down credit card debt with a

high interest rate. While more evidence is needed, our findings are suggestive that a large

fraction of home equity-based borrowing is used for consumption or home improvement. This

conclusion is consistent with survey evidence by Brady, Canner, and Maki (2000) who find that

from 1998 to 1999, 40% of households cite home improvement as a reason for home equity

extraction, and 39% cite consumer expenditures. Using similar survey data, Canner, Dynan, and

Passmore (2002) find that over 50% of funds liquefied from home equity are used for either
10
  Ideally, we would want to examine outstanding credit card debt on which interest is being paid. However, the
credit bureau only collects outstanding credit card balances. Several tests suggest that balances are strongly
correlated with outstanding debt, especially among high credit card utilization individuals. Increases in credit card
balances are strongly positively correlated with future default, and outstanding credit card balances are strongly
negatively correlated with credit scores. Further, given that all of our tests are done in first-differences, any error in
using balances instead of debt that is similar across housing supply elasticity is removed.

home improvement or consumer expenditures.

B. The Macroeconomic Impact of the Household Borrowing Channel

        Since our estimates of the home equity-based borrowing channel is based on a

representative sample of the U.S., we can integrate our estimated effect to compute the economy

wide magnitude of home equity-based borrowing due to higher house prices.

        How much of the increase in mortgage credit can be attributed to a direct effect of

existing homeowners borrowing against the increasing value of their housing equity? We start

with our baseline estimate of column 2 in Table II that suggests that homeowners increase their

total borrowing by 0.6 percent for every 1.0 percent increase in house prices. Since our estimated

effect is based on a difference in differences approach, the level impact of house prices on

borrowing is not identifiable. Therefore, the appropriate in-sample aggregate effect of our

estimate should be computed using relative differences in house price growth.

        Let i index an MSA such that the MSAs are ordered by their housing supply inelasticity

with i=1 being the most elastic. Let ∆ be the predicted percentage change in house prices for

MSA i given its supply inelasticity. Given our home equity-based borrowing elasticity estimate

of 0.6, the average percentage change in total borrowing due to the house price channel for

homeowner living in MSA i is given by 0.6               ∆       ∆    ]. Since we know each homeowner’s

level of initial debt, we can convert the percentage change in debt into new debt taken out in

dollars. Aggregating this procedure for all MSAs gives us an aggregate borrowing due to house

price appreciation effect of $1.45 trillion dollars over four years from 2002 to 2006.11 This

increase represents 59.2% of the overall increase in debt of homeowners from 2002 to 2006.

11
  The sum of home equity-based borrowing over our regression sample is equal to $2.21 billion. Since our random
sample has a sampling rate of 0.494%, and we dropped 18.3% of homeowners (dollar-weighted) due to early moves,
the total effect in our sample of zip codes is: $2.21/(0.00494*(1-0.183))= $548 billion. The zip codes in our
regression sample represent 26.5% of U.S. household credit in 2002. To estimate the home-equity borrowing
channel effect for remaining zip codes not in our sample, we apply our home equity-based borrowing elasticity
estimate of 0.6 to the house price appreciation for these zip codes. House price appreciation is measured using zip
code level price estimate from zillow.com wherever possible, and using MSA level OFHEO price index otherwise.


                                                        23
        The aggregate increase in debt due to house price appreciation represents 2.8% of GDP

per year over the four years. While we do not have data on real outlays, our previous evidence

suggests that it is likely that some of the borrowings are used for consumption and home

improvement. If we take the extreme view that all of borrowed money is used for real outlays,

then our estimate helps explain the drop in the savings rate during this time period.

IV. Does the Home Equity-Based Borrowing Channel Vary By Consumer Type?

        Our estimates above suggest a large response of homeowner borrowing to increases in

the value of home equity. In this section, we explore cross-sectional heterogeneity of the effect.

Our goal is to provide insight into the underlying model of consumer behavior that is most

consistent with the home equity-based borrowing channel.

        We first examine how the propensity to borrow against increased home equity varies by

the homeowner’s base year credit score and credit card utilization rate. Credit scores play an

important role in the availability and pricing of consumer credit, and consumers below critical

thresholds are often unable to obtain financing at reasonable interest rates.12 Credit card

utilization rate is measured by the fraction of the total available credit card limit that is used.

Credit scores and credit card utilization rates have a correlation coefficient of -0.88 in our sample

of homeowners, and an OLS regression of one on the other yields an R2 of 0.78. The literature on

consumer credit often interprets low credit scores and high credit card utilization rates as

indicators for liquidity constrained households (see Gross and Souleles (2002)). However, such

variables may also be systematically correlated with an underlying behavioral attribute of

households such as self-control problems.




For 16.6% of dollar-weighted zip codes, we do not have any house price data and assume a home equity borrowing
effect of 0 to be conservative. The aggregate home equity borrowing effect comes out to be $1.45 trillion.

                                                      24
       The top four panels of Figure 5 examine debt growth patterns for inelastic and elastic

MSAs by 1997 homeowner credit score and credit card utilization rate. We define “high” and

“low” categories as the top and bottom quartile of the respective distribution. The top panel of

Figure 5 shows a very strong home equity-based borrowing effect for low credit quality

borrowers. In contrast there is almost no effect for high quality borrowers as both elastic and

inelastic debt growth path are similar throughout the sample period. A similar pattern is revealed

in the middle panel that uses 1997 credit card utilization to separate borrowers.

       The top four panels of Figure 5 provide support for the exclusion restriction in our

instrumental variables specification. The fact that there is almost no difference in borrowing

between inelastic and elastic MSAs for high credit quality and low credit card utilization zip

codes is inconsistent with a general non-housing related credit demand shift in inelastic MSAs.

An alternative channel for higher borrowing in inelastic MSAs must explain why the effect is

absent in high credit score and low credit card utilization individuals.

       As we discuss in Section II.A, a standard model without liquidity constraints

hypothesizes that older consumers should be more willing to extract cash from the increased

value of home equity. The bottom two panels of Figure 5 do not show evidence in favor of this

hypothesis. We split the sample into consumers in the lowest and highest quartile of the age

distribution, and we find that inelastic-elastic differential in debt growth is not significantly

different for young and old homeowners.

As equation (7) shows, the instruments in the first stage are housing supply inelasticity and

housing supply inelasticity interacted with the relevant interaction variable listed at the top of the

column in Table VIII. In column 1, the estimated coefficient on the interaction term is negative,

which implies that the effect of house price growth on home equity-based borrowing from 2002

to 2006 is lower for individuals with a higher 1997 credit score. The magnitude of the difference

is large. For a consumer one standard deviation above the mean 1997 credit score, the elasticity

of debt with respect to house prices is 0.35. For a consumer one standard deviation below the

mean 1997 credit score, the elasticity is 0.83.

         The positive estimate on the interaction term in column 2 implies that individuals with a

high credit card utilization rate have a larger borrowing response to house price growth. The

estimate implies that for a consumer one standard deviation below the mean 1997 credit card

utilization rate, the elasticity of debt with respect to house prices is 0.37. For a consumer one

standard deviation above the mean 1997 credit card utilization rate, the elasticity is 0.85.

         The coefficient estimate on the interaction term is not significant for either sex or

household income. The coefficient estimate on the age interaction term in column 4 is negative

and marginally statistically significant with a p-value of 0.11. In column 5, we create an

independent interaction term for homeowners over the age of 65. As the interaction term

coefficient estimate shows, individuals over 65 have a lower sensitivity of borrowing to house

price growth. The evidence suggests that the borrowing of older consumers is less responsive to

house price growth than young consumers, which is inconsistent with standard life-cycle models

of consumer financial behavior.13

V. Home Equity-Based Borrowing and the Financial Crisis




13
  In unreported results, we find similar results for cross-sectional heterogeneity of the home equity-based borrowing
effect using the within-MSA specification outlined in Section II.C.


                                                         26
       The evidence above shows the importance of the home equity-based borrowing channel

during the U.S. housing boom. What role did the unprecedented increase in leverage for high

house price growth homeowners play in the ensuing financial crisis? A unique advantage of our

data set is that we can estimate the default rate implications of aggressive home equity-based

borrowing when house price growth decelerates and turns negative. Moreover, since the

purchase of autos (a key durable good) is often financed through auto loans, we can estimate the

effect of household leverage in explaining the plummet of auto sales during the downturn.

       The top panel in Figure 6 examines total debt default rates for 1997 homeowners in the

highest and lowest quartile MSAs based on house price inelasticity. As previous results show,

homeowners in inelastic MSAs experience both a sharp rise in house price growth and home

equity-based borrowing from 2002 to 2006 relative to homeowners in elastic MSAs. As the top

panel shows, there is a contemporaneous relative decline in the default rate for homeowners in

inelastic versus elastic MSAs. From 2006 to 2008, default rates for homeowners in inelastic

MSAs experience a sharp increase in default rates, surpassing the default rate in inelastic areas.

       We also split the sample into borrowers in the lowest and highest quartile of the credit

quality distribution. As the middle panel shows, low credit quality borrowers in inelastic MSAs

experience a very sharp relative decline in default rates. From 2001 to 2005, the default rate falls

by almost five full percentage points in inelastic MSAs, whereas it falls by only two percentage

points in elastic MSAs. Recall that it is precisely low credit quality borrowers in inelastic MSAs

that experience the largest increase in home equity-based borrowing during this time period.

       When house prices begin to decelerate and fall from 2006 to 2008, the default rate for

low credit quality borrowers in inelastic MSAs skyrockets past the default rate for high credit

quality borrowers. The magnitude is very large. The default rate for low credit quality

homeowners increases by more than 12 percentage points from 2005 to 2008 in inelastic MSAs.

The corresponding increase in elastic MSAs is less than 4 percentage points.


                                                 27
       Table IX presents estimates of the effect of house price growth on the change in default

rates from 2002 to 2006. The instrumental variables specification in columns 1 and 2 is similar to

the specification outlined in equations (1) and (2) above, except we examine default rates as the

outcome variable. Consistent with Figure 6, we find a negative correlation between default rates

and house price growth from 2002 to 2006. The estimate in column 2 implies that a one standard

deviation increase in house prices leads to a 1 percentage point decrease in default rates.

       In columns 3 through 7, we examine how house price growth differentially affects the

decline in default rates from 2002 to 2006 for different homeowners. The instrumental variables

specification is similar to the specification outlined in equations (6) and (7) above. The estimates

in columns 3 and 4 show that lower credit quality and higher credit card utilization rate

homeowners experience an even stronger decline in default rates from 2002 to 2006. In other

words, the exact same borrowers experiencing the largest effect of house prices on home equity-

based borrowing also experience the largest declines in default rates from 2002 to 2006.

       Table X presents the analogous specifications that examine the increase in default rates

from 2006 to 2008. The coefficient estimate on house price growth in column 2 is positive and

statistically distinct from zero at a high confidence level. In other words, lagged house price

growth strongly predicts future default rates. As the specifications with interaction terms show,

the effect of lagged house price growth on future defaults is strongest among low credit quality

and high credit card utilization households. The magnitude of the difference is very large.

Among homeowners one standard deviation below the mean 1997 credit score, a one standard

deviation increase in house prices from 2002 to 2006 leads to a full standard deviation increase

in default rates from 2006 to 2008. In contrast, among homeowners one standard deviation above

the mean 1997 credit score, a one standard deviation increase in house prices from 2002 to 2006

leads to 1/6 standard deviation increase in default rates from 2006 to 2008.




                                                 28
       To obtain the macroeconomic magnitudes, we can repeat our analysis from Section III.B

to examine the effect of house price appreciation on total defaults for the U.S. economy. Taking

the estimate of 0.085 from column 1 of Table X, we find that defaults due to the home equity-

based borrowing channel represent 34.8% percent of total new defaults in the U.S. economy.

This suggests that the current mortgage default crisis is not entirely driven by individuals buying

into a rising housing market. A significant part of the default crisis is driven by existing

homeowners borrowing heavily against the rising value of their house.

       Figure 7 provides suggestive evidence on the effect of increased household leverage on

the consumption contraction during the recent recession. The top panel compares the evolution

of auto loans for elastic and inelastic MSAs for homeowners in the top and bottom quartile of

credit score distribution as of 1997. The top-left panel shows a sharp (relative) reduction in auto

loans starting in 2006 for low credit quality homeowners living in inelastic MSAs. The

magnitude of this drop is also large at almost 20%. There is no such relative drop for high credit

quality homeowners living in inelastic MSAs.

       The bottom panel repeats this exercise for homeowners in the top and bottom quartile of

credit card utilization distribution in 1997. Consistent with the top panel, homeowners with a

high credit card utilization rate as of 1997 significantly cut back their purchase of autos with

financing, while there is no such effect for homeowners with low credit card utilization. In

unreported regression results, we find that the differential drop in auto loans over 2006 to 2008

for homeowners in inelastic MSAs is statistically significant at the 1% level.

       From 2002 to 2006, high credit card utilization rate and low credit score homeowners in

high house price growth MSAs borrow heavily against the increased value of home equity and

experience a sharp relative decline in default rates. These same individuals experience a very

large relative increase in default rates and sharp reduction in auto loans when house prices




                                                 29
decelerate and fall from 2006 to 2008. These results highlight the important role that increased

homeowner leverage played in the financial and economic downturn of recent years.

VI. Conclusion

       We provide evidence of a strong link between asset prices and household borrowing

decisions. The use of individual level data and an instrumental variables methodology enables us

to precisely estimate the magnitude of the home equity-based borrowing channel. Since our

individual level data is representative of U.S. household sector, we can provide an estimate of the

economy-wide effect of the rise in house prices on household borrowing during the period of

strong house price growth from 2002 to 2006.

       The macroeconomic estimate of the effect of house price on household borrowing is

large. We also show evidence that the increase in homeowner borrowing is not used to buy new

houses, buy investment properties, or pay down costly consumer debt. Taken together, these

findings lend support to the view that home equity-based borrowing is used for real outlays.

While the effect of collateral on macroeconomic fluctuations has typically focused on business

investment (Bernanke and Gertler (1989), Kiyotaki and Moore (1997)), our evidence suggests

that fluctuations in house prices and household credit availability may play an important role in

the evolution of business cycles. Exploring this link is an important question moving forward.

       Our results also highlight the importance of understanding the microeconomic

foundations of household behavior. We find that the home equity-based borrowing channel is

driven primarily by homeowners with low credit scores and high credit card utilization rates.

This may suggest that house price appreciation allows previously credit-constrained homeowners

to move toward their optimal level of borrowing and consumption. However, it may also imply

house price appreciation provides greater access to borrowing for homeowners that suffer from

behavioral biases such as adaptive house price expectations (Agarwal (2007)), dynamically

inconsistent preferences, or self-control problems.

                                             Summary Statistics
This table presents summary statistics for 67,489 individuals who have either an existing mortgage account with
positive balance as of 1997 or a previous mortgage account. The sample is further restricted to individuals that do
not move zip codes between 1997 and 1999. Individuals are sorted into groups of at least 5 individuals. Each group
consists of individuals living in the same zip code as of 1997, and the individuals are sorted by 1997 credit score
before groups are formed. The income in the denominator of the debt to income ratio comes from zip level IRS data.
The zip code level median home value as of 2002 comes from the 2000 value reported in the decennial Census
multiplied by the growth rate from 2000 to 2002 reported in the Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss data. The housing supply
inelasticity measure we use is three – the Saiz (2008) measure. The Saiz (2008) measure is increasing in elasticity
from 0 to 3. There are 2,046 zip codes and 45 MSAs that are represented in the sample.

                The Effect of House Prices on Household Borrowing for 1997 Homeowners, Dollar for Dollar Changes
This table presents estimates of the effect of house prices on household borrowing for individuals who have either an existing mortgage account with positive
balance as of 1997 or a previous mortgage account. Individual dummy variables are quintile indicator variables for 2% bins of the 1997 credit score, 2008
income, and 1997 age variables. Census controls are zip code level variables for the vacancy rate, fraction white, fraction black, education indicator variables for
less than high school and high school diploma only, the unemployment rate, the poverty rate, and the fraction of households in the zip code living in an urban
setting, all measured as of 2000. Income controls are zip code level variables from the IRS and Census business statistics for the logarithm of the 2002
employment, per capita wage, and per capita payroll level, and the growth in wage, payroll and employment from 1997 to 2000, 2000 to 2002, and 2002 to 2006.

This table presents evidence on the exclusion restriction for the MSA-level analysis in Tables II and III. Panel A examines the correlation between economic
activity and housing supply elasticity in the sample of homeowners. “Growth shocks” represent the differences in 1998 to 2002 and 2002 to 2006 growth rates
for each respective variable. Panel B examines the home debt and credit card balances for homeowners and debt patterns for renters. Renters are defined as
individuals that have no housing related debt from 1997 to 2006. All standard errors are clustered at the MSA level.

                        Motivation for Within-MSA Test Based on 1997 Subprime Share of Zip Code Population
Panel A shows the effect of subprime fraction in the zip code on mortgage origination growth for home purchase at the zip code level by MSA housing supply
elasticity. The zip code level mortgage origination growth data come from HMDA. Panel B shows the effect of the 1997 fraction of subprime individuals in the
zip code on house price growth from 2002 to 2006 by MSA housing supply elasticity. Panel C shows the correlation between the instrument, subprime share of
total population interacted with housing supple elasticity, and measures of debt as of 2002. Individual dummy variables are quintile indicator variables for 2%
bins of the 2002 median home value in the zip code, 1997 credit score, 2008 income, and 1997 age variables. All specifications include MSA fixed effects and
standard errors are clustered at the MSA level.

                           What Do Homeowners Do with Borrowed Money?
Panel A examines whether households in high house price growth areas are more likely to move to a new zip code
and whether movers and non-movers experience differential growth rates in debt from 2002 to 2006. Panel B
examines whether households in high house price growth areas are more likely to increase their number of
mortgages, which is a proxy for the purchase of an investment property. Panel C isolates the sample to individuals in
the top quartile of the 1997 credit card utilization distribution and examines whether households in high house price
appreciation areas are more likely to pay down credit card balances. All specifications include control variables for
individual 1997 credit score, 2008 income, age, and sex. Standard errors are clustered at the MSA level.

               Cross-Sectional Heterogeneity in Effect of House Prices on Household Borrowing for 1997 Homeowners
This table presents estimates of the cross-sectional heterogeneity of the effect of house prices on household borrowing for individuals that have either positive
outstanding mortgage debt as of 1997 or a previous mortgage account. In each column, we interact house price growth with the variable in the top of the column.
The instruments in the first stage are MSA level housing supply elasticity and MSA level housing supply elasticity interacted with the interaction variable listed
in the top of the column. In all columns, we use the data sorts that maximize variation in the interaction variable. More specifically, in columns 1 and 2 we use
data sorted by credit score before groups are formed. In columns 3 to 6, we use data sorted by each interaction variable before groups are formed. All standard
errors are clustered at the MSA level.

                  The Effect of House Prices from 2002-2006 on Default Rates from 2006-2008 for 1997 Homeowners
This table presents the effect of house price growth from 2002 to 2006 on default rates from 2006 to 2008. In columns 3 to 6, we interact house price growth with
the variable in the top of the column. The instruments in the first stage are MSA level housing supply elasticity and MSA level housing supply elasticity
interacted with the interaction variable listed in the top of the column. In all columns, we use the data sorts that maximize variation in the interaction variable.
More specifically, in columns 3 and 4 we use the data sorted by credit score before groups are formed. In columns 5 to 7, we use the data sorted by each
interaction variable before groups are formed. All standard errors are clustered at the MSA level.

            The Effect of House Prices on Total Debt Growth for 1997 Homeowners
This figure presents the effect of house price growth on total debt growth from 2002 to 2006 across the full
distribution. The first stage instrument is the MSA-level housing supply elasticity from Saiz (2008). The sample
includes individuals with mortgage debt outstanding as of 1997 who do not move zip codes between 1997 and 1999.

where y is the natural logarithm of house prices in the top graph, the natural logarithm of total debt in the middle
graph, and the debt to income ratio in the bottom graph. The graphs show differential patterns for homeowners
living in high subprime share zip codes in inelastic housing supply MSAs relative to both homeowners living in low
subprime share zip codes in the same MSA and homeowners in high subprime share zip codes in elastic housing
supply MSAs.

                                       Summary Statistics for Renters
This table presents summary statistics for individuals who have no current or previous mortgage debt outstanding.
Individuals are sorted into groups of at least 5 individuals. Each group consists of individuals living in the same zip
code as of 1997, and the individuals are sorted by 1997 credit score before groups are formed. The income in the
denominator of the debt to income ratio comes from zip level IRS data. The zip code level median home value as of
2002 comes from the 2000 value reported in the decennial Census multiplied by the growth rate from 2000 to 2002
reported in the Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss data. The housing supply inelasticity measure we use is three – the Saiz
(2008) measure. The Saiz (2008) measure is increasing in elasticity from 0 to 3. There are 2,075 zip codes and 45
MSAs that are represented in the sample.

                              Summary Statistics for Moving Homeowners
This table presents summary statistics for individuals who have either an existing mortgage account with positive
balance as of 1997 or a previous mortgage account, and move zip codes between 1997 and 1999. Individuals are
sorted into groups of at least 5 individuals. Each group consists of individuals living in the same zip code as of 1997,
and the individuals are sorted by 1997 credit score before groups are formed. The income in the denominator of the
debt to income ratio comes from zip level IRS data. The zip code level median home value as of 2002 comes from
the 2000 value reported in the decennial Census multiplied by the growth rate from 2000 to 2002 reported in the
Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss data. The housing supply inelasticity measure we use is three – the Saiz (2008) measure.
The Saiz (2008) measure is increasing in elasticity from 0 to 3. There are 3,016 zip codes and 83 MSAs that are
represented in the sample.
