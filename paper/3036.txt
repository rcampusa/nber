                    TREASURY BILL RATES IN THE 1970s AND 1980s


                                     ABSTRACT



   As  is widely recognized, real interest rates in the early 1980s were at
peaks not witnessed since the late 1920s. Less well perceived is the sharp
decline in real interest rates since 1984. By 1986—88, real interest rates
were back at their average levels of the previous quarter century. This paper
seeks to identify the underlying determinants of the major movements in real
six—month Treasury bill rates.

    The rise in real interest rates between the middle 1970s and early 1980s,
not surprisingly, results from a variety of factors. First, rates were
unusually low in the middle 1970s owing to the first OPEC shock, which lowered
investment demand and increased world saving by transferring wealth from the
high—consuming developed countries to OPEC. Second. tight money, high
inflation, and hel ghtened nucl ear fear all contributed to real rates becoming
unusually high in the early 1980s. The eventual decline of OPEC surpluses
following the second OPEC shock prolonged the period of high real rates. The
decline in real rates to more normal levels in the 1986—88 period is also due
to multiple factors:   lower inflation, declining marginal tax rates, and easy
monetary policy.

    As is well known, real interest rates in the early 1980s were at peaks not
witnessed since the late 1920s (Clarida and Friedman, 1983; Hendershott,
1986).   These rates have generally been attributed to tight monetary policy
(Clarida and Friedman), easy fiscal policy (Feldstein, 1985), or a combination
of the two (Blanchard and Suriiiiers, 1984. and their discussants).     Changes in

private saving and investment propensities have been given secondary billing.
Less well known is the sharp decline in real interest rates after 1984.
    Movements in pretax and after—tax ex ante real six—month Treasury bill
rates are shown in Figure   1.1    The high pretax real rates in the 1981—85
period are obvious, as are the subsequent lower rates since then.2 Equally
obvious are the low real rates in the middle l97O. These low rates might
cause one to view recent real rates as still being high.        In fact, though, the
average real bill rate in the 1986—88 period exactly equals the real rate over
the last three decades. On an after—tax basis, the low 1970s rates stand out
far more than the high 1980s rates.       After—tax real rates were more than a
full percentage point below zero throughout the 1974—80 period, while
after—tax rates in the 1981—85 period were hardly above their average value
for the 1960s.   Finally, Figure    1   suggests a strong cyclical pattern in real
rates, with the pretax real rate rising by two to three percentage points from
trough to peak over each business cycle (the last cycle being a possible
exception).4
    This paper seeks to identify the underlying determinants of the major
movements in these real bill rates.       Our innovations to the "standard's
pre—1980s model are the addition of a new private saving shifter (Slemrods
nuclear fear variable) and lagged values of all variables in the economy s
expenditure function (to reflect short—term disequilibrium in the goods
market).   He also develop a new measure of monetary policy because customary
empirical measures (e.g., the level of the money supply or the acceleration in
money growth) lose meaning when deposit rate ceilings are removed and new
liquid financial claims are Introduced.       Host of those who attribute high real
rates in the 1980s to tight monetary policy do so by default —— it must be
monetary policy because nothing else seems to explain the high rates —— rather
than by relating interest rates to a measure of monetary tightness or ease.
    The same factors explain the surge in the early 1980s and the subsequent
decline in both before—tax and after—tax real interest rates.       The erosion of
the second OPEC shock, a tightening of monetary policy, a nuclear—fear—induced
decline in the propensity to save, and an increase in expected inflation all
contributed to the jump in real rates in the early 1980s. The decline in real
rates since then is due to a decline in expected inflation and the longest
period of monetary ease in the last thirty years.
    This paper is divided into four parts.       The model is presented in Section
I, and the empirical estimates are reported in Section II.       An interpretation
of the major shifts in real bill rates, both before— and after—tax, is
presented in Section III, and our findings are summarized in Section IV.
                      I. Derivation of the Estimation Equation
     The initial interest—rate model is based on a relatively simple
specification of IS and LH equations.     The goods and money market equilibria
can be expressed as
     (1) V — E(i*_w, GAP, DEF, OPEC, PSAV)
                 (—)  (—)  (+)   (—)  (—)

                  and

     (2) H/P — L(V, i, OPEC).
                (+)(—)    (—)



Real expenditures depend on the after—tax real interest rate defined as the


                                        —2—
after—tax nominal rate less the expected inflation rate (i*_lr),     the   real GNP

gap (GAP), the full—employment federal budget deficit (DEF), OPEC supply
shocks (OPEC), and a private saving shifter (PSAV).       Real money demand depends

on real income (Y), the after—tax nominal interest rate (j*), and asset demand
shifts associated with the OPEC shocks.       The presumed partial derivatives of
the expenditure and money demand functions with respect to these arguments are
indicated in parentheses.     The after—tax nominal interest rate is simply
(l—t)i, where t is the marginal tax rate on interest income and      i   is the
pretax nom1na rate.
    Many of the hypothesized responses of planned expenditures in the IS and
LM equations are straightforward.    Money demand rises with increases in income
and falls with an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money, the
after—tax nominal interest rate.     Increases in the after—tax real interest
rate and the real GNP gap (defined as potential minus actual real GNP, divided
by potential real GNP) are each hypothesized to reduce real expenditures,
while an increase in the full—employment federal budget deficit is
hypothesized to increase real expenditures.5
    The OPEC oil shocks shift both the IS and LM curves.      An increase in the
relative price of energy would reduce the demand for capital, and hence
investment, and thus lower the IS curve (Wilcox, 1983).      Such a shock also
would transfer real income to oil—exporting countries.       If these countries
desire to maintain a higher proportion of their wealth portfolios in U.S.
financial assets than did those who lost wealth (Japan, Europe and the U.S.),
the LM curve will shift downward.     Furthermore, because the marginal
propensity to save of the oi exporting countries exceeded (at 'east
initially) that of the rest of the world, world saving increased (Sachs, 1981;
Peek and Wilcox, 1983).     This would lower the IS curve to the extent that a
part of the associated decline in aggregate world expenditures represents a

                                        —3—
reduction in expenditures on U.S. goods and services.
      The private saving shifter is based on Slemrod's (1986) hypothesis that
heightened fear of nuclear war reduces 'private saving.        If war is considered
imminent, the return to saving is a large negative number.         His proxy for
nuclear fear is the minutes—to—midnight series published monthly by Ih
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The fewer are the minutes left till
midnight, the closer is war, the lower is the incentive to save, and the
higher would real interest rates be.
      Assuming continuous equilibrium in financial and goods markets, equations
(1) and (2) can be combined in a straightforward manner to yield a
reduced—form equation for the after—tax nominal interest rate:
      (3) i — F(ir, GAP, HIP,   DEF, OPEC, PSAV).
                (+) (—)   (—)   (+)   (—)     (—)



The   nominal after—tax interest rate would be expected to rise with increases
in the expected inflation rate (but by less than percentage point for
percentage point) and the full—employment budget deficit.         Increases in the
GNP gap, the real money supply, real oil prices, and the propensity of private
citizens to save would lead to lower interest rates.
      Because financial markets adjust quickly, the economy can plausibly be
assumed to be continuously on the LM curve.         However, temporary disequilibrium
in the goods market can result In the economy being off the long—run IS
curve.    As a result, shifts in either the IS or LH schedule do not immediately
move the economy to the new (i*,Y) equilibrium (Horwich, 1964, pp. 525—528).
An outward shift of the IS curve moves the economy gradually (along the LM
curve) to the higher interest ratelincome equilibrium.         Thus, lagged values of
the IS shifters should enter equation (3).          In contrast, when the LM curve
shifts, the interest rate overshoots the new equilibrium.          For example, an
easing of monetary policy causes the interest rate initially to decline

                                            -4—
sharply   with little change in income and then to rise (along the new LM
curve) with income to the new equilibrium.
    The overshOot and reversal can be captured by including the difference
between the current growth rate of the money supply and its recent average
growth rate (MACC) as a regressor in equation (3) (Peek and Hilcox, 1986).                 If
this accelerated growth rate is maintained, MACC gradually reverts to zero and
the overshooting of the interest rate decline is eliminated. He would expect
the coefficient on MACC to be negative.          The revised interest rate equation is
then:
 (4) i — F(M/P, MACC; current and lagged values of ir,         GAP,   DEF, OPEC, PSAV)
             (—)     (—)                                   (+) (—)    (+)   (—)      (—)


                              II.    Bill Rate Equations
                                    A. The Basic Data
    The interest rate equation estimates are based on semiannual observations
corresponding to the frequency of the Livingston survey data on expected
inflation rates. April and October monthly averages of daily secondary market
six—month Treasury bill rates are taken from the Federal Reserve Bulletin and
have been converted from a discount basis to a bond—equivalent yield.               The

first available observation is for April 1959 (denoted 1959:04, April being
the fourth month), and our first set of equations is estimated through the
April 1979 observation.     The six—month Livingston expected inflation rate
series was provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.6            This
measure of expected inflation has two advantages over mechanical formulations:
it is a truly ex ante expectation, and it reflects whatever sophistication
agents use to process information.       The tax rate on interest income is an
average marginal tax rate constructed from data contained in annual editions
of Statistics of Income. Individual Income Tax Returns as described in Peek
and Hilcox (1983).     The tax rate used for the October observation is an

                                           —5—
average of the rate for the current year and the subsequent year.
    The GNP gap (GAP) is based on the middle—expansion trend real GNP series
calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.     GAP is computed as
middle—expansion GNP minus actual real GNP, divided by middle—expansion GNP.
The average value of the first— and previous fourth—quarter observations of
GAP is used to correspond to the April interest rate data.     The average of
second— and third—quarter values of GAP corresponds to the October
observation.   The fiscal poflcy proxy (DEE) is the cycflcafly—adjusted federal
budget deficit as a percentage of middle—expansion GNP and is based on the
series constructed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.7 The appropriate
measure is the expected cyclically—adjusted deficit, and the expectation
should be over the same time span as covered by the interest rate.      Because

the dependent variable is a six—month interest rate, the average of the
cyclically—adjusted federal budget deficit measure for the quarter beginning
in April (or October) and the subsequent quarter is used.     The use of the
actual values of the cyclically—adjusted deficit measure as a proxy for its
expected value makes an implicit rational expectations assumption.
    The OPEC proxy is measured as the current account surplus of oil exporting
countries, taken from International Financial Statistics, divided by
middle—expansion GNP.     Following the two sharp oil price increases in the
1970s, oil—exporting countries did not imediately purchase imports with their
rapidly growing export receipts, causing a temporary surge in their current
account surplus.   Because this surplus is highly correlated with the relative
price of oil, it is also employed as a proxy for the OPEC relative price
effect in the model.     The real money stock, M/P, is ca'culated as the narrowly
defined nominal money supply (Ml) divided by the GNP price deflator for the
quarter imediately preceding the interest rate observation (ie., first— and
third—quarter values).    MACC is calculated as the growth rate of nominal Ml

                                        —6—
during the previous six months relative to its growth rate during the previous
three years (as in Wilcox, 1983).
    The natural logarithm of the average of minutes to midnight for the
preceding quarter is used as our proxy for the private propensity to save.
This variable is denoted as PSAV and has a negative expected sign in the
interest rate equation.8 Hendershott and Peek (1989) have found some
support for this hypothesis from U.S. saving data.       In a multicountry study,
Slemrod (1989) has found a role for a related variable.
                           B.   Preliminary Estimation
    The first two rows of Table   1   contain alternative estimates of the
 standard' specification —— equation (3) without PSAV but augmented with MACC
(for example, Wilcox, 1983).    Row 1   contains the results for the
1959:04—1979:04 period.   All of the explanatory variables have the predicted
sign with the exception of M/P and DEF. and all except the OPEC shock variable
are statistically significant. The positive coefficient on M/P is consistent
with the findings of much of the previous empirical literature (e.g., Peek and
Wilcox, 1983) and could be caused by the money demand puzzles of the 1970s.
Similarly, the negative estimated coefficient of DEF is not surprising,
although its significance level is, given the mixed evidence from previous
studies (for example, Evans 1985, Makin 1983, Congressional Budget Office
1984) and the problems associated with our empirical measure (see footnotes 5
and 7).
    This specification (with or without M/P and DEF) does an excellent job of
explaining movements in the after—tax bill rate for the 1959—1979 period.
However, the specification (again with or without M/P and DEF) is unable to
forecast the sharp rise in after—tax real interest rates in the early 1980s.
The actual after—tax real interest rate and the corresponding
fitted/forecasted rate using the row 1 estimates are plotted in Figure 2.

                                         —7—
Although the difference between these two series never exceeds one percentage
point through mid—1979, it jumps to 2.5 percentage points in late 1980, to 5.5
percentage points in early 1982, and does not fall below 2 percentage points
until 1986.
       Further evidence of the breakdown of the relationship when the 1980s are
included is given in row 2 of Table 1.        When the sample period is extended
through 1988:10, the standard error of the equation rises sharply, the
Durbin—Watson statistic plummets, and all but the estimated coefficient on
MACC change dramatically.9         Figure 3 contains the residuals from the row 2
equation, as well as from the fitted/forecasted series from the row 1
estimates.     While the full—sample equation obviously fits the 1980s better,
the improved fit comes at the expense of the second half of the 1970s where
the equation overpredicts those low rates by over a percentage point on
average.

       The last row in Table   1   includes both our new proxy for changes in the
propensity to save and lagged values of all the IS shifters.         The nuclear fear
variable contributes marginally, and all five lagged explanatory variables
have the expected sign, with the coefficients on both expected inflation and
OPEC shocks being statistically significant.         Overall, the equation standard
error is cut by nearly 20 percent and the Durbin—Watson statistic rises above
1.0.     Nonetheless, numerous problems exist with this equation: current values
of many variables have little impact, significant autocorrelation of the
residuals is evident, and the equation standard error is over three—quarters
of a percentage point.     Based on these estimates, restrictive monetary policy
contributes less than 25 basis points to the sharp increase in real interest
rates in the early 1980s, a surprisingly small role given the widespread
attribution of high 1980s interest rates to a restrictive monetary policy.



                                            —8—
                        C.   Measures of Monetary Policy
    The creation of new deposit interest accounts and the deregulation of
deposit interest rate ceilings in the late 1970s and early 1980s distorted
measures of the money supply and shifted the money demand function (Simpson.
1984).   Much evidence suggests that the impacts of M/P and MACC might be
different in the 1980s than in the 1970s (see, for example, Friedman 1988).
Moreover, the information contained in these measures might need to be
supplemented to account for the shifting relationship between money demand and
any particular measure of the money supply.
    Our alternative proxy for the stance of monetary policy is based on the
behavior of the six—month Treasury bill rate, which the Federal Reserve can
control over short periods, relative to that of the five—year Treasury bond
rate, over which the Federal Reserve has decidedly less control.    In general,
one might posit the slope of the term structure (R6/R6O the ratio of the six—
to the sixty—month Treasury rates) to be a function of the slope of the
inflation rate structure (ir6/ir6O. the ratio of the six— to the sixty—month
expected inflation rates), the current full—employment Federal deficit (DEF)
relative to the expected long—run deficit (DEF6O), cyclical factors causing
short— and long—term real rates to differ (GAP), and monetary policy.     We


anticipate that a large current deficit relative to outyear deficits would
raise short—term rates relative to longer—term rates, as would a strong
current economy.

    Because we are interested in the impact of monetary policy on the
six—month interest rate, it is useful to write:

    (5) R6/R60 — (ir6/ir6O, DEF, DEF6O, GAP) + HP,
                      (+)    (+)   (—)   (—)

where MP is the impact of monetary policy.    Solving for MP,
    (6) MP — R6/R60 —




                                       —9—
That Is, HP can be computed directly after the estimation of the          function
component of equation (5).        In the actual estimation of (5), standard monetary
variables (a component of MP) would be included in the equation along with the
arguments in & HP would then be measured as the estimated contribution of
the monetary variables and the equations residual.
    For the rate ratio, we use the six—month bill rate divided by the
five—year rate, both on a bond—equivalent basis, for April and October of each
year.     The five—year rate is the constant maturity series from the Federal
Reserve Bulletin.10         Unfortunately, a five—year expected inflation rate is
unavailable, but a one—year rate is obtainable from the Livingston survey.
Thus we use the six—month to one—year expected Inflation ratio, ,r61,r12, as
a proxy for    w6/ir60.11     We also include as regressors GAP for the current
and previous period, proxies for the expected full—employment deficits over
the life of the six—month Treasury bill and over the life of the five—year
bond, and H/P and MACC.
    Empirically, we proxy the expected future deficit variables by the actual
deficits during the six months the bill will exist (DEF) and the two years
beyond that (DEF24).         A two—year rather than five—year horizon is employed
because actual future deficits are unavailable for the final observations in
our sample and must be projected.         A further consideration is that the longer
the horizon, the less likely actual deficits serve as an adequate proxy for
expected deficits due to major unanticipated changes in fiscal policy. This
is particularly important for the sequence of tax law changes in the 1980s,
some of which reversed the thrust of prior changes.         For the same reason,
projections of future deficits based upon todays tax law and expenditure
programs are likely to be inappropriate.
        Table 2 presents the results for alternative specifications of the rate
ratio equation.      The equations in the first two rows are estimated only

                                            —10—
through April 1979 to avoid possible contamination of the estimated
coefficients by the changing monetary relationships associated with the
October 1979 change in Federal Reserve operating procedures and the
acceleration of the ongoing financial deregulation and innovation in the early
l980s.

    In the first equation, M/P and both deficit measures have estimated
coefficients with signs opposite those predicted, although the M/P coefficient
is not significant.    The signs on the deficit variables are puzzling.         They

may be related to general problems with the deficit measure (see footnotes 5
and 7).    Alternatively, recessions might cause both low rate ratios (an upward
sloping yield curve) and a relaxation of current fiscal policy (high DEF
relative to DEF24).    In any event, the deficit variables are certainly not
causing the rate ratio to move as the coefficients indicate.         Thus, we
reestimate the first equation omitting M/P, DEF and DEF24 (row 2).  All of the
estimated coefficients are statistically significant, with the exception of
GAP1.     The ir6/irl2 coefficient is smaller than anticipated, perhaps
reflecting the use of ir6/irl2 in place of ir6/ir6O.
    Rows 3 and 4 contain the estimates for the full 1959:04 — 88:10         period.
To allow for a changing impact of Ml in the l980s owing to deregulation, M/P
and MACC are entered for the entire period and again for the l980s only (M/P80
and MACC8O are equal to M/P and MACC during the 1979:10 — 88:10 subperiod and
zero otherwise).    M/P and MACC both have the predicted negative signs; the
positive and statistically significant M/P80 and MACC8O coefficents indicate           a

reduced impact on the rate ratio in the 98Os.          This would be consistent with
our hypothesis of a deteriorating relationship between measures of Ml and
other economic variables (including interest rates). GAP1 now has a
t—statistic of only about 0.25.     The deficit variables again have
statistically significant coefficients with signs opposite those predicted.

                                        —11—
The ii-6hr12 coefficient is now much larger.   Row 4 presents a reestimation
of this equation omitting GAP1, DEF and DEF24.      All of the estimated
coefficients are now statistically significant and of the predicted sign.      All
the equations exhibit significant autocorrelation of the residuals, suggesting
that an important explanatory variable has been omitted.     This is exactly as
expected, the important variable presumably being monetary policy effects not
captured by the included monetary variables.
    We have constructed monetary policy proxies based on the estimates in rows
2 and 4.   SubstitutIng the first four terms of row 2 (three terms of row 4)
into equation (6) for 4(), we can compute the HP series for the entire
1959:04—88:10 period.   Thus the alternative proxy for the stance of monetary
policy is composed of the movement in R6/R60 "explained     by the monetary

variables plus the residual from the estimated equation.'2      The two HP

variables and —H/P are plotted in Figure 4.     The H/P variable has been
multiplied by minus one so that it should correlate positively with Interest
rates.
    The HP variables appear to be more reasonable proxies for shifts in
monetary policy than H/P even before the 1980s.     The easing of monetary policy
after the 1966 credit crunch, the subsequent tightening leading to the 1969
credit crunch, and the return to monetary ease are all more apparent.
Although both HP and H/P show a tightening in the early 1970s,     the subsequent

 easing of policy and return to a tighter monetary policy are again more
 striking with HP than with H/P.    Finally, both series indicate a dramatic
 easing of monetary policy In 1983.
     The two HP measures move similarly and thus perform similarly in
 regressions.   We report results using the MP variable based upon the pre—1980s
 data in order to avoid any contamination of the estimated coefficients used to
 construct the monetary policy variable owing to the changing financial

                                        —12—
environment in the 19805.
                   0. Final Estimates of the 8111 Rate Equation
    The first four rows of Table 3 explain after—tax bill rates.       Row    1    simply
reproduces the last row of Table    1   for comparison purposes.   Row 2 adds our
new monetary po1cy proxy to the regressors in row 1.        8ecause HP Is measured

with error, we use instrumental variable methods in our estimation.          The

instrument for MP was constructed by arranging the 60 semiannual MP values
according to magnitude and collecting them into six groups of ten.          The rank,
one through six, of each group is used as the value of the instrumental
variable for each observation in the group.       Including the new monetary policy
proxy lowers the equation standard error by over 15 percent, causing the
coefficients on the current values of the GAP, OPEC and 0EF to be closer to
those expected, and raising the Ourbin—Watson statistic to 1.29.       Row 3

 cleans up    the equation by dropping the M/P variable and the lagged value of
0EF, which had a coefficient with the incorrect sign.       The remaining
coefficients are now all of the correct sign, although the t—statistcs in
some instances are rather low, reflecting the high correlations (ranging
between 0.87 and 0.96) between the pairs of current and lagged values of
explanatory variables.
    Row 4 reports the estimates with a Cochrane—Orcutt adjustment for auto—
correlation of the residuals.     These estimates shift half of the
lagged—inflation effect to current inflation, while reducing the lagged—OPEC
impact.13    The most important changes, though, relate to the private saving
shifter —— fear of nuclear war —— and federal saving (the deficit).          The row 4
estimates allocate a greater impact to changes in nuclear fear, and the
current full—employment deficit now has a negative, but statistically
insignificant, coefficient.     In effect, these estimates attribute more of the
high 1980s real rates to reduced private saving and less to reduced federal

                                         —13—
savi ng.
    To this point we have said nothing about foreign monetary or fiscal
policy.    To test for the impact of these factors, we obtained estimates of the
OECD full—employment deficit and computed a weighted average monetary
acceleration variable for the OECD countries)4 Because we could only
obtain this data for the 1970—87 period, we estimated an equation for this
period including these variables and all those appearing in row 3.    The

coefficients on foreign variables had t—ratios less than 0.7 and that for the
foreign deficit was unexpectedly negative. This suggests that foreign fiscal
and monetary policies have not had a major impact on U.S. Treasury bill rates.
     Figure 5 illustrates how closely the row 3 estimates track the observed
real after—tax bill rate.    Both the decline throughout the 1970s and the jump
in the early 1980s are generally explained, as are the major variations in the
1960s and the decline in the second half of the 1980s.    The fitted rate is
over a percentage point too high in only two 1970s observations and over a
percentage point too low for only two observations in the 1980s.     The row 3

estimates are used in the next section of the paper to explain the major
shifts in the real after—tax and pretax bill rates over the last three decades.
     Much of the previous empirical literature has focused on the pretax,
rather than the after—tax, real interest rate.    For this reason, we have
reestimated the third and fourth equations in Table 3, setting t • 0.       These

estimates, reported in rows 5 and 6, tell much the same story as their
after—tax counterparts (given that the dependent variable is roughly 40
percent greater in rows 5 and 6, the coefficients would be expected to be
comparably larger than those in rows 3 and 4).    Two significant deviations
occur in the row 5 analogue to row 3.    First, the current federal deficit
coefficient is less than that in row 3 and is barely greater than half its
 standard error (the lagged value had a negative and very insignificant

                                        —14—
coefficient and was thus omitted from the equation).    Second, the sum of the
coefficients on expected inflation are 60 percent greater. Thus an increase
in inflation will raise real rates more according to row 5 than to row 3.
    Following Peek and Wilcox (1984), we specify the after—tax nominal
interest rate as (l—et)i and obtain an equation explaining the pretax
nominal interest rate by dividing all explanatory variables in equation (4) by
(1—et).   For the equation corresponding to row 3, the estimated value of e
was 1.10 with a standard error of 0.45.    We take this as evidence that the
after—tax, rather than the pretax, Treasury bill rate is determined in
financial markets.   Nonetheless, for comparison purposes we use both the
after—tax and pretax interest rate equations in our analysis of major shifts
In the pretax real rate.
              III. Determinants of Major Shifts in Real Bill Rates
    After—tax real rates have varied widely over the 1959—88 period, falling
from 1.5 percent in the 1960s to —1.75 percent in the middle and late 1970s,
Jumping to 2.25 percent in the early 1980s, and then receding to 0.95 percent
during the 1986—88 period.    Pretax real six—month Treasury bill rates averaged
2.6 percent during the entire 1959—88 period.    Moreover, they averaged 2.7
percent during the initial 1959—70 years and 2.5 percent over the last six
observations (86:04—88:10).    In the intervening years, however, real rates
swung violently, averaging only 0.2 percent in the middle 1970s but then
rising to 2.0 percent in 1979—80 and 5.5 percent in 1981—84.    This section
unravels the contributions of our explanatory variables to these wide swings
in real rates.
                              A. After—Tax Real Rates
    The first row of Table 4 contains average rates for the real after—tax
six—month Treasury bill rate at each of the peak and trough periods mentioned
above.    Row 2 lists the change in the after—tax real rate between these

                                       —15—
periods.     The remaining rows contain the contributions of changes in monetary
policy (MP and MACC), fiscal policy (DEF), saving (PSAV and OPEC), the
business cycle (GAP) and expected inflation (ir) to the changes in the real
after—tax rate.     These contributions are based on the coefficient estimates in
row 3 of Table 3.     The impact of expected inflation arises largely because the
sum of the coefficients on ir and ir1 is less than unity (higher expected
inflation lowers the after—tax real rate).
    The decline in the after—tax real rate from the 1960s to the mid—1970s is
attributable to three factors, increases in private saving and expected
inflation and, to a lesser extent, a weakening of the economy.     All of these
were, in fact, largely due to the same single cause: the first OPEC shock.
Monetary policy played no role in the decrease.     This interpretation is
consistent with I'lilcox (1983).
    The real after—tax rate fell further in 1979—80, in spite of a sharply
restrictive monetary policy and a strong economy, owing to the sharp rise in
inflation.     (Because both subperiods immediately follow oil shocks, the OPEC
saving shifter played a much less important role.)     After—tax real rates then
jumped by over 4 percentage points in 1981—84, not due to a further tightening
of monetary policy, but rather to the decrease in expected inflation and a
decrease in private saving.     Eighty percent of the latter is attributable to
the unwinding of the second oil shock (as OPEC surpluses dissipated) and 20
percent to the heightened fear of nuclear war.     In fact most of the increase
in real rates from the lows in the middle of the 1970s to 1981—84 might be
traced to a single cause, the second OPEC shock.     The resultant acceleration
in inflation caused the restrictive monetary policy, contributed to the
election of Ronald Reagan (not only was inflation high and rising, but the
spring 1980 inflation numbers led Jimy Carter to impose consumer credit
controls, which triggered the 1980 recession), and led to the disinflation.

                                        —16—
The election of Reagan, with his "evil empire" speeches, was likely the cause
of the heightened fear of nuclear war.     Nearly a percentage point of the peak
after—tax real rate is not explained, however.
    The decline in after—tax real rates from their peak can also likely be
linked to a change in inflation, this time a decline, which led to an easier
monetary policy.     A strong economy acted to cushion the decline.   The failure
to explain fully the high 1981—83 after—tax real rate also shows up here in
the contribution of unidentified factors of roughly equal (but opposite
signed) magnitude.
    The subperiods in Table 4 were chosen based on values of the real
after—tax interest rate.     However, major shifts in the contributing factors
can occur within subperiods, and thus changes in the subperlod averages in the
Table can understate the importance of short—term movements in the
contributions.     For example, because monetary policy was still tight at the
beginning of the 1974—78 subperiod before easing substantially in 1976, the
table understates the shift in monetary policy from 1976—77 to the early
1980s.   By our measure, monetary policy raised real after—tax interest rates
by 140 basis points between its low point in 1976:04—77:04 and
1979:04—1980:10.     This translates into a two percentage point increase in the
pretax real rate.
                                B. Pretax Real Rates
    Table 5 is similar to Table 4 except that changes in the pretax real
six—month bill rate are now being attributed to our explanatory variables.
The periods correspond to those in Table 4 except for single half—year shifts
in the starting/ending dates to correspond more closely to observed interest
rate peaks and troughs.     The contributions of the variables are calculated in
two ways, using the coefficient estimates in rows 3 (after—tax bill rate
equation) and 5 (pretax equation) of Table 3.     The unwinding of the after—tax

                                        —17—
equation allows the tax rate contribution to be isolated and included with DEF
n the flscal policy category)5 Imp1icatons of the row 3 estimates are
listed first in the table; implications from row 5 are reported in parentheses.
   As can be seen, the two sets of coefficient estimates attribute roughly
equal impacts to monetary policy, saving shifts, and the business cycle.        They

obvousy give different impacts for fisca' policy, with the f1sca poflcy
contribution from the after—tax equation reflecting the impact of bracket
creep in the 1960s and 1970s mitigating the decline in real rates and the
substantial tax rate reductions in the 1980s first holding back real rate
increases and then making an important contribution to their decline.
Differences in the inflation impact and in the residual (unidentified factors)
offset the differences in the fiscal policy impact.
    The decline in the real rate from the 1960s to the mid—1970s is less than
the decline in the after—tax rate because the increase in expected inflation
does not act to lower the pretax rate;     the sum of the coefficients on ir and
    (divided by   1   — t in the after—tax equation) exceeds unity.16    This

leaves an increase in saving and a weakening of the economy as the only
factors contributing to the reduction in real rates.
    The rise in the real rate to more normal levels in 1979—80 was due
primarily to a restrictive monetary policy and a strong economy.        The further
jump to extraordinarily high real rates in 1981—84 was not due to a further
tightening of monetary policy, but rather to a sharp decrease in private
saving and to changing inflation.      As was the case with after—tax rates, most
of the increase in real rates from the lows in the middle of the 1970s to the
highs in 1981—84 can be attributed to the direct and indirect effects of the
second OPEC shock.

    Much of the decline in pretax real rates from their peak can, like the
decline in after—tax rates, be tied to a decline in inflation and the

                                        —18—
resultant easing of monetary policy.           In addition, in the after—tax model a
cut in tax rates also plays an Important role, alone accounting for a full
percentage point of the decline in pretax real rates between 1981—84 and
1986—88.




                                        IV. Sumary

    We have attempted to uncover the sources of the major changes in real
Treasury bill rates, both before— and after—tax, since the middle 1970s.                Two

major changes have occurred in both before— and after—tax real rates               —— a jump

in the early 1980s and a partial reversal since then.           But pre— and post—tax
rates do not always move together.        Most clearly, pretax real rates rose by
nearly two percentage points from the mid—1970s to 1979—80, while after—tax
rates fell by another half percentage point before leaping in 1981—82.
    Differences in the movements in these rates stem from different responses
to changes in tax rates and expected inflation.           If financial markets
determine after—tax rates as our model suggests, these rates are independent
of changes in tax rates; a reduction in the tax rate causes the pretax rate to
rise sufficiently to leave the after—tax rate unchanged.           Thus bracket creep
in the 1960s and 1970s tended to put upward pressure on pretax real rates
while the large tax rate reductions in the 1980s made an important
contribution to the recent decline in real rates.           The impact of changes in
expected inflation is more complicated. We estimate the long—run response of
the after-tax nomina' rate to expected inflation (Si*/Sir)         to   be 0.80.
The response of the after—tax real rate to a single percentage point increase
in expected inflation is thus 0.80 —       1   — —0.20.   Because the response of the
pretax real rate is 6(i—ir)/&tr   •   0.80/(1 — t) and t has varied from
0.24 to 0.34. the pretax real rate response has varied from 0.05 to 0.21.
However, in the short run the response is negative because most of the

                                          —19—
response of nominal rates to increases in expected inflation occurs with a
one—period lag.
    The other variables estimated to affect real interest rates significant'y
are monetary policy, the propensity to save (influenced by OPEC shocks and the
fear of nuclear war), and the strength of economic activity.     Changes in each
of these affect pre— and post—tax rates the same way, 1though the impacts on
pretax rates are about 40 percent greater than those on after—tax rates.
Swings in monetary policy have altered pretax real rates by as much as two
percentage points; cyclical changes in real activity have moved pretax rates
by a percentage point; and changes in the propensity to save have changed
pretax rates by over two and a half percentage points.     Movements in the
full—employment deficit, in contrast, are estimated to affect interest rates
little.
    Our principal conclusion is that the emphasis on the high real interest
rates in the early 1980s is overdone.     The key to understanding real interest
rates in the last quarter century is the extraordinarily low interest rates in
much of the 1970s owing to the two OPEC ofl shocks, which lowered investment
demand and increased world saving by transferring wealth from the
high—consuming developed countries to OPEC.    Tight money, high inflation, and
heightened nuclear fear all contributed to the subsequent sharp rise in real
rates, with the eventual decline of OPEC surpluses following the second OPEC
shock prolonging this period of higher real rates. Hhile changes in monetary
policy explain both the rebound in real rates to normal levels in the 1978—80
period and much of the decline since 1984, by our estimates monetary policy
does not account for the jump in real rates between 1978—80 and 1981—84.
Monetary policy was not noticeably tighter in the early 1980s than in the
1973—74 period, although the period of tightness, mid—1979 to mid—1983, lasted
much 1nger.   Simflarly, the recent period of ease has been longer than any in

                                        —20—
the last quarter—century.   Fiscal policy, on the other hand, had little impact
on real interest rates in the early 1980s, with decreasing marginal tax rates
offsetting the effects of increasing structural deficits.

1The data are semiannual, based on April and October monthly averages of the
secondary market six—month Treasury bill interest rate.       The Treasury bill
interest rate has been converted from a discount basis to a bond—equivalent
yield.   After—tax interest rates are calculated using the marginal tax rate on
interest income described in the text.     Ex ante real interest rates are
calculated using the Livingston survey six—month expected inflation rate.
Thus their movement is not due to misperceptions of inflation.       Ex post real
rates based on actual inflation rates exhibit even more dramatic movements.
2For the 1980—88 period Drexel Burnham Lambert has been surveying "decision
makers" on 10—year inflation expectations.       Based upon this series, pretax
real 10—year Treasury bond rates have moved roughly like real six—month rates,
rising from 2.1 percent In 1980 to 5.8 percent In 1981—mid 85 and then falling
to 3.0 percent.
3kilcox (1983) has attributed these to the first OPEC supply shock.
4Even the 1966 slowdown, which many at the time viewed as a minirecession,
was accompanied by a decline in real rates.       For earlier empirical evidence on
the procyclical pattern in real Interest rates, see Hendershott (1986, pp.
45—46) and the references cited therein.
5Changes in government expenditures are often hypothesized to have a larger
impact on aggregate demand than changes in tax revenues (the balanced—budget
multiplier argument).   On the other hand, to the extent government purchases
are good substitutes for privately purchased goods, the impact on aggregate
demand of government expendItures would be partIally offset by a corresponding
reduction in private expenditures.     In some instances, changes in tax revenues

                                         —22—
financed by changes in government bonds outstanding are hypothesized to have
no impact on aggregate demand (Barro, 1974).     Because the additional interest
payments on the newly issued government bonds represent expected future tax
liabilities with a present discounted value equal to the reduction in current
taxes, individuals would view the changes in current and future taxes as
equivalent and not alter their planned expenditures (Ricardian equivalence).
On the other hand, to the extent that individuals are liquidity constrained,
their marginal propensity to consume out of disposable income would approach
unity.   In that instance, tax changes could have substantial effects on
aggregate demand.

6The Livingston survey data actually represent eight— and fourteen—month
rather than six— and twelve—month inflation expectations.     For example, in
approximately early May, respondents are asked to provide their expectation of
the level of the Consumer Price Index for December and for June of the
following year.     The last reported CPI data would be for April.   Thus, the
calculated implicit inflation rate would be for April to December and for
April to June of the following year.     The timing of the interest rate data has
been selected to correspond with the approximate date at which respondents
form their expectations.
7This proxy for fiscal policy effects presents a number of problems, as do
alternative measures.     On general measurement issues, see, for example, Eisner
(1986) and Kotllkoff (1986).
8An increase in minutes to midnight would also raise investment and thus
interest rates.     However, the saving effect should dominate because life—cycle
savers are likely to have a longer horizon than firms would have for equipment
investment.   Firms need capital equipment to continue operating in the
immediate future.     Individuals need accumulated retirement saving only in the
distant future and thus would be more strongly affected by the more likely

                                        —23—
possibility of nuclear war at some time in the (perhaps somewhat distant)
future.    That is, a decrease in minutes to midnighit is more likely to
effectively shorten the relevant horizon for life-cycle savers by more than
for firm investment decisions.
9The extended sample period includes the imposition and termination of
credit controls in 1980.    This caused sharp fluctuations in interest rates and
the money supply.    The timing of the April and October interest rate
observations are such that they avoid the extremes of those fluctuations.
However, the MACC variable does reflect the effects of credit controls.
Consequently, we included dumy variables for the two 1980 observations.
however, we have not included the credit controls dummy variables in the
equations here and in the remaining tables because no statistically
significant effects were found for the dummy variables and the other estimated
coefficients were little affected by their inclusion.
10We used the five— rather than ten— or twenty—year Treasury rates for two
reasons.     First, the data on longer—term Treasuries are contaminated because
only deep discount bonds existed between 1966 and 1975 (Cook and Hendershott,
1978).     Second, only short—term expected inflation series are available prior
to 1980.
11Using the decision—makers 10—year expected inflation rate, we can
construct a measure of ir6/irl2O for the 1980s.   For the 1980:4—1988:10
period, the simple correlation between ir6/irl2 and ir6/irl2O is 0.90
suggesting that ir6/irl2 may not be a bad proxy for longer horizons.
121f the MACC component of equation (5) were not included in HP, only the
size and interpretation of the MACC estimated coefficient in the interest rate
equation that includes HP as an explanatory variable would be altered.      The

overall fit of the equation would be unaffected.

13When the unadjusted equation (row 3) is re—estimated with the coefficients
on the current and lagged expected inflation variables constrained to be
equal, the only notable change is a rise in the coefficients on the current
OPEC and DEE variables and a decline in those on their lagged values (the
estimated equation standard error rises by only a basis point).
14The budget deficit data were provided by the OECD.              The foreign deficit
series is a weighted average of the cyclically—adjusted general budget deficit
as a percentage of cyclically—adjusted GNP/GDP for the six major countries of
OECD excluding the United States (Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom,
Italy, and Canada).       The weights are based on the 1982 shares in total OECD
GNP/GDP contained In Table          1   of OECD Economic Outlook, 42, December 1987, p.
5.       The data were available for the 1970—87 period.         A weighted average MACC
variable was calculated for the same six countries using the same weights and
money supply data from Iiitrnptipnpl Finpncil Statistics.
15The impact of the variables on the pretax real rate is obtained from the
after—tax equation in the following way.              The estimated equation is:
         (1—t)i   — l' + 2—l + Z
where Z reflects all other variables including the residual. Differencing
obtains,
(l—t)M —
                     —      +   2—l       +



Solving      for the real rate,
M    —       —       +   2—l    +       + i_1At]I(l-t) - air.


16When     Inflation is rising so rapidly that the average value of         ir significantly

exceeds that of 1r1,      the   increase in inflation can temporarily lower the pretax
rate.
