                                           ABSTRACT

We provide empirical evidence on the dynamics effects of tax liability changes in the United States.
We distinguish between surprise and anticipated tax changes using a timing-convention. We document
that pre-announced but not yet implemented tax cuts give rise to contractions in output, investment
and hours worked while real wages increase. In contrast, there are no significant anticipation effects
on aggregate consumption. Implemented tax cuts, regardless of their timing, have expansionary and
persistent effects on output, consumption, investment, hours worked and real wages. Results are shown
to be very robust. We argue that tax shocks are empirically important impulses to the U.S. business
cycle and that anticipation effects have been important during several business cycle episodes.

1    Introduction

This paper estimates the dynamic macroeconomic eﬀects of tax changes in the United States for the

post World War II period. We take into account the timing of tax changes by introducing a distinction

between anticipated and unanticipated changes in taxes. According to economic theory, agents

base their decision rules upon their current information about variables relevant for the decision

problem. Unanticipated changes in taxes aﬀect behavior when the tax changes are implemented,

while anticipated changes in taxes may aﬀect the economy ahead of their introduction. The idea

that anticipated policy shocks impact on the economy prior to their implementation has been explored

extensively in the literature on fiscal policy, see e.g. Hall, 1971, Auerbach, 1989, Yang, 2005, and

House and Shapiro, 2006, for the case of tax shocks, or Blanchard, 1981, Taylor, 1993, and Ramey,

2008, for the case of government spending shocks. Yet, there is little if any direct empirical evidence

that anticipation eﬀects are empirically relevant. This paper provides such evidence for the U.S.

economy. Moreover, by explicitly taking the timing of tax changes into account, we are better able

to estimate the impact of implemented tax changes than preexisting studies.

    Our analysis is based upon a narrative account measurement of tax changes. Specifically, we

adopt the narrative account of post World War II legislated federal U.S. tax bills provided by Romer

and Romer (2007, 2008). We focus upon those tax changes that Romer and Romer (2008) classify

as exogenous because they were introduced either for ideological reasons or because they were moti-

vated by “inherited deficit concerns” (as opposed to deficits caused by current spending). There are

70 such tax liability changes that derive from 35 diﬀerent federal tax policy acts. The distinction be-

tween anticipated and unanticipated tax shocks is accomplished by introducing a timing convention.

We define for each tax act the announcement date and the implementation date of the tax liability

changes. The announcement date is assumed to correspond to the date at which the policy inter-

vention became law while the implementation date is defined as the date at which the tax liability

changes were to be implemented according to the tax acts. When these dates are no longer than 90

days apart, we classify the corresponding tax liability change as an unanticipated tax shock, while

anticipated tax shocks are those changes in taxes for which the two dates diﬀer by more than 90 days.

Based on this measurement, 37 out of the 70 tax liability changes are categorized as anticipated and

the median anticipation horizon amongst these tax shocks is 6 quarters.

                                                  1
       The use of this timing convention provides a methodological innovation to the problem of esti-

mating anticipation eﬀects in the macroeconomic literature on fiscal policy. Alternatively, Blanchard

and Perotti (2002) suggest the use of an instrumental variables estimator. These authors identify

fiscal shocks by exploiting the existence of decision lags assuming that fiscal policy variables do not

adjust within a quarter to other unanticipated shocks but point out that decision lags need to exceed

implementation lags if there are pre-announced tax changes. Since the median implementation lag

in our data is 6 quarters, this approach would therefore have to rely on unrealistically long reaction

lags when estimating the dynamic impact of unanticipated and anticipated tax shocks.1

       We estimate the impact of the tax shocks on main macroeconomic aggregates using a VAR

approach treating the tax liability changes as exogenous shocks. This approach is akin to analyses

that have examined the impact of government spending shocks using the narrative approach (e.g.

Ramey and Shapiro, 1998, Burnside, Eichenbaum and Fisher, 2004, or Ramey, 2008) with the added

feature that we distinguish between anticipated and unanticipated fiscal shocks. The key findings

are:

       • An unanticipated tax cut gives rise to significant increases in output, consumption, and invest-

         ment which peak around 2.5 years after the introduction of the tax cut. The largest response

         relates to investment that after a 1 percent tax cut increases by approximately 10 percent at

         peak. Hours worked also increases but only gradually over time. Real wages rise persistently.

       • An anticipated tax cut is associated with pre-implementation drops in output and investment

         while consumption remains roughly constant during the pre-implementation period. Once the

         tax change is implemented, it is associated with a stimulating eﬀect on the economy. There is

         also a significant pre-implementation drop in hours worked, while real wages increase during

         the pre-implementation period.

       • Unanticipated and anticipated tax shocks have contributed importantly to the U.S. business

         cycle. In particular, the anticipation eﬀects associated with the Social Security Amendments
   1
       Mountford and Uhlig (2009) estimate the impact of pre-announced fiscal policy shocks using a structural VAR ap-

proach where identification is obtained by imposing sign restrictions. They do not show, however, whether anticipation

eﬀects have been important quantitively for fluctuations in the U.S. economy. Mertens and Ravn (2010b) propose an

alternative structural VAR estimator which applies Blaschke matrices to correct for anticipation eﬀects.


                                                           2
         of 1977 and the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 explain a significant proportion of the

         1981-82 recession and the mid-1980’s boom in the U.S. The Bush tax initiatives in the early

         2000’s also had important anticipation eﬀects. Tax shocks account for around 20-25 percent of

         the volatility of output at business cycle frequencies.


       In contrast to preexisting studies, our results provide direct empirical evidence on the impor-

tance of anticipation eﬀects. A number of papers have examined the consumption response to

pre-announced changes in personal taxes. Poterba (1988) tests whether aggregate U.S. consumption

reacts to announcements of future tax changes and fails to find robust evidence in favor of this hy-

pothesis.2 Heim (2007) studies data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) and tests for

announcement eﬀects of state tax rebates. He finds no significant household consumption response

to rebate announcements. Parker (1999) and Souleles (1999, 2002) also study CEX data and test

whether household consumption responds to actual changes in taxes when these were known in ad-

vance of their implementation.3 They find that consumption plans adjust only when tax changes

are implemented. Our results regarding the impact of taxes on consumption agree with these stud-

ies but indicate that other key macroeconomic variables do display significant anticipation eﬀects.

This is important because the existing evidence on pre-announcement eﬀects on consumption has

been interpreted in terms of lack of foresight on the part of households and/or binding liquidity

constraints. We argue that the drop in hours worked and the increase in investment in response to

announcements of future tax cuts indicate forward looking behavior and are hard to reconcile with

large shares of liquidity constrained agents.

       We carry out an extensive robustness analysis. We first examine reliability of the timing-based

measurement of anticipated tax shocks. Specifically, we allow leads of surprise tax changes to aﬀect

the vector of observables which should be the case if the public had good knowledge of tax changes

prior to them becoming law. We find little evidence to indicate that surprise tax changes systemat-

ically have any impact before their implementation which supports the timing-based measurement

   2
       Poterba (1988) identifies five such episodes: February 1964, June 1968, March 1975, August 1981, and August

1986.

       Parker (1999) examines the impact of Social Security changes during the 1980’s while Souleles (2002) investigates

the Reagan tax cut of the early 1980’s.

of anticipated tax shocks.

    Secondly, we investigate whether our results are driven by endogeneity of the tax shocks. We

examine the predictability of the tax changes using an ordered probit model distinguishing between

surprise and anticipated tax changes and taking into account the motivation for their introduction.

We cannot reject exogeneity of tax changes that were introduced for ideological reasons. The results

for deficit driven tax changes are less clear with some mild (but not very strong) evidence indicating

predictability of announcements of future deficit driven tax liability changes. Although the evidence

on endogeneity is weak, we repeat our analysis eliminating all deficit driven tax changes from the

data but find that this does not overturn any of the main results. We also investigate whether the

estimation results hinge critically on particular tax laws. We remove three particularly large tax

interventions the Reagan tax cut being the most prominent. We show that the results are robust to

removing any of these three tax acts.

    Finally, we ask whether our results are contaminated by lack of control for monetary policy and for

fiscal spending which might be an important issue in small samples. Our results become perhaps even

stronger when we control for monetary policy shocks or for government spending shocks. Moreover,

our finding that the anticipation eﬀects associated with the Reagan tax cut were partially responsible

for the early 1980’s recession in the US holds true even when we control for monetary policy shocks.

    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes our estimation approach

and discusses the tax data. Section 3 contains the main results regarding the dynamic eﬀects of tax

shocks. A substantial robustness analysis is discussed in Section 4. Section 5 contains our analysis

of the role of tax shocks for US business cycles. Finally, Section 6 concludes and summarizes.



2     Estimation Approach

In this section we discuss how we measure tax shocks and our approach to the estimation of their

impact on macroeconomic aggregates.


2.1   Identification

Key to any estimation of the impact of fiscal policy shocks is the identification strategy. Recent

contributions to the fiscal policy literature have adopted either structural VAR approaches or have

                                                   4
relied upon narrative approaches. We follow the second identification strategy. The key advantage

of the narrative approach is that it allows us to make a distinction between anticipated and unantici-

pated tax shocks based on timing assumptions and therefore, at least partially, to control for ex-ante

available information about future changes in taxes that is usually ignored in standard VAR based

methods.4 Specifically, we make use of Romer and Romer’s (2007) (updated in Romer and Romer,

2008) narrative account of U.S. federal tax liability changes. Based on oﬃcial government documents,

presidential speeches, and Congressional documents, these authors identify 51 significant legislated

federal tax acts in the period 1947-2006 and a total of 110 separate changes in tax liabilities. This

account is therefore much richer than the standard narrative account of fiscal spending (Ramey and

Shapiro, 1998).

       We focus on the tax liability changes that Romer and Romer (2007) classify as exogenous since

“(t)he changes were not motivated by current or projected economic conditions” (Romer and Romer,

2007, p.3). This includes tax liability changes that Romer and Romer (2007) classify as either

“exogenous due to long-term growth objectives” or exogenous due to “deficit concerns”. The former

of these are tax changes that were introduced with no explicit concerns about the current state of

the economy while the latter are tax changes introduced to address inherited budget deficits. Our

benchmark estimates of the impact of these tax shocks includes all of these tax liability changes but

we later examine in some detail whether there are signs of endogeneity of the tax liability changes.

This selection leaves us with 70 tax liability changes deriving from 35 diﬀerent federal tax policy acts

listed in Table A.1.


2.2       Distinguishing Between Anticipated and Unanticipated Tax Shocks

We adopt a timing based distinction between unanticipated and anticipated tax shocks. For each

tax liability change we define two dates, the announcement date and the implementation date. We

assume that the announcement date corresponds to the date at which the tax legislation became

law, i.e. when it was signed by the President. The implementation date is instead the date at which,

   4
       Blanchard and Perotti (2002) point out that allowing for anticipated shocks in a structural VAR framework where

identification of fiscal policy shocks rests upon decision lags implies the need for using instrumental variables estimators

and assuming decision lags that exceed announcement lags.




                                                             5
according to each tax legislation, the tax liability changes were to be introduced.5 We refer to the

diﬀerence between these two dates as the implementation lag.

       Figure 1 illustrates the histogram of the implementation lag (in days) in the data. It is evident

that the histogram of the implementation lag is twin peaked with the peaks occurring at 0-30 days

and at more than 151 days. Only 18 of the 70 tax liability changes have implementation lags in the

30-150 days interval. In our benchmark analysis we define a tax liability change as anticipated if the

implementation lag exceeds 90 days which strikes a balance between robustness of the classification

to the timing within a quarter and the ability to measure anticipation eﬀects. The twin peaked

nature of the frequency of the implementation lag implies that minor changes in the width of the

window have little impact.

       Based on this definition, 36 out of the 70 of the tax liability changes are anticipated while 34 tax

liability changes are defined as surprise tax shocks. The resulting tax shocks are illustrated in Figure

2 in percentages of annual current price GDP. The top panel shows the unanticipated shocks, the

middle panel shows the anticipated shocks dated by the quarter of implementation, and the bottom

panel reports the anticipation horizon of the anticipated tax shocks (truncated at 4 years).

       As is evident, the tax liability changes are quite frequent and some of them are quite large. The

Reagan tax initiative, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA 1981 from now on), signed by

Reagan in August 1981, contained a substantial amount of pre-announced tax changes. It consisted

of five separate changes in tax liabilities due in 1981:3, 1981:4, 1982:1, 1983:1, and 1984:1. The

first two tax changes are defined as surprise changes according to our taxonomy while the last three

initiatives are defined as anticipated policy changes. The change in tax liabilities of these latter three

anticipated changes corresponds to approximately 4.5 percent of annual GDP. This sequence of tax

cuts as a whole constitutes by far the largest anticipated tax changes in the sample that we study.

       The median implementation lag in the data is 6 quarters while the longest implementation lag is

associated with the Social Security Amendments of 1983 signed by Reagan in April 1983 which had

tax liability changes being introduced as far out in the future as 1990. Most other pre-announced

   5
       When the tax bill is advanced by the President, the bill becomes law when passed by the Congress. This date may

occur slightly earlier than the bill being signed by the President. However, given that we introduce a 90 day minimum

anticipation horizon, this detail should not aﬀect our results.




                                                            6
tax changes, however, had implementation lags close to the median lag (only 5 tax changes have

anticipation lags longer than 4 years).

   The timing based distinction between surprise and anticipated changes in taxes is parallel to the

approach taken in microeconometric estimates of the impact of pre-announced tax changes on house-

hold consumption (Heim, 2007, Parker, 1999, Souleles, 1999, 2002) and in Poterba’s classic (1988)

study of the aggregate consumption response to tax announcements. One might consider taking

into account promises made during election campaigns, lags in the democratic process of passing tax

legislations, etc. to arrive at more sophisticated measurements of the arrival of information about

future tax interventions. The advantage of the approach taken here is that the measurement is con-

sistent across all tax liability changes and it is easily reproducible. Nevertheless, in the robustness

analysis we take a closer look at the plausibility of this assumption.

   Another issue relates to the timing of the announcements of anticipated tax shocks. Suppose

that the announcements were systematically related to the state of the business cycle. In this case,

while the motivation for the tax changes may not be related to current economic conditions, the

timing of their introduction may reflect concerns about the state of the economy. To check this, we

computed the average number of quarters between announcements of future tax changes and the

closest NBER business cycle turning point. This statistic is 5.7 quarters in the data. Assuming that

tax announcements are random so that they occur with the same probability at all dates gives an

expected value of this statistic of 5.8 quarters. Thus, we find no signs of a systematic relationship

between announcements of future tax changes and business cycle turning points.


2.3   Measurement of Tax Shocks

We measure the size of surprise tax liability changes, denoted as τ ut , as the implied dollar change in

tax liabilities in percent of current price GDP at the implementation date. This tax measure converts

the tax liability change into an average tax rate. It would potentially be interesting to disaggregate

this measure into changes in specific taxes but we concentrate on the coarser measure since it gives

us a rich amount of data to examine.

   Anticipated tax changes are distinguished by size, the announcement date, and by the anticipation

horizon. Let sa,i
              t denote tax liability changes that were signed by the President at date t and had




                                                   7
an anticipation horizon of i quarters measured as a percentage of GDP at the implementation date.

Ideally, we would like to allow for diﬀerential eﬀects of tax liabilities that had diﬀerent anticipation

horizons but this is infeasible due to the loss of degrees of freedom implied by the large number of

tax shocks that needs to be included. To see this, note that adopting this approach implies that the
                                                                           h                               i
information set at date t must include the vector of anticipated tax shocks sa,i=1,..M
                                                                             t         , sa,i=2,..,M a,M
                                                                                          t−1       , st−M

where M denotes the largest implementation lag in the data. For M = 20, the largest anticipation

horizon in the data, 210 parameters need to be estimating leaving only a tiny degrees of freedom

available for estimating of the impact of tax changes.

       To address this issue, we distinguish between anticipated tax shocks on the basis of their remaining

anticipation horizon. We define the following anticipated tax shocks:
                                                               M−i
                                                               X
                                                    τ at,i =         sa,i+j
                                                                      t−j                                           (1)
                                                               j=0

       Thus, τ at,i measures the sum of all anticipated tax liability changes known at date t to be imple-

mented at date t + i. Using this definition of the anticipated tax shocks implies that the number of

anticipated tax variables that enter the information set at date t is equal to M , making estimation

feasible.


2.4       Estimating the Impact of Tax Liability Changes

Given the estimates and classification of the tax shocks, we estimate the impact of tax shocks on the

basis of impulse response functions. These impulse response functions are derived from the following

regression model:
                                                                                    K
                                                                                    X
                      Xt = A + Bt + C (L) Xt−1 + D (L) τ ut + F (L) τ at,0 +              Gi τ at,i + et            (2)
                                                                                    i=1

where Xt is a vector of endogenous variables, A and B control for a constant term and a linear

trend, C(L) is P -order lag polynomial, and D(L) and F (L) are (R + 1)-order lag polynomials.6 We

allow the maximum anticipation horizon in equation (2), K, potentially to diﬀer from the maximum

implementation lag observed in the data, M . The anticipation eﬀects of pre-announced tax liability

changes are introduced through the terms G1 − GK . Notice that, since these coeﬃcients enter on the

   6
       The results are robust to allowing for a break in the trend in 1973:2, see Ramey and Shapiro (1998) and Burnside,

Eichenbaum and Fisher (2004). The results are also robust to first diﬀerencing the Xt vector.


                                                               8
tax liability changes that are part of the information set at date t but not yet implemented, these

terms directly measure news eﬀects associated with anticipated tax shocks. Therefore, the empirical

model allows us to trace out the dynamics of the economy from when tax changes are announced.

      The regression model can be viewed as a vector autoregression for Xt , treating the tax variables

as exogenous shocks. Since we do not include actual tax rates in the vector Xt , in order to allow for

persistence in the tax liability changes the VAR includes moving average terms of implemented tax

liability changes, τ ut and τ at,0 (the D(L) and F (L) lag polynomials).

      A main motivation for the formulation of the regression model is that it corresponds to an

approximation to the dynamics of the observables in a DSGE model with stochastic shocks to tax

rates, see Mertens and Ravn (2010a). We explain this in Appendix 2. The approximation consists of

restricting D(L) and F (L) to be finite order polynomials (as opposed to infinite order polynomials).

Mertens and Ravn (2010a) show that as long as R is suﬃciently high, the approximation is quite

precise and that the VAR provides a very good fit of the dynamics of a DSGE model.

      Our treatment of the tax shocks contrasts with the standard “dummy variable” measurement

of the policy interventions usually adopted in the narrative approach, see e.g. Ramey and Shapiro

(1998) or Burnside, Eichenbaum and Fisher (2004).7 The advantage of our approach is that it allows

us to aggregate the evidence across diﬀerent episodes of tax liability changes. This seems a sensible

strategy given that we have quite a large number of tax shocks, and given that their measurement

can be interpreted in terms of changes in average taxes.

      We study U.S. quarterly data for the sample period 1947:1 - 2006:4. In all our experiments, the

vector Xt includes the following variables:
                                                        ∙                    ¸0
                                                 Xt =       yt , ct , it ,

where yt denotes the logarithm of U.S. GDP per adult in constant (chained) prices, ct is the logarithm

of the real per capita private sector consumption expenditure, it is the logarithm of real aggregate per

capita gross private sector investment (see Appendix 2 for precise definitions and data sources). We

also estimate the impact of the tax shocks on hours worked and on real wages by adding these variables

sequentially to the vector of observables. This strategy requires the estimation of a fewer number

                                                               9
of parameters than estimating the larger dimensional VAR directly, see also Burnside, Eichenbaum

and Fisher (2004).8

        The VAR above assumes that the tax shocks have persistent but non-permanent eﬀects on the

vector of observables (under the condition that the lag-polynomial C (L) does not contain unit roots).

We also checked the results when allowing for permanent eﬀects of the tax shocks using a VAR in

first diﬀerences. The results are very similar to those that we derive with the VAR in equation (2)

and are therefore not reported.



3        Empirical Results

We assume that K = 6 which corresponds to the median implementation lag in the data that we

study, that R = 12, and that P = 1 (the results are robust to assuming longer lag structures). We

report the impulse response functions to a 1 percent decrease in the tax liabilities (relative to GDP)

along with 68 percent non-parametric non-centered bootstrapped confidence intervals computed from

10000 replications.9 The impulse response functions are shown for a forecast horizon of 24 quarters

for unanticipated tax liability shocks, and for 6 quarters before its implementation, to 24 quarters

thereafter in the case of anticipated shocks.


3.1        Benchmark Results

Figure 3 reports the benchmark results. We discuss first the impact of an unanticipated tax cut

shown in the left column of the figure. A surprise tax cut sets oﬀ a major expansion of the economy.

According to our estimates, a 1 percent tax cut is associated with a 2 percent peak increase in

GDP per capita. The increase in output occurs gradually over time with the peak being reached

10 quarters after the cut in taxes. Thereafter, output remains above trend for an extended period

that goes beyond the 6 years forecast horizon illustrated in Figure 3. The increase in output is

significantly positive at all but the second and third quarter and the confidence interval is narrow at

all forecast horizons.

        Mertens and Ravn (2008) estimate a larger dimensional VAR which also includes consumer durables. The results

are for al intents and purposes identical to those reported here.
    9
        We report 68 percent confidence intervals due to the use of a non-parametric bootstrap.



                                                            10
   Private sector consumption also increases and the size of its peak response is similar to the size

of the peak response of output, corresponding to a 2 percent increase above trend. Consumption,

however, tends to increase slightly faster than output, and 6 years after the tax cut, consumption

is still around 0.75 percent above trend. The increase in consumption is significantly positive at all

forecast horizons.

   By far the most elastic response is associated with private sector investment, which we estimate

to increase by as much as 10 percent relative to its trend. As for output, the peak increase occurs

10 quarters after the cut in taxes. This indicates a large supply side impact of tax changes. One

noticeable feature of the investment dynamics is that while its peak response is much larger than

that of output and consumption, the response is also significantly less persistent. Such dynamics

of investment would appear consistent with standard model of capital accumulation if tax changes

aﬀect directly the return on capital.

   The impact on hours worked, instead, is estimated to be close to zero until around a year and a

half after the change in taxes. After that, hours worked increases gradually and its peak response,

which occurs 10 quarters after the tax cut, corresponds to approximately a 1 percent increase above

trend. This gradual increase in hours worked indicates a much less significant labor market impact

of tax shocks than the impact on goods markets. Another aspect of the labor market impact is the

eﬀect on real wages. The real wage response to fiscal policy shocks is often seen as a litmus test of

business cycle theories because it reflects the movements in labor supply relative to labor demand.

We find that (before tax) real wages rise gradually but very persistently after a cut in taxes.

   Our estimates of the impact of unanticipated tax liability changes on output are similar to the

univariate results of Romer and Romer (2010) and to the impact of a “basic government revenue

shock” estimated by Mountford and Uhlig (2009). Relative to the estimates of Blanchard and Perotti

(2002), the response of output to tax liability shocks occurs more gradually than their structural

VAR estimate. However, our results are similar to theirs in terms of the persistence of the output

response.

   The right column of Figure 3 illustrates the impulse responses to an anticipated tax cut assum-

ing a 6 quarter anticipation period. We find strong evidence of anticipation eﬀects. During the

pre-implementation period, an anticipated tax cut gives rise to significant declines in output, invest-


                                                  11
ment, and in hours worked. The drop in aggregate output reaches its maximum 1 year before the

implementation of the tax cut where output is estimated to be 1.5 percent below trend. The most

dramatic anticipation eﬀects relate to the impact on aggregate investment which drops 4 percent

below trend 4 quarters before the tax cut is implemented. The anticipation eﬀect on hours worked

is also very pronounced, with hours worked falling 2 percent below trend and remaining below trend

throughout the pre-implementation period.

   The eﬀects of the tax cut announcement on consumption and real wages are quite diﬀerent from

the eﬀects on output, investment and hours worked. We find that the real wage if anything increases

during the pre-implementation period, while consumption remains roughly unaﬀected by the tax

announcement apart from a temporary drop 5 quarters before the tax cut is implemented. The

impact on real wages makes it unlikely that the estimates are significantly contaminated by the lack

of control for other structural shocks such as monetary policy shocks, a point that we will return to.

   Once taxes are cut, the dynamics of the variables resemble the dynamics that follow after an

unanticipated tax cut. Peak eﬀects, however, occur slightly earlier for anticipated tax cuts. Output

starts rising 3 quarters after the tax cut is implemented and reaches a peak increase that corresponds

to a 1.5 percent rise above trend 8 quarters after the implementation of the tax cut. Investment

reaches a 10 percent peak rise over trend 9 quarters after the implementation date. Hours worked

rise slowly but eventually expands 1 percent above trend one year after the tax cut is implemented

while the increase in the real wage during the pre-implementation period persists after taxes are cut.

   The lack of an anticipation eﬀect on consumption is in line with previous estimates in the liter-

ature. Poterba (1988) and Heim (2007) find no significant consumption response to announcements

of future tax changes while Parker (1999) and Souleles (2002) find that consumption reacts to the

implementation of pre-announced tax changes. According to our results the lack of anticipation

eﬀects on consumption is not indicative of the absence of adjustments to announcement of changes

in future taxes since we find strong pre-implementation eﬀects on output, investment, and hours

worked. Romer and Romer (2010), in contrast, find only mild evidence of expectational eﬀects when

examining whether the expected present value of future not yet implemented tax changes aﬀects the

current level of aggregate GDP. A main diﬀerence between their approach and ours is that while

we control for the anticipation horizon, Romer and Romer (20010) examine whether the present


                                                 12
value of future tax changes aﬀect current output regardless of their remaining anticipation lag of the

pre-announced tax changes. It is hard to see that there are any reasons for why for example a tax

change 2 quarters out in the future should have the same impact as, say, a tax change 6 quarters out

in the future. Our results shows quite clearly that there are important anticipation eﬀects when we

take into account the anticipation horizon.10

       Mountford and Uhlig (2009) identify the impact of a pre-announced government revenue shock

using an “ex-post” identification approach based on sign restrictions. In particular, they examine

the impact of a government tax revenue shock that takes place one year out in the future with the

restriction that the shock is orthogonal to “business cycle” shocks and monetary policy shocks. In

contrast to our findings, they find that a pre-announced revenue increase is associated with a pre-

implementation increase in output, while their estimates of the impact on investment agree with

our results. Their identification strategy is fundamentally diﬀerent from ours as they do not include

currently available information about future tax liability changes. For that reason, it is perhaps not

surprising that they find a diﬀerent impact of pre-announced fiscal policy shocks.11

       Our results appear consistent with strong supply side eﬀects of tax changes. The strong decline

in investment and the drop in hours worked in response to a pre-announced tax cut is consistent

with the idea that future lower taxes motivate firms to delay purchases of capital goods and gives

rise to intertemporal substitution of labor supply. Indeed, Mertens and Ravn (2010a) show that a

DSGE model can account quite precisely for the dynamics of output, investment, and hours worked

that follow after unanticipated and anticipated changes in taxes. At the same time, the results do

not appear easily compatible with the idea that the lack of consumption response to announcements

  10
       There are several other diﬀerences between our analysis and that of Romer and Romer (2010). We control for

the interrelationships between the vector of endogenous variables, while Romer and Romer (2010) carry out univariate

regressions. Our analysis allows for a diﬀerent impact of implemented changes in unanticipated and anticipated tax

shocks while Romer and Romer (2010) restrict these to have identical impact apart from the possible impact of lagged

news.
  11
       Moreover, as discussed by Leeper, Walker and Yang (2008), their identification is applied to government tax

revenue rather than to tax liabilities relative to GDP. They assume that government revenue remains constant from

the announcement date until the implementation date. Thus, to the extent that tax revenue is derived from income

taxation, the pre-implementation increase in output that they estimate in response to a future tax revenue increase

implies that tax rates must adjust during the pre-implementation period.


                                                         13
of future tax changes can be interpreted as evidence of a significant share of liquidity constrained

households. In particular, one would think that the ensuing increase in real wages would stimulate

liquidity constrained households to work harder and therefore increase their consumption. For those

reasons, we believe that the results of our exercise are important for understanding better the impact

of fiscal policy shocks and for the development of macroeconomic theory.


3.2       Sensitivity to the Anticipation Horizon

The above analysis assumes pre-announced tax changes can impact on Xt from a maximum of 6

quarters before their implementation. This length of the anticipation period corresponds to the

median anticipation lag in the data. However, there is quite some variation in the anticipation lags

and it is therefore interesting to examine how the results depend on the assumed anticipation horizon.

       Figure 4 illustrates the impact of an anticipated tax liability cut on aggregate GDP when we vary

the maximum anticipation horizon, between 4 and 10 quarters. In each case, we reestimate equation

(2) for K = 4, 6, 8, 10, and then plot the resulting impulse response function. Regardless of the

assumed anticipation horizon, the pre-implementation period is characterized by a drop in output

and, once the tax cut is implemented, the tax cut stimulates the economy. However, the depth of the

pre-implementation downturn and the size of the post-implementation expansion are sensitive to K.

In particular, the longer the assumed maximum anticipation horizon (within reasonable limits), the

deeper is the pre-implementation downturn and the milder is the post-implementation expansion.12

       These results reconcile our findings with those of Blanchard and Perotti (2002) who find little

evidence of anticipation eﬀects, but allow only for a one quarter anticipation horizon. Our estimates

indicate that for longer, and empirically relevant anticipation horizons, there are significant pre-

implementation eﬀects of pre-announced tax liability changes.


3.3       Anticipation Eﬀects of Surprise Tax Changes

The timing convention that we adopt to identify anticipated tax changes is based on the diﬀerence

between the dates at which tax laws were signed by the President and the implementation of the tax

  12
       We find roughly the same results alternatively estimate the anticipation eﬀects for, say, K = 10, and plot the

impulse responses for anticipated shocks under alternative assumptions regarding their anticipation lag.



                                                          14
liability changes according to these laws. This identification scheme does not take into account that

the private economy might have perceived the introduction of tax bills even before they became law.

Such perceptions may occur due to promises made during election campaigns, commitments made

in speeches, policy announcements etc. If such considerations are significant, our results regarding

the existence of anticipation eﬀects and the diﬀerential impact of anticipated and unanticipated tax

shocks would be questionable.

   We examine the relevance of this issue by investigating whether there is any systematic evidence

of responses to leads of surprise tax shocks. If the public had good information about tax changes

before their implementation, we should find that these “anticipated surprise tax shocks” give rise to

much the same adjustment of the economy as the tax shocks that we identify as anticipated on the

basis of the timing convention. We estimate the following model:

                                                           K
                                                           X                   K
                                                                               X
                Xt = A + Bt + C (L) Xt−1 + D (L) τ ut +          Gi τ at,i +         Hi τ ut+i + et   (3)
                                                           i=1                 i=1

which allows for anticipation eﬀects of surprise tax shocks.

   Figure 5 illustrates the impact of a one percentage point decrease in τ ut+6 on output and on

investment. For comparison, this figure also shows the estimates of the impact of anticipated tax

changes from this regression. In contrast to the impact of the impact of anticipated tax shocks

identified using the timing convention, we find no evidence that surprise tax shocks impact on output

or investment prior to their implementation. Thus, there is little evidence to suggest that surprise tax

changes were systematically anticipated by the private sector. This does not preclude the possibility

that specific surprise tax changes were anticipated nor that some of the anticipated tax changes were

expected before they became law. For example, ERTA 1981 was proposed prior to Reagan’s election

and RA 1964 was proposed by Kennedy already in 1962. On the other hand, agents may have been

skeptical about the likelihood that these proposals were actually to be implemented before they

became laws. In any case, the evidence presented here is supportive of our timing based assumptions

regarding the measurement of anticipated tax shocks when evaluated across tax changes.

4         Robustness Analysis

This section provides a detailed robustness analysis. We wish to examine whether the findings

regarding the stimulating impact of implemented tax cuts and the pre-implementation negative

impact of anticipated tax cuts are sensitive to key aspects of our analysis.


4.1         Exogeneity of the Tax Shocks

The first issue that we address is endogeneity of the tax liability changes. The narrative account

identification of fiscal shocks that we have adopted does address endogeneity and we eliminated

all tax liability changes that Romer and Romer (2007) categorize as endogenous responses to the

current or projected state of the economy. However, one may still worry that this does not completely

eliminate the possibility that there is some endogeneity left in the tax changes that these authors

deem exogenous.

         Ideally one would wish to examine the exogeneity of each single tax act in isolation but this is not

feasible statistically. Instead, we group the tax liability changes according to their motivation, that

is whether they were ideologically based or introduced to address deficit concerns, and according to

whether they were anticipated or not. We test for predictability of the tax liability changes using

an ordered probit approach. Let τbst measure the tax liability change of type s announced at date t

where s refers to the motivation of the tax change and to whether it refers to a surprise tax change

or an anticipated tax change.13 We then define the variable yts as:
                                                      ⎧                  ⎫
                                                      ⎪
                                                      ⎪       τ st < 0
                                                        −1 if b          ⎪
                                                                         ⎪
                                                      ⎪
                                                      ⎪                  ⎪
                                                                         ⎪
                                                      ⎨                  ⎬
                                                yts =        τ st = 0
                                                        0 if b
                                                      ⎪
                                                      ⎪                  ⎪
                                                                         ⎪
                                                      ⎪
                                                      ⎪                  ⎪
                                                                         ⎪
                                                      ⎩      τ st > 0
                                                        1 if b           ⎭

         Thus, yts is a dummy variable that takes on on the value −1 when tax cuts are announced, 0

when there are no tax liability changes, and the value 1 when tax increases are announced. We then

test whether this variable is predictable on the basis of past data on the vector of observables Xt

(output, consumption, investment, hours worked and real wages) using ordered probit regressions.

    13
         Since the hypothesis is that preannounced tax changes aﬀect the economy before the implementaiton date, it is

important that the tax liability hanges are dated by the announcement dates rather than the implementation dates.



                                                            16
Since most of the variables in Xt are trending, these tests are carried out using detrended values of

Xt and each regression allows for 4 lags of Xt to enter the probit regressions.14

       Table 1 reports the values of likelihood ratio tests that the coeﬃcients pertaining to the lags

of Xt are all equal to zero and the corresponding p-values of these statistics. The hypothesis that

announcements of tax liability changes taken as one group are predictable can be rejected at the 95

percent level indicating lack of predictability of the tax changes. When we look at the subsets of

the tax liability changes, the evidence in favor of exogeneity is very strong for ideologically based

changes in taxes regardless of their timing. Taken as one group or separated into surprise tax

changes or anticipated tax changes, the p-values of the test that lags of Xt have no predictive power

for ideologically based tax liability changes are all above 99 percent. Thus, we find no evidence to

indicate that changes in taxes motivated by long term growth, fairness, or other ideological reasons

can be predicted.

       The results for deficit driven tax changes are instead more mixed. When we look at this type of

tax changes without distinguishing between the announcement of concurrent or future tax changes,

the p-value of the likelihood ratio test statistic is 48.2 percent. Decomposing these tax changes by

the timing, the p-value for non-predictability of unanticipated tax changes is above 99 percent while

it is 9.5 percent for the announcements of future tax changes. However, as far as the latter regression

is concerned, there is no single element of the vector of lagged values of Xt that individually has any

predictive power for yts . Thus, the evidence against the hypothesis that announcements of future

deficit driven tax shocks are exogenous is, at best, weak.

       We take a conservative approach to these results. Although the evidence against exogeneity of

the tax changes is at best only mild as far as pre-announced deficit driven tax liability changes are

concerned, we repeat the estimation of the impact of tax changes using only ideologically based

tax acts (see Table A.1 for the classification of the tax shocks according to the motivation of their

introduction). Figure 6 shows the impulse responses for this alternative tax shock measure. The

results are robust. We find a slightly smaller impact of surprise tax changes than the benchmark

  14
       We repeated our analysis using lower and higher order lag polynomials of Xt , using linear regressions, and using

simple probits (which test for endogeneity of the timing of the tax announcements). The results were in line with those

reported here.




                                                            17
estimates (although the estimates are within the confidence intervals of the benchmark estimates at

most forecast horizons) but the finding that anticipated tax shocks give rise to a pre-implementation

drop in output and in investment is, if anything, even stronger when deficit driven tax changes are

eliminated. In particular, we now find a 7 percent drop in aggregate investment 4 quarters before

the implementation of the tax cut as compared to 4 percent in the benchmark case. Thus, while

deficit driven tax changes may be partially endogenous, eliminating them from the sample does not

overturn the key results of our analysis.


4.2     Stability Across Tax Acts

Another potential problem is that the results may derive from particular tax acts rather than being

robust across tax acts. High sensitivity to particular tax acts would indicate that the results cannot

be viewed as general, but derive from features special to particular tax acts such as the economic

circumstances under which they were introduced.

   We examine this issue by eliminating particular tax acts from the sample. Three tax acts stand

out as particularly important: The Kennedy tax initiative (the Revenue Act of 1964, RA 1964 in

short), the Reagan tax act (ERTA 1981), and the Bush tax initiatives (the Economic Growth and

Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of

2003, EGTRRA 2001 and JGTRRA 2003). These tax acts included large changes in tax liabilities

and also included several pre-announced changes in taxes. They are therefore prime candidates for

having particularly important consequences for our results and, thus, we examine how the results of

our exercise are sensitive to their elimination. We estimate the following regression:

                                                                                           K

                     b        denote the tax shocks when we eliminate the tax liability changes (i.e. when we

set these tax shocks equal to 0) associated with either the Kennedy tax act, the Reagan tax act, or

the Bush tax acts.

   The results for output, investment and real wages are reported in Figure 7 together with the

benchmark estimates and their confidence intervals. Exclusion of ERTA 1981 implies slightly smaller

responses of output and investment but their shapes are very similar to the benchmark estimates.


                                                            18
The most significant impact of eliminating ERTA 1981 is that we find a much larger real wage increase

to implemented anticipated tax cuts. Excluding RA 1964 has little consequence at all apart from the

real wage response to surprise tax cuts being less strong than in the benchmark case. Finally, when

we eliminate EGTRRA 2001 and JGTRRA 2003 we find even larger output, investment and real wage

increases after surprise tax cuts than in the benchmark regressions while the eﬀects of anticipated tax

cuts are basically unaﬀected. In summary, although the quantitative impact of tax shocks depends

somewhat on the tax acts that are considered, the main results are robust to eliminating particular

tax acts.

   We also note that we find a consistent tendency for the real wage to increase during the pre-

implementation period in response to an anticipated tax cut. This result is important because it

addresses indirectly a concern that the estimated pre-implementation drop in activity derives from

lack of control for monetary policy variables (an issue that we examine in detail below). In particular,

since the ERTA 1981 coincided with the Volcker disinflation, one might worry that our results are

sensitive to the omission of monetary policy variables. However, not only do we find that the results

are robust to eliminating this tax act, but the rise in the real wage also appears at odds with this

hypothesis. The reason is that standard monetary models would predict that the real wage should

decline in response to a contractionary monetary policy shock (such as the Volcker experiment) due

to the ensuing increase in the markup. We find instead a rise in the real wage which lends no support

to this hypothesis.


4.3   Permanent vs. Temporary Tax Changes

The tax shock measure that we study aggregates together tax liability changes that were meant to

be permanent and tax changes meant to be temporary. In theory one would like to treat these tax

changes separately although the distinction in practice is less clear-cut since tax changes that were

meant to be permanent have occasionally been reversed subsequently (and in some cases, tax changes

meant to be temporary have subsequently been extended).

   Nevertheless, it is of interest to examine whether this distinction matters for the results. Table

   A.1 records the persistence of the tax liability changes and we note that eliminating temporary

tax changes corresponds to removing in total 10 tax liability changes from the sample out of which


                                                  19
the Jobs and Growth Relief Tax Reconciliation Act of 2003 is the most important one. Figure 8 shows

the responses of aggregate output, consumption and investment to the tax shocks when we consider

only those tax changes that were explicitly meant to be permanent. The results are qualitatively

very similar to those that we reported in Section 3. Quantitatively, we find a larger response of

output and its components to surprise tax changes when we consider only permanent tax changes,

a finding that appears natural. The impact of anticipated tax shocks is also quite similar to the

benchmark results, although we now find some evidence to suggest a pre-implementation drop in

private sector consumption. Nevertheless, as in the benchmark results, the anticipation eﬀects are

much more pronounced for output and investment than for consumption.


4.4     Other Structural Shocks

Finally, we consider whether our results are aﬀected by the lack of control for other structural shocks.

We wish to emphasize that lack of control for other structural shocks is only a concern due to small

sample considerations.


4.4.1    Monetary Policy Shocks

One of the largest sequence of tax shocks in our sample, the Reagan tax cuts, coincides with an

important monetary policy intervention, the Volcker disinflation. The deliberate disinflationary

period of the Volcker chairmanship took its course during the period November 1980 to June 1982

(see Goodfriend and King, 2005). During this period, interest rates were hiked and by mid-1981

the federal funds rate peaked at 19 percent while the Tbond rate peaked a few months later at

more than 15 percent. Thus, when Reagan signed the ERTA in August 1981, it was in the midst

of the Fed’s attempts to stabilize inflation. We have already provided evidence above in Section 4.1

that eliminating ERTA 1981 from the sample does not substantially alter the results. Therefore, we

are skeptical about contamination during this particular experiment, but this does not exclude the

possibility that there is a more systematic problem when omitting controls for monetary policy.

   In order to address this issue we augment the VAR with variables that allow us to control for

monetary policy shocks and introduce identifying assumptions adopted in the SVAR literature to

derive estimates of the monetary policy shocks and their eﬀects. We estimate the following VAR:



                                                  20
                                                                             K
                                                                             X
                    et = A + Bt + C (L) X
                    X                   et−1 + D (L) τ ut + F (L) τ at,0 +         Gi τ at,i + et    (4)
                                                                             i=1

      et consists of the following vector of variables:
where X

                                           et = [yt , it , zt , rt , nt ]0
                                           X


   zt is a vector of variables consisting of the (annualized) inflation rate, and the commodity price

inflation rate, rt is the federal funds rate, and nt denotes non-borrowed reserves (see the Appendix

for precise definitions and sources). Given lack of data for non-borrowed reserves for the earliest part

of the sample, we restrict the sample period to 1959:1-2006:4. This VAR is estimated using 4 lags of

the vector of endogenous variables. This introduces a large number of parameters to be estimated

and for that reason we eliminate consumption from the VAR. For the same reason, we set R = 6.

   We assume that the interest rate is aﬀected contemporaneously by all the variables in the VAR

apart from non-borrowed reserves. We also allow the interest rate to react contemporaneously to

innovations to the tax shocks. The variables ordered before the interest rate in the VAR (i.e. all but

non-borrowed reserves) are assumed not to react contemporaneously to monetary policy shocks while

non-borrowed reserves is not constrained this way. These assumptions identify the monetary policy

shock as the innovation to the federal funds rate given a Cholesky decomposition of the covariance

matrix of et , see Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1996).

   Figure 9 illustrates the impact of the tax shocks on output, investment, inflation, and the federal

funds rate. The results are very similar to the benchmark estimates. Interestingly, we find that the

federal funds rate initially decreases in response to a surprise cut in taxes but then eventually returns

to its normal level 1.5-2 years after the tax cut. As in the benchmark estimates, the anticipated tax

cut gives rise to a pre-implementation drop in aggregate output and investment as well as in the

inflation rate and the nominal interest rate. The associated drop in aggregate investment during the

pre-implementation period is slightly larger than in the benchmark estimates of Section 3 while the

output drop is slightly smaller.

   All in all, we find a remarkable degree of robustness of the benchmark results. Thus, our estimates

of the impact of tax policy shocks do not appear contaminated by the lack of control for monetary

policy variables.


                                                        21
4.4.2   Government Spending

One may also worry about possible correlations of the tax changes with other fiscal policy shocks.

In particular, it is possible that the results are sensitive to in-sample correlation with shocks to fiscal

spending. We address this issue in the same fashion as above by controlling directly for government

spending shocks. We estimate the following VAR:

                                        4
                                        X                                              K
                                                                                       X
         bt = A + Bt + C (L) X
         X                   bt−1 +            H(L)Wit + D (L) τ ut + F (L) τ at,0 +         Gi τ at,i + et   (5)
                                         i=1                                           i=1

      bt is the following vector of variables:
where X

                                          bt = [gt , vt , yt , ct , it ]0
                                          X


   The variable gt denotes gross federal purchases of goods and services, and vt denotes federal

revenues (both measured in real per capita terms, see the appendix for precise definitions). As

in Burnside, Eichenbaum and Fisher (2004) and Ramey (2008), the fiscal VAR includes controls

for (scaled) Ramey and Shapiro (1998) war dummies augmented with a 9/11 dummy as in Ramey

(2008). These dummies, captured by Wit , control for changes in federal military spending associated

with the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the Carter-Reagan military buildup, and 9/11. The war

dummies are equal to zero at all dates apart from 1950:3 for W1t , 1965:1 for W2t , 1980:1 for W3t and

2001:3 for W4t . We normalize W1,1950:3 = 1 while following Ramey (2008), we set W2,1965:1 = 0.3,

W3,1980:1 = 0.1 and W4,2001:3 = 0.1, see also Burnside, Eichenbaum and Fisher (2004). Government

spending shocks are thus measured by the war dummies which provides a symmetric treatment to the

narrative approach of the measurement of the tax shocks. One slight worry is changes government

spending may also be associated with anticipation eﬀects. It is beyond the scope of this paper to

evaluate this problem but Ramey (2008) provides some evidence of the relevance of this issue.

   The responses to a 1 percent tax cut when we control for government spending are reported

in Figure 10. The impact on output, consumption, and investment are practically identical to the

benchmark case. An anticipated tax cut gives rise to a pre-implementation drop in output and in

investment while consumption is roughly constant throughout the pre-implementation period. As

in the benchmark estimates, once taxes are eventually cut, there is a significant rise in output and

its components. Thus, we find no evidence to suggest that our results are contaminated by lack of

                                                       22
control for government spending shocks.

    Finally, we note that an unanticipated tax shock is associated with a temporary drop in govern-

ment spending, a finding that would be consistent with a “starving the beast” hypothesis regarding

the government spending eﬀects of tax cuts. This result, however, is sensitive to the inclusion of

changes in tax liabilities that are related to concerns about inherited government deficits. Elimi-

nating these tax changes, we find that government spending increases after a cut in taxes which is

consistent with the estimates of Romer and Romer (2009).



5    Tax Shocks and the U.S. Business Cycle

We now examine if the tax shocks have had important business cycle consequences. We carry out

this analysis using a counterfactual framework. In particular, we simulate the estimated VAR process

setting the vector ebt equal to zero and using the point estimates of the estimated parameter vectors.

The resulting time-series for the observables are then Hodrick-Prescott filtered (assuming a value

of the smoothing parameter of 1600). These counterfactual time-series are then compared with the

actual time series for the observables.

    The results of this exercise using the benchmark VAR are reported in Figure 11. We show the

counterfactual time series for output, consumption and investment for three diﬀerent simulations.

In the first simulation we allow only for surprise tax shocks thus setting τ at,i = 0 for all t and all

i = 0, 1, .., K. These results are reported in panel A. In the second case we allow only for anticipated

tax shocks thus setting τ ut = 0 for all t. These results are shown in panel B. Finally, in the third

simulation, we allow for both types of tax shocks. In all cases, the counterfactual time series are

shown with thick lines while the actual time series are illustrated with the lighter lines. In each

figure, grey areas illustrate recessions according to the NBER datings.

    Both anticipated and unanticipated tax shocks have provided important impulses to the business

cycle. Surprise tax changes were important impulses to the business cycle during three episodes.

During the early to mid 1960’s, the 2.55 percent tax liability cut contained in RA of 1964 provided a

major stimulus to the economy which accounts for a large fraction of the boom in the U.S. economy

during the mid 1960’s. The 1.23 percent tax cut contained in the Revenue Act of 1971 contributed to

the pre-OPEC I boom of the U.S. economy in the early 1970’s. Finally, the 2.86 percent tax liability

                                                  23
cut associated with JGTRRA 2003 provided a major boost to the economy in the mid 2000’s.

       Anticipated tax liability changes were particularly relevant impulses to the business cycle dur-

ing the early 1980’s recession, the expansion that followed thereafter, and during the early 2000’s.

Particularly interesting is the 1980’s episode where we find that ERTA 1981 and the Social Secu-

rity Amendments of 1977 together had a large impact on the U.S. economy. The Social Security

Amendments of 1977 (signed by Carter in December 1977) included a 0.56 percent tax increase im-

plemented in 1981. This tax liability change had an expansionary eﬀect on the economy prior to its

implementation but provided a negative stimulus once implemented in 1981. ERTA 1981, signed by

Reagan in August 1981, was associated with major tax cuts implemented gradually from 1982 to

1984. These anticipated tax cuts had a negative impact on the U.S. economy from late 1981 up till

the end of 1983, the same time as the negative eﬀects of the Social Security Amendments of 1977

were setting in. When the Reagan tax cuts were eventually implemented through 1982 to 1984, it

provided a major stimulus to the economy during the mid 1980’s. Together, these anticipated tax

cuts therefore stimulated the economy prior to 1981, gave rise to a contractionary eﬀects from 1981

to late 1983, and helped the economy recover thereafter. Quantitatively, our results indicate that

the early 1980’s recession was to a large extent caused by fiscal policy rather than induced by tight

monetary policy during the Volcker monetary regime.

       Anticipation eﬀects are also relevant in the case of EGTRRA 2001 and JGTRRA 2003 signed

by Bush in June 2001 and in May 2003, respectively. The former introduced a 0.80 percent cut in

tax liabilities in the first quarter of 2002 while the latter introduced anticipated tax increases in the

third quarter of 2004 (a 1.70 percent increase) and in the first quarter of 2005 (a 0.56 increase). In

agreement with the simulations of House and Shapiro (2006), we find that the anticipation eﬀects

of the first of these tax acts contributed to the slow recovery from the 2001 U.S. recession, while

the implementation of the tax cut helped stimulate the economy from 2002 onwards. Ironically, the

anticipation eﬀects associated with the tax increases incorporated in JGTRRA 2003 further stimu-

lated the economy during the pre-implementation period (2003q2 - 2004q3) until its implementation

eventually starts having a negative impact from the end of 2004 onwards.15

  15
       Note that we exclude parts of the tax changes in EGTRRA 2001 since Romer and Romer (2007) categorize the

temporary tax cut as an endogenous response to the state of the business cycle.



                                                        24
    When we allow for both types of tax shocks, see panel C, we find that they have accounted

for around 20 percent of the in-sample variance of output and its components at business cycle

frequencies. Moreover, the correlation between the counterfactual time-series and the actual time-

series is high (around 56 percent for output, and 48 percent for consumption and investment). Thus,

we conclude that tax shocks play a major role as business cycle impulses, a finding that is in line

with McGrattan (1994).

    Perhaps the most controversial result of this exercise is the importance of anticipated tax changes

for the early 1980’s recession. To establish the robustness of this result, Figure 12 reports the

counterfactual time-series for output based on the VAR in equation (4) where we control for monetary

policy. In this figure we also show the counterfactual output series that derives from allowing only for

monetary policy shocks. Our results are robust. At the trough of the early 1980’s contraction, output

is 4.6 percent below trend. According to the benchmark estimates, the tax shocks by themselves give

rise to a 3.3 percent drop in output and the anticipated tax cuts account for almost all of this drop.

When we reestimate the VAR allowing for monetary variables, tax shocks give rise to a 2.6 percent

drop in output again with most of the action coming from anticipated tax shocks. By contrast,

the monetary policy shocks account for a maximum one percent drop in output. Moreover, in the

counterfactual experiment, the tax shocks can account for 27 percent of the output variance when

we introduce monetary variables in the VAR, and estimate that is even higher than the benchmark

estimate. Thus, the finding that tax shocks were key for accounting for the early 1980’s recession is

robust and is not due to lack of control for monetary policy shocks.



6    Conclusions

We have investigated the dynamic eﬀects of tax liability changes in the U.S. during the postwar

period. We distinguished between anticipated and unanticipated tax shocks on the basis of a timing

convention. In particular, we assume that tax shocks that were introduced more than 90 days after

they became law were anticipated while tax liability changes implemented within 90 days of becoming

law are classified as surprise tax shocks. We have documented that unanticipated tax cuts give rise

to a major stimulus to the economy which is reflected in persistent increases in output, consumption,

investment and, to a smaller extent, hours worked. Anticipated tax cuts also stimulate the economy

                                                  25
once taxes are cut, but during the pre-implementation period, we find that output, investment

and hours worked drop while consumption is roughly unchanged. A number of earlier studies have

documented little impact of tax announcements on consumption until taxes are eventually changed,

a finding that is consistent with our results. The finding of important anticipation eﬀects on output,

investment and hours worked is new to the literature, however. Moreover, we showed through

extensive robustness analysis that these results do not derive from special assumptions that we

made, nor that they are caused by endogeneity of the tax changes or by missing control for other

popular structural shocks.

   Tax shocks have provided important impulses to the U.S. business cycle. In particular, we

showed that the two tax shocks have been important for several business cycle episodes in the U.S.

Particularly interesting may be our finding that tax changes were key for understanding the early

1980’s recession and the mid-1980’s expansion of the U.S. economy. The tax shocks altogether can

account for around 20-25 percent of the in-sample variance of (detrended) output, an estimate that

is at least as large as the contribution of other popular candidates for business cycle impulses.

   Our results regarding the presence of anticipation eﬀects have important consequences. First,

it provides some empirical evidence towards which theories of anticipation eﬀects can be evaluated.

Preexisting evidence has been scarce on this since it has mainly been concerned with consumption

responses to pre-announced tax changes and has found little impact on consumption of such tax

announcements (until they become implemented). Therefore, our results regarding the output, in-

vestment, and labor market impact of tax announcements provide some valuable findings that one

can use for model evaluation. Mertens and Ravn (2010a) carry out such an exercise. Secondly, our

results may also have some relevance for the recent interest into the “news” view of business cycles,

see e.g. Beaudry and Portier (2004, 2006), Cochrane (1994), Danthine, Donaldson and Johnsen

(1998), den Haan and Kaltenbrunner (2009), or Jaimovich and Rebelo (2006). An important ob-

stacle to empirical tests for a news driven business cycle theory is that expectations are inherently

diﬃcult to estimate as they are unobserved by the econometrician, but we overcome this diﬃculty

in our application to fiscal policy. Our finding that a pre-announced tax cut gives rise to a pre-

implementation contraction in the economy may be important for understanding how news shocks

help shape fluctuations in the economy.


                                                  26
    It would be interesting to extend our analysis to other parts of fiscal policy. Ramey (2008)

provides some first evidence that anticipation eﬀects may account for some of the more puzzling recent

findings about the impact of government spending shocks that derive from VAR based measures of

fiscal shocks. In particular, she shows that the fiscal shocks identified by VAR based methods (that

rely on decision lags for identification) appear to be predictable on the basis of publicly available

forecasts of changes in fiscal policy. Moreover, by simulating a DSGE model she shows that ignoring

such anticipation eﬀects may lead to seriously biased estimates of the impact of fiscal policy shocks.

It would therefore be interesting to examine also whether there are signs of such anticipation eﬀects

in the data using similar methods to those that we have proposed in this paper.

Here we outline how the empirical VAR model can be obtained from a DSGE model. Suppose that labor income and

capital income tax rates are stochastic and given by the processes:


                                       τ nt = (1 − ρn ) τ n + ρn τ nt−1 + εnt + ξ nt,0                                 (6)

                                       τ ks = (1 − ρk ) τ k + ρk τ kt−1 + εkt + ξ kt,0                                 (7)

where    τ n , τ k ∈ [0, 1) are constants that determine the long run unconditional means of the two tax rates. There are

                                                     t and εt ) and anticipated tax shocks (ξ t,b and ξ t,b ). The latter

are pre-announced    b quarters in advance and ξ it,0 denotes the anticipated tax shock to tax rate i which is implemented

at date t. The innovations to the tax rates are iid with zero mean, εt       ∼ iid (0, Ωε ) and ξ t ∼ iid (0, Ωξ ) where
    £         ¤0        £           ¤0
εt = εnt , εkt and ξ t = ξ nt , ξ kt . The innovations to the tax rates are allowed to be correlated but we assume that

εt and ξ t,b are orthogonal.

       The solution to a linear rational expectations model can be expressed as:


                                               Zs = ΛZ Zs−1 + ΞZ Ws                                                    (8)

                                              Ws = ΞW Ws−1 + ΓW ηs                                                     (9)

                                               Us = ΛU Zs−1 + ΞU Ws                                                   (10)

where    Zs is a vector of endogenous states, Ws is a vector of exogenous states, η s a vector of innovations including the

tax shocks, and   Us is a vector of controls. Let Ys be a vector of observables and suppose we wish to estimate how tax

innovations aﬀect the dynamics of this vector. This vector is assumed to be a subset (or linear combinations of) of the

set of controls and states. The solution for the observables,   Ys can be expressed as:

                                                 Ys = ΛY Zs−1 + ΞY Ws                                                 (11)

It follows from equation   (8) that:

                                               Zs = (I − ΛZ L)−1 ΞZ Ws                                                (12)

which converges under the condition that the roots of     ΛZ are strictly less than one in modulus. Under the condition

that   ΛY is invertible, equations (11) − (12) imply that


                                                          ¡             ¢
                           Ys = ΛY ΛZ Λ−1                           −1
                                       Y Ys−1 + ΞY Ws + ΛY ΞZ − ΛZ ΛY ΞY Ws−1


                                                             35
Assume that   dim (Y ) = dim (Z) so that there are as many innovations as measurement variables. From equation

(9) we have that:

                                   Ws = ΓW η s + ΞW ΓW η s−1 + Ξ2W ΓW η s−2 + ..

which converges given that    ΞW has roots inside the unit circle. Inserting this into equation (??) we find that:

    Therefore, the roots of  ΞW are less than or equal to one under the conditions that |ρn | < 1 and ¯ρk ¯ < 1.

Finally, in order to derive equation (??) note that, η s−j =   εns−j εks−j ξ ns−j,b−j ξ ks,b−j    for j < b while

η s−j = εns−j εks−j ξ ns+b−j,0 ξ ks+b−j,0 . Thus, the process for the observables can be expressed as:

no predictive power for tax liability changes dated by their

null of no predictability. The vector Xt includes linearly

detrended logarithms of output, investment, consumption,
