The Bond Market's q
Thomas Philippon
NBER Working Paper No. 12462
August 2006, Revised February 2008
JEL No. E0,E44,G31

                                            ABSTRACT

I propose an implementation of the q-theory of investment using bond prices instead of equity prices.
Credit risk makes corporate bond prices sensitive to future asset values, and q can be inferred from
bond prices. The bond market's q performs much better than the usual measure in standard investment
equations. With aggregate data, the fit is three times better, cash flows are driven out and the implied
adjustment costs are reduced by more than an order of magnitude. The new measure also improves
firm level investment equations.

      In his 1969 article, James Tobin argued that “the rate of investment — the speed at
which investors wish to increase the capital stock — should be related, if to anything, to q,
the value of capital relative to its replacement cost.1 ” Tobin also recognized, however, that
q must depend on “expectations, estimates of risk, attitudes towards risk, and a host of
other factors,” and he concluded that “it is not to be expected that the essential impact
of [..] financial events will be easy to measure in the absence of direct observation of the
relevant variables (q in the models).” The quest for an observable proxy for q was therefore
recognized as a crucial objective from the very beginning.
      Subsequent research succeeded in integrating Tobin’s approach with the neoclassical
investment theory of Jorgenson (1963). Lucas and Prescott (1971) proposed a dynamic
model of investment with convex adjustment costs, and Abel (1979) showed that the rate of
investment is optimal when the marginal cost of installment is equal to q−1. Finally, Hayashi
(1982) showed that, under perfect competition and constant returns to scale, marginal
q (the market value of an additional unit of capital divided by its replacement cost) is
equal to average q (the market value of existing capital divided by its replacement cost).
Since average q is observable, the theory became empirically relevant. Unfortunately, its
implementation proved disappointing. The investment equation fits poorly, leaves large
unexplained residuals correlated with cash flows, and implies implausible parameters for
the adjustment cost function (see Summers (1981) for an early contribution, and Hassett
and Hubbard (1997) and Caballero (1999) for recent literature reviews).
      Several theories have been proposed to explain this failure. Firms could have market
power, and might not operate under constant returns to scale. Adjustment costs might
not be convex (Dixit and Pindyck (1994), Caballero and Engle (1999)). Firms might be
credit constrained (Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988), Bernanke and Gertler (1989)).
Finally, there could be measurement errors and aggregation biases in the capital stock or
the rate of investment.
      None of these explanations is fully satisfactory, however. The evidence for constant
returns and price taking seems quite strong (Hall (2003)). Adjustment costs are certainly not
convex at the plant level, but it is not clear that it really matters in the aggregate (Thomas
(2002), Hall (2004)), although this is still a controversial issue (Bachmann, Caballero, and

      Tobin (1969), page 21.

Engel (2006)). Gomes (2001) shows that Tobin’s q can capture most of investment dynamics
even when there are credit constraints. Heterogeneity and aggregation do not seem to create
strong biases (Hall (2004)).
   In fact, an intriguing message comes out of the more recent empirical research: the
market value of equity seems to be the culprit for the empirical failure of the investment
equation. Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995), following Abel and Blanchard (1986), use VARs
to forecast cash flows and to construct q, and they find that it performs better than the
traditional measure based on equity prices. Cumins, Hasset, and Oliner (2006) use analysts’
forecasts instead of VAR forecasts, and reach similar conclusions. Erickson and Whited
(2000) and Erickson and Whited (2006) use GMM estimators to purge q from measurement
errors. They find that only 40 percent of observed variations are due to fundamental
changes, and, once again, that market values contain large ‘measurement errors’.
   Applied research has therefore reached an uncomfortable situation, where the bench-
mark investment equation appears to be successful only when market prices are not used
to construct q. This is unfortunate, since Tobin’s insight was precisely to link observed
quantities and market prices. The contribution of this paper is to show that a market-
based measure of q can be constructed from corporate bond prices, and that this measure
performs much better than the traditional one.
   Why would the bond market’s q perform better than the usual measure? There are
several possible explanations. First, the bond market might be less susceptible to bubbles
than the equity market. In fact, there is empirical and theoretical support for the idea that
mispricing is more likely to happen when returns are positively skewed. Barberis and Huang
(2007) show that cumulative prospect theory predicts that a positively skewed security can
be overpriced. Brunnermeier, Gollier, and Parker (2007) argue that preference for skewness
arises endogenously because investors chooses to be optimistic about the states associated
with the most skewed Arrow-Debreu securities. Empirically, Mitton and Vorkink (2007)
document that under-diversification is largely explained by the fact that investors sacrifice
mean-variance eﬃciency for higher skewness exposure. Purely rational explanations can
also be proposed. These explanations typically involve diﬀerent degrees of asymmetric
information, market segmentation, and heterogeneity in adjustment costs and stochastic



                                             3
processes.2 They can create conceptual diﬃculties regarding the correct definition of firm
value or the proper goals of managers. It is much too early at this stage to take a stand
on which explanations are correct, and which ones are not. My goal is more modest: it is
simply to provide a new measure of q based on market prices.
       Of course, even if bond prices are somehow more reliable than equity prices, it is far
from obvious that it is actually possible to use bond prices to construct q. The contribution
of this paper is precisely to show how one can do so, by combining the insights of Black and
Scholes (1973) and Merton (1974) with the approach of Abel (1979) and Hayashi (1982). In
the Black-Scholes-Merton model, debt and equity are seen as derivatives of the underlying
assets. In the simplest case, the market value of corporate debt is a function of its face
value, asset volatility and asset value. But one can also invert the function, so that, given
asset volatility and the face value of debt, one can construct an estimate of asset value from
observed bond prices. I extend this logic to the case where asset value is endogenously
determined by capital expenditures decisions.
       Like in Hayashi (1982), I assume constant returns to scale, perfect competition, and
convex adjustment costs. There are no taxes and no bankruptcy costs, so the Modigliani-
Miller Theorem holds, and real investment decisions are independent from capital structure
decisions.3 Firms issue long-term, coupon-paying bonds as in Leland (1998), and the default
boundary is endogenously determined to maximize equity value, as in Leland and Toft
(1996). There are two crucial diﬀerences between my model and the usual asset pricing
models. First, physical assets change over time. Under constant returns to scale, however,
I obtain tractable pricing formulas, where the usual variables are simply scaled by the
book value of assets. Thus, book leverage plays the role of the face value of principal
outstanding, and q plays the role of total asset value. The second diﬀerence is that cash
flows are endogenous, because they depend on adjustment costs and investment decisions.
       I model an economy with a continuum of firms hit by aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks.
   2
     Consider for instance the random arrival of a new technology. News about the technology can have a
large impact on equity values, but if it is not possible to invest in the new technology before it actually arrives,
there would be no corresponding change in capital expenditures. In addition, firms might be reluctant to use
equity to finance capital expenditures, because of adverse selection, in which case the bond market might
provide a better measure of investment opportunities (Myers (1984))
   3
     One could introduce taxes and bankruptcy costs if one wanted to derive an optimal capital structure,
but this is not the focus of this paper. See Hackbarth, Miao, and Morellec (2006) for such an analysis, with
a focus on macroeconomic risk.



                                                         4
Even though default is a discrete event at the firm level, the aggregate default rate is a
continuous function of the state of the economy. To build the economic intuition, I consider
first a simple example with one-period debt, constant risk free rates, and iid firm level
shocks. I find that, to a first order (i.e., for small aggregate shocks), Tobin’s q is a linear
function of the spread of corporate bonds over government bonds. The sensitivity of q to
bond spreads depends on the risk neutral default rate, just like the delta of an option in
the Black-Scholes formula. In the general case, I choose the parameters of the model to
match aggregate and firm level dynamics, estimated with post-war U.S. data. Given book
leverage and idiosyncratic volatility, the model produces a non-linear mapping from bond
yields to q.
       I then use the theoretical mapping to construct a time series for q based on the yield of
Baa and government bonds, taking into account trends in book leverage and idiosyncractic
risk, as well as changes in real risk free rates. This bond market’s q fits the investment
equation quite well with post-war aggregate US data. The R2 is around 60%, cash flows
become insignificant, and the implied adjustment costs are more than an order of magnitude
smaller than with the usual measure of q. The fit is as good in levels as in diﬀerences.4
       At the firm level, I use credit ratings to construct a proxy for bond prices, and I use
the model’s mapping to construct q. The coeﬃcient estimated in the cross section is fairly
similar to the one estimated in the time series. Recent work by Gilchrist and Zakrajsek
(2007) also provides evidence that firm specific interest rates forecast firm level investment.
At the firm level, however, equity and cash flows remain strongly significant.
       The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. In section 1, I present the setup of
the model. In section 2, I study a simple case to build the economic intuition. In section
3, I present the numerical solution for the general case. In section 4, I present evidence
based on aggregate data. In section 5, I present evidence based on firm level data. Section
6 concludes.
   4
    Cochrane (1996) finds a significant correlation between stock returns and the growth rate of the aggregate
capital stock, but Hassett and Hubbard (1997) argue that it is driven by the correlation with residential
investment, not corporate investment. In any case, I find that the bond market’s q outperforms the usual
measure both in diﬀerences and in levels.

1        Model
1.1       Firm value and investment

Time is discrete and runs from t = 0 to ∞. The production technology has constant returns
to scale and all markets are perfectly competitive. All factors of production, except physical
capital, can be freely adjusted within each period. Physical capital is predetermined in
period t and, to make this clear, I denote it by kt−1 . Once other inputs have been chosen
optimally, the firm’s profits are therefore equal to pt kt−1 , where pt is the exogenous profit
rate in period t. Let the function Γ (kt−1 , kt ) capture the total cost of adjusting the level
of capital from kt−1 to kt . For convenience, I include depreciation in the function Γ, and I
assume that it is homogenous of degree one, as in Hayashi (1982).5
        Let rt be the one period real interest rate, and let E π [.] denote expectations under the
risk neutral probability measure π.6 The state of the firm at time t is characterized by the
endogenous state variable kt and a vector of exogenous state variables ωt , which follows a
Markov process under π. The profit rate and the risk free rate are functions of ωt . The
value of the firm solves the Bellman equation:
                                   ½                                                        ¾
                                                                  E π [V (kt , ωt+1 ) |ωt ]
           V (kt−1 , ω t ) = max p (ω t ) kt−1 − Γ (kt−1 , kt ) +                             .              (1)
                             kt ≥0                                      1 + r (ωt )

Since the technology exhibits constant returns to scale, it is convenient to work with the
scaled value function:
                                                          Vt
                                                  vt ≡        .                                              (2)
                                                         kt−1
                                                     kt
Similarly, define the growth of k as: xt ≡          kt−1 .   After dividing both sides of equation (1) by
kt−1 , and using the shortcut notation ω 0 for ω t+1 , we obtain:
                               ½                                        ¾
                                                       x      π
                                                                £ ¡ 0¢ ¤
                   v (ω) = max p (ω) − γ (x) +               E v ω |ω ,                                      (3)
                           x≥0                     1 + r (ω)
    5
     For instance, the often used case of quadratic adjustment costs corresponds to: Γ (kt , kt+1 ) = kt+1 −
(1 − d) kt + 0.5Γ0 (kt+1 − kt )2 /kt , where d is the depreciation rate, and Γ0 is a constant that pins down the
curvature of the adjustment cost function.
   6
     Pricing a bond is like pricing a derivative. Using risk neutral probabilities instead of pricing kernels is
therefore going to simplify the notations and the algebra. In any case, it is crucial to account for risk premia.
For instance, Berndt, Douglas, Duﬃe, Ferguson, and Schranz (2005) show that objective probabilities of
default are much smaller than risk-adjusted probabilities of default. Lettau and Ludvigson (2002) also
emphasize the role of time varying risk premia.

where γ is the re-normalized version of Γ. The function γ is assumed to be convex and to
satisfy limx→0 γ (x) = ∞ and limx→∞ γ (x) = ∞. The optimal investment rate x (ω) solves:

                             ∂γ                   E π [v (ω 0 ) |ω]
                                (x (ω)) = q (ω) ≡                   .                       (4)
                             ∂x                     1 + r (ω)

Equation (4) defines the q-theory of investment: it says that the marginal cost of investment
is equal to the expected discounted marginal product of capital. The most important
practical issue is the construction of the right-hand side of equation (4).

1.2   Measuring q

The value of the firm is the value of its debt plus the value of its equity. Let Bt be the
market values of the bonds outstanding at the end of period t, and define bt as the value
scaled by end of period physical assets:

                                                    Bt
                                            bt ≡       .                                    (5)
                                                    kt

Similarly, let e (ω) be the ex-dividend value of equity, scaled by end of period assets. Then,
q is simply:
                                    q (ω) = e (ω) + b (ω) .                                 (6)

The most natural way to test the q-theory of investment is therefore to use equation (6)
to construct the right hand side of equation (4). Unfortunately, it fits poorly in practice
(Summers (1981), Hassett and Hubbard (1997), Caballero (1999)). Equation (6) has been
estimated using aggregate and firm level data, in levels or in first diﬀerences, with or without
debt on the right-hand-side. It leaves large unexplained residuals correlated with cash flows,
and it implies implausible values for the adjustment cost function γ (x).
   As argued in the introduction, there are potential explanations for this empirical failure,
but none is really satisfactory. Moreover, a common finding of the recent research is that
“measurement errors” in equity seem to be responsible for the failure of q-theory (Gilchrist
and Himmelberg (1995), Erickson and Whited (2000), Cumins, Hasset, and Oliner (2006),
Erickson and Whited (2006)). I do not attempt in this paper to explain the meaning of
these “measurement errors”. I simply argue that, even if equity prices do not provide a
good measure of q, it is still possible to construct another one using observed bond prices.



                                                7
1.3   Corporate debt

I assume that there are no taxes and no deadweight losses from financial distress. The
Modigliani and Miller theorem implies that leverage policy does not aﬀect firm value or
investment. Leverage does aﬀect bond prices, however, and I must specify debt dynamics
before I can use bond prices to estimate q. The model used here belongs to the class of
structural model of debt, with endogenous default boundary. In this class of models, default
is chosen endogenously to maximize equity value (see Leland (2004) for an illuminating
discussion).
   There are many diﬀerent types of long term liabilities, and my goal here is not to study
all of them, but rather to focus on a tractable model of long term debt. To do so, I
use a version of the exponential model introduced in Leland (1994), and used by Leland
(1998) and Hackbarth, Miao, and Morellec (2006) among others. In this model, the firm
continuously issues and retires bonds. Specifically, a fraction φ of the remaining principal is
called at par every period. The retired bonds are replaced by new ones. To understand the
timing of cash flows, consider a bond with coupon c and principal normalized to 1, issued
at the end of period t. The promised cash flows for this particular bond are:

                    t+1     t+2               ...   τ                       ...
                    c+φ     (1 − φ) (c + φ)   ...   (1 − φ)τ −t−1 (c + φ)   ...

Let Fτ −1 be the sum of the face values of all the bonds outstanding at the beginning of
period τ . I use the index τ − 1 to make clear that this variable, just like physical capital, is
predetermined at the beginning of each period. The timing of events in each period is the
following

  1. The firm enters period τ with capital kτ −1 and total face value of outstanding bonds
      Fτ −1 .

  2. The state variable ωτ is realized. The value of the firm is then Vτ = vτ kτ −1 , defined
      in equations (1) and (3).

       (a) If equity value falls to zero, the firm defaults and the bond holders recover Vτ .

       (b) Otherwise, the bond holders receive cash flows (c + φ) Fτ −1 .



                                                8
  3. At the end of period τ , the capital stock is kτ , the face value of the bonds (including
        newly issued ones) is Fτ , and their market value is Bτ = bτ kτ .7

      In Leland (1994) and Leland (1998), book assets are constant, since there is no physical
investment, and the firm simply chooses a constant face value F . In my setup, the corre-
sponding assumption is that the firm chooses a constant book leverage ratio. I therefore
make the following assumption:

      Assumption: Firms maintain a constant book leverage ratio: f ≡ Ft /kt

      A bond issued at the end of period t has a remaining face value of (1 − φ)τ −t−1 at the
beginning of period τ . In case of default during period τ , all bonds are treated similarly and
the bond issued at time t receives (1 − φ)τ −t−1 Vτ /Fτ −1 . Since all outstanding bonds are
treated similarly in case of default, we can characterize the price without specifying when
this principal was issued. The following proposition characterizes the debt pricing function.


Proposition 1 The scaled value of corporate debt solves the equation:

                               1        £   ©                     ¡ ¢ ¡ ¢ª ¤
                 b (ω) =             E π min (c + φ) f + (1 − φ) b ω 0 ; v ω 0 |ω .         (7)
                           1 + r (ω)

      Proof. See appendix.

      The intuition behind equation (7) is relatively simple. Default happens when equity
value falls to zero, i.e., when v − (c + φ) f − (1 − φ) b = 0. There are no deadweight losses
and bond holders simply recover the value of the company. When there is no default, bond
holders receive the cash flows (c + φ) f and they own (1 − φ) remaining bonds. A few special
cases are worth pointing out. Short term debt corresponds to φ = 1 and c = 0, and the
pricing function is simply:

                                                1        £   ¡     ¡ ¢¢ ¤
                             bshort (ω) =             E π min f ; v ω 0 |ω .                (8)
                                            1 + r (ω)

The main diﬀerence between short- and long-term debt is the presence of the pricing function
b on both sides of equation (7), while it appears only on the left hand side in equation (8).
A perpetuity corresponds to φ = 0, and, more generally, 1/φ is the average maturity of the
  7
      New issuances represent a principal of Fτ − (1 − φ) Fτ −1 .

With a constant risk free rate, bf ree is simply equal to (c + φ) f/ (φ + r).


2        A simple example

This section presents a simple example in order to build the intuition for the more general
case. The specific assumptions made in this section, and relaxed later, are: the risk free
rate is constant; firms issue only short term debt; and idiosyncratic shocks are iid. Let us
first decompose the state ω into its aggregate component s, and its idiosyncratic component
η. The aggregate state follows a discrete Markov chain over the set [1, 2.., S], and it pins
down the aggregate profit rate a (s), as well as the conditional risk neutral expectations.
The profit rate of the firm depends on the aggregate state and on the idiosyncratic shock:

                                            p (s, η) = a (s) + η.                                 (10)

The shocks η are independent over time, and distributed according to the density function
ζ (.). Since idiosyncratic profitability shocks are iid, the value function is additive and can
be written: v (s, η) = v (s) + η. I assume that s and η are such that v (s, η) is always
positive, so that firms never exit. Tobin’s q is the same for all firms, and I normalize the
mean of η to zero, therefore:8
                                                      E π [v (s0 ) |s]
                                            q (s) =                    .                          (11)
                                                          1+r
Let v̄ ≡ E π [v (s)] be the unconditional risk neutral average asset value, and define q ≡
v̄/ (1 + r).
        We can write the value of the aggregate portfolio of corporate bonds by integrating (8)
over idiosyncratic shocks:
                                  " Z f −v(s0 )                       #
                            1   π
                                                ¡ ¡ 0¢  0
                                                            ¢ ¡ 0¢ 0
                   b (s) =     E f+              v s + η − f ζ η dη |s .                          (12)
                           1+r       −∞

    8
    All the firms choose the same investment rate. This will not be true in the more general model with
persistent firm level shocks.

In equation (12), f is the promised payment, and the integral measures credit losses. Let δ
be the default rate estimated at the risk neutral average value:
                                        Z f −v̄
                                                 ¡ ¢
                                    δ≡          ζ η0 dη 0 .                                   (13)
                                                         −∞

Let b̄ be the corresponding price for the aggregate bond portfolio.9 Using (13) and (11), we
can write (12) as:
                                                                    E π [o (v0 )]
                                     b (s) − b̄ = δ (q (s) − q) +                 ,           (14)
                                                                       1+r
where o (v 0 ) is first order small, in the sense that o (v̄) = 0 and ∂o/∂v 0 = 0 when evaluated
at v̄.10 When aggregate shocks are small, so that v stays relatively close to v̄, E π [o (v 0 )] is
negligible.
       Equation (14) is the equivalent of the Black-Scholes-Merton formula, applied to Tobin’s
q. The value of the option (debt) depends on the value of the underlying (q), and the ‘delta’
of the option is the probability of default. If this probability is exactly zero, bond prices
do not contain information about q. The fact that the sensitivity of b to q is given by δ is
intuitive. Indeed, b respond to q precisely because a fraction δ of firms default on average
each period. A one unit move in aggregate q therefore translates into a δ move in the price
of a diversified portfolio of bonds.
       To make equation (14) empirically relevant, we need to express it in terms of bond
yields. All the prices we have discussed so far are in real terms but, in practice, we observe
nominal yields. Let r$ be the nominal risk free rate, and let y$ be the nominal yield on
corporate bonds. With short term debt, the market value is equal to the nominal face value
divided by 1 + y $ . Under the assumption we have made in this section, and neglecting
the terms that are first order small, a simple manipulation of equation (14) leads to the
following proposition.


Proposition 2 To a first order approximation, Tobin’s q is a linear function of the relative
yields of corporate and government bonds:

                                                   f     1 + rt$
                                        qt ≈                     + constant,
                                               δ (1 + r) 1 + yt$
   9
                       U f −v̄
     (1 + r) b̄ ≡ f + −∞ (v̄ + η 0 − f ) ζ (η 0 ) dη 0
  10
               U f −v0
     o (v 0 ) ≡ f −v̄ (v 0 + η 0 − f ) ζ (η 0 ) dη 0


                                                              11
where r is the real risk free rate, f is average book leverage, and δ is the risk neutral default
rate.


    The proposition sheds light on existing empirical studies, such as Bernanke (1983),
Stock and Watson (1989), and Lettau and Ludvigson (2002), showing that the spread of
corporate bonds over government bonds predicts future output.11 This finding is consistent
with q-theory, since the proposition shows that corporate bond spreads are, to a first order,
proportional to Tobin’s q.


3       General case

I now consider the case of long term debt and realistic firm level shocks. The goal is to obtain
a mapping from bond yields to Tobin’s q that extends the simple case presented above. As
in the previous section, let s denote the aggregate state and let η denote the idiosyncratic
component of the profit rate, defined in equation (10). With persistent idiosyncratic shocks,
Tobin’s q and the investment rate depend on both s and η, and the value function is no
longer additively separable. There is no closed form solution for bond prices, and I turn
directly to numerical simulations with a model calibrated to U.S. data.

3.1     Calibration

The data used in the calibration are summarized in Table 1. The data are also described in
more details in Section 4, when the model is used to construct a new series for q over the
post-war period. All the parameters used in the calibration, and the empirical moments
used to infer them, are presented in Table 2.
    Some parameters are chosen a priori. The real risk free interest rate is assumed constant
at r = 3% per year.12 Book leverage is set to f = 0.45 and average debt maturity to 10
years (φ = 0.1), based on Leland (2004) who uses these values as benchmark for Baa bonds.
I use a quadratic adjustment cost function:

                                         γ (x) = γ 1 x + 0.5γ 2 x2 .                                      (15)
   11
      In the proposition, I use the ratio instead of the diﬀerence because this is more accurate when inflation
is high. The approximation of small aggregate shocks made in this section refers to real shocks, but does
not require average inflation to be small.
   12
      This is only to simplify the exposition. I take into account changes in real interest rates in Section 4.


                                                      12
With this functional form, the investment equation is simply x = (q − γ 1 ) /γ 2 . The pa-
rameter γ 1 is irrelevant and is normalized to one. There is much disagreement about the
parameter γ 2 in the literature. Shapiro (1986) estimates a value around 2.2 years, and Hall
(2004) finds even smaller adjustment costs.13 On the other hand, Gilchrist and Himmelberg
(1995) find values around 20 years, and estimates from macro data are often implausibly
high (Summers (1981)). I pick a value of γ 2 = 8 years, which is in the middle of the set
of existing estimates, and also corresponds to the slow adjustment case in Hall (2001). It
turns out, however, that the mapping from bond yields to q is not very sensitive to this
parameter.
       Some parameters are directly observed in the data. Idiosyncratic profitability is assumed
to follow an AR(1) process:
                                            η t = λη η t−1 + εηt .                                      (16)

Let σ η be the standard deviation of εηt . Equation (16) is estimated with firm level data
from Compustat. The profit rate is operating income divided by the net stock of property
plants and equipment, and η as the idiosyncractic component of this profit rate. Firms
in finance and real estate are excluded. The panel regression includes firm fixed eﬀects to
remove mechanical diﬀerences in average profitability across firms or industries.14 The es-
timated parameters, λη = 0.47 and σ η = 14%, are consistent with many previous studies.15
Similarly, I specify aggregate dynamics as:

                                      at − ā = λa (at−1 − ā) + εat .                                  (17)

Using annual NIPA data on corporate profits and the stock on non-residential capital over
the post-war period, I estimate λa = 0.7.
       The parameters ā and σ a cannot be calibrated with historical aggregate profit rates
  13
      Shapiro (1986) estimates between 8 and 9 using quarterly data, which corresponds to 2 to 2.2 at annual
frequencies.
   14
      These are mostly due to accounting choices, fixed technological diﬀerences, whereas the model is ex-
plicitly about firm level shocks. Not including fixed eﬀects would lead to overestimation of the persistence
parameter λ.
   15
      For instance, Gomes (2001) uses a volatility of 15% and a persistence of 0.62 for the technology shock.
Hennessy, Levy, and Whited (2007) report a persistent of the profit rate of 0.51 and a volatility of 11.85%,
which they match with a persistence of 0.684 and a volatility of 11.8% for the technology shocks. Note
that in both of these papers, firms operate a technology with decreasing returns. Here, by contrast, the
technology has constant returns to scale. This explains why some details of the calibration are diﬀerent.




                                                     13
because they must capture risk adjusted values, not historical ones.16 Instead, the model
must be consistent with observed bond prices. Three parameters are thus not directly
observed in the data: these are c (the coupon rate), ā and σ a . Their values are inferred by
matching empirical and simulated moments. The processes (16) and (17) are approximated
with discrete-state Markov chains using the method in Tauchen (1986). The investment
rate x (s, η) and the value of the firm value v (s, η) are obtained by solving the dynamic
programming problem in equation (3). Equation (7) is then used to compute the bond
pricing function b (s, η). The aggregate bond price b (s) and the aggregate corporate yield
y (s) are obtained by integrating over the ergodic distribution of η.
    The empirical moments are the mean and standard deviation of the price of Baa bonds
                                  ³       ´ ³       ´
relative to Treasuries, defined as φ + rt$ / φ + yt$ , where y $ is the yield on Baa corporate
bonds and r$ is the yield on government bonds. The final requirement is that the average
bond be issued at par, as in Leland (1998). The three parameters c, ā and σ a are chosen
simultaneously to match the par-value requirement and the two empirical moments. The
parameters inferred from the simulated moments are: c = 4.35%, ā/r = 0.93 and σ (εat ) =
5.46%.

3.2      Simulation and interpretation

We can now use the model to understand the relationship between bond prices and Tobin’s
q. The model is simulated with the parameters described in the previous section. Figure
1 presents the main result. It shows the model-implied aggregate q (s) as a function of the
model-implied average relative bond price (φ + r) / (φ + y (s)). Tobin’s q is an increasing
and convex function of the relative price of corporate bonds. Figure 1 therefore extends
Proposition 2 to the case of long term debt, persistent firm level shocks, and large aggregate
shocks.
       The mapping from bond yields to Tobin’s q is conditional on the calibrated parameters,
in particular on book leverage and idiosyncratic volatility. Figure 2 shows the comparative
statics with respect to book leverage (f ) and firm volatility (σ η ). The comparative statics
  16
    Note that, in theory, the same applies to λa , because persistence under the risk neutral measure can be
diﬀerent from persistence under the physical measure. In practice, however, the diﬀerence for λa is much
smaller than for ā or σa . I therefore take the historical persistence to be a good approximation of the risk
neutral persistence.



                                                     14
are intuitive. For a given value of q, an increase in leverage leads to more credit risk, and
lower bond prices, so the mapping shift left when leverage increases. Similarly, for a given
value of q, an increase in idiosyncratic volatility increases credit risk, and the mapping shifts
left when volatility increases. In this case, the slope and the curvature of the mapping also
change, and the intuition is given by Proposition 2: idiosyncratic volatility increases the
delta of the bond with respect to q.
         In the next section, mappings like the ones displayed on Figure 2 are used to construct
a new measure of q from observed bond yields.


4         Aggregate Evidence

In this section, I construct a new measure of q using only data from the bond market. I then
compare this measure to the usual measure of q, and I assess their respective performances
in the aggregate investment equation.

4.1        Data and measurement issues

Bond yields
Moody’s Baa index, denoted ytBaa , is the main measure of the yield on risky corporate debt.
Moody’s index is the equal weighted average of yields on Baa-rated bonds issued by large
non financial corporations.17 Following the literature, the 10-year treasury yield is used as
the benchmark risk free rate. Both rt10 and ytBaa are obtained from FRED.18

Expected inflation and real rate
The Livingston survey is used to construct expected inflation, and the yield on the 10-year
    17
      To be included in the index, a bond must have a face value of at least 100 million, an initial maturity of
at least 20 years, and most importantly, a liquid secondary market. Beyond these characteristics, Moody’s
has some discretion on the selection of the bonds. The number of bonds included in the index varies from
75 and 100 in any given year. The main advantages of Moody’s measure are that it is available since 1919,
and that it is broadly representative of the U.S. non financial sector, since Baa is close to the median among
rated companies.
   18
      Federal Reserve Economic Data: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/ . The issue with using the 10-year
treasury bond is that it incorporates a liquidity premium relative to corporate bonds. To adjust for this, it
is customary to use the LIBOR/swap rate instead of the treasury rate as a measure of risk free rate (see
Duﬃe and Singleton (2003) and Lando (2004)), but these rates are only available for relatively recent years.
I add 30 basis points to the risk free rate in order to adjust for liquidity (see Almeida and Philippon (2007)
for a discussion of this issue).

treasury to construct the ex-ante real interest rate.19 The mappings are conditional on the
current value of the real rate.

Idiosyncratic risk and leverage
The model described in section 3 constructs q from the relative price of corporate bonds,
conditional on book leverage and idiosyncratic risk. Using Compustat, I find a slow increase
in average book leverage from 0.4 to 0.55 over the post-war period.20 The idiosyncratic
volatility of publicly traded companies has also changed over time.21 Campbell and Taksler
(2003) show that changes in idiosyncratic risk have contributed to changes in yield spreads.
Following the standard practice in the literature, I estimate idiosyncratic volatility with
a 6-month backward moving average of the monthly cross-sectional standard deviation of
individual stock returns.22 The corresponding measure in the simulated data is used to infer
the evolution of σ η over time. This leads to a family of mappings, conditional on leverage
and volatility, similar to the ones in Figure 2.

Creating q bond
To summarize, qbond is a function of four observed inputs: average book leverage, average
idiosyncratic volatility, the ex-ante real rate, and the relative price of corporate bonds.
Figure 3 displays the three main components: leverage, volatility and the relative price. In
the short run, q bond depends mostly on the relative price component. Year to year changes
   ¡       ¢ ¡           ¢
in φ + rt10 / φ + ytBaa account for 85% of the year to year changes in q bond . In the long
run, leverage and, especially, idiosyncratic risk are also important.

Classic measure of Tobin’s q
The usual measure of Tobin’s q is constructed from the flow of funds as in Hall (2001).
The usual measure is the ratio of the value of ownership claims on the firm less the book
value of inventories to the reproduction cost of plant and equipment. All the details on the
construction of this measure can be found in Hall (2001).
  19
     Piazzesi and Schneider (2006) analyze the consequences on asset prices of disagreement about inflation
expectations. My model has nothing new to say about these issues.
  20
     The sample includes non financial firms, with at least five years of non missing values for assets, stock
price, operating income, debt, capital expenditures, and property plants and equipment.
  21
     See Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, and Xu (2001), Comin and Philippon (2005) for a discussion, and Davis,
Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2006) for evidence on privately held companies.
  22
     There are other ways to define idiosyncratic risk at the firm level (the standard deviation of the growth
rate of sales) but they produce similar trends. See Comin and Philippon (2005) for a comparison of various
measures of firm volatility. The measure used here is easy to construct and forward looking.

Investment and capital stock
I use the series on private non residential fixed investment, and the corresponding current
stock of capital, from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Table 1 displays the summary
statistics.

4.2       Results

Figure 4 shows the two measures of q: q usual constructed from the flow of funds as in
Hall (2001), q bond constructed using bond yields, leverage, idiosyncratic volatility, expected
inflation, and the theoretical mappings described in the previous sections. The average
value of qbond is arbitrary: γ 1 is normalized to 1, so q is just above 1 on average.
       It is meaningful, however, to compare the variations of the two measures. The standard
deviation of q usual is 0.848, while the standard deviation of q bond is only 0.115, seven times
less volatile. It is also interesting to notice that qbond is approximately stationary, because
the mappings take into account the evolution of idiosyncratic volatility and book leverage,
as explained above.
       Figure 5 shows q usual and the investment rate in structure and equipment. Figure 6
shows qbond and the same investment rate. The corresponding regressions are reported in
the upper panel of Table 3. They are based on quarterly data. The investment rate in
structure and equipment is regressed on the two measures of q, measured at the end of the
previous quarter:
                                        xt = φb qt−1
                                                 bond
                                                      + φe qt−1
                                                            usual
                                                                  + εt .

The standard errors control for auto-correlation in the error terms up to four quarters.
q bond alone accounts for more than half of aggregate variations in the investment rate.
q usual accounts for only 14% of aggregate variations. Moreover, once q bond is included, the
standard measure has no additional explanatory power. Looking at Figure 5, the fit of the
investment equation is uniformly good, except during the 1991 recession, where the drop in
the investment rate exceeds the one predicted by the bond market.23
       q bond is more correlated with the investment rate, hence the better fit of the estimated
equation, but it is also much less volatile than the standard measure of q. As a result,
the elasticity of investment to q is 15 times higher with this new measure, which is an
  23
       This is consistent with the interpretation of the 1991 recession as a credit crunch.

encouraging result since the low elasticity of investment to q has long been a puzzle in
the academic literature. The estimated coeﬃcient still implies adjustment costs that are
too high, around 16 years but, as Erickson and Whited (2000) point out, there are many
theoretical and empirical reasons why the inverse of the estimated coeﬃcient is likely to
underestimate the true elasticity.
    Figure 7 shows the 4 quarter diﬀerence in the investment rate, a measure used by
Hassett and Hubbard (1997) among others, because of the high auto-correlation of the
series in levels. The corresponding regressions are presented in the bottom panel of Table 3.
The fit of the equation in diﬀerence is even better than the fit in levels, with an R2 around
60%. In the third regression, the change in corporate cash flows over capital is added to
the right hand side of the equation, but it is insignificant and does not improve the fit of
the equation.
    The conclusions from this empirical section are the following:

    • With aggregate US data, the fit of the investment equation with the bond market’s q
      is good, both in levels and in diﬀerences;

    • The estimated elasticity of investment to q is more than 10 times higher than the one
      estimated with the usual measure of q;

    • Corporate cash flows do not have significant explanatory power once the bond market’s
      q is included in the regression.


5    Firm Level Evidence

Testing the theory at the firm level is more diﬃcult because there are no panel data set
on corporate bond prices comparable to Compustat and CRSP for equity prices. I create
a panel of corporate bond yields by matching the rating of a company in a given year,
available from Compustat, to the average yield in the same year and rating category. Thus,
my measure of yields is rating-year specific, not firm-year specific.
    I obtain data on corporate yields from Citigroup’s yield book, which covers the period
1985-2004. For bonds rated A and BBB, these data are available separately for maturities
1-3, 3-7, 7-10, and 10+ years and I use the 10+ maturity. For bonds rated BB and below,


                                              18
these data are available only as an average across all maturities. The firm level data come
from Compustat and are entirely standard in the literature. The data are described in Table
4.
     I construct the bond market’s q using the model without aggregating across firms. To
test the theory in the cross section, I include a full set of year dummies and firm-fixed
eﬀects. The time dummies capture any change in the real interest rate and any common
trend in leverage or risk. The firm fixed eﬀect capture any permanent heterogeneity at the
firm level.24 These controls oﬀer a cross-sectional test of the model that is orthogonal to
the one performed earlier in the time series. I estimate the following equation:

                         xit = αi + ξ t + φb qt−1
                                              bond
                                                   (ratingit ) + φu qi,t−1
                                                                     usual
                                                                           + εit .                      (18)

                    bond as a function of the rating to emphasize that all firms with the same
I write explicitly qi,t−1
                                                                   usual is really firm
rating in the same year have the same imputed yield. By contrast, qi,t−1
specific. To avoid outliers, I truncate the investment rate at 100%, and q at 10, as can be
seen in Table 4.
     Table 5 presents the regression results. For q bond , the results are consistent with the ones
obtained earlier. The coeﬃcients are highly significant and the point estimates are similar
to the ones obtained in the time series. For q usual , the results are diﬀerent. The regression
coeﬃcients are significant, and much larger than the ones obtained in the time series. In
other words, relative stock market values are consistently linked to relative investment rates,
even though the relation is weak in the aggregate. Finally, in contrast with the macro data,
cash flow variables retain significant explanatory power at the firm level, even after the
inclusion of q bond and q usual .
     These results are consistent with the ones obtained by Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2007)
with a large panel data set of firm level bond prices. They regress the investment rate on a
firm specific measure of the cost of capital, based firm level bond yields and industry specific
prices for capital. They find a strong negative relationship between the investment rate and
the corporate yields, and they also find that q usual and cash flows remain significant.
  24
     I include fixed eﬀects rather than estimating firm level measures of risk because, while the trends in
average or median volatility are consistent across a wide variety of measures (see Comin and Philippon
(2005)), the cross sectional dispersion of the measures is quite large. In any case, the combination of fixed
eﬀects and time dummies actually accounts for most of the variations in idiosyncratic risk in the panel of
rated firms.


                                                     19
    One reason q bond might perform better in the aggregate is that idiosyncratic shocks make
the mapping from bond yields to aggregate q very smooth. At the firm level, however, the
mapping is very nonlinear and small errors in the parameters translate into large errors in
q bond . Returns to scale might also be decreasing at the level of an individual firm, even
though they are constant for the economy as a whole. This could explain why cash flows
are significant in the micro data but not in the macro data. In addition, Vuolteenaho (2002)
shows that much of the volatility at the firm level reflects cash flow news, whereas discount
rate shocks are much more important in the aggregate. Finally, to the extent that mispricing
explains some of the discrepancy between qusual and q bond , the results are consistent with
the argument in Lamont and Stein (2006) that there is more mispricing at the aggregate
level than at the firm level.


6    Conclusion

This paper has shown that it is possible to construct Tobin’s q using bond prices, by
bringing the insights of Black and Scholes (1973) and Merton (1974) to the investment
models of Abel (1979) and Hayashi (1982). The bond market’s q performs much better
than the usual measure of q when used to fit the investment equation using post-war US
data. The explanatory power is good (both in level and in diﬀerences), cash flows are no
longer significant, and the inferred adjustment costs are more than ten times smaller.
    Two interpretations of these results are possible. The first is that the equity market is
subject to severe mispricing, while the bond market is not, or at least not as much. This
interpretation is consistent with the arguments in Shiller (2000) and the recent theoretical
work of Barberis and Huang (2007) and Brunnermeier, Gollier, and Parker (2007).
    Another interpretation is that the stock market is mostly right, but that it measures
something else than the value of the existing stock of physical of capital. This is the view
pushed by Hall (2001) and McGrattan and Prescott (2007). According to this view, firms
accumulate and decumulate large stocks of intangible capital. If the payoﬀs from intangible
capital are highly skewed, then they could aﬀect equity prices more than bond prices, and
this could explain the results presented in this paper. The diﬃculty of this theory, of course,
is that it rests on a stock of intangible capital that we cannot readily measure (see Atkeson



                                              20
and Kehoe (2005) for a plant level analysis).
   Looking back at Figure 4, it is diﬃcult to imagine a satisfactory answer that does not
mix both theories. Moreover, these theories are not as contradictory as they appear, because
the fact that intangible capital is hard to measure increases the scope for disagreement and
mispricing. One can hope that future research will be able to reconcile them.

A     Proof of proposition 1
Let θτ be the marginal default rate during period τ . Let Θt,τ be the cumulative default
rate in periods t + 1 up to τ − 1. In other words, if a bond has not defaulted at time t, the
probability that it enters time τ > t is 1 − Θt,τ . Thus, by definition, Θt,t+1 = 0 and the
default rates satisfy the recursive structure: 1 − Θt,τ = (1 − θt+1 ) (1 − Θt+1,τ ). The value
at the end of period t of one unit of outstanding principal is:
                   " ∞                                                                      #
                      X                (1 − φ)τ −t−1
           1     π
          bt = Et          (1 − Θt,τ )            τ −t ((1 − θ τ ) (c + φ) + θ τ Vτ /Fτ −1 ) . (19)
                    τ =t+1
                                       (1 + rt,τ )

Similarly, and just to be clear, the price of one unit of principal at the end of t + 1 is:
               " ∞                                                                             #
                  X                     (1 − φ)τ −t−2
   1        π
  bt+1 = Et+1          (1 − Θt+1,τ )               τ −t−1 ((1 − θ τ ) (c + φ) + θ τ Vτ /Fτ −1 ) . (20)
                τ =t+2               (1  + rt+1,τ )

Using the recursive structure of Θ and the law of iterated expectations, we can substitute
(20) into (19), and obtain:

               1                                                 1−φ π£                      ¤
     b1t =          Etπ [(1 − θt+1 ) (c + φ) + θt+1 Vt+1 /Ft ] +        Et (1 − θt+1 ) b1t+1     (21)
             1 + rt                                              1 + rt
Default happens when equity value reaches zero, that is, when:
                                      ¡                   ¢
                            Vt < Ft−1 φ + c + (1 − φ) b1t

Therefore, the pricing function satisfies:
                                1       £   ©                                 ª¤
                      b1t =          Etπ min φ + c + (1 − φ) b1t+1 ; Vt+1 /Ft                    (22)
                              1 + rt

Now recall that b1t is the price of one unit of outstanding capital. Let us define bt as the
value of bonds outstanding at the end of time t, scaled by end of period physical assets:

                                               bt ≡ fb1t ,                                       (23)
                                                                   Ft
where book leverage was defined in the main text as f ≡            kt ,   and assumed to be constant.
Multiplying both sides of (22) by f , we obtain:
                                1
                       bt =         E π [min {(φ + c) f + (1 − φ) bt+1 ; vt+1 }]
                              1 + rt t
In recursive form, and with constant book leverage, this leads to equation (7). Note that
if book leverage is state contingent, the first term in the min function would simply be
                           ft
(φ + c) ft + (1 − φ) bt+1 ft+1 .

Fixed private non-residential capital and investment series are from the BEA. Quarterly data, 1953:3 to
2005:3. Tobin's Q is constructed from the Flow of Funds, as in Hall (2001). Bond Q is constructed by
applying the structural model to Corporate and Treasury yields, expected inflation, book leverage and
idiosyncratic firm volatility. Newey-West standard errors with autocorrelation up to 4 quarters are below the
coefficients, in italics. Bold coefficients are significant at the 1% level or higher.

Notes: Leverage is average book leverage among non financial firms in Compustat. Idiosyncratic volatility is estimated using idiosyncratic stock
returns and translated into parameter σ η of the model. Relative Bond Price is the relative price of corporate and government bonds, defined as
(φ+r)/(φ+y), using Moody's Baa and 10-year Treasury yields (with φ=0.1).

Notes: I/K is corporate fixed investment over the replacement cost of equipment and structure. Bond Q is constructed from Moody's yield on Baa
bonds, using the structural model calibrated to the observed evolutions of book leverage and firm volatility, expected inflation from the Livingston
survey and the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds.
