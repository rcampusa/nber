           Coordination of Monetary and Fiscal Policies in the OECO



                                 ABSTRACT



          Discontent with the functioning of the world monetary system has led to

many proposals for international monetary reform. These proposals range from

enhanced consultations under the current regime of floating exchange rates to a

regime of fixed exchange rates, as proposed by Ronald McKinnon. In this paper

we examine the implications of several alternative monetary arrangements for

fiscal policy in the world economy. In particular we focus upon two issues. The

first is the effects of alternative monetary arrangements on the international

transmission of fiscal policy. The second is the implications of the

alternative regimes for strategic aspects of fiscal policymaking.

          As is generally the case in the discussion of exchange regimes we find

that the choice of the monetary system is crucially dependent upon the source

and nature of the shocks hitting the world economy. In this paper we show that

the monetary regime also has important implications for the transmission of

fiscal policy in the world economy and for the nature of the strategic games

played by fiscal authorities. Rigid rules of the game, as under fixed

exchange rates, do not necessarily eliminate the inefficient equilibria

that can occur when fiscal authorities behave non-cooperatively.

I. Introduction


        The volatility of the world economy since the breakdown of the Bretton

Woods par value system of exchange rates has led many policymakers and

economists to call for reform of the international monetary system. Many

economists have argued that domestic macroeconomic policies in the major OECD

economies should be geared, at least in part, to maintain exchange rates within

ranges set cooperatively among the major countries. Proposals vary from the

"target zone" system, as advocated by Williamson [1983] and Roosa [1984], to a

much more stringent system of fixed exchange rates, as advocated by McKinnon

[1984]. There are several possible arguments in the case for a return to a more

managed system, as described in recent surveys by Obstfeld [1985] and Sachs

[1985b]. One crucial argument has been that the equilibrium of noncooperative

macroeconomic policymaking under flexible exchange rates is likely to be

inefficient, as countries fail to take into account the external effects of

their policies on their trading partners. More rigid rules of the game, as

embodied in a managed exchange rate system, are seen as a way to reduce the

inducements to beggar-thy-neighbor policies. It has been frequently noted that

there are many institutional forms that greater cooperation might take, ranging

from the give and take of bargaining at economic summit meetings, to the

implicit form of cooperation that takes place when each country adheres to

externally imposed exchange rate targets. The exchange rate alternative is seen

as particularly attractive in that it reduces the needs for constant, face-to--
                                      —2—


face bargaining. The hope is that by changing the rules of the game,

policymakers can then be free to act independently (i.e. noncooperatively)

within the confines of the international agreement. Tighter margins for

exchange rate fluctuations might eliminate the most noxious forms of

international competition, in the same way that the GATT has significantly

reduced the international competition via tariff setting.

        There are of course limits to the gains that will be achieved by a

change in the international rules of the game. Every set of exchange

arrangements will generate its own forms of strategic behavior, that will tend

to cause some forms of inefficient strategic behavior. For example, while much

of recent writing in this area has considered the gaming aspects of flexible

exchange rates (see Canzoneri and Gray [1985],. Oudiz and Sachs [1985], Currie

and Levine [1985], and the other studies in Buiter and Marston [1985]), many

others studies have shown that similar strategic issues arise in fixed exchange

rate systems. Indeed the original analytical work in this area, by Hamada

[1974], considered the case of monetary management under a fixed exchange rate

regime. Even the classical gold standard, the self-regulating system par

excellence, offered up incentives for inefficient strategic behavior, as argued

by Eichengreen [1985] and Matsuyama [1985]. An important aspect of research in

this area is to make quantitative judgements about the gains and losses from

alternative forms of exchange rate management.

        This paper studies the properties of four alternative international

monetary regimes, both with respect to their operating characteristics, and with

regard to the incentives for strategic behavior under each regime. We consider
                                      .-3—




alternatively a floating exchange rate system as now, with three forms of fixed

exchange rate systems. In the floating rate system, we assume that policymakers

in each country can choose monetary and fiscal instruments in order to maximize

a national social welfare function, without having to gear the policy choices to

a particular exchange rate target. In the fixed exchange rate systems, some or

all of the countries are required to peg the exchange rate as a side condition

on their policy actions. We then study the implications of the exchange rate

constraints. However, we do not ask the more fundamental question as to whether

the exchange rate system itself would be viable, or instead whether the

countries would choose to bow out of the arrangement.

        As -is well known, a fixed exchange rate system must be specified by much

more than the constraint that bilateral or multilateral rates be fixed. It is

crucial to specify which countries have the obligation to intervene in order to

preserve a given peg. The so-called "N-i problem" underlines the fact that in a

fixed regime of N countries, only N-i countries need to undertake the obligation

to stabilize. The N-th country, presumably, can act without direct regard for

the consequences of its policies on the exchange rate. The "problem", generally

speaking, is to decide how the responsibilities for pegging are allocated among

the countries.

        We consider three alternatives that are widely discussed. The first is

an asymmetric "dollar standard", in which the United States assumes no

responsibility in pegging the exchange rate, while the other countries

(specifically Japan, and the rest of the OECO, named ROECD) both peg to the

dollar. This system makes the U.S. the "N-th" country, and is considered by
                                       -4-


many to be a easonable description of how the Bretton Woods system actually

operated (see Swoboda [1978]). In fact, it should be remembered that under the

Bretton Woods arrangement, the U.S. had the side condition to peg the dollar

price of gold at $35 per ounce, though it is difficult to find an important

ef-ect of this constraint on U.S. policy actions through most of the Bretton

Woods period.

        The other two systems that we study are symmetric solutions to the N-i

problem, a la the gold standard. Recently, McKinnon [1984] has proposed a fixed

exchange rate arrangement for the U.S., Germany, and Japan, in which the cross

rates among these countries are fixed, and in which the weighted sum of the

money stocks of the three countries is to be held constant. This means that any

expansion of money in one country must be matched by a compensating contraction

in the other countries. Note that a strict gold standard, with a constant world

stock of gold reserves, would work this way: any increase in money in one

country (backed by 10096 gold reserves) would necessarily require a contraction

in money in rest of the world. Subject to this monetary constraint, the

countries would be free to pursue independent fiscal policies.

        This monetary standard is extremely strict, in making the aggregate

stock of world money invariant to underlying conditions. As a third fixed

exchange rate arrangement, we experiment with a modified McKinnon plan (dubbed

McKinnon II) in which the exchange rates across regions are fixed, but in which

the weighted world money stock is controlled cooperatively by the participating

countries, to forestall large swings in world economic activity. Using a

numerical model later, we attempt to find an equilibrium set of rules for fiscal
                                       —5—


policy in each country and for the global money stock, which has the
                                                                       following
properties: the fiscal rules are optimal for each country, taking as given the

fiscal rules in the other countries, and the rule for the management of the

global money stock, while at the same time, the cooperative money rule is

optimal taking as given the fiscal rules in each of the countries.

        Within each of these exchange rate systems, we analyze the behavior and

characteristics of fiscal policy, and examine how a changes in the rules of the

game affect the incentives to use fiscal and monetary policies. In particular,

we examine whether the various inefficiencies of floating rates caused by the

strategic behavior of individual countries can be muted by a move to a more

managed system. Under various circumstances, it is true that a move to managed

rates can indeed blunt the inefficient deployment of fiscal policies, but we

also find that there are many circumstances in which the introduction of fixed

rates would itself lead to serious inefficiencies of other sorts. As is common

in this kind of research, the desirability of one type of monetary arrangement

over another will depend importantly on the nature of the underlying shocks

hitting the world economy.

        The paper is set out as follows. In section II, we examine the

transmission of fiscal policies under alternative exchange rate arrangements,

using an extremely simple version of the Mundell-Fleming model for heuristic

purposes. We then move on to a large-scale empirical model of the world

economy in section III, in which the same fiscal experiments are performed. We

find that the cross-country transmission of fiscal policy is affected in crucial

quantitative ways according to the global monetary arrangements in which the
                                        —6-


fiscal expansion takes place. In Section IV we take up the strategic aspects of

monetary and fiscal policies under the alternative monetary arrangements that we

are examining, and present illustrations -in which a return to fixed rates would

indeed raise the efficiency of macroeconomic management. In Section V the

large—scale empirical model is then used to study strategic aspects of

policymaking in a differential game format. We examine a game of disinflation,

in which all of the major economies begin the game with an excessively high

inflation rate, and in which all then use monetary and fiscal policies (subject

to the rules of the exchange regime) in order to dis-inflate optimally. Once

again, we confirm the crucial quantitative importance of alternative exchange

regimes for policy choices and macroeconomic outcomes. Finally, in Section VI,

we introduce a useful methodology for judging the "long-run't efficiency of

alternative forms of monetary arrangements. Some concluding remarks are offered

in Section VII.


II. Fiscal Policy Transmission in a simple Mundell—Fleming Model


        We now introduce a simple, static two-country model in order to

illustrate the implications for fiscal policy of alternative monetary regimes.

We introduce the barest bones model here for illustrative purposes only, since

in the next section we study a richly specified and empirically calibrated model

of the world economy. It turns out, however, that even the simplest fixed price

model can give us a good understanding of the properties of the short-run policy

multipliers in the large-scale model.

        Consider the following standard set—up, as in Mundell [1968]. We assume
                                                    —7—


that domestic and foreign goods prices (p and p* )                are   fixed, and that there is

perfect capital mobility (i =             i*).   e is the exchange rate between the two

countries, in Units of the home currency per Unit of foreign currency. An

asterisk (*) denotes foreign country. The model is specified with two money

demand equations, and two IS curves. The notation is standard: m is (log) money

balances; p is (log) prices; q is (log) output; i is the nominal interest rate;

and g is the measure of fiscal policy. The equations are as follows:



         m-p=qq-i                                                                          (1)


         m*-p*= qq* -    i                                                                 (2)


         q =    -o(p-e-p*)   -   ai   +   Ag + yq*                                         (3)


         q* =   o(p-e-p*)    -   ai   + Ag* + yq
                                                                                          (4)




We assume, as is standard, that the interaction term in the IS equations, y, is

positive and less than one -in        value.       We consider four monetary regimes, and

study the fiscal policy multipliers in each case. The regimes are:


          (a) Floating exchange rate (the change -in                the exchange rate, de, is
unrestricted, and pure fiscal policy is studied with dm = dm* = 0)


          (b) Dollar standard (U.S. monetary policy is held fixed, so that dm = 0

and the foreign money supply adjusts endogenously so that de = 0)


          (c) McKinnon rule (the exchange rate is fixed, de =                 0, and a weighted
average of the money stocks mw =             a   m + (1 -   a) m* is held fixed).
                                                                  —8—


             (d) modified McKinnon rule (de =                                0, dmW is allowed to change).



We now turn to the fiscal policy multipliers.


(a) Floating Exchange Rate


The system (1)-(4) is differentiated and solved, along with the conditions that

dm = dm* =0. The multipliers for fiscal and monetary policy are:



                                  A
         dq =                                        (dg      +       dg*)
                      2[1 -           + a4/f3]



                  +                                  dm           -                              dm*
                      2[1-y+c7/f3]                                            2[1-7+aq/]


                                   A
         dq*=                                        (dg +            dg*)
                      2[1 -           +




                  -
                              1       -y                                      1-y+ 2aq/
                                                     dm           +                              dm*
                      2[1-y+a4i/]                                             24[1-y+a4/]



                       A                                               1-y
         de =                              -              -                            -
                                  (dg*         dg)                              (dm*       dm)
                       2ö                                              26q
                                                            -9-


 In this symmetric case fiscal policy is positively transmitted across countries

 (given that y <1) with the the country having the largest fiscal
                                                                                           expansion
 experiencing an appreciation of its currency. Monetary policy is
                                                                                            negatively
 transmitted, since a money supply expansion at home causes the exchange rate to

depreciate, and thereby shifts demand from the foreign country to the home

market.


b) Dollar Standard


          The system is again solved                ,   this      time using the assumptions that
de =    0, dm exogenous, and dm* endogenous. In this case we find:

                  A
         dq =     —
                  A
                    (dg                 + 1 dg*)        +                      dm




                 A[ y -        aq/]                          A [1 +     4c/]
         dq*=                            dg     +
                                                                               dg*   +                   dm
                            A                                       A                           A




                 4A[y      - aq/$ -1]                         qA[1 -      +
         dm*=                              dg       +                                       +
                                                                                     dg*            dm
                                                                         A



where
                A =   [1   —
                                y   +   (q/)(j+y)       ]   >0

A foreign fiscal expansion is again transmitted positively to the home country,

while a domestic fiscal expansion will actually be negatively transmitted if a4
                                              —10-


> f3-y   .    This   surprising result occurs because the fiscal expansion by the home

country tends to appreciate the currency. The foreign country is thereby

required to undertake a monetary contraction in order to prevent its currency

from depreciating. The contractionary effects of this endogenous monetary

response can be sufficient to offset the normal expansionsary effect coming

through a rise in exports to the home country. Note that a rise -in home-country

money, dm >          0, raises output in both countries, and induces a corresponding
increase in the foreign money supply.

              There is admittedly something artificial in the way that we study this

case, in that g and g* are assumed to be exogenous, so that m* is the

"automatic instrument which the foreign country uses to peg the exchange rate.

If, for example, we were instead to assume that g* is altered to keep de =             0,
then a home fiscal expansion (dg > 0) would necessarily raise foreign output.

In the later empirical sections, the foreign country chooses the combination of

dg* and dm*optimally in order to maximize a social welfare function, subject to

the constraint that de =          0.


c) McKinnon Rule


              In the fixed exchange rate regime proposed by McKinnon [1984], the

exchange rate between the major countries would be fixed, together with an

exogenously set growth rate of a weighted average world money stock. The

implications of this regime for fiscal policy in this simple model can be found

by setting dmw = adm + (1_a)dm* as an exogenous variable, and requiring that

de =     0.    Monetary policy in both countries is endogenous. Doing this we find:
                                                          —11—


                                A                     A [y/(1-a) - a

In   this case both home and foreign fiscal policies will be negatively transmitted

if o(1—a) >     y for a foreign expansion and a4a > y                   for a domestic expansion.

         The form of the monetary regime has been shown to have important

implications for the transmission of fiscal policy in the world economy. Later,

we will see that the nature of the transmission will

for policy coordination among the major economies. In the next section we use a

large-scale simulation model in an attempt to better quantify the fiscal policy

multipliers.

III. Fiscal policy in an Empirical Model


        In this section we use the MSG (McKibbin —Sachs Global) simulation model

to examine the international transmission of fiscal policy. The MSG model was

developed in Sachs and McKibbin [1985]. The reader is also referred to recent

papers by Ishii, McKibbin and Sachs [1985], McKibbin and Sachs [1985] and Sachs

[1985a] for several applications and refinements. The model is a rational

expections, dynamic general equilibrium macroeconomic model of the world

economy. A full list of equations is provided in the Appendix. The world

economy is divided into five regions consisting of the U.S., Japan, the rest of

the OECD (hereafter ROECD), OPEC and the Developing countries. Each region is

linked via flows of goods and assets. Stock-flow relationships and

intertemporal budget constraints are carefully observed. Budget deficits

cumulate into a stock of government debt which must eventually be financed,

while current account deficits cumulate into a stock of foreign debt. Asset

markets are forward looking so the exchange rate and long term interest rate are

conditioned by the entire future path of policy.

        There are equations for the internal macroeconomic structure of the

three industrialized regions of the U.S., ROECO and Japan, while the OPEC and

developing country regions have only their foreign trade and financial

structures incorporated. Each region produces a good which is an imperfect

substitute in the consumption baskets of each of the other regions. Consumption

of each good therefore depends on income and relative prices. Private

absorption depends on financial wealth, disposable income and long-term and
                                         —13—


 short-term real interest rates along conventional lines. Nominal
                                                                  wages are
 predetermined in each period, with the nominal
                                                  wage change between periods a
 function of lagged consumer price
                                     inflation, the output gap and the change in
 the output gap. With the assumption that the GOP deflator is a fixed
                                                                         markup
 over wages, we derive a standard Phillips
                                             curve equation. In essence, the model
 is a generalized version of the
                                   Dornbusch [1976] model, in which the goods
 markets clear less rapidly than the asset markets.

         Residents in different countries hold their
                                                       own country's assets as well
 as foreign assets (except foreign money), based on the relative expected rates

of return, with expectations
                               being formed rationally. While we specify the
asset demand functions in a general
                                      portfolio balance fashion, the parameter
values that we impose make the model behave almost as if assets are perfect

substitutes. Money demand is specified according to a standard transactions

demand formulation.

        The model is parameterized using actual 1983 trade shares and asset

stocks. Behavioural parameters are chosen to be consistent with values found in

the empirical literature. We have shown
                                           elsewhere (see Sachs [1985a]) that the
model is able to explain the macreconomic
                                            experience of the 1980's including the
strong dollar and trade imbalances by shifts in
                                                  macroeconomic policies in the
U.S., Japan and the ROECD.

        We simulate non-linear and linear versions of the model using numerical

techniques which take into account the forward
                                                  looking variables in the model.
Specifically we use a procedure described by Fair and Taylor [1983]. The

linearized version of the model is
                                     amenable to policy optimization exercises and
                                      -14-


has previously been used to consider the gains to policy coordination using

dynamic game theory techniques (see Sachs and McKibbin [1985]). Throughout the

paper we use the linearized version of the model because of the reliance on

dynamic programming in later sections. We have verified in earlier work that

there is little difference between the policy multipliers in the linearized and

nonlinear versions of the model in the exercises studied here.


A. Fiscal Policy Multipliers Under Alternative Regimes


        We simulate a fiscal expansion by assuming a permanent 1 of GNP

increase in real government expenditures on domestic goods, commencing in 1984

which is financed by government debt. We assume that the expenditure increase

is permanent, and expected to be permanent on impact, with the budget deficit

remaining 1 of GNP above the baseline path. Because of rising interest

payments on the accumulating public debt, the deficit would tend to grow over

time in the absence of compensating cuts in expenditure or increases in taxes.

We assume that over time the increase in interest repayments is paid for through

higher tax revenues. Note that the economies all possess a steady state growth

rate of 3 percent per annum. In steady-state equilibrium, a constant deficit is

compatible with a fixed debt-GOP ratio as long as the increase in debt due to

the deficit causes the total debt stock to grow at the 3 percent annual rate.

This requirement means that the steady-state Debt—GOP ratio equals the

steady-state deficit-GOP ratio divided by 0.03. For example, a permanent

increase in the budget deficit, that raises the deficit from zero to 19 of GOP,

causes the steady-state debt-GOP ratio to rise from zero to 33 of GOP.
                                          —15-


        Table 1 contains the results for a fiscal expansion in the U.S. under a

pure floating exchange rate. The absence of Ricardian consumers and the

presence of price stickiness is obvious -in the results. The real output

multiplier follows a familar hump shape: output rises initially, but over time

rising interest rates ,   rising   prices, a strong dollar, and rising taxes to

finance the growing debt burden, crowd out the fiscal stimulus. Crowding out

is complete by 1989. Note that the dollar appreciates on impact, by 3.3 percent

against the ECU (the currency of the ROECD) and the Yen. Interest rates rise

throughout the world, although by more in the U.S. than abroad. The

differential in large part captures the expectation of a future depreciation of

the U.S. dollar (remember, though, that because of the portfolio balance

assumptions, there is also a slight and growing risk premium on dollar

denominated assets). The fiscal impulse is positively transmitted to the rest

of the world as Japanese and ROECO trade balances improve due both to the demand

stimulus from higher U.S. output, and from the strong dollar. The positive

transmission quickly fades as rising world interest rates have their effect.

Note that inflation initially falls in the U.S. This result follows from our

somewhat artificial assumption that home goods prices do not respond at all

within the first year to higher domestic output, while import prices fall in

response to the appreciation of the dollar.

        Table 2 contains corresponding results for an ROECD fiscal expansion

under a flexible exchange rate. The results are similar to those for the U.S.

fiscal stimulus, with a positive transmission of output to the U.S. and Japan.

The ROECD exchange rate appreciates against the dollar by 3.4 percent on impact,

and against the Yen by 3.1 percent on impact.

        The results for a U.S. fiscal expansion under a dollar standard regime

are shown next in table 3. In specifying this regime, we make several crucial

assumptions. First, the comparative dynamic exercises assume that the non-U.S.

economies peg their exchange rates to the dollar via monetary policy, rather

than via fiscal policy. In other words, the U.S. fiscal multipliers assume that

foreign fiscal policies are held fixed, while foreign monetary policies are

wholly endogenous. Second, the form of monetary intervention must be made

clear. The authorities could choose to stabilize the exchange rate with

intervention on the foreign exchange markets or via intervention in the domestic

credit markets (e.g. open-market operations, rediscounting, etc.). In a world

of perfect capital mobility, all of these alternatives would be identical from

the point of view of macroeconomic outcomes, while in a world of imperfect

capital mobility, differences will arise depending on the nature of exchange

rate pegging. Since our model assumes very high, though not fully perfect

substitutability, the choice of intervention mechanism is quantitatively of

some, but only minor importance. In fact, in all of our specifications used in

the paper, we assume that the exchange rate is stabilized through interventions

in the domestic money market.

        Several results are striking. The first is the negative transmission of

the U.S. fiscal expansion to the rest of the world. In this case both Japan and

the ROECD adopt severely contractionary monetary policies in order to maintain

the fixed exchange rate. The result is severe recession in both regions. The

recessionary effect of the contractionary monetary policies quickly feeds back

to the U.S., and does much to dampen the U.S. fiscal multiplier (it turns

negative by 1987). The asymmetry -in the dollar standard regime -is illustrated in

table 4, which shows the results for an ROECD fiscal expansion. In contrast to

the U.S. fiscal expansion, the ROECD fiscal expansion is positively transmitted

to the rest of the world. The Ecu tends to appreciate, so that the ROECD

monetary authorities are obligated to expand the domestic money supply. This

leads to an enormous expansion in the ROECO, and positive transmission to the

other economies.

        Table 5 illustrates the consequence of a fiscal expansion under the

McKinnon regime. In this case, we study the effects of a fiscal expansion under

the assumption that a geometric weighted average of the money supplies in the

U.S., ROECD, and Japan is fixed, and that the exchange rates are similarly

fixed. The weights used (somewhat arbitrarily) are the GNP weights for 1983. In

this case, as with the U.S. expansion under the dollar standard, the

transmission of fiscal policy is negative. Once again, the non-U.S. economies

are obligated to contract their money stocks while the U.S. expands its money

stock. The result is a rise in interest rates abroad that is sufficient to

overwhelm the direct effects of the U.S. stimulus. The extent of the recession

abroad is less than in the Dollar standard, since in the McKinnon case, the U.S.

is obligated to expand its money supply in line with the fiscal expansion.

        The effects of an ROECD fiscal expansion under the McKinnon rule are

shown in table 6. Now the ROECD fiscal expansion is negatively transmitted to

the rest of the world. Clearly, the McKinnon rule on world money supplies

imposes more symmetry than does the dollar regime. In the case of an ROECD

fiscal expansion under the McKinnon rule, the U.S. and Japan contract monetary

policy and the ROECD expands monetary policy in order to maintain the fixed

exchange rate. The consequence of the contractionary monetary policies is to

cause a recession in Japan and the U.S.

IV. Implications of the Exchange Regime for Strategic Interactions of Monetary

     and Fiscal Policy


       As we noted in the beginning, one of the most attractive aspects of

monetary reform is the possibility of reducing the inefficient strategic

behavior of national macroeconomic authorities. It is well known that if

policymakers in the U.S., the ROECD, and Japan independently select their

monetary and fiscal policies, taking as given the actions of the other

countries, the resulting (Nash) equilibrium of macroeconomic policies is likely

to be inefficient, -in the sense that another vector of policy parameters could

simultaneously raise the level of social welfare in all of the countries. In

this brief theoretical section, we illustrate how a change of regime could

possibly make the independent actions of national policymakers more efficient.

        Consider an illustration in which two symmetric countries choose

monetary and fiscal policies to maximize a social welfare function in output,

the fiscal deficit, and the level of prices (in the dynamic model, the target

will be the inflation rate). For simplicity, we assume that the welfare

functions are identical and of the following quadratic form:



                                                                     (5)
             W=_(q2+J1P2+Vg2)
                                                       —25—



where PC is the (log) level of consumer prices (the foreign welfare function is

of course a function of the corresponding foreign variables). The bliss
                                                                                             points
for each country are zero levels of (log) output, consumer prices, and fiscal

expenditure. We use the earlier static model of Section II, with the addition

that consumer prices in each country are a weighted average of home prices and

import prices (valued in domestic currency):



                           (1-a) (p*+e)

                       p*+ (1 -   v)   (p -     e)


Maintaining the assumption that domestic and foreign output prices are Hxed,

with p =   p*   =
                    p0. we have that fluctuations in the exchange rate is the only
factor that can cause PC and                  to change in the short run.


           In the case of symmetric countries, it will necessarily be the case that

the exchange rate equals zero (e =              0).      Given this fact, consumer prices in each

country are fixed at the level p0. Since p cannot be reduced in both countries

simultaneously, the best symmetric solution is merely to live with the fact that

   is above the bliss level, and then to set g =                  g*   =   0, and m = m* = p0. so
that output is kept at q =        q*   =   0.        In other words, the economies should Sit at

"full employment" and zero budget deficit, suffering the inevitable fact that

consumer prices are above their bliss level.

        Unfortunately, in noncooperative policymaking under floating exchange

rates, this efficient equilibrium will not be reached. Each country's policy
                                       —26—



authorities will believe that a strong currency option is available that will

allow them to reduce p, and therefore to import price stability (and to export

inflation!). Each country will therefore aim its monetary policy in a

contractionary direction and its fiscal policy in an expansionary direction in

order to exploit the possible anti-inflationary gains of a strong currency. Of

course, this noncooperative outcome has all of the trappings of a prisoners'

dilemma game, in that both symmetric countries will not be able, simultaneously,

to each enjoy a strong currency vis-a-vis the other! The results of the

noncooperative game will therefore be:


          (1) a policy mix geared towards fiscal expansion cum monetary

contraction, with a socially undesirable level of fiscal deficits;


          (2) overly contractionary policies in total, with output reduced below

the efficient symmetric level of q =    q*   =   0.


          (3) an exchange rate e =   0, with PC =      = p0.   i.e., no success -in

either Country of manipulating the exchange rate to its own advantage.


        These results are easy to confirm algebraically. The home Country

maximizes the social welfare function (5) with respect to m and g, taking as

given the level of m* and g*. The foreign country makes the comparable policy

analysis, arriving at values of m* and g*, taking as given m and g. At the Nash

equilibrium -in this symmetric case, m = m* and g =   g*,   with the specific values

of the target variables given as follows (note that the multipliers dy/dx in the

equations are as given -in the derivations in Section II):
                                                    —27—



                    q*   =
             q =             -[ji p0   (1 -   n)(de/dm)]/(dq/dm)       < 0

                                        0




             g =    g*   =    -[q   (dq/dg) + ji p (1 -     )(de/dg)]/v      > 0


Remember that de/dm > 0, de/dg < 0, dq/dm > 0, dq/dg >0, in order to derive the

signs of the preceeding expressions. Thus, output is below zero, while

government spending is above zero. By simple substitution, it is easy to see

that m = m* < p0. In sum we have established the early conclusions: m is too

tight and g is too loose relative to the efficient equilibrium, and aggregate

demand overall -is too tight (since q =              q*    < 0).

           It is important to note that the inefficiency in this game would hold if

the players had only one instrument, either m or g, instead of two. If m and m*

were fixed, with the authorities setting g and 9*, there would still be a bias

towards inefficiently large fiscal deficits; while on the contrary, if g and g*

are fixed, while the game is played with m and m*, then the bias is towards

overcontractionary policies. In both cases, the countries attempt to manipulate

the exchange rate in their favor (i.e. towards an appreciation).

           Now, consider how this game would be played under the McKinnon standard.

In that case, policymakers choose only g and g*, since monetary policy is set

according to the two rules that mW is fixed and that the exchange rate is fixed

(in this case at e =          0).      The cooperative optimum equilibrium is again the same,

with q =   q*   =   0, g = g* = 0, and PC =               = p0.    To achieve this equilibrium, mW

should be set at p0. and fiscal policy in both countries should be set at zero.
                                             —28—



            Assume now that the McKinnon rule is in place, but with each fiscal

policy authority free to choose the level of fiscal spending in a noncooperative

way. Suppose also that mW is fixed exogenously at p0 (more on this assumption

 in a moment). It now turns out that the independent actions of the fiscal

authorities will lead to the social optimum. The policymaker has no incentive

to try to deviate from the point of zero fiscal expenditure. Higher fiscal

spending no longer improves the price performance, as it did under the floating

system, since now the exchange rate is fixed at zero. Therefore fiscal

expenditure merely worsens the budget deficit without any compensating benefits.

These results are verified formally by maximizing the social welfare function at

home with respect to g, and abroad with respect to g*. It is easy to verify

that g =     g*   = 0 constitutes a Nash equilibrium.


            To see this formally, we simply differentiate the utility function with

respect to g, and set the results equal to zero. Under the McKinnon rule, de/dg
=     0, so that the result of differentiation is: dW/dg =    0 =   -[q(dq/dg)   +   v g].

With mW at p0. and g* =       0, this first—order condition is satisfied at q = 0,       and

g =    0.   The same result holds for the foreign country when g =     0, so that the
pair g =    g*    = 0 constitutes a Nash equilibrium.


            Thus, we have a case in which a change in monetary regime eliminates the

inefficient strategic interactions of the two governments. The essential

inefficiency of the game under floating resulted from the fact that the two

sides had inconsistent exchange rate targets, that obviously could not be

simultaneously satisfied. Under the McKinnon rules, neither player attempts nor

-is   able to influence the exchange rate in his favor. It must be stressed that
                                         —29—



 the efficiency of the McKinnon solution
                                           relied heavily on two facts. First, it
 was assumed that the world money stock mw
                                             was at the global optimum. In fact,
 McKinnori has opted for a fixed level of mw -in most discussions of his
                                                                         proposal,
 and there is no reason to believe that
                                         the selected value of mi" would

 necessarily be at an efficient level. Second, the
                                                      symmetry of the model and the
 symmetry of the "shock" (both countries had prices
                                                      equally above the optimum)
 meant that the exchange rate did not have to adjust in order to adapt

 efficiently to the shock. In later sections,
                                                we will study asymmetric cases, in
 which efficiency requires a change in the nominal exchange rate.


V. Strategic Interactions Under Alternative Regimes j the MSG Model


        We now employ the large-scale simulation model to study strategic

interactions in the dynamic case. For this purpose we use two types of

methodologies. In the first, we place the countries in a particular historical

situation, and study the optimal
                                   strategies of each country over time. A

benchmark "cooperative" equilibrium is used as a benchmark with which to compare

the performance in the alternative
                                     monetary regimes. In the second and more
novel approach, introduced in Section
                                        VI, we study the asymptotic properties of
the system under alternative
                               exchange arrangements. In that case we assume that
the system is buffeted through time by various stochastic disturbances, in

output markets, money markets, and elsewhere.    Using a technique described in
that section, we can calculate the
                                     steady-state variance-covariance structure of
the target variables in each exchange regime, and thereby measure the
                                                                      average
operating properties of each system. In general, the MSG model is particularly
                                              —30—



well suited to this kind of analysis, since the model is easily reducible to a

first-order difference equation system, which is easy to analyze using standard

techniques of dynamic analysis.
                                                                                          *

         To study the dynamic games involved in setting national policy we

specify a social welfare function for each of the three OECO regions.        Social

welfare in each region is specified as a function of various macroeconomic

targets, such as the inflation rates, the GOP gap, the current account deficit,

and the budget deficit. The intertemporal social welfare functions are written

as additively separable quadratic functions of the targets in each period. The

specific form that we employ makes social welfare a function of the output gap

Q,   CPI inflation it,   the   current account deficit as a percent of GOP, denoted CA,

and the level of the budget deficit relative to GOP, denoted D. The specific

function that we employ is as follows:




                                 2                   2           2
            W =   —o     [0.5        + ir2 + 0.5   CAt +   0.6                   (6)
                  t=O

& is the social rate of time discount. Clearly, macroeconomic "bliss" is

achieved when the GDP gap is zero, CPI inflation is zero, the current account is

 in balance, and the budget is in balance.

          Corresponding welfare functions are assumed for ROECO and Japan. A

couple of preliminary comments should be made about this welfare function.

 First, the results are obviously specific to a given numerical specification.

 The inefficiency of a strategic noncooperative interaction will depend
                                      —31—


 quantitatively on the weights attached to the countries' target variables. In

 the simple example of the last section, for example, the inefficiency resulted

 from the fact that both countries were attempting simultaneously to reduce their

 price levels, via exchange rate appreciation. The inefficiency of the

 noncooperative solution in that case depends crucially on the relative weight

placed by the countries on the inflation target. For purposes of study of our

 large-scale model, we have not yet determined any way to study the dynamic games

except through the specification of particular loss functions. The second point

is that the loss function relates to macroeconomic targets (inflation,

unemployment, etc.) rather than to more basic categories of real consumption

over time. Our model does not have strong enough microeconomic foundations at

this point to write policy targets in terms of the "primitives" of consumption

expenditure, as might be desirable in a more sophisticated treatments.

        Using results of dynamic game theory, we calculate (with numerical

dynamic programming methods) a set of fiscal policy rules in the three OECD

regions that have the following "equilibrium" property: the rules for each

country are optimal for the given country (in that they maximize the dynamic

social welfare function), taking as given the rules that are being employed in

the other regions. A more rigorous statement of the equilibrium conditions and

a discussion of the solution technique is given in Oudiz and Sachs [1985). The

optimum we calculate it time consistent. That is, there is no incentive to

choose a different set of policies if the optimization problem is solved again

at some point in the future. The policies are therefore also credible to the

forward looking private agents and other countries in the model.   We have shown
                                      —32-.




elsewhere (see Sachs and McKibbin [1985]), that as in the static model of the

previous section, such an equilibrium does not necessarily yield very attractive

outcomes. These rules will likely contain some types of beggar-thy-neighbor

policies, and will therefore show some of the disadvantages of the classic

prisoners' dilemma. For example, in the case where both monetary and fiscal

policies are chosen according to such rules under a flexible exchange rate

regime, we will see that the equilibrium rules are likely to produce excessive

budget deficits and high real interest rates in an inflationary environment,

just as we found for the static model.

        It is therefore very likely the case that the social welfare of all of

the countries can be enhanced by a different set of policies, chosen

cooperatively. We can find such a set new rules by assuming that a single

"world" planner maximizes a single social welfare function, which is a weighted

average of the social welfare functions of the U.S., Japan, and the ROECD, where

the weights are GNP shares. The result of this global optimization is a new set

of rules that avoids prisoners' dilemmas. These optimal "cooperative" rules can

then be compared with the "non-cooperative" rules found in the first stage. In

general, it will be the case that "cooperative" policies result in some form of

managed float, in that global efficiency of policy setting will almost surely

require changes in the nominal exchange rates of the three countries in the

course of macroeconomic adjustment.

        We use this technique to generate non-cooperative rules for fiscal

policy given the monetary regime in place, as well as a set of cooperative

rules. In the case of the flexible exchange rate regime we assume that
                                      —33—


policymakers choose both monetary and fiscal policies to reach targets for

output, inflation, the current account and budget deficits. In the dollar

standard case the U.S. is allowed to optimize on both monetary and fiscal

policies whereas Japan and the ROECO are only given the option of choosing

fiscal policy. Their money supplies are made endogenous, and set at the levels

necessary to keep the exchange rate unchanged, given the levels of the state

variables of the world economy, and given the levels of their own fiscal

policies, and of the monetary and fiscal policies in the other economies. In

the McKinnon regime, each region chooses fiscal policy to reach its given

targets. In the "simple" McKinnon regime, the global money stock is held fixed,

while in the "modified" McKinnon regime, the three regions cooperatively set the

global money stock, m', while they choose their fiscal policies independently.

In each case the dynamic welfare function is the one that we have just

introduced.

        A word must be said about how we implement the modified McKinnon

proposal. Remember that in that case, the global money stock is set

cooperatively, while the individual countries set the fiscal policies

noncooperatively. To find a "good" rule for the global money stock, we employed

the following iterative procedure. We found the rule for global money that

maximizes a global social welfare function (a GNP-weighted average of the

individual region social welfare functions) assuming that fiscal policies were

also chosen cooperatively. Then, given the resulting rule for global money, we

let the individual policymakers choose optimal fiscal policies in a

noncooperative manner. Taking as given these resulting rules for fiscal policy,
                                                           —34—


we then recalculated an optimal cooperative rule for global money, and used that

one as the rule to control the evolution of mW. Ideally, it would be best to

find the linear rule for mW that maximizes the global welfare, subject to the

constraint that the fiscal rules are choosen noncooperatively by the separate

regions. This formulation would make the cooperative monetary authorities

Stackelberg leaders with respect to the fiscal authorities of the individual

countries. Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to implement this more

ambitious approach.

        As a formal matter, the MSG model can be written -in a standard state

space representation in the following way:



                          =         +        +         +
          Xt1                 AXt       Be       CU        Zc                  (7)


                          =         +        + Gut +                           (8)

                                                       +                       (9)

     where:
                          is a vector of state variables (in this case 37x1)

              Ut is a vector of control variables

              e is a vector of non—predetermined (or "jumping") variables

              Tt
                     is   a vector of target variables

                     is a vector of stochastic shocks (9x1)

                     is the expectation taken at time t of the jumping variables at

                     time t+1 based on information available at time t


The model variables are divided into state variables X, historically given at

any moment; "jumping" or forward-looking variables e. which are fixed in order
                                      —35—



to place the system on the stable dynamic manifold; control variables

Ut including fiscal and monetary policies; and stochastic shocks •      Assuming
that in each period the policy variables must be set before the stochastic

shocks are observed, the policy rules are all written in the form:



                  =   r                                                     (10)


In other words, the general specification of rules links the control variables

to the state variables in any period via a fixed set of linear rules. Of course

the linearity results from the assumption of linearity of the underlying model

and the assumption of a quadratic social welfare function in each region.

        The dynamic game that we study in this section has the policy

authorities all confronting an unanticipated jump in nominal wage inflation of

10 percent per year, after being on a baseline path of zero inflation, zero GDP

gap, budget balance, and current account balance. The shock hits in 1984,

raising domestic prices in the year by 10 percent, and setting in motion several

years of high inflation given the inflationary momemtum built into the Phillips

curve equation (which makes current nominal wage change a function of lagged

nominal price change). In each region, monetary and fiscal policies are

deployed in order to engineer an optimal rate of disinflation, subject to the

social welfare function (which trades off output, inflation, budget, and current

account deficits) and subject to the policy rules taken abroad. In this

analysis, we assume that the system is nonstochastic (that is, all   are zero),

returning to the stochastic case in the next section when we look at the
                                       —36--



steady-state   operating properties of the alternative regimes.

        Table 7 illustrates the case of optimal cooperative disinflation. Since

all countries begin with a shock of 10 percent wage inflation, it is optimal to

pursue tight macroeconomic policies -in order to bring inflation down to zero in

the period of a few years. In this case, the nominal money stock growth -is kept

low and falling, so that real money balances (not shown) fall sharply in the

early period of disinflation. Since domestic prices in each of the three

regions has risen by 10 percent in 1984, the fact that nominal money stocks are

falling in 1984 relative to the baseline means that real money balances are

declining by more that 10 percent in 1984, i.e. that monetary policy is highly

nonaccomodative in the year of the price shock. Also, fiscal policy is

restrictive in the U.S. (where there is a surplus of 0.5 percent of GNP in 1984),

and Japan (where there is a surplus of 0.8 percent of GNP), while fiscal policy

is neutral in the ROECD. In all countries, there is a sharp recession in 1984

of about 10 percent of GOP relative to potential, and actual GOP reapproaches

its potential level only slowly over time. Note that because of the monetary

stringency, there is a sharp rise in nominal short—term interest rates, with

interest rates rising by 15.4 percentage points in the U.S. in 1984, by 16.1

percentage points in Japan, and by 14.8 percentage points in the ROECD.

Interest rates fall gradually over time, in line with the gradual disinflation.

        Table 7 showed the optimal cooperative response. Now table 8 shows what

happens when policy makers act independently and noncooperatively, under a

regime of floating exchange rates. Suddenly, everybody tries to maintain a

strong currency in order to help fight off the inflationary shock. Each country

therefore has more expansionary fiscal policy than in the cooperative solution

(the U.S. for example runs a budget deficit of 1.3 percent of GNP in 1984) and

has more contractionary monetary policy than in the cooperative case. The

result is that noncooperation under floating leads to very high world interest

rates, since the whole world is tilted towards fiscal expansion and monetary

contraction. U.S. nominal interest rates jump by 19.3 percentage points in the

noncooperative floating rate case, whereas they increased by only 14.8

percentage points -in the cOoperative policy response.

        In Tables 9 and 10 we ask what happens when the same shock occurs in a

regime of fixed exchange rates, first under a dollar standard, and then under a

modified McKinnon rule. The notable point about the dollar standard is that the

U.S. still has an incentive to pursue fiscal expansion and monetary contraction,

just as under the floating rate case. A fiscal expansion in the U.S. reduces

output abroad (we noted the negative transmission -in Sections II and III), and

thereby lowers foreign inflation. Lower foreign inflation in turn lowers U.S.

import prices. Similarly, a U.S. monetary contraction has the same side-effect.

Thus, the U.S., as center of monetary system, shifts its policy mix in a

direction intended to promote very sharp disinflation abroad. In the other

countries, expansionary budget policies are undertaken defensively, in order to

limit the extent of disinflation and economic contraction implicit in the U.S.

policies. The result is that, like the floating rate case, each country is led

to pursue a policy mix of large budget deficits and very contractionary monetary

policies. World interest rates shoot up, and the world falls moves into

recession.

        Table 10, under the Modified McKinnon regime, shows the advantage of

this regime in fighting a global inflationary shock. As we saw in the

theoretical analysis of Section IV, countries no longer have the incentive to

run large budget deficits under the McKinnon regime, since they know that they

cannot get disinflationary benefits from such a policy mix. Therefore, they all

choose to have lower budget deficits than -in the noncooperative equilibrium

under floating, and than in the noncooperative equilibrium under the dollar

standard. In this sense, the shift -in regime almost substitutes for the

cooperation assumed in Table 7.      World interest rates rise much less under the

modified McKinnon plan than under the other noncooperative regimes.

        We can make a formal comparison of the outcomes of the four regimes by

measuring the intertemporal welfare function, starting in 1984, for all of the

countries given the different adjustment paths. The results of this comparison

are shown below:


          Intertemporal welfare measurement, in:


                              U.S.      Japan     ROECD


    Cooperative case        —14.884     -13.416   -14.626


    Non-Cooperative case    -14.983     -13.441   -14.886


    Dollar standard        -15.381      -14.286   -15.644

                                    —43—


        Comparing the non-cooperative case with cooperation we see that each

country has a lower loss under cooperation. The dollar standard leads

uniformally to the largest loss. For the U.S. and the ROECD, the McKinnon rule

performs well relative to the non-cooperative case, but -is worse for Japan. The

ranking of non-cooperation and the McKinnon Rule is therefore ambiguous.

        The results have shown that national welfare in responding to an

exogenous shock will be altered by the nature of the monetary regime, and that

at least for one shock (a global inflationary disturbance), the symmetric fixed

exchange rate regime envisioned by McKinnon might have some merit. However, it

is extremely inappropriate to draw conclusions about the relative merits of

exchange rate regimes from one type of shock. In the next section, we enrich

the comparison among regimes by using a technique that allows us to examine

regime performance under a variety of disturbances.


 VI. Asymptotic Properties of Alternative Regimes


        Our second approach to comparing interactions under alternative exchange

regimes uses a technique developed in McKibbin and Sachs [1985), in which we

calculate the steady-state variances of a set of targets when the model is

subject to a range of stochastic shocks, and when national policymakers optimize

their policy choices with respect to a social welfare function. Related

methods have been employed by Currie and Levine [1984]. In the illustration in

this section, the stochastic shocks are included in equations for aggregate

demand, prices and money demand in both the U.S. and ROECD. It is assumed that

in each period the shocks hit after the policies are in place, so that the
                                         —44-.



policy choices are not conditioned on the realizations of the disturbances

hitting the system with-in the period.

        Under our assumption of an additively separable, quadratic social

welfare function, average operating welfare of an economy in a particular

monetary regime can be written in terms of the variances and covariances of the

target variables under the particular regime. The numerical techniques in this

section allow us to determine the asymptotic variance-covariance matrices for

the target variables for each of the countries, and thereby to determine the

average welfare levels of the economies under each of the regimes. For each

regime, we proceed as follows. Optimal rules of adjustment, in the form



          u = r'                                 I   =   U.S.,   ROECD, and Japan

are calculated for each country, using the dynamic programming solutions shown

in the previous section of the paper. We may then substitute these rules back

into the structural equations of the model. Given the asymptotic

variance-covar-jance structure of the shocks, we can then solve for the

asymptotic variance—covariance structure of the target variables. Given these

results, it is possible to calculate the asymptotic level of expected welfare

for each country under each regime, by a method described later in this section.

In this way, we can find out which regimes are most attractive independent of

the initial conditions of the economy, in other words, in the long—run operating

characteristics.

        Since the technique is somewhat technical, it is worth spelling out in

some detail, as we now proceed to do. Once again, we begin with the state-space

representation of the model, as reproduced here from equations 7 to 9:
                                                           —45—

                                                           Wet                           (8')


                     =            +         +         +

          We now make several assumptions about the stochastic disturbances.                 They

all enter additively so certainty equivalence holds. All shocks have persistent

effects in the model. This is because the shocks enter into dynamic equations

which cause the effects of the shocks to propagate over time. The shocks to the

aggregate demand equation (Ca)              are   entered explicitly in the following way:


                     =       .'             )+

where      becomes part of the state vector X.


The other shocks, although serially uncorrelated, are persistent because of the

dynamic specification of the model: the price shocks are built into a

wage-price spiral in the model, and disturbances to money demand affect future

money demand because of a lagged adjustment specification of the money demand

equation (which makes the future demand for real money balances a function of

the lagged level of real money balances).

          The shocks also satisfy the following conditions:



          Et_i(ct) = 0
                 T
                     =


Policy   rules are written in the form:

              U   = F1X                                                       (10')

where U -is the stacked vector consisting of the policy instruments of the

individual regions, U            ,   i=   U.S., ROECD, Japan.

The policy rule may be the result of an optimization procedure (the case that we

study in this section), or may be chosen by some other arbitrary technique. In

other words, the technique -in the section can be used to analyze each

individual's favorite "optimal" policy rule, whether or not that rule is derived

from a formal optimization procedure.

           Given a specification of a policy rule, and given the structural

equations of the system -in (7') to (9') we find the stable manifold for the

"jumping" variables et

        With the system written in the canonical form of a first—order

stochastic difference equation, as in (12), it is straightforward, though

tedious, to calculate the asymptotic variance-covariance structure of the state

variables X. Once these are calculated, it is possible to use the equation for

the target variables T, in order to calculate the variance-covariance matrix of

the target variables.           A full description of the numerical techniques used to

get to this point is provided in McKibbin and Sachs E1985].

        Once the variance-covariance matrix of the target variables is known, we

can also calculate the expected utility loss given some arbitrary welfare

function.




                    T                                  tT
     Let II =   E(TT    ),   and utility U =           T WT
                                               t=O


where W is a diagonal matrix with weights for each target along the diagonal.

     Then,


        T             T
     E(T WT) = TrE(WTT )        = Tr(Wfl).                                        (13)


     Thus we find


        E(U) = Tr(Wll)/(].—g3)                                                    (14)


        Using the procedures just outlined we can now calculate the variance of

targets under the alternative monetary regimes. For each regime, we calculate

optimal policy rules of the form given in equation (10), and then we derive the
                                      -48-.




asymptotic variance-covariance structures of the target variables. Rather than

summarizing the results by presenting a single expected welfare level for each

regime, as in the equation (14), we instead report the asymptotic variances of

the key variables, so that the reader can see how well the alternative regimes

do in stabilizing the target variables in the world economy. (For convenience,

the results are actually reported as standard deviations, rather than

variances).

        These results are reported in tables 11 to 13, which present the

standard deviations of output, inflation, the current account and the fiscal

deficit in the U.S. and ROECD, given shocks to aggregate demand, prices and

monetary velocity in each of these regions. Each row of numbers in the tables

correspond to the asymptotic standard error of each target when the economy is

subject to a given stochastic shock, within a given monetary regime. Results are

reported for five types of monetary regimes: (1) a pure float, in which no

policy actions are taken in any country (i.e. pure laissez—faire); (2) a

cooperative float, in which all of the instruments in all of the countries are

cooperatively controlled by a central authority, who maximizes a weighted sum of

regional utilities; (3) a noncooperative float, in which monetary and fiscal

policies are selected in a noncooperative way by the macroeconomic authorities

in each of the countries; (4) the simple McKinnon rule, with fixed exchange

rates, and a constant level of global money; and (5) a modified McKinnon rule,

in which the global money is cooperatively controlled, in the way outlined in

Section V.

demand, under the alternative regimes given in table 11. The standard deviation

of the shock itself is one percent of U.S. GDP (the corresponding shock in the

ROECO has a standard deviation of one percent of ROECD GOP). Under a pure

laissez-faire float, (denoted "flexible exchange rate" in the table), the unit

shock to aggregate demand induces an asymptotic standard deviation in real

output in the U.S. of 2.164 percent of GOP. Under a global cooperative

arrangement, the standard deviation is reduced to 1.534 percent of U.S. GOP. If

the U.S. -is stabilizing by itself, in a noncooperative flexible exchange rate

regime, and if the stabilization is such as to minimize the social welfare

function introduced earlier, then the variability of U.S. GDP due to pure demand

shocks -is reduced still further, to 1.490 percent of U.S. GOP. The shock of

course also induces fluctuations in inflation and in the current account-GOP

ratio (the table records the standard deviation of both of these variables when

measured in percentage points; i.e. the standard deviation of 0.932 in U.S.

inflation, signifies a standard deviation of just under one percentage point of

annual inflation).

        The key point in table 11 is that the fixed exchange rate systems

(McKinnon I and McKinnon II) are destabilizing for the real GOPs of both the

U.S. and the ROECD when U.S. aggregate demand is hit by stochastic shocks. In a

floating rate system, some of the demand shock is automatically muted as the

floating rate appreciates, and thereby shifts some of aggregate demand abroad.

Under the McKinnon rule, however, if the U.S. is hit by a positive aggregate

demand shock, the U.S. money supply automatically expands, enough to forestall

any appreciation of the exchange rate. The demand shock is then magnified in
                                        —51—



the U.S., as it is amplified by a monetary expansion. Abroad, we have already

seen, the foreign money supply contracts under the rules of the game, and the

foreign economy actually slumps. For this kind of shock, it doesn't really

matter whether the global money stock is fixed (as in the basic McKinnon

proposal) or varied cooperatively (as in the modified McKinnon proposal,

labelled McK-innon II), though it is not clear to us why there is not more gain

to a coordinated monetary response. Note finally, some policy is better than

none, since the cooperative and noncooperative floating rate policies dominate

the laissez-faire response in all cases.

          When we turn our attention to price shocks, in table 12, little of this

conclusion is changed. In almost all cases, cooperative or noncooperative

floating is better than either laissez-faire or a fixed exchange rate. This

result is really not surprising, in that a nominal price or wage shock in one

country (due, for example, to a temporary productivity decline, or to wage

militancy, etc.) is best absorbed in the world markets through a depreciation of

the currency of the inflating country. In this way, there is a substantial gain

in the stability of real output, with only a slight decline in the stability of

the inflation rate (note that the Laissez—faire policies and the pure McKinnon

rule have a very slightly lower variance of inflation than do the floating rate

rules).

          Why is it that the McKinnon rule seemed stabilizing in the inflation

game of Section V, but seems rather unattractive in the present context? The

reason is that the previous game studied a case in which all countries

simultaneously are faced with a price shock, whereas in table 12, the price

shocks in the U.S. or in the ROECD are considered to be
                                                          independently
distributed. This distinction is potentially very important, in that when the

price shocks are independent, it is useful to allow for nominal exchange rate

variability across the countries, while when the shocks are highly correlated,

the need for exchange rate movements is very much reduced, and the benefits to

reducing cross-country strategic actions that cancel each other out, is likewise

enhanced. For that reason, the methodology in this section is somewhat biased

against a fixed exchange rate system.

        Table 13 refers to velocity shocks in the money demand equations in the

U.S. and the ROECD. Once again, we study the case in which the shocks are

independently distributed. Now we have an interesting, and intuitively

plausible finding: a fixed rate regime stabilizes the economy of the country

experiences the monetary shock, but destabilizes the economy of the other

country. Consider concretely what happens when U.S. money demand rises, under

the alternative systems (remember that the shock is unobserved within the period

that it occurs). Under floating rates, the economy with rising money demand

experiences a currency appreciation and a corresponding decline in aggregate

demand, resulting from the fall in national competitiveness. The other

economies experience either a modest gain or fall in output:   competitiveness

improves, but export markets shrink since the economy with rising money demand

goes into recession. Now, under a McKinnon rule, the economy with rising money

demand would automatically have an accomodating increase in money, as the

monetary authority expands money enough to keep the exchange rate pegged. The

other economy, however, would be forced to contract the money supply under the

 rules of the game, so that its economy could be greatly destabilized.

         Once again, the conclusions would look much more appealing to the

 McKinnon rule once we allow for a negative correlation across countries in the

money shocks. Suppose, for example, that the money shocks in the U.S. and ROECD

are perfectly negatively correlated. The results for this case are given in

table 14. In this case the McKinnon rule is close to
                                                       being perfectly
stabilizing, since the country with expanding money demand automatically has a

rising money supply, while the country with the contracting money demand

automatically has a falling money supply. The other regimes perform far worse

than the McKinnon rule for this particular type of shock, which indeed is the

type of shock stressed by McKinnon.

        A full analysis of the costs and benefits of the alternative systems

would require a more complete investigation of the covariance structure of the

underlying shocks, something that we hope to do in future work.


VII. Conclusions


        This paper has analyzed the implications of alternative monetary regimes

in the OECO for the transmission of fiscal policy, and for the efficiency of

strategic interactions across the major DECO economies. While the work is

tentative, we have already arrived at several useful conclusions.   First, the
nature of fiscal interactions will vary greatly depending on the nature of the

monetary regime. Under floating exchange rates, transmission of fiscal policy

tends to be positive, while under a fixed rate system of the sort propounded by

McKinnnon, fiscal policy can actually be negatively transmitted. In asymmetric

 monetary systems, such as a dollar standard, u.s. fiscal policy may well be

 negatively transmitted, while foreign fiscal policy is almost surely positively

 transmitted to the U.S. These theoretical findings
                                                      are supported by simulation

 experiments in a large-scale multi-region model of the world economy (the MSG

model). The quantitative estimates show that negative transmission of fiscal

policy under a fixed exchange rate regime is more than a theoretical
                                                                       curiosity,
and is at the least a real empirical possibility, if not likelihood.

        One of the alleged advantages of a move to fixed exchange rates is that

it would mute the incentives for
                                   beggar-thy-neighbor policies under flexible

exchange rates. We illustrated that proposition in two ways, first using a

simple theoretical model, and then by examining a differential game in which the

large three OECD regions all inherit a high inflation rate and then use

macroeconomic policies in the attempt to pursue an optimal disinflation. As we

show, the noncooperative floating regime tends to create an incentive towards

fiscal expansion and monetary contraction that is inefficient from the point of

view of the social welfare functions in the individual countries.

        A new methodology is then used at the end, to examine the "average"

operating properties of the alternative systems. The question of which system

is best is shown to depend on which stochastic disturbances are dominant, a

standard result in the analysis of fixed versus flexible rates. The results on

the whole are relatively hostile to fixed exchange rates, but that might depend

on our specification of the shocks. As is described in the text, price shocks

which are positively correlated across countries, or money demand shocks which

are negatively correlated across countries, will both tend to be relatively well

handled by fixed exchange rate regimes.
