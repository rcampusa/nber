                                             ABSTRACT

The impact of school resources on the quality of education in developing countries may depend crucially
on whether resources are targeted efficiently. In this paper we use a randomized experiment to analyze
the impact of a school grants program in Senegal, which decentralized a portion of the country’s education
budget. We find large positive effects on test scores at younger grades that persist at least two years.
We show that these effects are concentrated among schools that focused funds on human resources
improvements rather than school materials, suggesting that teachers and principals may be a central
determinant of school quality.

1    Introduction

In the last 50 years, primary school enrollment has increased dramatically in the developing world.

Even in the poorest areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, gross enrollment rates in primary school are

approaching 80 percent (e.g., Glewwe and Kremer (2006)). There is, however, widespread evidence

that the quality of education in developing countries remains very low. As a result, increases in

school enrollment may not translate into corresponding increases in productivity and wellbeing.

This is consistent with recent evidence suggesting that education quality, not quantity, matters

most for growth (e.g., Hanushek and Woessmann (2010), Glewwe et al. (2013)).

    We address the following question: is it possible to improve the quality of poor schools by

providing them with cash transfers? The appeal of this idea lies in its simplicity. The assumption

behind it is that local decision makers, such as principals and community leaders, are likely to have

a deeper understanding of the needs of their schools than central education authorities, and are

therefore in the best position to put these resources to their most efficient use.

    We study a school grant program in Senegal, which was developed to decentralize at least a

small part of the country’s education budget. Through this program, every elementary school in

Senegal could apply for funds for a specific school project that seeks to improve the quality of

learning and teaching, with the best proposals being selected through a competitive process. The

maximum amount a school could receive for a project amounted to USD$3,190, which corresponded

to 7 percent of the total annual school budget of a typical school (inclusive of teacher salaries).

    We find large and statistically significant effects on test scores one year after the start of the

intervention, for children who benefited from school grants when they were in second grade -

especially for girls. The effects are larger for schools in the South of the country, where projects

tended to focus on training human resources (teaching and management), compared to the North,

where priority was placed on the acquisition of school material (e.g., textbooks/manuals). We do

not observe similar program impacts for children in other grades. The point estimates are very

similar in the second follow up for the same children, pointing to persistent effects.

    Since we examine the impact of the intervention across different tests and different groups

of students, for inferential purposes we implement a step-down procedure proposed by Romano

and Wolf (2005) that controls the probability of falsely rejecting at least one true null hypothesis,


                                                  2
and improves upon more conservative prior methods for multiple hypothesis testing such as the

Bonferroni procedure. We show that our main conclusions survive and are unlikely to be due to

false rejections.

   The evidence on the effect of school resources on primary school student achievement in de-

veloping countries is at best mixed (see Glewwe and Kremer (2006), Glewwe et al. (2013), and

Murnane and Ganimian (2014) for reviews). While some pedagogical resources, such as textbooks

and flipcharts, only have positive effects for high-achieving students (see Glewwe et al. (2009),

Glewwe et al. (2004)), other resources such as computer-assisted instruction increased test scores

by up to one-half of a standard deviation in India (Banerjee et al. (2007)). If local decision-makers

can target resources better than a central authority, however, school grants (and other ways of

decentralizing funding) could help boost the effect of school resources by targeting funds toward

efficient uses of resources (see Galiani and Perez-Truglia (2013) for a review).

   In theory, decentralizing decision making about school resources is a good idea, but in practice,

this idea is often dismissed. The main problem is that principals in public schools (or other local

decision makers) may not be incentivized to use resources optimally to serve students. Recent

work on secondary schools in Argentina and primary schools in the Gambia find positive effects of

decentralization (Galiani et al. (2008), Blimpo et al. (2014)). Meanwhile, cross-country comparisons

show negative effects of decentralization for developing countries (Hanushek et al. (2013)). Our

results indicate that decentralized distribution of resources through school grants can have positive

effects on student achievement, and we present suggestive evidence that factors such as teacher

quality may have enhanced the impacts.

   The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we describe the school grants program in Senegal

and the evaluation design. In Section 3 we describe our data and Section 4 describes our empirical

approach. In Section 5 we present our main results and examine potential mediating factors through

which the impact of the program may have operated. Section 6 concludes.

2        Description of the Program and Evaluation

Primary schooling in Senegal consists of six years of education and is funded through a mix of

government, foreign aid, and household resources.1 Almost all classroom instruction is conducted

in French, while the language spoken by students at home is predominantly not French (only 11

percent of the household interviews were conducted in French). Gross enrollment rates in primary

schools increased dramatically over the ten years prior to our study, from 67 percent in 2000 to

92 percent in 2009. Despite this large increase in enrollment, in 2009 only 60 percent of students

completed primary school. In an effort to increase the quality of primary education, Senegal’s

Ministry of Education initiated this school grants program (see Appendix A for more historical

details).

2.1       School Grants in Senegal

For the past several years, Senegal has used school grants (projets d’école) as a tool to fund

improvements in education quality, based on the premise that school-level actors are in the best

position to identify a school’s unique deficiencies and the most workable solutions to address them.

Beginning in 2009, the emphasis of these grants shifted from strengthening the physical environment

toward pedagogic issues. At that point the government also sought technical and financial support

from the World Bank to rigorously evaluate the program.

        The main goal of the program was to improve school quality, as measured by student learn-

ing outcomes, specifically by improving pedagogical resources in the school. Instead of providing

general funding for all schools, funds were targeted towards problems identified by the school

as major obstacles to quality, and identified by a government evaluation committee (Inspection

Départementale de l’Education Nationale, IDEN) as being eligible for funding based on district-

level and system-wide priorities. Problems were identified at the local level, in the hope that

decentralized decision-making would allow more efficient and effective use of funds.

        Generally, the program worked as follows. The Ministry of Education issued a call for proposals,

based on the available grant funding, priority areas, and eligible activities (and sometimes eligible

regions). Schools that decided to apply for funding completed a grant application for a school
    1
    Fees collected from parents represent around ten percent of school funding in 2006 (PASEC (2007)) and are a
non-trivial financial burden on families: around one-fifth of students who dropped out in the first year of primary
school did so because of limited financial resources of their parents (World Bank (2013)).


                                                        4
project (called the projet d’école) addressing a particular pedagogical issue faced by the school.

Another important component of the program was its role in promoting strong community partici-

pation in schools. As a result, grants were prepared by a committee of parents, teachers, and local

officials. For schools that received a grant, the grant totaled around 1,500,000 CFA Francs (approx-

imately USD$3,190), which represented a roughly 7 percent increase in expenditures per student

in a typical school (inclusive of teacher salaries, which comprise over 90 percent of the budget).2

In Section 2.2 we describe the process through which grants were approved and allocated.

2.2      Evaluation Design

In the initial stage of this study, all Senegalese schools were eligible to respond to the call for pro-

posals. The IDEN evaluation committee first ranked the applications and discarded low quality and

ineligible applications. The remaining ones, referred to as “approved applications” were grouped

into two categories. The first consisted of very good proposals which were eligible for financing. The

second consisted of strong proposals with potential, but which needed revision. These were sent

back to schools with comments from the IDEN evaluation committee, then re-submitted. Figure 1

provides a graphical representation of this process.

       This process resulted in the selection of 633 projects to fund, whose locations are shown in

Figure 2.3 For the purposes of the evaluation, these 633 projects were randomly allocated to three

funding cohorts. 211 schools were selected randomly to receive funding in the first cohort (June

2009), at the end of the school year. This funding could only be executed at the beginning of the

following school year (October/November). Of the remaining schools, 211 were to receive funding

in June 2010, and another 211 were to receive funding in June 2011. In practice, the disbursement

of the second round of grants did not occur until the first trimester of 2011. This means that

between mid-2009 and mid-2011, two groups of schools can be compared. The schools in the first

cohort received school grants during this period, while the schools in the second and third cohorts

did not and therefore can be used as a comparison group for the schools in the first cohort. The

school year runs from October/November through June, allowing us to compare the first cohort to

    These numbers are based on collected self-reports from principals and teachers in our sample.
   3
    Of these projects, 96 percent included a component to improve French outcomes, 70 percent had a component to
improve math outcomes, and 52 percent had a component to improve science outcomes. 82 percent of the projects
aimed to build capacity, 63 percent aimed to increase teaching time, and 45 percent aimed to reduce repetition and
drop-out. The intended beneficiaries of these projects, in addition to students, were the teachers and principal in 84
percent of projects, and the management committee in 29 percent of projects.

both the second and third cohorts for the 2009-2010 school year and the first cohort to the third

cohort for the 2010-2011 school year (see Figure 3).

    The randomization among eligible schools is critical for our study: it ensures that the three

successive cohorts are statistically comparable, which in turn ensures unbiased estimates of the

effect of the program. In this process it is crucial that the control group contains only schools that

were judged as eligible but were not selected to receive funding by the randomization process until

a later date.


3    Data and Balance

In order to gather data for this study, three waves of surveys were administered to students and

their families, teachers, and principals in these schools. A baseline survey was conducted at the

start of the 2009-2010 academic year (in November), right as the first round of grants were able to

be executed. Subsequent surveys took place in November 2010 at the beginning of the 2010-2011

academic year (first follow-up), and in May 2011 at the end of the 2010-2011 academic year (second

follow-up).


                                                  7
       At baseline, we administered written assessments in mathematics and French to a random

sample of 6 children in each of grades 2 and 4, and an oral reading assessment (similar to Early

Grade Reading Assessment, or EGRA) to a random sample of 3 of those 6 children in grades 2

and 4. Importantly, the same tests were administered across all waves. In addition, we randomly

selected 2 of the 3 children in each grade who took all three assessments, and conducted a household

survey that included demographic and financial information on all household members. Finally, we

collected classroom and school level information by surveying the school principals and the teachers

of the students in our sample.

       In the first follow-up, we surveyed and tested the same children again (at the start of 3rd and

5th grade, respectively) and their households, teachers and principals. Schools who received grants

in the first cohort answered a set of questions on the use of the extra funds. To examine the

possibility that funds were disproportionately channelled to students preparing to enter secondary

school, we also administered written assessments in mathematics and French to a random sample

of children who were in 6th grade at follow-up, and also surveyed their teachers.

       In the second follow-up, we re-surveyed and tested the same children who were tested at baseline

and first follow-up, and we also tested a random sample of 2nd, 4th, and 6th grade students in

French and mathematics. In addition, in the second follow-up we administered the Peabody Picture

Vocabulary Test (PPVT) to children and their mothers. We did not collect general school and

classroom information in the second follow-up.

       Of the 633 schools, split randomly into three cohorts of 211 schools each, we sampled 525. We

were able to contact 478 schools at baseline (among which 447 were successfully surveyed), 528 at

first follow-up4 (among which 517 were successfully surveyed), and 340 at second follow-up (among

which 325 were successfully surveyed and tested).5 The schools that were not included at baseline

were out of bounds either due to inclement weather or rebel activity in the South. While this

may have impacted the representativeness of the baseline sample, it did not affect the balance as

accessibility was not correlated with treatment status, as we will report later. Due to budgetary
   4
     We contacted more schools in the first follow-up than we originally sampled because the enumerators accidentally
went to an extra treatment and two extra control schools that we had not originally planned on sampling.
   5
     See Appendix Table A15 for the corresponding number of student-level observations and attrition. In Appendix
Tables A16 and A17 we show the difference in baseline characteristics between treatment and control schools, for
students who did not leave the sample between baseline and first follow-up or second follow-up, respectively. The
sample is similarly balanced as our main sample (see below).



                                                         8
constraints, in the second follow-up we dropped Cohort 2 schools, and ended up with a sample

of 352 schools, of which 325 schools were successfully surveyed and tested. Since cohorts were

randomly allocated, this did not introduce bias.

    The first column of Panel A of Table 1 shows means and standard deviations of baseline test

scores for females in grade 2 of control schools. The third column shows the same results for

boys (analogous results for grade 4 are in Appendix Table 1, and the full distribution of scores is

in Appendix B). The French, mathematics, and oral tests were appropriately targeted to student

grade level, as mean scores (calculated as the proportion of correct responses on the exam) were

around 30-40 percent. The same tests were administered at first follow-up, so these scores allowed

room for noticeable improvement. The fourth row corresponds to an index of the three tests (which

is the first principal component of these three tests, standardized to have unit variance).

    Panel B shows household characteristics of the students. On average these students live less

than a kilometer from the school and miss one day of school per month. Their households spend a

fair amount of their income on education expenses as compared to household food consumption, and

over half of the parents claim to be involved in school activities. Only 10 percent of the household

interviews were conducted in French.

    Panel C reports school characteristics. The average school in our sample is not small: it has 347

students and 10 teachers, half of whom hold a baccalaureate degree and half of whom participated

in training in the five years preceding the intervention. The schools are varied in their resources:

56 percent have electricity, and 23 percent have a library. Three-quarters of principals have a

baccalaureate degree.

    The second and fourth columns in panels A and B show the differences in test scores and school

characteristics between treatment and control at baseline, for both males and females. The second

column of panel C shows differences in household characteristics between treatment and control. All

but one difference (parental involvement in school) are insignificant. Thus treatment and control

are very well balanced. It is noteworthy that the precision of the difference in test scores is very

high, which bodes very well for our ability to detect even small effects of the program.6
   6
     With the exception of the index score, we chose not to standardize the mathematics, French, and oral scores.
The tests were designed to appropriately measure the types of skills taught in the first years of elementary school,
and looking at the proportion of right answers in this test is a natural way to assess student knowledge in these
subjects, and its progress over time. Furthermore, these scores are specific to Senegal, so standardization would not
be useful for international comparisons. Even within sample, we show below that the distribution of scores is highly

    As we explained above, some schools were inaccessible at baseline, and thus were only added

to the survey in the first follow up (although they participated in the randomization, and the

treatment schools in this group were funded as planned). The exclusion from baseline was unrelated

to treatment status, which explains why nevertheless baseline schools are balanced. In Appendix

Table A2 we present descriptive statistics for all schools including those added at the first follow

up. As we expect, when we compare the characteristics of treatment and control schools which

we did not expect to change as a result of the experiment there is no significant difference, other

than possibly in distance from school. However this is just one significant difference among many

differences; jointly there are no differences and this one is very small in magnitude. Hence, whether

we look at schools surveyed at baseline or at the first followup, there is no evidence of imbalances

between treatment and control with respect to their baseline characteristics.

    Another concern is that these 633 schools may be fundamentally different from other primary

schools in Senegal as a result of the grant selection process (e.g., these schools were better organized

to put together a good grant application). Thus, they may not constitute a random set of schools

in Senegal and the results of this study may not generalize. In Appendix Table A3, we show

characteristics of a nationally representative sample of Senegalese households using data collected

in 2006 by PASEC (Programme on the Analysis of Education Systems), a survey aimed at assessing

educational attainment in primary school, and variables that correspond to those in our data.

Schools in our sample have fewer students and are more likely to have electricity than the average

school in Senegal, but are similar on other measures, including the literacy rates, the number

of teachers and their education, and whether the school has a library. At least in terms of these

variables, our sample does not look drastically different from the average Senegalese primary school.


4    Empirical Approach and Inference

We use a regression approach to estimate the impacts of the program. Specifically, the impacts are

the estimated βtk coefficients7 from the following regression:

                                        k
                                      Yist = αtk + βtk Gs + Xis λt + εkist                                   (1)

non-normal, so a one standard deviation in test scores does not have the usual meaning. Nevertheless, in Appendix
C we replicate our main results using standardized test scores.
   7
     Appendix Table A4 reports results using standardized test scores.



                                                       12
        k is the proportion of correct answers in test k, for student i in school s at follow up t (1
where Yist

or 2), Gs is a treatment indicator, Xis are conditioning variables measured at baseline, and εkist is

an error term. Conditioning variables include household size, number of children, whether the head

has any education, distance to school, a wealth index8 , the interview language, and the baseline

scores of all tests. Since household interviews were conducted for only a random subsample of

students, two-thirds of our sample has missing household characteristics (at random). In order to

keep these observations, we assign zeros to conditioning variables if they are missing and include

dummies for observations with missing conditioning variables.9

    Since we are testing multiple hypotheses at once we compute levels of significance for each

coefficient using the step-down approach of Romano and Wolf (2005). In this way we control for

the family-wise error rate (FWE). The FWE is defined as the probability of incorrectly identifying

at least one coefficient as significant, which becomes more likely as the number of hypothesis tests

increases. The Romano-Wolf approach improves upon more conservative classical methods such

as the Bonferroni correction by applying a “step-down” algorithm that takes advantage of the

dependence structure of individual tests. Our approach is to control for a FWE of 5 and 10 percent

and mark each coefficient that is significant at each of these rates with ** and * respectively.

However, testing too many hypotheses at once may reduce power to detect anything significant.

We thus test multiple hypotheses in related groups rather than for all effects reported in the paper.

    We also present bootstrap-based 95% confidence intervals, clustered at the school level. They

may exclude zero, pointing to a coefficient that is significant at a 5% level, while the multiple-testing

adjusted p-value may be above 5% or even above 10%. This is perfectly consistent because the

p-value is adjusted for multiple testing, while inference based on the 95% CI only corresponds to a

5% level of significance if no other hypothesis is tested.
    8
      The wealth index is standardized to have unit variance and is defined as the first principal component of the
following variables: the home has electricity, the home has plumbing, the home has a radio, the home has a television,
the home has a telephone, the home has a computer, the home has a refrigerator, the home has gas, the home has
an iron, the home has a bicycle, the home has an automobile, the home has a bed, the home has a modern toilet,
the number of chickens, the number of sheep, the number of cows, the number of horses, the number of donkeys,
the amount of land, savings, debt, food expenditure, child expenditure, other expenditure, wall material, ground
material, and roof material.
    9
      Results without conditioning variables are presented in Appendix C and they are almost identical, but of course
less precise.

5         Results
5.1         Impacts on Test Scores for Boys and Girls

In Table 2 we present estimates of the difference between third grade test scores in treatment and

control schools, measured at first follow-up (beginning of third grade) in Panel A, and at second

follow-up (end of third grade) in Panel B.

         As explained above, at first follow-up we have measurements of student performance in writ-

ten tests in French and mathematics, as well as an oral test that covers sound, letter and word

recognition, and reading comprehension, but (for cost reasons) was only administered to a third of

the students who take written tests. For each of these three tests we compute the proportion of

correct answers given by each student. In addition, we use the first principal component as a sum-

mary index of these three tests, which is standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation

1. For the second follow-up, we also have scores for the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, which

is standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation 1 (within sample).

         Before proceeding to a more detailed analysis of the impacts, we first note that the effects of the

program for third grade students on the entire set of 42 main outcomes we consider10 are jointly

significant with a p-value of 0.02. This conclusion is based on a χ2 type test with critical values

derived using the bootstrap. Thus the intervention had an overall significant effect on third grade

outcomes.

         We start with the results for children who were in third grade at the first follow up, one year

after the intervention started. Panel A of Table 2 has 4 columns, one for each of the three tests,

and one for the aggregate index of all tests. There are two rows. The first presents the estimates

for female students and the second presents estimates for males. Each cell displays estimates of βtk ,

the corresponding 95% bootstrap confidence interval, and significance stars based on the Romano

and Wolf (2005) procedure.

         There are large impacts of school grants on third grade test scores of girls. This is true across

all tests. Impacts range from an increase of over 3 (math) to almost 5 (oral) percentage points in

the proportion of correct answers in each test. These are large effects in light of the means (and
    10
     The outcomes jointly tested include the 3 tests for boys and girls in both followups plus the PPVT in the second
follow-up. We consider a national sample (14 hypotheses), and a sample split between the north and south of the
country (28 hypotheses), for a total of 42 hypotheses.

means of French, math, and oral tests are 0.540, 0.538, and 0.351 for females and 0.546, 0.564, and
0.376 for males, respectively. In the second follow-up, overall means of French, math, oral, and
(standardized) PPVT tests are 0.678, 0.678, 0.463, and -0.030 for females and 0.685, 0.696, 0.474,
and 0.025 for males, respectively.

standard deviations) of these test scores: 0.54 (0.24) for both written French and written math, and

0.35 (0.22) for the oral test. If we view all of these tests as noisy measurements of one underlying

human capital factor we may improve precision by using the first principal component computed

using factor analysis. When we look at this aggregate index of the three tests, the school grant

increases third grade school performance of females by 0.22 of a standard deviation.

    All of these effects are individually significant (i.e. the 95% confidence interval does not include

zero) for girls, but none are for boys, where the effects are much smaller and the index points to no

overall improvement. To evaluate the statistical significance of these effects as a group, as explained

above, we first carry out a joint χ2 test for all effects reported in Table 2 (excluding the index).

Jointly these effects are significant at the 2% level. To pinpoint which effects are responsible for

the overall rejection of the null hypothesis, we implement the Romano and Wolf (2005) procedure

and find that the oral test for girls is significant at the 10% level but none of the other effects

are significant.11 However, the effect on the aggregate index for girls, which effectively filters out

measurement error, is still significant at the 5% level once we control for multiple testing.12 Taken

together, these results imply substantial, sizable and significant effects on the performance for girls

but did not change the overall performance of boys.

    Panel B of Table 2 documents program impacts measured using test scores at the end of third

grade for the same students (the second follow-up). In addition to the three tests and the index

described above, column 5 shows the impact on PPVT scores, standardized to have mean zero and

standard deviation 1 in the sample.

    Impacts of the program for boys are again positive but much smaller than for girls, below 2.6

percentage points for all tests considered (about 0.08 of a standard deviation for the index). These

are not significant by any criterion.

    For females, impact sizes are similar to those reported in Panel A of Table 2, if not larger, with

the exception of math. This indicates that program impacts persisted two years after the grant was

disbursed to schools. The effects we report for girls are all individually significant, except for the

PPVT and mathematics in the second follow up. However, we note that, based on the step-down

p-values, the effects are not significant in the second followup (albeit the sample used is smaller,

since we could not use cohort 2 schools).13 Our interpretation of these results is that the program

seems to be improving the performance of girls who, at the start of the program, were in second

grade (and tested at the beginning and the end of third grade).

       It is interesting that a relatively small grant is able to improve children’s learning outcomes

to this extent, especially for girls. By contrast, in Glewwe and Kremer’s (2006) survey of the

recent literature on the effectiveness of improvements in school resources on students’ learning in

developing countries, there are several interventions that show no significant impact. In developed

countries, there are even fewer examples of successful school resource interventions (Hanushek

(2006)).

       It is possible that the intervention improved outcomes because it provided cash in a decentralized

way to local decision makers, who could then put these funds to an efficient use. Nevertheless, there

is abundant evidence of leakages in other similar grant programs across the world (Reinikka and

Svensson (2004), Bruns et al. (2011)). If the extent of local capture of these funds is also substantial

in Senegal then the results in this paper are even more remarkable because they would have been

produced with minimal resources.

       Whether the program has different effects across the distribution is an important question

relating to targeting. In Figure 4 we show parameter estimates together with their 95% confidence

intervals from a quantile regression of the relevant test scores for grade three in the first follow

up, on the treatment indicator and including the usual controls, clustered by school. For girls the

effects of the grant are spread over most of the distribution, except at the very top. For boys these

results confirm no effect along the entire distribution.

       A similar picture emerges for the second follow up in Figure 5, although the results are unfor-

tunately less precise because of the smaller sample size. Finally, estimates of the grant on PPVT

scores occur mainly in the middle of the distribution, for boys. No other effect is observed for boys

on the remaining test scores.

       We also estimated the main effects for children who were at grade 5 in the two followups in

Table 3. The impacts are numerically close to zero and statistically insignificant by any criterion.14
  13
    Notice that all the individual confidence intervals increase relatively to those in Panel A.
  14
    Appendix Table A6 resports these effects without controls, as well as the impacts of school grants on test scores
of children in other grades for which we collected test scores but no other data.

positive or negative) on grade 3 tests. The standard errors of the estimates are similar across

       This is a very puzzling finding. It is possible that a belief that learning delays emerge early in

the life of the child, and that in the early stages of school it is central to build a strong foundation

for future learning, leads principals to invest in earlier grades more than in later grades. This seems

to be a widespread belief among elementary school principals in Senegal.

       Using data from the teachers’ questionnaires at follow-up we investigate whether there were

differential impacts of school grants on observable investments in 3rd and 5th grade students in
  15
     Therefore, the lack of statistically significant results in grade 5 (but not in grade 3) does not appear to be due to
a lack of power. If the point estimates for grade 5 were as large as those for grade 3 it is likely that we would be able
to reject that they were statistically equal to zero. When designing our study we anticipated that with our sample
we would be able to detect program impacts of between 0.2 and 0.3 standard deviations, which is in line with what
we find.


                                                             20
Panel A of Appendix Table A7.16 Some of the variables we can study are classroom materials (e.g.,

textbooks/manuals, desks, tables, etc), and teacher training. We find no differential impact of the

program in any of these. When we examine other classroom characteristics or teacher behaviors,

the only interesting difference to report concerns student (mis-)behavior in the classroom. While

in third grade there was a positive impact of the program on student behavior as measured by

the number of times a day a teacher needs to demand silence, in fifth grade there was a negative

impact of the program on student behavior measured by this variable, and by the number of times

a teacher has to punish a child for impolite behavior.

       It is also possible that parents believe that investments in the early grades are more productive

than investments in later grades. If that were true it could happen that parents decreased their

home investments (if they were substitutes with school investments) more in later grades than in

earlier grades in response to an increase in school resources. However, once again, there is no

evidence that this took place, at least in terms of observable parental investments (see Panel B of

Appendix Table A7).

5.2      Heterogenous Impacts

There are important differences in the impact of school grants on the test scores of boys and girls.

Here we consider two additional characteristics by which the impact of the school grants may

plausibly differ: prior ability and region (the South is much poorer and geographically distinct

from the North).

       For baseline ability, we convert corresponding baseline test scores into a ”high” (above median)

or ”low” (below median) binary variable. However, as we mentioned above, several schools were

missing at baseline. In Appendix Table A8 we show that missing schools at baseline are mainly in

the South, and that they display worse student performance in the first follow-up than comparable

non-missing schools. It is noteworthy that they are not disproportionately control or treatment

schools.

       For region, we distinguish schools located in the most southern regions in Senegal (Ziguinchor

and Kolda) from schools in the rest of the country. We consider these regions separately because

Ziguinchor and Kolda are much poorer regions (ANSD (2007)) and have been beset by problems
  16
     Ideally we would want to do this using 2nd and, say, 4th grade students, but we do not have the follow-up data
for these teachers, although we have baseline data for them.

related to rebel activity.

   Since our larger estimates of program impacts were for students in 3rd grade, who were first

exposed to the program in 2nd grade, we focus this analysis of heterogeneous impacts on them. A

similar analysis performed on the test results of students in 5th grade did not produce evidence of

any program impacts for this set of students (see Appendix Tables A9 and A10).

   The regressions we run to construct Tables 4 and 5 extend equation (1) to include an interaction

between the treatment variable Gs and a pre-determined variable Wist (baseline ability or region):

                           k
                         Yist = αtk + βtk Gs + δtk (Gs ∗ Wist ) + ψtk Wist + εkist                 (2)


Tables 4 and 5 have two panels, corresponding to Wist =”Baseline ability” and Wist =”Region”,

respectively. Each panel reports the treatment effect for each Wist (δtk ) and the 95% bootstrapped

confidence interval, clustered at the school level. The final row reports the p-value of the difference

between the estimated treatment effects for high and low ability children.

   The first panel of Table 4 shows that the impact of school grants on 3rd grade French scores is

especially large for girls with a high level of baseline ability in French. This is consistent with the

idea that investments in skills are complementary over time and hence will be more productive for

those with high levels of skill to start with. There are several education interventions that share

this characteristic.

   There are also several education interventions that benefit mostly girls. It is much less common

to find programs that affect boys alone. Again, this could be related to the skills that girls bring to

elementary schools, such as discipline, patience, and higher levels of maturity overall, which may

make them better able to enjoy the benefits of additional school resources, such as a better teacher,

better training manuals, a library, and so on.

   We now turn to differences by North and South of the country, two very different regions. In

Tables A12 and A13 of the appendix we show that the samples are balanced within each geographic

region. There are dramatic differences in program impacts depending on whether the school is

located in the South of the country (which are poorer and have worse school results) or in the

North (Table 5, or see Appendix Table A11 for standardized coefficients). In fact, if we focus on

3rd grade French scores, there are no statistically significant impacts of the program in the North of

the country, whereas in the South they are very large, even among boys. For example, as a result of

the program, girls in southern schools are able to increase the proportion of correct answers by 12.5

percentage points, which is over 0.5 of a standard deviation. These effects are qualitatively similar

for other tests and persist through the end of the grade (second follow-up). When we examine all

of the tests and correct the p-values for multiple testing, the impacts remain significant despite the

high number of hypotheses tested. In addition, we still find no effects for fifth graders (Appendix

                                                    25
Tables A9 and A10).

   The South-North differences in estimates of the impact of school grants are striking. It may be

the case that the types of investments made in response to the grants varied by region and took

different amounts of time to manifest themselves in test scores. In the remainder of the paper we

examine whether there are differences between what school principals, teachers, and parents did in

response to the availability of school grants in each of these areas, which could help shed light on

the sources of regional differences in the impacts of the program on the performance of students.

5.3   Understanding Differences Between South and North

We start by examining baseline test performance differences of third grade students between schools

in the South and in the North. These are shown in Table 6, panel A. Students in the southern

schools perform worse on almost all tests than their counterparts in the North. This is particularly

true for girls. For control schools in the first follow-up, documented in panel B, the differences

between the North and the South are much larger, they hold across gender groups, and they always

show larger scores in the North. A possible interpretation of this is that schools in the south had

more room for improvement than schools in the North. However, this interpretation conflicts with

the finding that program impacts are larger for students with high baseline test scores.

   Next, we examine differences in household and project characteristics in Table 7. Panel A

compares household characteristics of students in the South and in the North. Because of the

missing schools at baseline, we take characteristics measured in the first follow-up among students

in the control schools. A few interesting patterns emerge. Households in the south are poorer but

have fewer children and better educated heads (and more prominently so for the families of female

students).

   Panel B of Table 7 considers the characteristics of projects being undertaken by schools with the

school grant funds. This information comes from a survey conducted in treatment schools which

asked principals about the project for which they got funding. We conducted two of these surveys,

one at first follow-up, and one at second follow-up. We report estimates from the second follow-up

survey when, presumably, data about the project is more mature and complete.

   In the South, students were much more frequently named as participants in the drafting of the

proposal. Although it is not clear what input students may have had, this could indicate that

principals were more sensitive to the needs of the students in the South. It is also significant that

projects in the South started later. By the end of year 2 of the study projects in the North had

been running 7.6 months longer than in the South. If results faded out quickly this could explain

why we observe effects of the more recent projects than in the earlier projects but this is unlikely to

be the case, given our previous results about the sustainability of program impacts (although those

are not very precise). If, on the other hand, a project needed time before it started to influence

children’s learning (as in the case of activities that take time, such as training a teacher, or building

a library), we would expect larger impacts for more mature projects, which goes against what we

find in terms of the South - North comparison.

   Some of the most remarkable differences relate to the components of the project. The schools in

the North were more likely to have components involving the purchase of textbooks/manuals and

other educational materials, while schools in the South were much more likely to have components

related to training of teachers and of the management committee. This is also reflected in the

amounts schools reported the project spent on principals, teachers, the management committee,

and the students. Thus there are clear differences in the characteristics of projects in schools in the

North and the South, as stated by the principals of these schools. Schools in the South seem to be

investing more in the teaching and management abilities of their human resources, while schools

in the North invest more in materials. This may well be a force behind the large differences in

program impacts in these two sets of schools.

   Table 8 reports the impact of the program on principals’ (panel A) and teachers’ (panel B)

behaviors. We present separate estimates of program impacts in the South and in the North, and

test whether differences in program impacts in these two areas are equal to zero (column 3).

   As expected, there are no broad impacts of the school grants on aspects of school infrastructure.

This was expected because, as we mentioned above, the projects had to have exclusively a peda-

gogical emphasis. However one aspect that can be considered infrastructure was very significantly

affected by school grants both in the North and in the South: the existence of a library in the

school. While the impact is twice as large in the South as in the North, we cannot reject that the

two impacts are statistically equal. In addition, schools in the North that received a school grant

spent more money on electricity and water for the school.

   Regarding school materials and training, we see that the school grants caused an increase in

books in the library in the North and an increase in the amount spent on manuals in both regions.

In contrast, schools in the South spent substantially more in tutoring while both sets of schools

increased spending on teacher training. All this is very much consistent with the way principals

described the grant projects, as reported in Table 7. While the point estimates reveal differences

in direction in the North and South, it is difficult to be conclusive since none of the impacts are

significantly different between the two (except expenditure on electricity and water).

   It is also interesting that there was an increase in the number of students in the North (perhaps

attracted by more school materials) which is not matched by an equally large increase in the

number of teachers, and which could lead to a dilution of treatment effects. In the South both

these quantities go down, but not significantly. Nevertheless, it is not easy to explain how these

changes in class size came about.

   Finally, school grants decreased teacher turnover, particularly in the South. Given that teachers

are likely to be the most important input in the school production function, the fact that in the

South the program significantly affected the amount of training they got and how likely they were

to remain in the school from one year to the next, is consistent with the finding of strong program

impacts on student performance in this region of the country.

   One final and important thing to report is that, as a result of the grant, the behavior of students

seems to have improved considerably in the South, but not in the North: treatment affected how

often teachers have to ask for silence during the day in southern schools. This mimics what we found

before when we compared 3rd and 5th grade teacher reports (see Appendix Table A7). Student

behavior improved among 3rd graders but not among 5th graders, which is exactly what happened

in terms of test results. It is difficult to say whether test results improved because teachers were

able to improve student behavior, or whether teachers who are good at teaching reading and math

are also able to improve behaviors in their students.

   We also examined the impact of the program on household behaviors in the South and in the

North, which is shown in Appendix Table A14. It could happen that households in the North

reacted differently to the availability of school grants than those in the South, say, by investing less

(substitution) in their children (which would then help explain the pattern of test results). However,

this did not happen. There are no noteworthy impacts of the program on household behaviors, and

they do not seem to vary with the region of the country where households are located.

                                                  31
    The resulting picture from this section is mixed. There are several differences between the south

and the north: households are poorer yet more educated households in the south, and projects in

the south tended to focus on training and less on information technology. However, when we look at

the impact of the grant on how schools use the money, there are no obviously significant differences

between the north and south. Nevertheless, the improvement in behavior in the south is remarkable

and one can expect that fewer classroom disruptions - perhaps due to teacher training - can help

learning.


6    Conclusions

There is substantial debate about the importance of resources in schools for student performance.

More often than not, increases in school resources are not associated with increases in student

performance. One reason may be that central education authorities lack an understanding of the

needs of schools. Principals, on the other hand, could have better information and could target

resources more efficiently. The danger is that incentives to improve student performance may vary

across school principals and there may be several sources of local pressures for alternative uses of

these funds.

    This paper studies the impact of a school grant program on student performance and on poten-

tial mechanisms that could underlie the change in school performance induced by such a program.

We find impacts of school grants on student learning, especially on girls with high ability levels

at baseline. Notably, these impacts persist over the two years of our evaluation. However, these

impacts occur only in third grade, as opposed to later grades, and they are stronger in the South

of the country. These results suggest that resources distributed in a decentralized manner can have

positive impacts on students.

    While it is difficult to explain the grade differential in program impacts, one conjecture is that

principals focus on earlier grades because they see there the foundations for future learning. We

can say a bit more, however, about the North-South difference in program impacts, based on

how we see principals spending their resources. While schools in the North emphasized manuals

and other education materials, schools in the South emphasized human resources, namely through

the training of teachers and school administrators. Our results suggest that the latter type of

investments, although perhaps less visible to the local community (and therefore less preferred by

                                                 32
say, local politicians, or even local school authorities), is likely to be more effective than the former

type of investments. This result is also consistent with the idea that the main determinant of school

quality is teachers, not equipment, as suggested by the most recent literature on this topic (e.g.,

Hanushek and Rivkin (2006)).

A. Primary Education in Senegal: School Grants Program

Senegal is investing a large portion of public expenditures in education (6 percent of GDP in 2009).

About 90 percent of the budget is geared towards teacher salaries. Yet, despite these resources,

results have been slow to materialize. While access to primary education has increased (gross

enrollment rates reached 92 percent in 2009), primary completion rates remain low (57 percent in

2009).

   Senegal’s education decentralization policy dates back to 1972. A decree in 2002 established

school management committees (Comite de Gestion des Ecoles), which are composed of represen-

tatives of the village chief, the commune, the Parents’ Association, the local sports and cultural

association, school directors, teachers, and others. The CGEs’ central role is to manage and super-

vise the implementation of school grants. Other education management aspects, such as teacher

salaries, continue to be steered at the central level.

B. Test Score Distributions

In this appendix we document the way the distribution of test scores changed over time and as a

result of the experiment. The first panel of Figure A1 shows the densities of scores in the French

written test taken by girls in 2nd grade at baseline, first follow-up, and second follow-up. The

dashed lines in the figures correspond to the control schools while the solid lines are the treatment

schools. The second panel of Figure A1 shows the corresponding figure for boys. As expected given

earlier results, the thinnest, lightest lines show that the distributions of test scores are balanced for

treatment and control at baseline (beginning of second grade) for children of both genders.

   The lines with a medium level of thickness correspond to the densities of scores at the beginning

of third grade at first follow-up. Again, the dashed lines correspond to control schools, and the

solid lines correspond to treatment schools. Although the densities of test scores are balanced at

baseline, they are different at first follow-up, especially for girls, indicating that the program has an

impact on this group of children. Notice also that students in the first follow-up have a much higher

(and statistically significant) proportion of correct answers than at baseline (recall that they take

the same test in both occasions). Given that the baseline takes place at the beginning of second

grade, and the first follow-up at the beginning of third grade, this is expected if schools provide

knowledge about the test material. Notice also that program impacts are smaller for boys.

   The thickest lines in Figure A1 correspond to the densities of scores for the second follow-up,

conducted at the end of third grade. We use the same test as in the previous two waves. Like before,

the evolution of test scores shows (statistically significant) learning during third grade. Program

impacts remain strong for girls towards the end of the third grade, roughly two years after the

funds were disbursed to the treatment schools.

   Figures A2 and A3 show that this is also true if we examine math and oral tests.

   Analagously, in Figures A4, A5, and A6, we display the densities of scores at first and second

follow-up for boys and girls who were in fourth grade at baseline (and in fifth grade in the subsequent

year). The differences between treatment and control schools are smaller than the ones we document

for grade 3, especially when we consider girls. In the main body of the paper we show that there

is no statistically significant impact of school grants on fifth grade test scores.

             *Attrition in the second follow-up is based on cohorts 1 and 3, since cohort 2 schools were
             dropped in the second follow-up. A student in the second follow-up has attrited if they
             have a baseline test score but not a second follow-up test score (regardless of their status
             in the first follow-up).
