Short-Run Effects of Lower Productivity Growth. A Twist on the Secular Stagnation Hypothesis

Since 2010, U.S. GDP growth has been anemic, averaging 2.1% a year, and this despite interest
rates very close to zero. Historically, one would have expected such low sustained rates to lead to
much stronger demand. They have not. For a while, one could point to plausible culprits, from a
weak financial system to fiscal consolidation. But, as time passed, the financial system
strengthened, fiscal consolidation came to an end, and still growth did not pick up. We argue that
this is due, in large part, not to legacies of the past but to lower optimism about the future, more
specifically to downward revisions in forecast potential growth. Put simply, the anticipation of a
less bright future is leading to temporarily weaker demand. If our explanation is correct, it has
important implications for policy and for forecasts. It may weaken the case for secular
stagnation, as it suggests that the need for very low interest rates may be partly temporary.

    Since 2010, U.S. GDP growth has been anemic, averaging 2.1% a year,
and this despite interest rates very close to zero. Historically, one would have
expected such low sustained rates to lead to much stronger demand. But this
time, they have not.
    For a while, one could point to plausible culprits, from a weak financial sys-
tem to fiscal consolidation. But, as time passed, the financial system strength-
ened, fiscal consolidation came to an end, and still growth did not pick up.
    We believe that this is largely due, not to legacies of the past but to lower
optimism about the future, more specifically to downward revisions in forecast
potential growth. Put simply, the anticipation of a less bright future is leading
to temporarily weaker demand.1
    If this explanation is correct, it has important implications for policy and
for forecasts. It may weaken the case for secular stagnation, as it suggests that
the need for very low interest rates may be partly temporary. Put another
way, to the extent that investors in financial markets have not taken this
undershooting into consideration, the current yield curve may underestimate
the strength of future demand, and the need for higher interest rates in the
future.23

    Our paper is organized in three sections:

    The first section looks at the historical relation between revisions in long-
run potential growth forecasts and unexpected movements in consumption and
investment. It finds a surprisingly strong relation between the two. Based on
data going back to 1991, revisions have typically been associated with forecast
errors in consumption and investment of the same sign. Under the assumption
that forecasts of potential growth far in the future are not aﬀected by cyclical
movements in output, this relation can be interpreted as causal. The eﬀect is
large, between 0.4 and 0.6% of consumption for example for a 0.1 percentage
point downward revision in future potential growth.
   1
     We explored, both conceptually and empirically, the idea that short-run fluctuations
may be partly due to news about the future in Blanchard et al (2013).
   2
     To be clear, our hypothesis is not an alternative to the secular stagnation hypothesis,
but a twist on it. Namely, we do not question that interest rates will probably lower in the
future than they were in the past. We argue that there is a temporary component to the
low rates, which will go away as the adjustment of consumers and firms comes to an end.
   3
     We also believe that the productivity growth forecasts may be too pessimistic, and that
growth, and by implication, interest rates, may end up stronger than currently expected.
This is however is a diﬀerent argument.




                                             1
    The second section reviews the diﬀerent channels through which lower fore-
casts of long-run productivity growth can aﬀect output and inflation in the
short run. On the supply side, workers may be reluctant to accept a slower in-
crease in real wage growth, leading to a temporary increase in the natural rate
of unemployment. On the demand side, lower potential income growth may
lead consumers to revise their assessment of permanent income; lower growth
of demand, combined with temporarily lower profits may lead firms to revise
their investment plans. Both may lead to an increase in actual unemployment.
What happens to inflation depends on the balance of increases in the natural
and the actual rate of unemployment.

    The third section tries to assess the size of the eﬀects by using the FRB/US
model, which embodies most of the mechanisms described above. Under back-
ward looking expectations, the adverse supply eﬀects dominate: Unemploy-
ment goes up, and so does inflation. Under forward looking expectations how-
ever, the adverse demand eﬀects dominate: The actual unemployment rate
increases, and does so by more than the natural unemployment rate, leading
to a decrease in inflation (all relative to baseline). The interest rate rule leads
the policy rate to decline for some time, before partly recovering to its (lower)
steady state value.


1     Potential growth revisions, consumption and
      investment
Using US data, we examine first whether revisions in long-run potential growth
have historically been associated with unexpectedly weaker demand growth.

    • For potential growth, we use forecasts from the Congressional Budget
      Oﬃce (CBO) (which appears to be the only source of such forecasts for a
      long enough period). Every January since 1991, CBO publishes forecasts
      of annual potential growth for the next  years. (It is reasonable to
      assume that, were professional forecasters to regularly publish long-run
      potential growth forecasts, they would be rather similar). Until 1995, 
      was equal to 5. Since then,  has been equal to 10.
      Let the annual forecast of potential growth in year + as of January of
      year  be denoted by  , and the first diﬀerence in the series be denoted


                                        2
         by  . This is not quite a pure forecast change, as the terminal year
         goes up by one from year  to year  + 1, but it is close.
         Because of the change in the terminal year in 1996, we construct three
         diﬀerent versions of  . The first is the change in the forecast for year
         5, which is available for the 24 years of the sample, which we denote
          5. The second is the change in the forecast for year 10, which is
         available only for 19 years, which we denote  10. The third is the
         change in the forecast for the furthest available year, so 5 years until
         1995 and 10 years thereafter, which we denote by  .


       • For forecasts of consumption and investment, both non residential and
         residential, we use data from the Survey of Professional Forecasters
         (SPF). The forecasts are quarterly, so we can use forecasts of spend-
         ing for year  as of various quarters of year  − 1. We construct forecast
         consumption growth in year  as the forecast of consumption for year 
         divided by the forecast of consumption for year −1, minus one (and sim-
         ilarly for investment). We denote forecast consumption growth for year 
         as of the i’th quarter of year  − 1 by   . We define the corresponding
         forecast error for consumption growth in year  by  ≡  −   ,
         and similarly for non residential and residential investment,  and
          .


   When looking at the relation between the forecast error for consumption
and the change in the forecast of potential growth, what precise timing should
one adopt? We can think of two extreme assumptions:

       • One assumption is that CBO learns about potential growth throughout
         year −1 and publishes its forecast in the first quarter of year , and that
         consumers (firms) learn about the change in potential growth forecasts
         only when CBO announces them and so adjust their consumption over
         year .4

       • The other assumption is that people learn roughly at the same time
         as CBO does, so that they adjust their consumption throughout year
   4
    The usual remark about people and firms not reading the CBO publication applies.
The assumption is that these forecasts find their way in the press, and in turn, in people’s
expectations about the future.

                                             3
          − 1 rather than during year , and do not learn further from the CBO
         announcement.5

    Both assumptions are extreme, and this suggests the following encompass-
ing specification. We assume that consumers learn both as future potential
growth evolves and from the CBO announcement itself, in proportions  and
(1 − ). During year , they learn both from the announcement in January
of year , and from the evolution of future potential growth during year ,
which will eventually be reflected in the CBO announcement in January of
year  + 1. So, in year , they learn (1 − ) + +1 . This leads us to
specify regressions of the type:

                      1 = [(1 − )  +  +1 ] +                          (1)

       or equivalently:

                     1 = ( +1 −   ) +   +                         (2)

    where   stands for either  5  10, or  , and 1 is the
forecast error for  . As professional forecasters presumably have access to
the same information as CBO and take it into account in their forecasts, the
forecasts of consumption and investment must be as of a time when information
about changes in potential growth revealed in year  − 1 is not yet available.
Ideally, we would want to use forecasts as of quarter 4 of year −2, but these do
not exist. Thus we use forecasts of consumption and investment as of quarter
1 of year  − 1 (and use a similar approach for non-residential and residential
investment).
    The results are given in Table 1 for consumption, and in Tables 2 and 3
for non-residential and residential investment.
    The three columns of Table 1 give the regression results for consumption
based on the three versions of the revisions in forecast long-run growth,  5,
 10,  . Given the specification, the coeﬃcient on +1 −  is equal
to . The coeﬃcient on  is equal to . The implied values of  and  are
given at the bottom of the table.

    Here again, people and firms do not think about potential growth per se. But consumers
may get signals that their labor income may not grow as fast as they thought, or firms may
get signals that demand growth is likely to be lower than anticipated.

    All three specifications yield a value of  close to half, suggesting that
people learn both during the year and following the CBO announcement. The
coeﬃcient  is large, between 4.3 and 6.8 (the larger estimate when  10 is
used reflects the eﬀects of the shorter subsample rather than the eﬀect of the
longer horizon. When all three regressions are run over the shorter sample,
they all give roughly the same numbers, about 0.5 for  and 6.0 for ). This
implies that a 0.1 percentage point downward revision in long-run potential
growth is associated with a 0.43 to 0.68% reduction in consumption growth, or,
assuming a ratio of consumption to GDP of 68%, a reduction of GDP growth
of 0.27% to 0.44%.
    Figure 1 shows the scatter diagram corresponding to the specification in
the second column of Table 1. The variable on the horizontal axis is the
expression in brackets on the right hand side of equation 1, thus a weighted
average of the CBO revisions in year  and  + 1. The variable on the vertical
axis is the variable on the left hand side of the equation, the forecast error
in consumption for year . Note that most of the points are in the south
west quadrant: most years have been associated with downward revisions of
potential growth, and negative forecast errors for consumption. 2008 and 2009

  Figure 1: Consumption forecast error and Revisions of long-term growth

are outliers, with large negative forecast error for consumption relative to the
revisions of long run growth: this is hardly surprising given the financial crisis
shocks which aﬀected both years.6


    An obvious issue in interpreting the results of Table 1 is that of causality.
While causality from unexpected consumption to long-run potential growth
revisions seems implausible, a more relevant possibility is that unexpected cur-
rent income aﬀects both unexpected consumption and the revision in long-run
potential growth. The only way to settle the issue would be to find variables
which aﬀect long-run growth forecast revisions and are uncorrelated with cur-
rent income. We could not think of any.7 CBO’s description of the way they
construct those forecasts, based on a production function approach, indicates
that they try to eliminate cyclical eﬀects.8 The choice we make of looking at
forecasts of potential growth in year 5 or 10 also reduces the likelihood that
they are strongly aﬀected by cyclical movements. A year for which the issue
seems perhaps most serious is 2009, in which sharply negative growth could
   6
     Recall that the 2008 variable is a weighted average of the CBO announcements in
January 2008 and January 2009, the 2009 variable a weighted average of the 2009 and 2010
announcements.
   7
     Demographic variables may be good instruments for the growth forecasts themselves,
but not for changes in those forecasts: Their evolution from year to year is largely expected.

     See for example “Revisions to CBO’s projection of potential output since 2007” (2014).



                                                                                       6
have aﬀected long-run potential growth forecasts. 10-year out potential growth
was indeed revised down by 0.23%, and 5-year out by 0.04%. We therefore ran
the regression leaving out 2009; the results are very similar to those reported
above.

    The three columns of Table 2 and Table 3 give the regression results re-
spectively for non-residential investment and for residential investment, based
on the three versions of the revisions in forecast long-run growth,  5,  10,
 . The point estimates suggest large eﬀects, although they are less sta-
tistically significant for non-residential investment than for consumption, and
they are not significant in the case of residential investment. A 0.1 percentage
point downward revision in potential long-run growth leads to a 1.0 to 2.0%
unexpected decrease in non-residential investment; assuming a ratio of non-
residential investment to GDP of 12%, this implies an unexpected decrease in
GDP of 0.12 to 0.21%. A 0.1 percentage point downward revision in poten-
tial long-run growth leads to a 0.6 to 1.1% unexpected decrease in residential
investment; assuming a ratio of residential investment to GDP of 4%, this
implies an unexpected decrease in GDP of 0.03 to 0.04%.
    Putting all these numbers together, what do the point estimates suggest

                                       7
as the contribution of downward revisions to unexpected demand growth over
the past few years? Since 2012, the CBO has revised its estimates of its
5-year ahead potential growth from 2.64% to 2.10%, so a decrease of 0.54
percentage points(peak forecast was 3.23% in 2001).9 Adding the estimates
for consumption and investment above, this suggests an implied an unexpected
decrease in demand of 2.3 to 3.8%, or about 0.6 to 0.9% a year for the last
four years.10

     Over the same period, 10-year ahead potential growth has been revised down from
2.37% to 1.91%, so a decrease of 0.46 percentage points.
  10
     One might guess that the eﬀect is larger when monetary policy is limited by the zero
lower bound, as has been the case since 2012. There are not enough observations to estimate
the equations over the crisis sample period. Estimation over the pre-crisis period (up to
and including 2007) gives smaller, but not significantly smaller, coeﬃcients. More on the
potential role of the zero lower bound in Section 3.

2      Mechanisms
As demographic trends are largely predictable and capital accumulation plays
a limited role in determining potential growth in the long run, revisions to long-
run potential growth are mostly due to revisions to total factor productivity
growth.
    In the standard optimal growth model, the Euler equation for consumers
implies that, in the new steady state, the decrease in productivity growth
is reflected in a lower interest rate. This in turn implies a lower marginal
product of capital, and thus an increase in the capital stock in eﬃciency units.
The path of adjustment implies a smooth decrease in the marginal product of
capital over time, and, typically, a smooth decrease in the interest rate over
time.11
    When account is taken of nominal rigidities and other distortions, a number
of other relevant eﬀects are at work and are likely to dominate.
    On the supply side, while a decrease in real wage growth is eventually
needed, both real and nominal wage rigidities may slow the adjustment, leading
to a temporary increase in the natural rate of unemployment. This eﬀect,
together with the eﬀect of higher oil prices, is seen as having been central in
triggering stagflation of the 1970s (see for example Bruno and Sachs 1985).
    On the demand side, for a given sequence of interest rates, aggregate de-
mand is likely to decrease as well. Lower income growth implies a decrease in
the present value of income, leading consumers to cut spending. Given lower
expected demand growth, firms are also likely to cut on investment. If lower
productivity growth comes from lower embodied technological progress in new
capital, then two other eﬀects are at work. The first is that, as technological
obsolescence is reduced, old vintages that would have been discarded may now
be kept longer, leading to a slowdown in investment for some time. The second,
working in the opposite direction is that lower technological obsolescence im-
plies a smaller decrease in the price of a given vintage of capital over time, and
thus a lower user cost, leading to higher investment. Overall, the presumption
is that demand goes down, leading to an increase in unemployment.
  11
    “Typically” reflects the fact that, in the model extended to allow for habit persistence
and costs of adjustment for investment, the interest rate may initially overshoot its long-run
decrease. The reason is that, in order to generate an increase in investment, the shadow
value of capital (Tobin’s q) may have to increase a lot, which in turn may require an interest
rate far below the marginal product of capital for some time.



                                              9
     Both the supply and the demand eﬀects imply an increase in unemployment
for some time. What happens to inflation depends on the balance between the
two. If the increase in the underlying natural rate of unemployment exceeds
the increase in the actual rate, for example if consumers and firms do not take
into account right away the decrease in underlying growth so the demand eﬀect
is limited, inflation will increase. If instead, the fall in demand is suﬃciently
large, and the increase in the actual unemployment rate exceeds the increase
in the natural rate, inflation will decrease.
     This discussion of the dynamics has taken interest rates as given. Monetary
policy is however likely to adjust as well. Lower interest rates can limit the
eﬀects on demand. This suggests that optimal monetary policy may take the
form of a large initial decrease in interest rates, with a return to the new lower
steady state in the long run.
     How can we tell which of these eﬀects dominate, whether they are consistent
with the reduced form empirical evidence presented earlier, and what the path
of interest rates may be under plausible interest rate rules? By simulating a
model that has most of the mechanisms described above. This is what we do
in the next section.


3      Simulations
The model we use for simulations is the FRB/US model developed at the
Federal Reserve Board.12
    We use that model for two reasons. The first is that it includes the mech-
anisms described in the previous section–except for the vintage structure of
capital. Consumers’ spending depends in part of expectations of future income
and future interest rates. Firms’ investment depends in part on expectations of
future output and future user costs. The wage and price equations reflect both
nominal and real rigidities. The second reason is that it allows for a flexible
treatment of expectations. In particular, the model can be run under “VAR”
expectations, in which expectations depend on past variables through a vector
autoregression, or under model consistent “MC” expectations, in which var-
ious agents, firms and workers, financial investors, consumers and firms, are
  12
    We use the November 21, 2014 package of the FRB/US model, downloadable from the
Federal Reserve Board website. See www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/frbus/us-models-
about.htm. We benefited from a further update to the package, kindly provided to us by
Flint Brayton.


                                         10
assumed to have (nearly) rational, forward looking, expectations.
    We present three simulations below.
    In all three, the deviation from the baseline is a decrease in the rate of
growth of total factor productivity of 1% a year. In order to get as close
numerically to a permanent shock to the growth rate as feasible, we take the
growth rate to follow an AR(1) process, with a decrease of 1% at the start of
the simulation, and an AR(1) coeﬃcient of 0.995 per quarter.
    The model allows for diﬀerent interest rate rules. We use the “inertial
Taylor rule”, which allows for a slow adjustment of the policy rate to the
deviation of inflation from target and the deviation of output from a smooth
trend.13
    The simulations diﬀer in the treatment of expectations and the treatment
of the zero lower bound:
    The first two simulations allow the central bank to freely adjust the policy
rate according to the interest rate rule, but diﬀer in their treatment of expec-
tations. The first simulation assumes backward looking (VAR) expectations.
The second assumes forward looking (MC) expectations for all agents.14
    The assumption that the central bank can freely adjust the policy rate
may be the right assumption for the pre-financial crisis episodes. But one
important aspect of the current episode is that the Fed has been facing a zero
lower bound constraint on the policy rate. While unconventional policies have
allowed the Fed to decrease other rates further, leading to negative “shadow
policy rates”, it has not been able to decrease even these shadow rates as much
as it desired. Thus, the third simulation imposes a lower bound on the decrease
in the rate. It allows the policy rate to decrease relative to the baseline by
no more than 2.4%, and assumes that the constraint is potentially binding for
5 years (implicitly assuming that, after five years, the baseline interest rate
is suﬃciently high as to allow for the interest rate rule to be used without
constraints).15 We shall refer to this simulation as the LB (for “lower bound”,
  13
     The model refers to this deviation as the “output gap”, but it is not the deviation of
output from the natural level of output, defined as the level of output that would prevail in
the absence of nominal rigidities.
  14
     The crucial assumption is that of forward looking expectations for firms and consumers.
Forward looking expectations in the determination of wage and price decisions, or even in
the determination of asset prices, leads to results close to the VAR assumption.
  15
     These choices are loosely based on the evolution of the shadow rate constructed by Wu
and Xia, which decreased from 0% in 2009 to between -2% and -3% in 2014, and is now
roughly back to 0%.

to the specific choice of this lower bound is discussed below.
    The results are presented in Figures 2 to 4.


    Figure 2 shows the evolution of unemployment under each of the three
assumptions. The maximum increase is smallest (0.7%) under the VAR as-
sumption, larger (1.4%) under the MC assumption (as one would expect given
that people and firms look forward and see a worse future), and, not surpris-
ingly, largest (3.1%) under the LB assumption.
    Figure 3 shows the evolution of the inflation rate. It shows that diﬀerent
eﬀects are at work between the first and the other two simulations. In the first
simulation, demand eﬀects are limited as neither consumers nor firms look
forward, and the increase in the natural rate of unemployment exceeds the
increase in the actual rate, leading to inflation pressure. Inflation increases,

although only slightly. In the other two simulations, the adverse eﬀects dom-
inate, leading to an unemployment gap and downward pressure on inflation.
The downward pressure is stronger in the LB simulation, reflecting the largest
increase in unemployment.
    Figure 4 shows the behavior of the policy rate. In all three cases, the
decrease in growth is associated, in the longer run, with a decrease in the
policy rate.16 Not surprisingly, the initial decline in the policy rate is smallest
under the VAR assumption (less than 1%). It is substantially larger under the
MC assumption. The rate declines by nearly 3%, before slowly recovering to
its (now lower) steady state value.
    The behavior of the policy rate and the associated unemployment rate
under the LB assumption is striking. Despite the fact that, relative to the
unconstrained MC case, the constraint is eﬀectively binding only for about
four years, the eﬀect on unemployment, from Figure 2, is quite dramatic. This
is a reflection of the strong adverse dynamics of adverse shocks under LB
constraints, in which an unemployment gap leads to lower inflation, higher
real interest rates, and further increases in unemployment.17
    In short, the simulations suggest that, with forward looking firms and
people, a decrease in potential output growth can lead to low demand growth
  16
     In the long run, the FRB/US model largely behaves like the standard Ramsey model,
in which the Euler equation for consumers implies a tight relation between movements in
the growth rate and movements in the interest rate
  17
     Indeed, we found that if we allowed the lower bound to be potentially binding through-
out (as opposed to ending after some time  ), then the model typically did not solve,
reflecting the fact that the economy got worse and worse, leading to no solution under
rational expectations.


                                                               13
for some time. The eﬀect can be very strong if monetary policy is constrained
by a lower bound. They also suggest that the low interest rates, needed in
the short run to limit the decrease in demand, may increase substantially over
time.
    How consistent are the earlier reduced form results and the simulation
results?
    The reduced form results suggest that a 0.1 percentage point revision in
long run potential growth in year  is perceived partly in year  and partly in
year  + 1, and leads to an unexpected decrease in output of 0.42% to 0.69%
by the end of year  + 1.
    The simulations above imply that the same revision, i.e. a 0.1 percentage
point downward revision in long run potential growth, leads to an unexpected
decrease in output at the end of year +1 of 0.29% under the VAR assumption,
0.39% under the MC assumption, and 0.67% under the LB assumption.18 The
two sets of results are thus roughly consistent, although the simulations suggest
a weaker eﬀect than the reduced form when the LB is not binding, and a
stronger eﬀect than the reduced form when the LB constraint is binding.


4      Tentative conclusions
We have oﬀered a tentative explanation for the weak US demand growth of
the last four years. Namely, that, beyond crisis legacies, anticipations of a
less optimistic future have led to temporarily weaker demand. Reduced form
and simulation results suggest that the series of downward revisions of pro-
ductivity growth may have decreased demand by 0.6% to 1.0% a year since
2012. If we are right, it may well be that, as this adjustment comes to an end,
this adverse eﬀect will disappear, demand will pick up and interest rates will
increase substantially. To the extent that investors in financial markets have
not fully taken this eﬀect into account, the current slope of the yield curve
may understate the increase in interest rates to come.
  18
    The increase in the output gap is smaller, as after two years, lower productivity growth
of 0.1% implies that potential output is at least 0.2% below the baseline. Using a 0.2%
number, this implies output gaps of 0.09%, 0.19% and 0.47% respectively. Using an Okun
coeﬃcient of 2 to get the eﬀect on unemployment, these imply an increase of 0.04, 0.10, and
0.24 percentage points, corresponding to the increases in the unemployment rate after two
years reported in Figure 2 (divided by 10, as the figure shows the eﬀects of a 1% rather than
a 0.1% reduction in productivity growth.)
