                 Sectoral Productivity Slowdown


                            ABSTRACT

     In this paper an attempt is made to answer two questions:
1) What set of factors explains the recent slowdown of the U.S.
aggregate labor productivity, and 2) whether the same set of
forces account for the slowdown of sectoral productivity growth
as well. We specify a model which relates measured labor prod-
uctivity growth to capital/labor ratio, level and rate of change
of utilization, stock of R & D, and the rate of disembodied
technical change. The model is estimated using sectoral and
aggregate data for the period 1949-1978.
     The results of the estimation suggest that the pattern of
aggregate productivity growth can be explained by the growth of
capital/labor ratio the gap between potential and actual output
growth paths, the change in degree of utilization, the growth of
stock of total R & D, and the time trend. In fact, both at the
aggregate and sectoral levels, these factors account fairly well,
first for the growth and then for the subsequent slowdown of labor
productivity in the postwar period. To be sure, in some specific
industries, the performance of the model could be improved. However,
the overall conclusion reached is that the slowdown in growth of
capital formation, the inability of the economy and various sectors
to grow at their normal growth rates, and the slowdown in rate of
technological change are some of the main reasons for the observed
productivity slowdown of the recent years.

   The recent dramatic s1cwdcim of the U.S. aggregate prcx5uctivity
growth has been the subject of intensive discussion in the literature.
The causes of this slowdown are difficult to pinpoint, and many factors
may be responsible. However, one source of the slowdown may be the
substantial changes in the industrial canpositicn of outout, rployirent,
capital accumulation, and resource utilization. It is fairly evident
that the slowdown is widespread throughout all sectors of the econamj, but
what is not quite obvious are the factors which have been responsible for
this pervasive phenarenon. Sare available studies attribute the retar—
dation of the aggregate productivity growth to sectoral shi fts in the
ccxrposition of output and errployiient.!" However, the intersectoral
shift in errployrrent can only explain a fraction of the aggregate produc—
tivity slowdown. Also, what is not readily known is the explanation
for the changes in growth of the sectoral productivity.
   In this paper, I shall concentrate on two questions: 1) What set of
factors explains, at least partially, the growth of labor productivity
in different sectors during the postwar period? and 2) is the weakening
of the sair set of factors accountable for the slow:1cwn of the sectoral
and aggregate productivity growth since 1973? What follows describes very
brief ly a irodel of labor productivity growth. The model is estimated using
sectoral and aggregate data for the period 1949-1978. The data covers
output, eiTloyrrent, capital stock, stock of R & D, level and rate of change

of utilization rate, and a proxy for diserthxlied technical change.
    We conclude fran our analysis that the grcwth rate of capital/labor
ratio, the utilization rate and its rate of change, and the g-rowth
stock of total Research and Develqrrent, go a fair distance in explaining
the pattern of sectoral and aggregate productivity growth. The weakening
of the sarre set of forces is shown to have contributed to the recent
slodcwn in these growth rates.

                                          I.
   Before describing our model, it will be useful to note briefly that
during the postwar period, substantial changes have taken place in patterns
of sectoral growth output, erriployrrent, capital stock, and R & D accumula-
tion, and degree    of    resource utilization. A brief look at the growth rates
over    the sub—periods, 1948—55, 1955—65, 1965—73, and 1973—78, indicate

that the sectoral productivity growth rates have been dramatically changing.

Sorre   industries li]ce Cciruriunications have been growing steadily,     while

sectors    like Mining,   Public   Utilities, and Construction     have lost their

pre-1965 expansion rates.       In fact, in the period 1973—78, labor productivity
growth in Mining    and Construction    has    been   negative, while Transportation,
Wholesale Trade, Services, arid      Public    Utilities productivity growth rates
have slowed considerably.
   Substantial    changes in sectoral mix of      employment and capital    growth
have occurred,    paxticularly since    the early 1970's. For example, the
exodus of labor from Farming has slowed, while Mining and Transportation
have experienced substantial positive growth in employment. The employrrent

growth   rates have been slowed consic1erai1y in all sectors of the econar'
during 1974-78, except in Mining and Transportation. Deceleration of
output growth is also evident in most industries for this period, with
the exception of Corrmunicaticns. This growth rate is even negative in
Construction and Mining. Also, the growth of capital formation in various
Sectors has been reduced substantially, and in sane sectors, the slowdown
is dramatic. Further, it is well documented that the growth of the
stock of R & D has declined by about 2.5 to 3.0% in recent years.
   These changes in sectoral growth rates of inputs and outputs over time
have certainly affected productivity growth at the aggregate level. The
results reported here indicate that the recent slowdown of productivity
growth at both sectoral arid aggregate levels can be explained to a
considerable degree by the deceleration of output growth and inadequate
utilization of existing capacity, plus the slowdown of growth of capital/
labor ratio, and the pace of technical change in sane sectors.
                                     II.
   The basic model of labor productivity growth is derived fran an
admittedly simple production function--a three-input, Cobb-Douglas
production function with neutral technical changes. The inputs are
capital, labor, and stock of R & D for the period 1948—78. Following
W. Nordhaus,     we have estimated the demand for each sector as a function
of its price relative to the general price level, t!- difference between
actual and normal unemployment rates, and the level of normal aggregate
output, a measure calculated by G.L. Perry '.    The estimated normal demand
for a given sector was then calculated by setting the level of actual employ-

 adjustments of iranhoirs to changes in short-term derand depends & the
 level of capacibj utilizatici and to its rate of change, the fol1o-.ing
pro3uctivity equation is cbtained:

whexe P is the level of output per iranhour, Ic is the ratio of gross capital
stock to iranhours, U is the gap between the rates of groth of actual and
nour.al output, A in U is the change in in. NJ., •R is the stock of R & D,
and t is the time trend. The variable, R, is a measure of the aggregate

        The

sec±oral data for 1949-78. The fit of the equations were very yocd, based
on conventional ortexTa. Hcwever, prior to the discussion of the results,
a few reirarks about the problems of estirnaticn seem to be in order. For
scrr Thdustries, we have restricted the capital/labor ratio and the
utilizaticn rate to the saxre coefficients. This was &ne once we observed
that the two sets of coefficients were exactly the same when the variables
were intrcxluoed separately. Hoever, the rrcst troubiescire estirratiori problem
arose in the secLoral equations due to th lticolliiiearity between the
stock of R & D and th tire trend. Sen tire trend was excluded frc. the              -

and significant magnitude in almost all of the sectoral equations. This
is not surprising. Our maasure of R &   refers to the aggregate level,
                                         D

and to distinguish between the effects of disodied technical change
and the growth of R & D stock in specific sectoral prcxluctivity equations,
what is needed is a rreasure of sector-specific stock of R &   D.   Unfortunately,
except for the period since 1958 for the manufacturing industries, the
necessary data are not available. Another reason may be that if the appro-
priate ireasure of capital, i.e., net capital stock, was used in estimating
the model, the R & D variable could have been statistically significant.
However, for the aggregate econclw, the results indicate that we can dis-
tinguish between the effects of stock of R & D arid diseithcxlied technical
change. The magnitudes of the coefficients of stock of R & D and the tine
trend were both statistically significant and positive. They were .06
and .01, respectively, in the agegate econaw productivity equations,
and .10 and .01 in the regression equation for the total private econary.
These estimates are reasonable and consistent with sane previous evidence.
   Our results also indicate that the level of productivity at both aggre-
tate and industrial sectors are affected substantially by grcwth of capital/
labor ratio. These results are in contrast to those found by W. Nordhaus
(1972) and G. Perry (1977) and, most recently, L. Thurcw (1979), who did
not find any effect of capital stock on growth of productivity. They
are, however, consistent with results recently reported by P. C1ark.';
Evidently, the coefficients of the capital/labor ratio we have estimated
are slightly greater than the share of capital in each sector or in the
aggregate econany. This can be expected since our Ireasure of capital is
gross capital stock. The unavailability of net capital stock series for
each sector for the entire 1948-78 period rendered the use of gross stock

series necessary.
   The coefficients of the short-term variables were also statistically
significant in each equation, which inplies that measured productivity
growth is affected significantly by the level of utilization and its
rate of change. In sate industries, ta in U was not significant, while
in Manufacturing Industries, Trade, Construction, and Public Utilities,
this variable was significant. A nore systematic variable that appeared
in every regression was the level of the utilization rate, suggesting
that an irrortant factor in restraining growth of measured productivity
has been the failure of output to grow fast enough to catch up with its
normal growth rate. Finally, the results indicated that disembodied
technical change affects productivity growth positively and significantly
in each sector except for the three industries which have been experiencing
negative productivity growth since 1973--Mining, Construction, and Public
Utilities.
                                  III.
   Given the estimates, we can calculate the contribution of the capital/
labor ratio, the short-term demand variables ,   and   the R & D toward the
slowdown of productivity growth since 1973 in the aggregate econany and
its various sectors. These contributions toward the slowdown of produc-
tivity growth in period 1974-7 8 are shown in Table 1. Several aspects
of these results are interesing. The slowdown of capital/labor ratio
growth, and the decline in the utilization rate and its rate of change contri-
bute to the decline of the aggregate ard sectoral productivity growth rates.

  The s 1cdcin in arcith of aggregate stock of R & D contributes about one
  fourth and one third of the slcdcn of prcduciiivity in total
                                                               econciny,
 respectively. These estirrates are probably on the high side and could
 be frrproved by further refincnt of the data. Hciever,
                                                          they clearly
 indicate that slc,3c of aggreya labor prcx:luctivity can be
                                                               explained
 fairly well by the conventional factors.
      The xntributians of these factors in explaining sectoral
                                                                prcx3uct.ivity
 grcth are also significant. In mjst sectors, the entire or large
 percentage of productivity grcwth is due to slc3c,wn in grth of capita
 labor ratio, degree of utilization, and the retardation of technical
 progress in sore industries. In sore sectors like Farming and Services,
 the slcc3cwn of prcr3uctivity growth rate is over-explained. In
                                                                 sectors
       the grcTh or retardati of productivity growth has been substan-
tial, far instance, Mining, Thansportation, and Public Utilities, these
set of factors account for a significant portion of the slc'down. In
other sectors sixth as Finance and Cc1rmunicatic, a substantial. residual
remains unexp1aine. It is possible that certain industry-specific
factors like regulatory restriction on Public Utilities, or special
factOrs in the Cc-istructjon industry should he explicitly taken into
account. Also, the strong grow h.of the Carrru.]rli(atjon sector needs
special attention. We have not irade such an effort at this point, but
will do so in the future.
    Note that the rnaguites of the contributjbn of grorth of capita]J
labor ratio, the short em utilization rate, and technjcal
                                                           progress
vary considerably anDng the various sectors. The estimates of the contri—
bution of capital/labor ratio are probably on the high side, as we no€ed
