                      Quality Upgrading and its Welfare Cost

                          in U.S. Steel Imports, 1969-74




                                     ABSTRACT



        In this paper we measure the quality change which has occurred in U.S.

steel imports during the 1969-74 VRA, using an index number method. Under

this approach, the yearly changes in unit values is broken into three

components: a quality-adjusted or pure price index; a quality index, which

measures changes in the product mix; and a supplier index, which measures

changes in the source of supply. We also derive a measure of welfare cost,

which    equals the inverse of a Paasche price index minus the inverse of an
exact price index. Over the 1969-74 VRA period we find quality upgrading of
7.4   percent in U.S. steel imports, which occurs most strongly in the first

year. The welfare cost of quality change varies around one percent of import

expenditure during 1970-73. This cost is at least as large as the

conventional deadweight loss triangle, but smaller than the transfer of quota

rents.

 1.   Introduction

      During the past two decades, the U.S. government, prompted by the

faltering steel industry, has made numerous attempts to restrict the flow of

imported steel. The U.S. industry was once the leading steel producer of the

postwar period, but by the late fifties that position was challenged by

foreign producers, particularly Japan, whose newer industries were more

efficient and reliable. A crippling strike by steel workers caused the U.S.

to become a net importer of steel for the first time in 1959. As countries

such as Brazil and Korea began to increase their steel production, and as the

U.S. industry failed to remain competitive, imports continued to erode the

domestic producers market share.

      In 1950 imported steel accounted for only 1.4 percent of total U.S. steel

consumption. In 1968, when the import share had reached 17 percent, the U.S.

negotiated a voluntary restraint agreement (VRA) with Japan and the European

Community (EC). The agreement limited the total tonnage of steel imports, but

not their total value. Existing theoretical work, such as Falvey (1979),

Rodriquez (1979), Das and Donnenfeld (1986, 1987) and Krishna (1985, 1987),

shows that the imposition of a quantitative restriction, as opposed to an

ad-valorem tariff, will likely lead countries to upgrade the quality of their

imports within quota categories. This has been demonstrated to have occurred

in the automobile industry by Feenstra (1984, 1985, 1988), in the footwear

industry by Aw and Roberts (1986, 1988), and in the cheese industry by

Anderson (1985, 1988).

      In this paper we measure the quality change which has occurred in U.S.

steel imports during the 1969-74 VRA, using the same method as Aw and Roberts

(1986, 1988).1 Under this method, the yearly changes in unit values is broken

into three components: a quality-adjusted or pure price index; a quality
                                                                               2



index,   which measures changes in the product mix; and a supplier index, which

measures changes in the source of supply. In section 2 we theoretically

justify this technique as a valid way to measure "quality.2" In section 3 we

go beyond existing literature by showing how the welfare cost of the quality

change in imports can be evaluated.3 In particular, we derive a measure of

welfare cost which depends only on some easily calculated index numbers: the

welfare   cost equals the inverse of a Paashe price index minus the inverse of
an exact price index. So long as producers are minimizing costs, this welfare
cost is non—negative.
     In   section 4 we outline our data and the method of calculating the index

numbers, and results are presented in section 6. Over the 1969—74 period of

the VRA, we find quality upgrading of 7.4 percent in U.S. steel imports, which

occurs most strongly in the first year. This compares with a 1.4 percent

quality decline in the following years. The welfare cost of the quality

change varies around one percent of import expenditure during 1970—73. We

argue that this cost is at least as large as the conventional deadweight loss

triangle, but smaller than the transfer of quota rents. Conclusions are given

in section 6.



2.   Model of Trade Restrictions and Quality Change

     Let us assume that inputs into an economy's production function may be

separated into M discrete varieties of an imported good, which we shall call

steel and denote by the column vector x, and all other inputs (including

domestically produced steel) denoted by the column vector z. Let us further

assume that imported steel is weakly separable from all other inputs in
                                                                                3

production.4 This means that the economy's production function can be written

as,


      y =    f[g(x),   z],                                                   (1)


where y denotes output, and g is increasing, concave and homogeneous of degree

one in x. The function g(x) can be interpreted as an aggregate of imported

steel.

      Let p denote the M—dimensionai price vector of imported steel , and q the

price vector of all other inputs. These are treated as columns unless

transposed with a prime. Then since the production function in (1) is

separable, the corresponding cost function can be written as (see Blackorby,

Primont and Russell, 1978, Theorem 3.8):


      C [,(p), q, y],                                                     (2)



where,


      w(p)     mm {px I g(x)   =   1,   x   0 }.                          (3)
                x


That is, the prices of imported steel are separable from q and y in the

economy's cost function. From (3), ,(p) is interpreted as a unit-cost

function for imported steel, and is increasing, concave and homogeneous of

degree one in p.

      Separability of the prices of imported steel means that the relative

demand for import varieties depends only on the import prices, and not on q or

y. This can be demonstrated by differentiating the cost function with respect

to some Pi and Pj to derive the demand functions for two varieties of imported

steel, and then examining their ratio:
                                                                                    4

                             =             =
       xi/xj =                   C11w1/C
                  Cp/Cp

where    ltj     w/apj.     One can see that although the absolute demand for an

individual variety of imported steel is a function of the prices of all goods

and the level of output, the relative demand for any two qualities is a

function only of imported steel prices.

       Before examining the effects of trade policy on the type of steel

products imported, we need to have a suitable definition of "quality." Let n

denote a column vector of one's with dimension M, and let X xn denote the

summed quantity of steel imports. We are supposing that the varieties of

steel imports are measured in some common unit (i.e. tons), but the summation

is still objectionable since we are adding rods, sheets, stainless steel, etc.

The purpose of our "quality" measure is to turn the objectionable magnitude X

(tons of imported steel) into a meaningful aggregate. To this end we use the

following:


Definition 1

The quality of steel imports is Q              g(x)IX.


       Thus, given data on X the researcher would multiply it by quality Q to

obtain the aggregate imports g(x). However, this definition of quality is

only useful if it can be computed relatively easily. The following result

shows that this is the case.


Proposition 1

Let x0         0 denote the cost—minimizing choice of imports given (p,q,y), with

X° =   nx°.      Then Q =    (px0/X°)/it(p).
                                                                                           5

Proof:

     Let x =     g(x°)   >       0.   Then using a slight change of notation in (3) we can

write:

     ,r(p)   = mm     {p'(x/x) I        g(x/x)    =
                                                      1,   (x/x)       O}
                  x

             =   mm   {p(x/A)            g(x) =   x, x     >   0   }
                  x


                 since g in homogeneous of degree one,


             =   (1/x) nun fpx g(x) = x, x                     0 }
                             x

             =
                 (1/x) px0 = px°Ig(x°)
                 by definition of x0 and x°.

Thus, we have g(x°) =             px0/yr(p)   and so the proposition follows directly from

the definition of Q.                                                                 QED


     Proposition 1 states that the quality of imported steel can be obtained

as a ratio of the unit value (px°/X°) and the unit-cost .(p). Let us denote

the former by UV. Now consider evaluating the change in quality between two

time periods, labelled 0 and 1. We have:


     lnQ1 - lnQ0 = ln(UV1/UV0) -              ln[,(p1)/,(p0)].                       (4)



In this formula, ,r(p1)/,(p°) can be measured by an exact price index (see

Diewert, 1976, and section 4). Thus, (4) states that the change in quality

can be measured by the difference of the growth in the unit value and an exact

price index between two periods. This is precisely the method used by

Waldorff (1979), Chinloy (1980), Aw and Roberts (1986, 1988), and others.5

     Our next step is to determine how the quality of imports is affected by

trade restrictions. A quota (or VRA) limits the total amount imported as
                                                                                                 6


measured by X (i.e. tons of steel). As argued by Falvey (1979), we expect

this restriction to cause the same s_pecific or dollar increase in all

varieties of the import, since if the specific markups on two varieties

differed there could be profits earned by lowering (raising) imports with the

low (high) markup, keeping total imports constant.6 Letting a > 0 denote the

specific increase in the price of imported steel due to a quota, and p denote

the               international prices, the import prices after the quota are p +

an.   In contrast, an ad valorem tariff of r leads to the same percentage

increase in all import prices, resulting in a price vector of p(l+-r).

      The effect of the quota or ad valorem tariff on the quality of imports is

given by:


Proposition 2

(a) A quota leads to an increase in import quality whenever                            for some i

      and j and        is of rank (M—1).

(b) An ad valorem tariff leads to no change in import quality.


Proof:

(a) We evaluate the change in quality using (4), with p0 = p and p1 = p +                        an.

      Note that UV =    px/X   =
                                   pC.,r/C.ff7rn
                                                   =
                                                       ,ip/ir.n   =
                                                                      ,r(p)/irn,   since r is

      homogeneous of degree one. Substituting the expressions for p0, p1- and

      UV into (4) and cancelling terms, we obtain

            lnQ1 - lnQ0 =   ln[,i(p)n]    -
                                              ln[ir(p+an)n].
      Since the natural log is an increasing function, the sign of this

      expresssion is identical to the sign of [,(p)n -                  ,i(p+cn)n].     Define

            =
                rr[xp+(1-x)(p+an)]n.     Then from the mean—value theorem we have,
                                                                                                         7


      n(p)n -      w(p+n)n             =
                                            p(l)   -


                = *(x°) for                some x°       [0, 1]
              =
                   oflwpp      [A°p +           (i-x°)(p+an)]n
                >0,                                                                                (5)


      where the last inequality follows since                              is concave, so that    is

      negative semi—definite. We know in general that itpp(P)P = 0 and, given

      our rank assumption, there is no vector other than kp which can be

      multiplied with irpp(P) to yield zero. Thus, (5) is zero if and only if

      [x0p+(i—A0)(p+cin)] = kn for some k>0, which implies that

      p =   [k-(i-°)a]n        so pj = Pj for all i and i.

(b)   We follow the same procedure as in (a), where now p0 = p and p1- =                          p(i+r).
      Then expression (4) becomes,

            lnQ1 -      lnQ°   =                         -
                                       ln[(p)n] ln[(p(l+T))n].
      Since r     is   homogeneous of degree one in p,                        is homogeneous of degree

      zero. It follows that irp(P) =                                       and so the above expression
                                                             rp(p(i+r)),
      equals zero.                                                                                 QED


      The assumption that PiPj in Proposition 2(a) simply means that some

varieties of imported steel have different prices, since otherwise the

specific price increase from a quota would be equivalent to an ad valorem

tariff. The assumption that                            is of rank CM-i) rules out a Leontief

production function g(x), for example, since the corresponding cost function

r(p) is linear and                 =       0.   In the Leontief case the varieties of steel would

be imported in fixed proportions xi/xj. and a quota has no effect on import

composition. But aside from this case, we expect the specific price increase
                                                                                      8

to shift import demand towards the varieties with higher initial prices, since

those varieties experience a lower relative price increase. It is this shift

in the composition of imports which is captured by our measure of "quality."

Since the ad valorem tariff leaves relative import prices unchanged, it leads

to no shift in the composition of imports.

       Proposition 2 should be regarded as a generalization of the results in

Falvey (1979), and certainly depends on our assumption of separability of

steel imports.7 New results are obtained when we consider the welfare

effect of quality change, which we turn to next.


3.     Welfare Cost of Quality Change

       To    evaluate the welfare cost of a quota or ad valorem tariff, we shall
use the conventional deadweight loss definition (Diamond and McFadden, 1974):
the   difference between the rise in production costs due to the trade

restriction, and the revenue or rents generated from it.8 Letting La and LT

denote the deadweight loss due to the quota and ad valorem tariff,

respectively, we have:

        L = C[,i(p+cn),   q, y] -     C[7r(p), q, yl - Cii(p+an)an,            (6a)


        L    = C[r(p(1+t)),   q,   y] - C[,r(p),   q,   y] - Ci(p(1+T))Tp.     (6b)


The first two terms in (6a) and (6b) are production costs with and without the

trade       restriction, and the third terms are quota rents or tariff revenue,
respectively, where                  is the vector of import purchases.9 If the quota
rents are obtained by foreigners, then the third term in (6a) should be
omitted when calculating the social cost of the quota.
        In this study we wish to focus on the "excess" cost of the quota due to
the quality upgrading. Our analysis is complementary to Crandall (1981),
                                                                                          9



Congressional Budget Office (1984), Tarr and Morkre (1984), Hufbauer, Berliner

and Elliot (1986), and other studies which estimate the price increase due to

the steel quota, the corresponthng reduction in aggregate imports, and then

calculate the deadweight loss triangle. We will provide an additional welfare

cost due to the quality change itself, which can be added to the conventional

deadweight loss triangle, and to the rectangle of quota rents (see section

5.2).

        To isolate the welfare effect of the quality change, let us consider an

ad valorem tariff which has the same effect on the aggregate import price as

the quota, i.e. which satisfies:


                   =
                       ¶(p+cn).                                                     (7)

if the quota led to no change in the composition of imports (e.g. if the

production technology was Leontief), then the tariff and quota satisfying (7)

would have the same deadweight loss. Then a natural way to isolate the

welfare effect of the quality change is to consider the difference between La

and L when (7) holds. Formally, we state:


Definition 2

        The welfare cost of quality upgrading due to the quota is

W       (Lc — L)IC(p+an),         where   (7) holds.

        Several   points should be noted. First, in this definition the term
 C1ir(p+an) is the total expenditure on          imports   with the quota, and we measure

                                   to this   expenditure. Second, we have referred to W
 the welfare cost      relative
                                                             this is the point of our next
 as a "costa without yet proving it is positive;

 proposition. Third, the ad valorem tariff and quota satisfying (7) can be
                                                                                    10


    thought of as "price—equivalent." The welfare cost of the quota is equal to
    the welfare cost of the price-equivalent tariff (LT) plus W (before dividing
    by import expenditure). An alternative comparison of tariffs and quotas can

    be made by considering those which are "quantity-equivalent" as defined by X,

    i.e. leading to the same tonnage of steel imports. This approach is taken by

    Krishna (1987), and will be considered at the end of this section.

         The next result shows that W can be measured by a comparison of index

    numbers.'° We suppose that import prices and quantity before and after the

    quota are available to the researcher. The Paasche price index measures the

    change in import expenditure using the post—quota quantities:



         a(1 p+an)        C(p+an)(p+an)/Cir(p+ai,)p
                      =
                          ¶;(P÷n)(P÷an)I;(P+an)P.                             (8)



    In contrast, an exact price index (see Diewert, 1976, and section 4) uses the

price and quantity data to measure the true change in the aggregate import

price:


        e(P' p+an)        r(p+an)/ir(p).                                      (9)


We then have:


Proposition 3

        W   [1/Pa(p, p+n)] —      [l/Pe(p,   p+an)] >   0.

Proof:

        Since   is homogeneous of degree one we have ir(p)p =   ,r(p) and 7r(p(l+T))
=
     lTp(P). Then   substituting (7) into (6) and cancelling terms, we obtain,
                                                                                                    11



       L -   L   =   C   [Tr(P(1+T))TP -

                 =C                   —
                                           (P(l+T))P]
                                                   =   n(p+an)(p+an)     from (7)
                     since (P(l+T))P(l4T)

                 =   cE;(p+)p — ,r(p)].

From (3), this expression must be non—negative, since the quantities

X =                                                             but not cost—minimizing with
      iip(P4an) are feasible to produce g(x) =             1


prices p. Dividing this expression by C ir(p+on) = C ir(p+an)(P+an) and using

(8) and (9), we obtain the proposition.                                                      QED


      The result that W         0 in Proposition 3 means that the quota has greater

deadweight loss than a "price—equivalent tariff, as defined by (7). Note

that this quota and tariff also lead to equivalent aggregate imports, given by

g(x) =   C(1r(p(l+T)),      q, y) =       C,1(,(p+on), q, y).      However the quantity of

imports as measured by X (tonnage of steel) certainly differ between the quota

and ad valorem tariff, since the former leads to quality upgrading. Indeed,

from Definition 1 we have that X =              g(x)/Q,   and since Q rises with the quota

but not the tariff, we see that imports X are lower with the quota than with a

"price—equivalent" ad valorem tariff.

      In some policy situations, planners might be interested in limiting X, so

it is relevant to compare the welfare cost of instruments which achieve this

goal, as in Krishna (1987). Since X =              C,rn,       we can define an ad valorem


tariff and quota to be "quantity—equivalent" if,



      C[ii(p(1+t)), q, y] (p(i+r))fl
                 = C
                     [,r(p+an),    q, y] ,(p+cyn)n.                                          (10)
                                                                                       12



A comparison of the deadweight loss for the tariff and quota is then possible

with the following result:


Proposition 4

For the ad valorem tariff and quota satisfying (10), (p(1+)) >           ,(p+crn),   with

strict inequality when PiPj for some i and i and             is of rank (M—1).


Proof:

Since         is homogeneous of degree zero, rrp(p(l+t)) = lTp(P).   Then using (5)

and (10) we obtain,


        C[rr(p(1+t)), q, y]       C1[ir(p+cin), q, y],


with strict inequality under the hypotheses of Proposition 2(a). Concavity of

the cost function means that C 0, and so the proposition follows.                QED


        From this result we can assert that the deadweight losses Lc and L, for

the "quantity—equivalent0 quota and tariff in (10), cannot be ranked in

general.       The reason is that the quota always leads to the welfare cost W due
to   upgrading. A "quantity-equivalent" tariff, however, leads to a larger

deadweight loss triangle due to the higher import price ,.           The welfare costs

of the quality upgrading versus the higher import price cannot be compared in

general      , and   so neither can La and   LT."
        In   this study we shall focus on the quality change in imports and the

corresponding welfare cost W.          In the next section we outline the calculation

of index numbers needed to measure the upgrading and welfare cost.
                                                                               13

4.      Calculation of Index Numbers

     We obtained annual, seven digit TSUSA data on the quantity (X) and value

(V) of steel imports by country of origin, from the U.S. Bureau of the Census

(1968-1978). The countries used accounted for virtually all the steel

imported into the U.S. One hundred sixteen product categories are included;

all steel products other than pipe and tube. Overall, this group of products

represents about 95 percent of U.S. steel imports in 1968. Denoting varieties

of steel by m and countries by c, the rate of growth of a unit value (UV) of

steel imports can be measured as follows:


        UVt =   ln    UVt —         ln UVt1                             (11)


where

                          Vt
                mc         mc
                      Xt
                mc


Superscripts denote time periods, while subscripts identify the particular

product—country combination.

     The rate of growth of a discrete Divisia price index (d) of imported

steel may be written as:

                                                                    1
                                       V                      V
        AP =         St         in                  —    ln             (12)
                                       xt                     xt_
                                           mc                 mc
                                L
where


            =   1/2                             +

                                                        mc
                                                                                              14

       As shown above, the Divisia price index weights the individual price

change of each type of steel, from each country, by its average share in the

total value of steel imports over the two periods.                   It will not change simply

because of a change in the product or country mix. This index is an exact

price index if the import expenditure function is translog (Diewert 1976), and

as such is a good choice as the true price index.

       The difference between tUV and APd is an index of the change in product

and   supplier mix. It                 captures the rate of growth of steel import prices which

is    not due to the price increase of any particular product from a particular
country.          It   may be written as follows:

              =             - AP .                                                       (13)


        Partial        Divisia indexes may also be constructed        to measure changes in

product and country mix individually. This is done by aggregating over one
factor,    either treating products as homogeneous to measure changes in the

source of supply, or treating suppliers as homogeneous to measure changes in

the product mix. A partial Divisia index is not a pure index, because it

contains one source of aggregation bias. However, the difference between the

rate of growth of a unit value index, and the rate of growth of a partial

Divisia index, may be interpreted as a product quality index only (Qm) or a

supplier index only (Qc)• To create a product quality index, we first create

a partial Divisia index treating countries as homogeneous. The rate of growth

of this index APm is:


                                   r
                                                         r ,t-fT
        APt =          St     in       C.   mc1 —   in                                   (14)
          m        rn m
                                                                                               15


where

                            [ Vtmc               mc
        m
              =   1/2                +

                            [mc mc         mc fliC



        If   this index is then subtracted from UV constructed previously, we get

a measure of product quality change or quality index, corresponding to

Proposition 1 and (4):


              =             - pt                                                       (15)


        If   a partial Divisia index treating goods rather than countries as
homogeneous is constructed, then the difference between UV and the rate of

growth of that partial Divisia index                     is   a supplier index, measuring the

change in import prices due to               different foreign suppliers:

              = UV          -                                                           (16)


The composite quality and supplier index in (13) is not necessarily equal to

the sum of (15) and (16), because substitution may take place toward more

expensive products from more expensive countries; see Aw and Robert (1986).

     Finally, we need to calculate the cumulative Paasche and exact indexes to

measure the welfare cost W. Using 1968 as the base year, the cumulative

Paasche price index is calculated as;

                        t
     p' = mZZVmc
            c                                                                           (17)
      a
           E ( V68/z              X°°) z   Xmc
                mc
                  mc            c
                                   mc
                                       c
                                                                                  16



Note that in this index we are treating countries as homogeneous, and

therefore measuring the change in product prices only. This corresponds to

our treatment of countries in the quality index. The cumulative Divisia

index treating countries as homogeneous is calculated from (14) as,

                         t
      t     = exp( z                                                     (18)
                        ¶69 AP).

The welfare cost corresponding to Proposition 3 is given by,



     w = (1/P)                —
                                      (1/P),                             (19)



where the subscript "d" is used to emphasize that a (partial) Divisia index

has been used as the exact index.

     Since it will be apparent that the welfare cost is sensitive to the

choice of the exact index, we shall also report results using the Fisher

(1922) Ideal price index, which is exact for a linear, Leontief and quadratic

production function (Diewert, 1976). The cumulative Ideal index (P) is

obtained by first calculating the Laspeyres price index (P) with 1968 as the

base year, and then taking the geometric mean of the Paasche and Laspeyres

i ndexes:




                      (Vtmc       /
                                        mc )   mc
     pt     =   111                                                        20'/
       £
                        EV68
                m       c mc


     pt =
       1
                 (pta   pt)l/2
                         £
                                                                          (21)
                                                                               17


In these formulae we are again treating countries as homogeneous. The welfare

cost W using the Ideal index is given by,


                 —
     W = (1/P)       (1/P).                                             (22)



5.   Effects of the 1969—74 VRA in Steel

5.1 Estimates of Quality and Supplier Changes

     When the VRA was first negotiated by the Johnson Administration in 1968,

the decision was made to limit overall steel imports to 12.7 million tons

(including pipe and tube). Forty-one percent was allocated to each of Japan

and the European Community (EC) and 18 percent was allocated to the rest of

the world. The VRA was agreed to formally, however, only by Japan and the EC.

It was to begin in 1969 and last three years, with a five percent growth rate

in imports allowed each year.

     As seen in Table 1, from 1968 to 1970 the quantity of steel imports fell

from 15.7 million tons, with a unit value of $105 per ton, to 10.8 million

tons, with a unit value of $143 per ton. In Table 2, the aggregate unit value

change is decomposed into a Divisia index, and using partial Divisia indexes,

into quality and supplier indexes.

     During the first year of the VRA the unit value of steel imports rose

14.7 percent, with about half of that increase due to product quality

upgrading. In the second year of the VRA the unit value rose 16.1 percent,

with about two percentage points of that increase due to importing higher

quality products. The agreement broke down in 1971 when the Nixon

administration placed a 10 percent surcharge on all imported products. The

Europeans and the Japanese claimed that this violated the quota agreement.
                                                                              18


They responded by increasing steel exports to a level which exceeded their

alloted quotas. As a result of this, the quantity of imports rose by about 50

percent in 1971, reaching 15.5 million tons. The unit value of steel imports

fell to $139 per ton that year. However, since the exact price (Divisia)

index actually rose by 2.3 percent, the entire decline in the unit value index

can be attributed to changes in the product and country mix to include more

iow quality steel products, imported from Japan and the EC.

     In May 1972, after over a year of negotiation, the agreement was renewed,

with more specific restrictions placed on high valued products, specifically

stainless steel and alloy tool steel (so called specialty steel). There was a

renewed pledge by countries to maintain the product mix of imports, and annual

import growth rates were reduced from 5 percent to 2.5 percent. In 1973,

there was a dramatic increase in world steel demand which caused the agreement

to become superfluous. It lapsed in 1974. During the time the renegotiated

VRA was in place, from mid—1972 to 1974, there was some additional quality

upgrading. However, because the agreement was binding with the EC only in

1973, and was not binding with Japan in either 1973 or 1974, it is not

surprising that further quality upgrading was small.

     Over the entire five year period of the VRA, the unit value of steel

imports rose by 53 percent, an average increase of 10 percent per year. About

one—seventh or 7.4 percentage points of that increase was due to product

quality upgrading. Since 1971 is included, this is a conservative estimate.

The upgrading is most apparent in the first year of the VRA, There was

virtually no movement, however, toward importing steel from higher priced

producers. Since the VRA was based on historic market shares, this result

follows naturally.
                                                                                19


     In order to see how instrumental the VRA was in the occurrence of this

quality upgrading, we compare the VRA period 1969 to 1973 (this is the last

year the agreement was binding), to a period when there were relatively few

restrictions, 1975 to 1978.   In the latter years, there were no formal

quantitative restrictions on carbon steel imports, although there were

quantitative restrictions on specialty steel imports between 1976 and 1980.

     The industry went through a period of strong demand worldwide in 1973 and

1974. In 1974, 13.3 million tons of steel with a unit value of $305 were

imported into the U.S. Although imports increased dramatically, the share of

imports in total domestic steel consumption fell from about 17 percent to about

13 percent. Therefore, import penetration was not a major concern. In 1975

and 1976, the situation reversed. Steel prices fell and producers, who had

expanded in the previous two years, were left with enormous levels of excess

capacity. In addition, because the decline in demand was viewed as temporary,

the industry was relectant to retire its older facilities, exacerbating the

problem. Steel imports fell by 30 percent in 1975, reaching their lowest level

of 9.6 million tons. However, the import share rose slightly.

     In order to maintain employment levels in their domestic steel

industries, many countries subsidized steel production and/or dumped imports

into the U.S. This led to a disintegration in the price structure and added

to the crisis already facing the domestic steel industry. Increased imports

of low priced foreign steel once again spurred action by the domestic

industry, in the form of anti-dumping and countervailing duty lawsuits. By

1978, when the quantity of steel imports has risen to 17 million tons, a new

method of curbing steel imports —   the   trigger price mechanism - was introduced.
                                                                              20

     From 1975 to 1978, the Divisia price index of imported steel rose

erratically by about five percent, but the unit value rose by less than one

percent. That is because the product quality index fell by 1.4 percent, and

the supplier index fell by 3.5 percent. This is a reversal of the previous

period, with lower quality products being imported from lower pricing

countries.

     In summation, product quality seemed to be affected by the imposition of

the VRA. Quality upgrading was most pronounced during the first year of the

VRA, when it accounted for one-half of the unit value increase. Product

quality increased by 7.4 percent, overall, when the VRA was in effect. This

compares to a 1.4 percent quality decline in the following years.

     Although supplier changes seemed less dramatic, this may be explained by

the smaller differential in the prices among suppliers ($70 to $375 per ton)

as compared to the differential in product prices ($41 to $2,387 per ton).

The supplier index indicates that there was a greater movement toward buying

products from lower pricing countries when the VRA was removed (-.1 percent

during 1969-73, compared to —3.5 percent after the VRA). Therefore, even if

the agreement did not cause an increase in import purchases from high priced

suppliers, because it preserved historic market shares, the agreement may have

prevented the increase in purchases from lower priced suppliers.


5.2 Welfare Cost of Quality Upgradin

     In Table 3 we report the welfare cost of quality change, focusing on the

1969—74 period of the VRA.12 We first show the cumulative Paasche and

Laspeyres price indexes with 1968 as the base year. The Ideal index is

calculated as the geometric mean of these, while the cumulative (partial)

Divisia can be computed from Table 2 using (15) and (18). Then the welfare
                                                                                      21


costs using the Divisia and Ideal indexes are obtained from (19) and (22), and

are shown in the last two columns of Table 3.

     In 1969, the first year of the VRA, the welfare cost was 0.42 and 0.21

percent of import expenditure using the Divisia and Ideal indexes,

respectively. From Table 1 import expenditure was $1.64 billion, so the

deadweight loss of the quality change is $6.9 and 3.4 million using the two

indexes. The welfare cost rises to exceed one percent of import expenditure

in 1970, or about $15.5 million. After this the welfare cost using the

Divisia index falls below one percent of import expenditure, while the welfare

cost from the Ideal index fluctuates around one percent. While the magnitude

of these welfare costs differ somewhat, the yearly directions of change are

the same.

     It is useful to compare the welfare cost due to upgrading with the other

welfare costs arising from the VRA: the conventional deadweight loss triangle

from increased domestic production and reduced consumption; and the transfer

of quota rents to foreigners. From Hufbauer, Berliner and Elliot (1986, case

M-12), the VRA is estimated to have increased the price of imported steel by

7.3 percent, which is also a median estimate from Crandall (1981, pp. 105—6).

Expressed as a percentage of import expenditure after the quota, the

conventional deadweight loss triangle is approximately (1/2) (0.073I1.073)2,

where r is the elasticity of import demand.13 Hufbauer etal. use an import

demand elasticity of 2.5, whereas Crandall reports a range of estimates for

various products ranging from 2.1 to 5. If we use       =   2.5,   then we obtain a

conventional deadweight loss of 0.58 percent of import expenditure, which is

below the welfare costs of upgrading reported in Table 3 for 1970-73. Even

with a high value of   =   4.5,   as used by Crandall, we obtain a deadweight loss
                                                                                22

of   1.04 percent, which lies between the welfare costs in Table 3 for 1970—73.

Thus, for the VRA in steel, the cost of quality upgrading is at least as large

as the conventional deadweight loss.

      Considering the transfer of quota rents to foreigners, the 7.3 percent

increase in the import price induced by the VRA corresponds to quota rents of

(0.073/1.073) 100 =    6.8 percent of import expenditure after the quota. Since
the welfare cost of upgrading fluctuates around one percent during 1970-73, we

can see that it is considerably smaller than the transfer of quota rents.


6.     Conclusions

       In this study we have examined the quality upgrading which occurred in

U.S. steel imports during the 1969-74 VRA. Quality change is measured by a

comparison of unit values with exact price indexes, as was theoretically

justified in section 2. We also derived a measure of the welfare cost of

quality change, which equals the inverse of the Paasche price index minus the

inverse   of an exact price index. So long as producers are minimizing costs,
this welfare cost will be non—negative.
       Empirically,   we found quality upgrading of 7.4 percent in U.S. steel

imports during the VRA, with most of the upgrading occurring during 1969.

This compares with a 1.4 percent quality decline in the following years. The

welfare cost of the quality change varies around one percent of import

expenditure during 1970-73. The measured cost is somewhat sensitive to the

choice of exact index number, with the Ideal index giving a higher welfare

cost in several years than the Divisia index.

       We should stress that it would be valid to take our measure of the cost

of quality upgrading, and simply add it on to the conventional deadweight loss

and transfer of quota rents obtained from other studies, such as Crandall
                                                                              23


(1981) and Hufbauer, Berliner and Elliott (1986). This procedure gives the

total welfare cost of the VRA. The reason it is valid i that the earlier

studies convert the quota into price—equivalent tariff, as in (7), before

calculating the deadweight loss. This means that the earlier studies are

really calculating the loss LT rather than La• From Definition 2 we have that

L = LT   + WC7.,r(p+an), and so given the deadweight loss L we can simply add on

the additional welfare cost of upgrading to obtain La. Applying this

procedure to the 1969—74 VRA, we have argued that the cost due to upgrading is

at least as large as the conventional deadweight loss, so that La is twice as

large as LT. However, the transfer of quota rents is considerably larger than

either of these welfare costs.

     Finally, it is useful to compare our results with those that could be

obtained for later time periods. American steel producers and the government

certainly became aware that quality upgrading was a response of foreign

producers to the 1969-74 VRA, and later protection attempted to limit

upgrading by specifying quotas on very detailed product categories. Boorstein

(1987) finds that these programs were partially effective in limiting

upgrading: the magnitude of upgrading during the 1976-80 specialty steel

quota, or the 1982-85 EC agreement covering specific carbon and alloy

products, is less than we have found for the 1969-74 VRA. This means that the

welfare cost of quality change is also smaller. However, even in cases where

the U.S. has imposed very detailed restrictions, some amount of upgrading is

often observed, so the economic forces we have identified in this study are

still operative.

     1This method has also been used to measure changes in labor quality by

Waldorff (1973) and Chinloy (1980), and more generally, is related to the

literature on technological change such as Jorgenson and Griliches (1967),

Christensen and Jorgenson (1969, 1970).

     2Note that the concept of "quality" used here refers only to the

jtion of imports across products. An alternative concept arises when

firms change the content of products, as with Japanese exporters sending

larger, more powerful cars to the U.S. In that case quality can be measured

using hedonic regressions, as in Feenstra (1984, 1985, 1988).

     3Anderson (1985, 1988) measures the welfare cost of inefficient

allocation of quotas to U.S. cheese imports. We contrast our approach to his

in footnote 10.

     4The concept of weak separability we use is from Blackorby, Primont and

Russell (1978, Lemma 3.3a). Crandall (1981, pp. 46—69) discusses why domestic

and imported steel should not be considered perfect substitutes; see also Tarr

and Morkre (1984). Note that separability is an assumption in Falvey's (1979)

model.

     5Note that these authors simply define quality change according to an

equation like (4).   In contrast, we have used the more primitive Definition 1,

and then related it to existing techniques using Proposition 1. We hope this

clarifies what is meant by "quality."

     6This statement does not hold if there are limits on the ability to

arbitrage between sources of supply, as when the quota specifies the maximum

amount exported from various countries. The effect of the VRA in steel on

sources of supply is captured by our "supplier index," discussed in sections 4

and 5.
                                                                                     25


     7A generalization which allows for nonseparability of imports, leading to

ambiguous effects of a quota, is in Dinopoulos and Koo (1986).

     8Recent analyses of deadweight loss in an open economy are provided by

Diewert (1983, 1985).

     9Note that in all expressions of the form C7irp(.) the arguments of C are

C71[ir(), q, y].

    101f a researcher actually had estimates of the cost functions C and u,

then the deadweight loss of the quota could be evaluated directly from (6a).
This is the approach taken by Anderson (1985, 1988), who estimates a translog

expenditure function over nine imported (and six domestic) cheese varieties.

In our study we have over one hundred categories of imported steel

necessitating the use of index numbers.

    11Using the conventional approximation for deadweight loss, it is possible

to express La and L1 in terms of the aggregate elasticity of import demand,

extent of quality upgrading, and W. By inserting different values for these

variables, it is apparent that La and L1 cannot be ranked for the "quantity-

equivalent" quota and tariff. These formulae are omitted for brevity but

available on request.

    12Results for later years, and specific countries, will be included in

future work.

    l3io derive this formula, we define the ad valorem tariff which is "price—

equivalent" to the quota by (7). Then (6b) is the conventional deadweight

loss. Dividing (6b) by C71ir(p(1+t)), and using the approximation C[it(p),q,y]'

                   -
                       C,(p)T   +   (1/2)   C,ir(p)2T2, we obtain LT/C,T7r(p(1+T))

(1/2) ri[t/(1+r)]2 where r =
