We develop a specific-factors model of regional economies that includes two types of workers, skilled
and unskilled. The model delivers a simple equation relating trade-induced local shocks to changes
in local skill premia. We apply the methodology to Brazil's early 1990s trade liberalization and find
statistically significant but modest effects of liberalization on the evolution of the skill premium between
1991 and 2010. The methodology uses widely available household survey data and can easily be applied
to other countries and liberalization episodes.

                     A Local Labor Markets Approach

                                     Draft: January 2015



          We develop a specific-factors model of regional economies that in-
          cludes two types of workers, skilled and unskilled. The model deliv-

          in local skill premia. We apply the methodology to Brazil’s early
          1990s trade liberalization and find statistically significant but mod-
          est effects of liberalization on the evolution of the skill premium
          between 1991 and 2010. The methodology uses widely available
          household survey data and can easily be applied to other countries
          and liberalization episodes.


  Trade economists have long studied the effects of globalization on wage differ-
ences between workers with different levels of skill or education.1 This literature
has generally sought to link globalization to changes in the economy-wide skill
premium. Attanasio et al. (2004) and Gonzaga et al. (2006) are salient examples
that investigate whether changes in sector-specific prices or tariffs, changes in skill
composition within and across sectors, and movements in the skill premium are
consistent with the predictions of workhorse trade models, such as the Heckscher-
Ohlin model. However, there is little evidence directly establishing a causal effect

of globalization on the skill premium.2 More recently, a growing body of research
has focused on trade’s differential effects across local markets within a country.3
In this paper, we combine these two strands of literature by developing a theo-
retically consistent approach to studying the causal effect of trade liberalization
on the skill premium at the local level.
  We develop a specific-factors model of regional economies that includes two
types of workers, skilled and unskilled, who are complementary with specific fac-
tors and with each other, and are mobile across industries within a region.4 From
this model, we derive a simple equation linking changes in regional skill premia
to (exogenous) liberalization-induced price shocks that differentially affect skilled
and unskilled workers.
  The model yields an empirically tractable approach to studying the effect of
trade liberalization on regional skill premia. We illustrate this methodology using
four rounds of the Brazilian Census of Population from 1980 to 2010 (IBGE 2012).
This period covers a major trade liberalization episode that took place between
1990 and 1995. We find that trade liberalization, operating through the mecha-
nism identified in the model, drove small but statistically significant declines in
the skill premium during the post-liberalization period. Our methodology makes
use of widely available household survey data and can easily be applied to liber-
alization episodes in other countries.

           I.   Regional Labor Market Model with Two Worker Types


  We extend the specific-factors model of Kovak (2013) to include two types of
labor. The national economy consists of many regions, r, each of which may
    2 Amiti and Cameron (2012) is a noteworthy exception, finding effects of input tariff changes on
within-firm skill premia.
    3 See Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2014) for an extensive list of citations.
    4 Autor et al. (2013) and Kovak (2013) respectively develop monopolistic competition and specific-
factors models of trade’s effects on local labor markets in a context with one homogenous labor pool.
Adão (2014), Pellandra (2014), and Rodriguez Chatruc (2014) are concurrent projects examining trade’s
effects on local skill premia using alternate theoretical frameworks to the one we develop. Topalova
(2007) and Costa et al. (2014) respectively study trade’s effects on local consumption inequality and
local wage inequality using causal empirical frameworks, though without the theoretical foundation that
we provide here.
produce goods in many industries, i. Goods are produced using three factors.
Each region is endowed with a vector of industry-specific factors, Tri . Skilled
labor, Hr , and unskilled labor, Lr , are both costlessly mobile across industries
within region. Total factor supplies are fixed in each region.5 Production is Cobb-
Douglas, and factor shares θT i , θLi , and θHi may vary across industries, subject
to θT i +θLi +θHi = 1.6 Goods and factor markets are competitive. Hats represent
proportional changes, such that x̂ ≡ d ln x. Producers in all regions face the same
national vector of liberalization-induced price changes P̂i .

  We solve the model in Appendix A.1, using factor market clearing, cost min-
imization, and zero profits. These equilibrium conditions imply the following
system of equations,

where λHri and λLri are the respective shares of regional skilled and unskilled
labor allocated to industry i, and s and w are the respective wages paid to skilled
and unskilled labor. The direct effect of trade-induced price changes on unskilled
wages has an indirect effect on skilled wages, which in turn affects skilled wages,
and so on. This system highlights how regional skilled and unskilled wages are
intertwined, showing that one must consider the factors’ equilibrium interactions
when studying the effects of trade liberalization on skilled and unskilled wages.

  Solving the system in terms of exogenous price changes yields the effect of
liberalization-induced price changes on the proportional change in the regional

    5 See Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2014) for a version of the model with one type of labor, but allowing
specific factor and labor supplies to vary endogenously. To the extent that factor supplies respond, we
identify the reduced form effect of liberalization, including endogenous supply responses.
    6 We assume Cobb-Douglas because we do not have empirical estimates of elasticities of factor sub-
stitution that vary across industries, and it avoids complications arising if the two labor types were
differentially substitutable with specific factors.

βLri and βHri sum to 1 across industries, such that the numerator reflects the
difference in weighted average price changes for skilled and unskilled workers.
The skill premium declines (increases) more when tariff declines are more inci-
dent upon industries employing a larger (smaller) share of skilled workers. This
weighted-average structure parallels the empirical approach in the literature on
the local effects of trade, with each term in the numerator reflecting a skill-specific
version of the literature’s weighted-average shocks. Thus, in this model, changes
in local inequality are driven by the difference in weighted average shocks for
skilled and unskilled workers, rather than by standard overall shocks using in-
dustry weights that combine both types of workers. The denominator in (2)
additionally shows that the skill premium depends not only upon the difference
in weighted average price shocks across skill levels, but also reflects the regional
equilibrium feedback effects illustrated in (1), which depend on the initial industry
mix and on the industries’ factor intensities.
  To summarize the empirical content of the model, liberalization differently af-
fects skill premia across regions because workers are imperfectly mobile across
regions, tariff changes vary across industries, regions initially specialize in dif-
ferent sectors, and industries employ skilled and unskilled workers with different
intensities.

                      II.   Context, Data, and Descriptives

  We examine the effects of trade liberalization on regional skill premia in the con-
text of Brazil’s widely studied early 1990s trade liberalization. See Dix-Carneiro
and Kovak (2014) for a detailed description the context and policy changes and
a discussion of the exogeneity of tariff changes to counterfactual industry perfor-
mance. We measure the effect of liberalization using tariff changes from 1990 to
1995, using tariff data from Kume et al. (2003).
  We then calculate regional shocks to the skill premium based on equation (2).
Under a small country assumption, the proportional change in the price faced
by Brazilian producers is given by d ln(1 + τi ), where τi is the tariff rate.7 We
calculate factor cost shares (θT i , θHi , θLi ) using IBGE national accounts data and
the 1991 Census.8 Industry distributions of skilled and unskilled labor in each
region (λHri , λLri ) come from the 1991 Census. We refer to the empirical measure
of the right hand side of (2) as the “differential tariff shock,” as it reflects the
differential effect of tariff cuts on wages for skilled and unskilled workers in the
relevant region.
  Figure 1 panel (a) shows the distribution of differential tariff shocks across
Brazilian microregions.9 Regions are outlined in gray while states are outlined in
black. Note that the vast majority of the population lives in the eastern part of
the country, where regions are geographically smaller. The shocks range from a 4
percent decline to a 0.5 percent increase, and the regional employment-weighted
mean shock is a decline of 0.8 percent. Thus, in most regions trade liberalization
is expected to drive a decline in the skill premium, relative to a no-liberalization
counterfactual. This negative but relatively small magnitude of differential tariff
shocks partly reflects the fact that tariffs in skill-intensive sectors declined more,
although not dramatically so (Gonzaga et al. 2006).
  We measure changes in skill premia using the Brazilian Decennial Census for
1980, 1991, 2000, and 2010, and restrict the sample to employed individuals out-
    7 In Appendix A.2, we show very similar results using effective rates of protection, which account for
changing input and output tariffs.
    8 The specific factor cost shares (θ ) reflect gross operating surplus as a share of total factor costs
                                        Ti
in the 1990 IBGE national accounts. The remaining cost share of labor is divided between skilled and
unskilled labor (θLi and θHi ) based on the industry skilled and unskilled labor wagebills in the 1991
Census.

kets.

side public administration, age 18-64, earning a positive wage, and not enrolled
in school. We define skill as completing high-school or more (11+ years of ed-
ucation).10 Skill premia in each region are calculated using individual-level log
wage regressions, separately for each Census year. We estimate linear returns to
years of education, allowing these returns to vary arbitrarily across regions and
controlling for national returns to various other observable worker characteristics,
including age, sex, and industry. We then use the estimates to calculate the re-
gional gap in predicted wages for an individual with the average number of years
of education for skilled (12.4 years) and unskilled (3.7 years) workers.11

  Table 1 shows descriptive statistics on the regional skill premium in each year,
calculated using both hourly wage and monthly earnings measures, which yield
quite similar results. We weight each region by its 1991 share of national workers

  10 Results for an alternative definition based on college completion appear in Appendix A.3
  11 The  educational composition of the Brazilian labor force changed dramatically over the course of the
1990s and 2000s, even within our skilled and unskilled categories (Menezes-Filho and Tavares 2013). We
use parametric returns to education rather than a more nonparametric approach as in Katz and Murphy
(1992) because we often have no observations for particular education levels in sparsely populated regions.
By evaluating the linear returns to education using the same education levels for skilled and unskilled
workers in all regions and years, we ensure that differences in the estimated skill premium are not driven
by differences in the educational composition of each skill group.
in our sample. In all cases, skilled workers earn much more than unskilled workers
on average. In 1991, skilled workers’ wages were 96 log points higher than those
for unskilled workers on average. The average skill premium remained relatively
steady from 1991 to 2000, with an average increase of only 3 log points. How-
ever, even during this period of relatively constant skill premium, the standard
deviation across regions was quite large, indicating substantial differences in the
skill premium’s evolution in different local markets. Panel (b) of Figure 1 shows
the regional variation in the change in skill premium from 1991 to 2000. The skill
premium fell sharply to 72 log points by 2010, but again there was quite a bit of
variation across regions in the skill premium’s evolution. In the subsequent sec-
tion, we seek to explain this regional variation using the differential tariff shocks
shown in Panel (a) of Figure 1.


               III.   Liberalization’s Effects on Regional Skill Premia


  We now examine the effects of trade liberalization on regional skill premia,
testing the model’s prediction that regions facing more negative differential tariff
shocks experienced larger relative declines in the observed regional skill premium.
We regress the change in regional skill premium on the differential tariff shocks.
Our sample consists of 411 time-consistent microregions.12 Since the dependent
variables are themselves estimates, we weight by the inverse of their standard er-
rors to account for heteroskedasticity. We also calculate cluster-robust standard
errors at the more aggregate mesoregion level to account for potential spatial
correlation in outcomes across neighboring regions.13 We present results for all
workers and for formally employed workers, since Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2014)
find substantial differences in the regional labor market effects of liberalization for
formally and informally employed workers.14 We also present results calculating

   12 We drop the region containing the free trade zone of Manaus, since it was exempt from tariffs and
unaffected by the tariff changes occurring during liberalization.
   13 There are 112 time-consistent mesoregions during our sample period.
   14 Formal employment is defined as having a signed work card. When examining skill premia for
formally employed workers, we construct an alternate version of the differential tariff shock in which

skill premia based on hourly wages and monthly earnings, and for the 1991-2000
and 1991-2010 time periods. In each case, we estimate a simple bivariate regres-
sion and specifications adding state fixed effects and 1980-1991 pre-liberalization
trends in the regional skill premium.

  The results appear in Table 2. The coefficient of 1.297 in column (1) of Panel
A indicates that, on average, regions facing a 1 percentage point more negative
differential tariff shock experienced a 1.3 percentage point larger decline in the
regional skill premium between 1991 and 2000. This is quite close to the coefficient
of 1 that would be observed if the data precisely followed the model in Section I.
Column (2) adds a vector of 26 state fixed effects to account for any state-level
policy changes such as minimum wages that might have affected the skill premium
in that state’s microregions. Column (3) additionally includes a skill premium pre-
trend based on monthly earnings, calculated identically to the dependent variable,
but covering the pre-liberalization 1980-1991 time period.15 This control ensures
that our results are not driven by ongoing trends in regional skill premia that
were already in progress before liberalization.16

λHri and λLri reflect the industry distributions of formally employed workers. See Dix-Carneiro and
Kovak (2014) for a discussion of this approach, justified by the fact that workers are able to transition out
of formal employment relatively easily, but transitioning into formal employment appears quite difficult.
   15 We use monthly earnings rather than hourly wage pre-trends because hours are unavailable in 1980.
   16 Table A1 in Appendix A.2 presents placebo tests relating 1980-1991 changes in regional skill premia
to the differential tariff shocks, showing that the two were not significantly related.
  In all panels and specifications, the point estimates are positive, and many are
significantly different from zero. Only one coefficient (Panel D column (3)) is
significantly different from the model’s predicted value of 1. Results for earnings
tend to be larger and more precisely estimated than those for hourly wages, re-
flecting either adjustment along the hours margin or non-classical measurement
error in hourly wages. Results for formally employed workers are somewhat larger
and more precisely estimated than those for all workers, but are otherwise qual-
itatively similar. There is no distinct time pattern in liberalization’s effects on
regional skill premia; liberalization’s effect is realized by 2000, with no noticeable
increase by 2010. This finding is in contrast to the steadily growing regional for-
mal wage and employment effects of liberalization documented in Dix-Carneiro
and Kovak (2014). Together, the two papers’ results imply that although regions
facing larger tariff declines during liberalization experience steadily deteriorating
relative formal labor market outcomes during the 2000s, outcomes for skilled and
unskilled workers evolve similarly during that time period.
  To get a sense of the economic importance of our results, we examine what
fraction of the realized average change in skill premium can be explained by our
estimates. For each specification, we multiply the coefficient estimate on the dif-
ferential tariff shock by the employment-weighted average shock of -0.008 to yield
the predicted change in skill premium on average.17 We then compare these pre-
dictions to the observed changes in Table 1. As an example, consider columns (3)
and (6) of Table 2 Panel B, which yield predicted skill premium changes of -0.0104
and -0.0210, respectively. From Table 1, the realized change in the earnings-based
skill premium in 1991-2000 was 0.022. In the absence of liberalization, our results
suggest that the average skill premium would have grown by 0.032 during that
period. The realized change in skill premium in 1991-2010 was -0.200, so our
liberalization shocks explain 11 percent of the observed average decline in skill
premium. Performing the same exercise across the other specifications in Table

  17 For   reference, the resulting predictions appear in Appendix Table A3.

2, the differential tariff shocks can explain at most 14 percent of the 1991-2010
decline in skill premium. Hence, although liberalization had a statistically signif-
icant effect on the evolution of the skill premium, our mechanism explains only a
modest portion of the aggregate decline.

                                                                                                                                                                                        IV.                                 Conclusion


  We develop a specific-factors model of regional economies that includes two
types of workers, skilled and unskilled, who are complementary with specific fac-
tors and with each other, and are mobile across industries within a region. The
model delivers a simple equation relating trade-induced local shocks to changes
in local skill premia. We apply the methodology to Brazilian data to explore
the country’s early 1990s trade liberalization. We find statistically significant
but modest effects of trade liberalization on the evolution of the skill premium
in Brazil between 1991 and 2010. The methodology uses widely available house-
hold survey data and can easily be applied to other countries and liberalization
episodes.

                                        1.       Model Solution


   The national economy consists of many regions, r, each of which may produce
goods in many industries, i. Goods are produced using three factors. Each region
is endowed with a vector of industry-specific factors, Tri . Skilled labor, Hr , and
unskilled labor, Lr , are both costlessly mobile across industries within region.
Total factor supplies are fixed in each region. Production is Cobb-Douglas, and
factor shares θT i , θLi , and θHi may vary across industries, subject to θT i + θLi +
θHi = 1. Goods and factor markets are competitive. Producers in all regions face
the same national vector of liberalization-induced price changes P̂i .
   Suppress regional subscripts on all terms, and let aT i , aLi and aHi be the
respective quantities of specific factor, unskilled labor, and skilled labor used to
produce one unit of industry i output. Letting Yi be output in each industry, the
factor market clearing conditions are

(A1)                                     aT i Yi = Ti      ∀i,

                                         X
(A2)                                              aLi Yi = L,
                                             i


                                         X
(A3)                                              aHi Yi = H.
                                             i

Holding regional factor supplies constant and letting hats represent proportional
changes, such that x̂ ≡ d ln x, factor market clearing implies the following.
                               X
(A4)                               λLi (âLi − âT i ) = 0

where λLi and λHi are the share of regional employment in industry i for unskilled
and skilled labor, respectively. Cost minimization with Cobb-Douglas production
implies

(A6)                          âLi − âT i = R̂i − ŵ             ∀i,


(A7)                          âHi − âT i = R̂i − ŝ             ∀i,
where Ri , w, and s are the respective wages of specific factors, unskilled labor,
and skilled labor. Combining these with the factor market clearing conditions in
(A4) and (A5), we have
                              X
(A8)                             λLi (R̂i − ŵ) = 0,
                                 i

(A9)                                  λHi (R̂i − ŝ) = 0.
                                  i

Zero profits implies

(A10)                     θLi ŵ + θHi ŝ + θT i R̂i = P̂i   ∀i.

We can then express the equilibrium factor market clearing and zero profit con-
ditions in (A8), (A9), and (A10) in matrix form.

To solve this system for the change in skill premium, first rewrite it in more
compact matrix notation.

This expression is still difficult to interpret, though the numerator resembles
the difference in weighted-average price shocks for skilled and unskilled weights.
However the sums involving P̂i have weights that do not sum to 1, so we divide
through by the sum of the weights, and define
                                            λLi                         λHi

which is equation (2) in the main text.


  It is instructive to return to the equilibrium system in (A11). The top portion
of the system can be expressed as
                                              
(A20)                        R̂ = Θ−1 P̂ − θ ŵ ,

while the bottom portion implies

(A21)                               ŵ = λ0 R̂.

Substituting out R̂ and simplifying the matrix operations yields the following
system of equations.

   Table A1 estimates pre-liberalization placebo regressions, using the 1980-1991
change in regional skill premium as the dependent variable while maintaining
the same independent variable as in Table 2, the differential tariff shock. Since
the 1980 Census is missing information on hours, we can only calculate pre-
liberalization skill premium trends for earnings. In all cases pre-existing trends in
the regional skill premium were not significantly related to the differential tariff
shocks.

Note: Dependent variable is the proportional change in regional skill premium from 1980 to 1991, cal-
culated as described in the text. Independent variable is the differential tariff shock for skilled and
unskilled workers, defined in (2). Worker skill defined as having completed 11 or more or 15 or more
years of education, as listed in the column titles. 411 microregion observations when including all work-
ers in the sample. 338 microregion observations when including only formally employed workers, those
with a signed work card. Observations weighted by the inverse of the squared standard error of the
estimated proportional change in regional skill premium. Standard errors (in parentheses) adjusted for
112 mesoregion clusters. *** Significant at the 1 percent, ** 5 percent, * 10 percent level.
  Table A2 shows liberalization’s effect on regional skill premia using an alternate
measure of the differential trade shock based upon changes in the effective rate
of protection rather than nominal tariffs. Effective rates of protection also come
from Kume et al. (2003). The coefficients are quite similar to those for nominal
tariffs in Table 2, though the scale is somewhat smaller. This feature results from
the fact that changes in effective rates of protection span a wider range than
changes in nominal tariffs, such that the regression coefficients are scaled down
proportionately.

Note: Dependent variable is the proportional change in regional skill premium from 1991 to the year
listed, calculated as described in the text. Independent variable is the differential tariff shock for skilled
and unskilled workers, defined in (2), and using the effective rate of protection as the tariff measure.
Worker skill defined as having completed 11 or more years of education. 411 microregion observations
when including all workers in the sample. 338 microregion observations when including only formally
employed workers, those with a signed work card. Skill premium pre-trends calculated for 1980-1991
period based on monthly earnings. Observations weighted by the inverse of the squared standard error of
the estimated proportional change in regional skill premium. Standard errors (in parentheses) adjusted
for 112 mesoregion clusters. *** Significant at the 1 percent, ** 5 percent, * 10 percent level.
   Table A3 shows the predicted changes in the skill premium resulting from trade
liberalization, as described in Section III. Each prediction applies to the corre-
sponding entry in Table 2.

                                  3.    Alternate Skill Definition

  In the main text, we define skill as having completed high school, i.e. com-
pleting 11 or more years of education. Here, we present results for an alternate
skill definition of having completed college, i.e. completing 15 or more years of
education. We again evaluate the returns to education using the average number
of years of education for skilled (15.4 years) and unskilled (4.7 years) workers.
Table A4 presents summary statistics for the skill premium calculated using this
approach. Not surprisingly, the returns to skill are higher when using the college
definition of skill rather than the high school definition, as in Table 1. Otherwise,
the results are quite similar, with roughly constant average returns to skill in the
1990s and a sharp decline in the 2000s, and substantial regional heterogeneity in
skill premium growth during both time periods.

workers in Panels A and B are very similar to those using the high-school skill
definition. There are a few specifications for the formally employed sample in
Panels C and D that differ substantially from Table 2. This likely results from
the fact that many regions have few individuals with a college education or more,
and restricting attention to formally employed workers further limits that sample.

Note: Dependent variable is the proportional change in regional skill premium from 1991 to the year
listed, calculated as described in the text. Independent variable is the differential tariff shock for skilled
and unskilled workers, defined in (2). Worker skill defined as having completed 15 or more years of
education. 411 microregion observations when including all workers in the sample. 338 microregion ob-
servations when including only formally employed workers, those with a signed work card. Skill premium
pre-trends calculated for 1980-1991 period based on monthly earnings. Observations weighted by the
inverse of the squared standard error of the estimated proportional change in regional skill premium.
Standard errors (in parentheses) adjusted for 112 mesoregion clusters. *** Significant at the 1 percent,
** 5 percent, * 10 percent level.
   Table A6 calculates predicted changes in the skill premium resulting from trade
liberalization, as described in Section III. Each prediction applies to the corre-
sponding entry in Table A5. Note that the employment-weighted average shock
is -0.003 when calculated for formal sector workers. As an example, consider
columns (3) and (6) of Panel B, which yield predicted skill premium changes
of -0.0043 and -0.0100, respectively. From Table A4, the realized change in the
earnings-based skill premium in 1991-2000 was 0.028. In the absence of liberal-
ization, our results suggest that the average skill premium would have grown by
0.032 during that period. The realized change in skill premium in 1991-2010 was
-0.245, so our liberalization shocks explain 4.1 percent of the observed average
decline in skill premium.
