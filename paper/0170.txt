                    The Austrian Theory of the Marginal Use
                        and of Ordinal Marginal Utility


                              J. Huston McCulloch



          The Austrian theory of the "marginal use" is restated and extended.

    It is found that the Austrian concept of marginal utility (as derived from

    the marginal use) is not dependent on cardinal utility, and indeed is

    consistent with "intrinsically ordinal" utility. In this system, diminishing

    (ordinal) marginal utility is an implication of rational choice, rather

    than an assumption. Examples of the rank—ordering on commodity space, derived

    from the underlying rank ordering on want—set space in conjunction with the

    technological relationship between goods and wants, are given in the cases

    of independent, rival, and complementary goods. In each case the derived

    commodity preferences are quasi—concave, which suggests that the Hicksian

    assumption of quasi—concavity is superfluous. In each case, the Auspitz and

    Lieben—Edgeworth—Pareto criterion for net coniplenientarity or rivalness emerges.

    It is shown that while a negative cross substitution elasticity is not a

    necessary condition for net complementarity, it is a sufficient condition

    under not very restrictive conditions.




I
INTRODUCT ION


      The Austrian theory of the marginal use and of ordinal marginal

utility has not slood still since its original development in the hands of

Menger, Wieser, and Böhm—Bawerk. Over the past hundred years, it has moved

far beyond their statement of it, even though this movement sometimes pro-

ceeded at a rather leisurely pace.

      This paper brings the old theory up to date. We do this by restating

it, insisting on a new English translation for one of its most important

technical terms. We call attention to two crucial assumptions which were

implicit in the old theory, but which were never stated explicitly until the

past decade. We point out that a recent mathematical finding implies that the

Austrian marginal utility concept is not just ordinal, but in a sense is

"intrinsically ordinal."

      The restated theory has many important implications for the structure

of preferences over commodities, implications which do not follow from the

Jevonian, Walrasian, or Hicksian traditions. The theory indicates that

preferences over commodities are indeed quasi—concave (as Hicks and Allen

merely assume), that marginal utility does diminish, even in an ordinalist

framework, and that rival and complementary interactions between goods do

lead to the Auspitz and Lieben—Edgeworth—pareto criterion.   From this cri-

terion we are then able to deduce that a negative cross substitution

elasticity, while not a necessary condition for net complementarity, is

a sufficient condition when there are three non—inferior goods, provided the

third good is on net independent of the two under consideration.

WANTS   AND UTILITY
                                                                                  .
        What distinguishes the Austrian approach from that of Jevons or

Walras is that the Austrians did not accept the utility or subjective

value of commodities as a given, but rather derived it from the importance

of the wants (sometimes translated as "needs") that the goods can be used

to satisfy. Nenger described this relation as follows:

        Value is therefore nothing inherent in goods, no property of them,
        but merely the importance that we attribute to the satisfaction
        of our needs, that is, to our lives and well—being, and in con-
        sequence carry over to economic goods as the exclusive causes of
        the satisfaction of our needs. (1950, 116)

The starting point for inferences about the subjective importance of goods

is a subjective rank—ordering of the set of all wants which arranges them

in the order of their importance to the individual. According to Böhm—Bawerk,

        It is a matter of common knowledge that our wants vary widely
        in importance       [lit is possible to construct a progression or
        graduated scale of wants in point of importance. That scale will
        of course vary from person to person because their varying physical
        and intellectual propensities, amount of education, and the like
        will result in widely varying wants. Even the same individual will
        vary widely in his wants at different times. And yet every practical
        economizing person, if he is to make a wise choice in the application
        of his limited means will have his scale of wants more or less clearly
        in mind. (1959 II, 137)

Given this scale, if we can determine which want is dependent upon the

possession of a certain good, we may ascribe the importance of that want to

the good. Thus, the utility of a good will essentially be a position on this

scale of wants.'


      1Böhm—Bawerk pointed out that "The expression ['the ranking of wants']
may mean the rank and order of categories of wants [BedUrfnisgattungen], or
may mean concrete wants [konkreten Budurfnisse], that is to say, the individual
feelings of want." (1959 II, p. 137, and 1909 A, p. 237) He went on to make
it explicit that he had in mind a ranking on concrete wants. Thus, we are
to enter nothing so general as "the want for food" in the scale of wants, but
are to break wants down into specific uses for each portion and type of food.

THE DEPENDENT WANT AND THE IMPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS.


        The Austrian determination of the dependent want that determines

value, as given In the classic expositions of Menger's farmer and Böhm—Bawerk's

hunter, runs essentially as follows: Suppose there are three wants, a, b,

and c, any one of which can be satisfied by a unit of a certain good, and

that the Indivual prefers a to b and b to c. We represent these preferences

by a b f c,       using the symbol }   rather than > , in   order to emphasize

that this is a preference ordering rather than a numerical inequality.

Obviously if the individual has only one unit of the good he will use it to

satisfy want a, if he has two units, he will satisfy wants a and b, and if he

has three units he will satisfy all three wants. Therefore the value of the

first unit is the importance of want a, the value of the second unit is the

importance of want b, the value of the third unit is the importance of want c,

and any additional units are worthless unless the individual can come up with

more wants the good can be used to satisfy.

        This conclusion may be obvious, but it is not really warranted, given

only the traditional rank—ordering on wants. It is true that If the individual

has only one unit he will, by assumption, use it to satisfy want a. However,

if he has two units, he may satisfy any two wants, that is, he may choose from

a and b, and a and c, and b and c. In fact, if he feels like it, he may

satisfy only one want, a, b, c, or for that matter, he may satisfy no wants

at all if he is so inclined. If W is the set of all wants, in this case

W =   {a,   b, c}, then with two units he may choose from any subset of W with

two or fewer elements. In order to infer which subset he will choose, we
                                         —4—


                                                                                                  .
must be given a preference ordering not just on W, but on W*, the set of

all subsets of W: W" = {P!PCW}.          In our example, W*             {'Ø,{a},{b},{c},{a, b},

{a, c},{b, c},{a, b, c}}, where "0" is the empty set, the subset of W which

corresponds to the satisfaction of no wants at all. To eliminate

unnecessary clutter, we will omit the braces and coimnas from the designation

of elements of W*, so that W* = {Ø, a, b, c, ab, ac, bc, abc}. If W is
                                       n                        3
finite and has n elements, then W* has 2 elements, in this case 2 = 8.

The first implicit assumption that the Austrians made is therefore that the

individual's preferences define a linear ordering on W , such that an

individual with a quantity of some good or goods will use these goods to

satisfy the highest rated subset which is feasible, given the supply. This

implicit assumption was noted by Georgescu—Roegen (1968, 251), and was also

independently discovered by Young (1969) and the present author at about the

same time.

      And the traditional Austrian formulation makes a second implicit

assumption, which somehow implies that if a b c and all are "desirable"

so that a b } c   0, then it is ab that will be the highest rated subject

with two or fewer elements. An article by the later Austrian—school economist

Bi1imovi (1934, esp. p. 183) provides a clue to what they had in mind.

He argues in effect that b c would imply ab ac, that a b would imply

ac bc, and that c 0 would imply ac a. These inferences, together with

the transitivity of the ordering on W*, imply ab ac bc and ab ac a b c 0,

so that ab is indeed the highest feasible subset when two units are available.

Bi1imovi argues as if these inferences were valid deductions from a rank—

ordering on W, but that is not the case unless we assume that if an additional

                                                                                                  .
                                    —5—



want or set or set of wants is "added" to both sides of a relationship,

the elements of the additional set not being contained in either of the

sets involved in the original relationship, then the relationship remains

undisturbed. We will call this property "additivity," following the

terminology of Kraft et al. (1959, 408). Formally defined, a set of subsets

W' is additively ordered if for any two subsets P and Q of W, we have P Q

if and only if P —   Q   Q — P.   In economics, this assumption was first made

explicit by Young (1969) and by the present author, working independently

at about the same time.

      Additivity is illustrated in the Venn diagram of Figure 1. The

two circles circles P and Q represent subsets of the universal set W. The

set difference P—Q is the set of all wants in P but not in Q, and Q—P is

the set of all wants in Q but not in P. The intersection PflQ is the set of all

wants in both P and Q.The additivity assumption states that P1\Q, the wants

P and Q have in common, are irrelevant to the relative ordering of P and Q.

All that matters is the relative importance of P—Q and Q—P, the wants P and Q

do not have in common.



THE LAW OF THE MARGINAL USE


      Given that W* is additively ordered and that abc).O, it follows that

an individual in possession of one unit of our good will use it to

satisfy want a, that the use of two units would be the satisfaction of wants

a and b, and that the use of three or more units will be the satisfaction of

all three wants. Hence, if the individual has only one unit, the use which

depends on possession of the last unit will be a, and therefore the value

or utility of one loaf will be that of a, that is, the place of the set

containing only a in the rank—ordering of W*. If he has two units, the

use dependent on either of these units will be the satisfaction of b, the

less important of the two uses covered by two units, and hence the utility

of one unit will be the position of b on the scale. And if he has three

units, the dependent use is the satisfaction of c, the least important of

the three uses covered by three units, and hence the utility of the third

unit will be the position of c on the scale.

     Menger had no name for this use which determines utility, but Weiser

proposed one which was subsequently adopted by B5hm—Bawerk:

     I will henceforth refer to that use of a good which is
     decisive for the value of a single unit of that good as
     the economically marginal use, or simply as the marginal
     use, since it stands at the margin of the economically
     permissible employments.... It will be shown that in every
     instance in which we are concerned with the value of a single
     unit which is part of a supply of a good, the marginal use
     determines the magnitude of the value. Economic value is
     marginal value.1

If P is the set of wants that will be satisfied by n units and P    the set
    n                                                           n-l

            werde im Folgenden den für den Werth der GUtereinheit entscheidenden
Giternutzen, well er an den Grenze der wirthschaftlich zugelassenen Verwendungen
steht, den wirthschaftlichen Grenznutzen oder auch kurzweg den Grenznutzen
nennen (vergl. die AusdrUcke "final degree of utility" und "terminal utility"
bei Jevons). Es wird sich zeigen, dass in allen Verhältnlssen, in denen es
sich urn den Werth der einzelnen, einen Vorrath bildenden Guter handelt, der
Grenznutzen den Ausschlag für die Groee des Werthes giebt. Der wirtschaftliche
Werth 1st Grenzwerth." (Wieser 1884, 128) Although Wieser invites his reader
to compare his Grenznutzen to Jevon's Final Utility, "Nutzen" and'Verwendung"
can mean "utility" only in the common English sense of the word, "usefulness,"
and cannot refer to the economist's "utility," which, as Jevons (193l,xxxiv)
and Wieser himself five years later (1889, 26n.) confirmed, corresponds to
the Austrians' Wert. Wieser's term "Grenzwerth" does, however, correspond
roughly to "marginal utility." Our choice of "marginal use" for"Grenznutzen"
Is discussed below.
                                     —8—



 that   will be satisfied by n—i units, then the set difference P — P
                                                                                      .
                                                                n     n-l
will be the dependent set of wants or the marginal use of the nth unit.

If the individual has n units of the good, "the marginal use of one unit"

is somewhat ambiguous, since it can refer either to the marginal use of the

last (nth) unit or the marginal use of one additional (the n+lst) unit. When nec-

 essary, the former may be reJEerred t as the inner marginal use and the latter as the

outer marginal use. The Austrians' Law of the Marginal Use, then, which

does not appear in the English literature, is that the value or utility

of a goods—increment is determined by the position of its marginal use on the

scale of sets of wants. A generalized proof of this theorem is given by

McCulloch and Smith (1975).

        Weiser's Grenzwerth or marginal value is the closest term the Austrians

had to "marginal utility."1 It corresponds exactly to Bernardelli's "conditional

utility" (1938). Thus, it makes sense in their framework to speak of the

(marginal) value of two units of a good, which is determined by the marginal

use of two units, in turn the satisfaction of the two least important wants

covered by the total supply. Because the Austrians thought in terms of

realistic discretely divisible goods instead of hypothetical continuously

divisible goods, their "value" corresponds to a non—infinitessimal increment.

When only a single unit is at stake, their "value" can be thought of as

"marginal utility," provided a distinction is kept in mind between outer

marginal utility, corresponding to the outer marginal use, and inner marginal

utility, corresponding to the inner marginal use.

        Wieser turns the law of the marginal use about to get what might be called

        1Alt's concept of Grenzwert (1936, 163) has no relation to Wieser's.
                                 -9—




a "law of marginal utility," which determines which uses are permissible and

which are not:

      Each desire whose importance lies above or Is equal to the [marginal]
      value will be permitted, each whose importance lies below it will
      be rejected. All economically permissible employments will be included
      by the marginal value [Grenzwerthl, and all impermissible ones
      excluded. (1884, 136, my trans.)


THE LAW OF DIMINISHING MARGINAL UTILITY


      An immediate consequence of the Law of the Marginal Use is the fact

that if we have a greater quantity of a good, the dependent want will have a

lower rank on the scale, and therefore the (marginal) utility of one unit will

be lower. As Menger put it,

      If a quantity of goods stands opposite needs of varying importance
      to men, they will first satisfy, or provide for, those needs whose
      satisfaction has the greatest importance to them.   If there are any
      goods remaining, they will direct them to the satisfaction of needs
      that are next In degree of importance to those already satisfied.
      Any further remainder will be applied to the satisfaction of needs
      that come next in degree of importance. (1950, 151)

When Menger here says that the most important wants will be satisfied first,

he of course means first logically (i.e. economically), and not necessarily

chronologically. Thus, although Böhm-Bawerk's famous hunter will always feed

himself (satisfy want a) "first," if he has two loaves of bread available

he may in fact give one to his dog (satisfying want b) before he actually takes

a bite of his own loaf.

      If the marginal uses decline in importance as the available quantity

increases, and it Is the importance of the marginal use which determines

marginal utility, then marginal utility must decrease as the available quantity

Increases. To illustrate this Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, let us
                                   —10—



suppose that there is one good, "X," and that there are four wants, a, b, c

and d that can be satisfied by a unit of X. (An imaginative individual might

be able to think up an Infinite number of wants he would like to satisfy

with a certain commodity. For the sake of brevity, however, we will restrict

our examples to finite cases.) An additive ranking of W* which could describe

an individual's subjective preferences is given in Table 1. The sixteen

positions on this scale have been numbered from "0th" to "15th," startIng

with the lowest position and proceeding up to the highest. These numbers

comprise an ordinal utility index, where each number designates a certain

utility level. These utility indices are not meant to mean that the twelfth

utility level is in any sense "twice" as high as the sixth level, or that the

utility of the tenth level equals that of the third level "plus" that of the

seventh level. The indices simply give us a convenient method of referring

to higher or lower positions on the scale. It seems appropriate to give the

empty set 0   (the set with no elements) the eroeth position, though It could
just as logically be assigned the ninety—seventh, or any other position.

        If an individual has n units of X, additivity implies his use of them

will be to satisfy the n most Important wants, as Indicated in Table 2. The

utility level of this total use naturally increases with X, as long as we have

additional "desirable" wants (that is, ones that are preferred to the empty

set).

        The marginal use of one unit of X for different quantities is shown in

Table 3, along with the utility of this use, which in turn is the marginal

utility of a unit of the good. The marginal utility of one additional unit

is found to decline from fifth to third to second to first to zeroeth as X

increases from 0 to 4.

                                                                                       .
      Notice     that the marginal utility is not the arithmetic difference in

the utility level. Rather, the Austrian concept of marginal utility is

the utility level of the set difference of the respective uses. When von

Mises insists, "There are in the sphere of values and valuations no arith-

metical operations; there is no such thing as a calculation of values,"

(1963, 122) he has therefore only gotten at half the truth, for there are,

we argue, set operations implicit in the Austrian utility analysis. Since

the algebra of set manipulation is only a formalization of elementary categories

of logic and since it has only recently come into fashion to use set notation,

even in mathematics it is understandable that the Austrians did not make

these operations explicit, and in fact, were probably not even consciously

aware that they were using them.

      The Austrian principle of diminishing ordinal marginal utility points up

the substantial difference between the Austrian theory of utility and the

theory of utility as it has grown up in the English language literature.

Hicks tells us that if we reject cardinal utility and purge our analysis of

      all concepts which are tainted by quantitative utility      the first
      vicfm iust be marginal utility itself. If total utility is arbitrary
      so is margina1 uti1ity.... The second victim (a more serious one this
      time) must be the principle of Diminishing Marginal Utility. If
      marginal utility has no exact sense, diminishing marginal utility can
      have no exact sense either. (1946, 19—20)

Yet the Austrians had an ordinal concept of utility in which marginal utility

does have a meaning, and furthermore, their marginal utility does diminish.

For example, in Table 1 we could square each of the ordinal utility index
                                                    2            2
values so that from the top down they read 15 =         225th, 14 = 196th,   etc.

The marginal utilities in Table 3 would still decline, from 25th to 9th to

 4th to   1st   to 0th. The   Austrian   law of diminishing marginal utility is thus
                                    —13—



invulnerable to monotonic transformations of the utility index.


THE UTILITY OF TWO INDEPENDENT GOODS


      Let us suppose that there are two kinds of goods, X and Y, and that one

unit of X will satisfy want a, c or e, and that one unit of Y will satisfy

b or d. We then have W =   {a,   b, c, d, e}.

      A conceivable additive preference ordering of W' is shown in Table 4,

along with an ordinal utility index Identifying the positions on the scale

from zeroth to thirty—first. If an individual with the preferences of Table

4 has m units of X and n units of Y, additivity obviously implies that he will

use them to satisfy the m most important elements of the set {a, c, e}, and

the n most important elements of the set {b, d}. Table 5 shows the optimal

use which would be made of various combinations of X and Y and the respective

utility levels. These utility levels imply a derived preference ordering on

the commodity bundles. In Table 6 the commodity bundles are arranged In

decreasing order of utility. Table 7 lays out the total use and total utility

of these bundles In two—dimensional tabular form. In Figure 2 the horizontal

axis represents units of X and the vertical axis units of Y. Lines have been

drawn on this graph corresponding to different utility levels. These lines

have the property that any point below and to the left of the line has a

utility level lower than that corresponding to that of the line, while all

points on the line have exactly this utility, and all points above and to

the right have at least this utility. Our lines roughly correspond to the

"indifference curves" of conventional utility theory. The only difference

is   that our commodities are "lumpy," rather than infinitely divisible, and
                                                                                .
therefore the lines usually go through only one point. The reader may, if

he likes, think of these lines as "preference curves."

       Table 8 shows the marginal use and marginal utility of one unit of X

as the total quantities of X and Y vary. Table 9 shows the marginal use and

marginal utility of one unit of Y. The marginal utility of X is found to

diminish from 9th to 4th to 1st to 0th as X increases from 1 to 4, regardless

of the quantity of Y available. Similarly, the marginal utility of Y dim-

inishes from 5th to 2nd to 0th, regardless of the quantity of X available. It

could not be otherwise in this case, for the quantity of one good has no

bearing on the use that will be made of the other, and therefore no effect

on the marginal use. We may therefore state as a general rule that when X

and Y are independent in consumption, i.e., when W may be partitioned into

two categories of wants such that a unit of X and only a unit of X will

satisfy the wants in one category, and a unit of Y and only a unit of Y will

satisfy the wants in the other category, the marginal utility of one good

will be independent of the quantity available of the other.'

       It should be noted that when there is only one good, the concept of

marginal utility has no operational significance. So what if a unit of a

good has a certain desirability, if there Is nothing to compare it to? But

when there is more than one good, we have the seemingly trivial but actually

important rule, that if an individual is offered a choice between a unit of



      1Strotz's concept of a "utility tree" [1957] is undoubtedly related to
independence of the goods in question. The exact connection deserves to be
explained in greater detail.

ne good or a unit of another, he will always choose the one with the

higher marginal utility, as determined by the marginal use.


THE AUSTRIAN RESOLUTION OF THE PARADOX OF VALUE


         Before the Austrians came on the scene, economists were troubled by the

so—called paradox of value. As Adam Smith expressed it,

         The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little
         or no value in exchange; and on the contrary, those which have the
         greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use.
         Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce any
         thing; scarce any thing can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on
         the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity
         of other goods may frequently be had for it. (1776/1937, 28)

         The Austrians made this paradox a central part of their theory. According

to Böhm—Bawerk,

         This unquestionably astonishing phenomenon became a troublesome bone
         of contention for the theory of value. Supreme utility [Nutzen: utility
         in the sense of "usefulness"] and minimal value —— what a strange
         paradox! .. . . It is therefore not difficult to understand that from
         the days of Adam Smith down to our own numberless theorists have des-
         paired completely of finding the essence and the measure of value in
         a relation to human welfare.1

         The alternate theories that did spring up, theories based on labor or

on costs, had, according to the Austrians, grossly erroneous implications for

the interpretation of economic phenomena. They argued that, if rightly

qualified, the value of a good is in fact determined by the importance of

its usefulness. In Weiser's words, or rather in our translation of Wieser's

words,

         For most goods a distinction must be made between the magnitude of their
         value [ihres Werthes] and the magnitude of their use [ihres Nutzens].
         Only for those goods that are actually employed to bring about the
         marginal use—performance will the good's own use be the source of its

      1Bbhm—Bawerk (1959 I, 135-6 and 1909 A, 234). Note however that Lindgren
(1976) puts a completely different interpretation on Smith's meaning.
                                —18—



     value and will there be agreement between the two judgments. For
     any other good a different use, which must nevertheless be a use
     characteristic of that sort of, good, will be the basis for the
     estimate of its value, which accordingly will differ from the estimate
     of the use—effect it actually brings about; for such a good, the
     actual use is higher than the dependent use and therefore higher
     than its value)-

     -To illustrate the paradox and its resolution, let us look again at

the individual of Tables 4 through 9. Suppose he has 3X and 2Y. The total

use of X (ace, twenty—first position) is more important that the total use

of Y (bd, tenth position). Furthermore, the highest use of X (a, ninth

position) is more important than the highest use of Y (b, fifth position).

Yet the subjective value, the utility, of a unit of X, even of the very unit

that will satisfy want a, is lower (first position) thati the utility of a

unit of Y (second position). The Austrians' answer to this paradox is that

the value of a unit of a good is determined, not by the total use of goods

of that sort, and not necessarily even by its own use, but rather by its

marginal use. Goods do not obtain value from the labor they "contain.t'

Rather, labor derives its value from use—value of the goods it is used to

produce.

      In the example given above, it was assumed that the two goods were used



      "Es muss bei den ineisten Glitern em TJnderschied zwischen der Grö8e

independently of one another. However, the law of the marginal use is

also applicable if the goods must be used together to satisfy some wants

or if they can be utilized in place of one another.

      Suppose there are two goods, X and Y, and that a unit of either may

be used to satisfy some want or wants, say c. Let there be other wants, a

and e, which a unit of X can satisfy, and still others, b and d, which may

be satisfied by a unit of Y. X and Y are then rivals, at least with respect

to want c.

      Let an individual preference—rank the subsets of W =   fa,   b, c, d, e}

as shown in Table 10. For various combinations of X and Y, Table 11 shows the

wants X will be used to satisfy, the wants Y will be used to satisfy, the

collective use of X and Y, and the corresponding total utility. Want c is

sometimes satisfied by X and sometimes by Y. Table 12 shows the implied

preference ordering on the commodity space. (Note that this ordering is

now only semi—linear; it sometimes happens that two different commodity

bundles have the same utility.) Tables 13—15 and Figure 3 are constructed in

the same manner as Tables 7—9 and Figure 2.

      As in the case of independent goods, the marginal utility of each good

decreases with its own quantity. However, three phenomena in Tables 14 and

15 are different from the case of independent goods and are worthy of note.

First, the marginal utility of one good is not independent of the quantity

of the other good available. For example, the marginal utility of the second

unit of X falls from the third to the second to the first position as Y

increases from 1 to 3. Similarly, the marginal utility of the third unit of

Y falls from second to first to zeroeth as X increases from 1 to 3. Thus,

when goods are rivals in consupion, the marginal uti1ityf one good tends

to fall off as the quantity of the o the rinrea.

        Second, it sometimes happens that the marginal use of one good is the

satisfaciion of a want which that good cannot itself satisfy. For instance,

when the individual has (lx, 2Y), the marginal use of one additional X is

d, a want that can only be satisfied by Y. When he has (2X, 2Y), the marginal use

of one more Y is e, a want that can only be satisfied by X. Thus Wieser's

assertion above (p. 18), that the marginal use must be a use characteristic

of the good in question, is not always true.

        And third, when goods are rivals, it often happens that their marginal

uses coincide. Thus, when (lx, 1Y) is available, the outer marginal use of

both X and Y is the satisfaction of want e. When (2X, 2Y) is available, the

 outer marginal use of both X and Y is the satisfaction of want e.


 COMPLEMENTARY GOODS


         Böhm—Bawerk attributes the origin of the expression "complementary

 goods" to Menger:

             It frequently occurs that the cooperation of several goods is
         required for the achievement of an economic use, in such a manner
         that if one of the goods was lacking, the use could be achieved not
         at all or only incompletely. We designate goods whose useful services
         thus supplement one another, "complementary goods" [komplementäre
         Giiter], following the precedent of Menger. As examples of complement-
         ary goods we have paper, pen and ink, needle and thread, horse and
         wagon, bow and arrow, the two shoes or gloves that make up a pair,
         and the like. (1909 A, 276, my trans.)

         Although the Austrians frequently gave examples of complementary

 production goods, which combine to produce a material product which in

 turn satisfies wants, it is not hard to think of complementary goods which

                                                                                    .
                                  —23—



satisfy wants directly, such as an hour or two of one's leisure time and

a ticket to a play. We will therefore illustrate with an example of

complementarity in consumption.

      Let there be two goods, X and Y, and suppose that one unit of each is

required to satisfy some want, b. Let both goods have alternative uses in

which they are not complements: a and d for X, and c and e for Y. Table

16 shows an additive ranking of W* which might reflect an individual's prefer-

ences. For various combinations of X and Y, Table 17 shows the best use that

can be made of the combination if the satisfaction of b is excluded, the best

use if b is included, and the utilities or subjective values of both these

uses. The best overall use is the better of these two and is shown with its

utility, the derived utility of the combination, in the last two columns.

      When we try to derive the marginal uses of X and Y from Table 18, we

encounter a new difficulty. For instance when our individual has (2X, 1Y) we

find that there is not a simple want dependent on the possession of another

unit of X. Rather, an additional unit of X enables him to replace want c

with the higher rated want b. We represent this sort of marginal use by the

ordered pair (b, c), where the first entry (b) represents the additional want

satisfied and the second entry (c) represents the want (if any) whose satis-

faction is omitted. Clearly in this case, the unit of X will have higher

utility to the individual, the more important b is, and the less important

c is. Menger carelessly describes such a utility as the difference between

the utility of b and the utility of c, without telling us what we are to make

of this concept:

              the value of a concrete quantity of a good of higher order
      [or of a good which is complementary in consumption in our example]
      is equal to the difference in importance between the satisfactions
      that can be attained when we have command of the given quantity of
                                     —24—

        the good of higher order whose value we wish to determine and the
        satisfactions that would be attained if we did not have this quantity
        at our command." (1950, 165)

        However, by extending the concept of additivity, we are able to place

such "differences" accurately enough for our needs without resorting to

cardinality. From Table 16, we have b       cd. If we "delete" c from both

sides of this relation, we obtain (b,c)        d (second utility level).

Similarly, since b                                 e (first utility level).

Therefore (b,c) is intermediate between the first and second positions.

In Table 19 we have indicated this by arbitrarily giving it the "1.5th" position.

As with a Dewey decimal classification, this is not intended to mean that it

is half way between the first and second positions, but merely that it is

somewhere in between them.

        The marginal use of the second unit of X, given 2Y, is (b,e). This use

is not so easy to place on the scale of wants. By comparison to c it can be

shown to be higher than the third position. To find an upper bound is more

difficult. Because ae      be, we have (a,c)     (b,e). Furthermore, cde       a implies

de      (a,c). Therefore, (b,e)   de (fourth position). Since (b,e) lies

between the third and fourth position, we assign it the "3.5th" position

of Table 16.

        The marginal utility of the second unit of Y, given 2X, is the importance

of replacing the satisfaction of d with that of b, or of (b,d) in our notation.

This use presumably has the same relation to (b,c) that bc has to bd. Therefore

(b,d)     (b,c) (1.5th position).The reader may confirm that (b,d)         (c,e)   d

(second position). We therefore assign (b,d) the "1.7th"utility level.'

      1The problems that arise when we introduce complementarity indicate that
W* does not contain all of the "uses" of interest. We must consider a more
complicated set, say W**, the set of all ordered pairs of disjoint subsets
of W. Given (P, Q) in W**, P is to be interpreted as the additional wants
                                                                (continued)
                                      —27—




        It   is still true that the marginal utility of either good always falls

as its own quantity increases. When we have 2 units of Y, the marginal

utility of a unit of X falls from 9th to 3.5th to 2nd, and finally to 0th.

When we have 2X, the marginal utility of Y falls from 3rd to 1.7th to 1st, and

then to 0th.

        Furthermore, we note that with complements, we get exactly the opposite

of what happens with rival goods: as the quantity of one good increases, the

marginal utility of the other tends to increase, instead of decrease as was

the case with competitors. For instance, when there are 2X available, the

marginal utility of another unit of X rises from 0th to 1.5th to 2nd as Y

increases from 0 to 2.


NET RIVALS AND COMPLEMENTS: ThE ALEP CRITERION


        Rivalness and complementarity are not mutually exclusive concepts.
Two goods may be     rivals with respect to one want and complements with respect

to another. Or using them as complements in one proportion may be rival with

using   them in another proportion,   as in the case of production under variable

proportions.

        Since when rivalness is the only interaction,   the marginal utility

of   one good falls as the quantity of the other increases, and since the

        1 (cont'd) that are to be satisfied, and Q the wants whose satisfaction
is to be omitted. W** then contains all marginal uses, in the broad sense
that we need for complementarity (and jointness). It appears that the linear
ordering on W*, together with our extended application of additivity, defines
a partial ordering on W' which is sufficient to say which of two goods will
be valued more highly many conceivable situation, to prove diminishing
marginal utility, and to establish the ALEP criterion, to be discussed below.
 See McCulloch and Smith (1975) for a proof of the law of the marginal use
 involving this extended conduct.

                                                                                 S
the opposite i true when complementarity is the only interaction, we

propose that X and Y be designated net rivals in a certain region of the

X—Y plane if in that region the marginal utility of the one decreases as

the quantity of the other increases holding the quantity of any other goods

constant, net complements if the opposite is true, and on net independent if

the marginal utility of one is independent of the quantity available of the

other.   (It can be shown that these concepts are well defined, that is, that

X will have qualitatively the same effect on the marginal utility of Y as Y

has on the marginal utility of X, even in the Austrian framework of ordinal

marginal utility.) This is actually the definition of rival and complementary

goods proposed, though in terms of the cross partial derivatives of a smooth

cardinal utility function, by Auspitz and Lieben, Edgeworth, and Pareto.1

We therefore designate it the "ALEP criterion." Note, however, that while        5
these authors used the ALEP criterion as the definition of complements and

rivals, the approach of the marginal use theory is to define these concepts

in terms of how the goods are used, and then to demonstrate a relationship to

the ALEP criterion.

     Hicks claims that the "Edgeworth—Pareto definition sins against Pareto's

own principle of the immeasurability of utility. If utility is not a quantity,



      11Auspitz and Lieben (1889, 482),Edgeworth (1897/1925, 117 n.l), Pareto
(1906/1927, 268—9). It is not actually clear that the functions Auspitz and
Lieben and Edgeworth differentiate are really what we would call utility
functions. For instance, Edgeworth equates his first derivative to a price.
Nevertheless the basic idea is definitely there. While Auspitz and Lieben
were Austrians by nationality, they are not considered part of the Austrian
school. Their approach was closer to that of Wairas. The ALEP criterion
has recently been rediscovered by Samuelson (1974, 1264—5).



                                                                                 .

but only an index of the consumer's scale of preferences, his definition of

complementary and competitive goods will differ according to the arbitrary

measure of utility which is adopted," (1946, 43) However, we have shown that

in the Austrian concept of ordinal marginal utility, the criterion does indeed

have a precise meaning, so Hick's objection is invalid.

        Hicks instead attempted to define the complementarity of X and Y in terms

of Allen's "partial" elasticity of substitution o      ,   which is related to the

curvature of the indifference surfaces. (Allen 1962/38, 504—5). If it is

positive he calls the two goods "substitutes" and if it is negative he calls

the two goods "complements". However, it has never been demonstrated that the

sign of the substitution elasticity has anything to do with whether X and Y are

used in combination with one another or in place of one another. It is about time

this quest-ion be investigated.

        We have demonstrated above that the ALEP criterion is related to whether

the goods are rivals or complements. One implication of the ALEP criterion

for the structure of commodity preferences, an implication that was not

recognized by Hicks, is that if there is a third good, Z, which is completely

independent of the first two goods, then the marginal rate of substitution between

X and Z will change in one direction as Y Increases holding X and Z constant

if X and Y are net complements, and will change In the opposite direction as

Y increases if X and Y are net rivals. If goods and wants are finely divisible

so that the Allen elasticities exist and are well defined, this implies that

Since   independent goods will always have positive income elasticities, equation

(5) implies that all three cross substitution elasticities will have the same

sign. Since       at   most one can be negative, it follows that they must all be

positive. Therefore if X and Y are independent (and the third good Z is also


       1Expressions (2) and (3) do not necessarily have the same sign unless Z

      it follows that there will be some small amount of ALEP net compliment—

arity between X and Y for which a          remains positive. Therefore a        being
                                      xy                                   xy
negative is not a necessary condition for complementarity.

       It is, however, a sufficient condition under not unreasonably re-

strictive conditions. If            is negative, the numerators of both (2) and

(3) will be positive except in unusual cases when some of the income elas-

ticities are negative. It can be shown that the direct elasticity of sub-

stitution between X and Y, s (which holds the quantity of Z constant),

is given by
                                    kk(k +k)(a a

                       s        =                                               (6)

                                              z zz

Since s must be positive and a    must be negative, it follows that the
       xy                      zz
denominators of (2) and (3) must also be positive. Therefore if Z is on net

independent of both X and Y, negativity of            does indeed imply that X and Y

are net complements in the ALEP sense.'

       Since negativity of a         is only a sufficient condition for complementarity,

we suggest that the Hicks—Allen definition of the unqualified term "comple-

ments" be abandoned, and that instead X and Y be referred to as "positive

substitutes" if a is positive, and as "negative substitutes" or "extreme

complements" if a is negative. Furthermore, "substitution" in the Hicks—

Allen sense should not be confused with rivalness (or "competitivity").

ANIMISTIC ECONOMICS


      The dominant position of the Hicks—Allen version of utility theory

reflects the popularity of positivist or behavioristic methodology in the

     1We cannot deduce the full ALEP relation among X, Y, and Z from demand
parameters alone. But, what is more useful, we can make inferences about
demand relationships from what we know about how X, Y, and Z are used.

social   sciences. Positivism attempts to transfer some of the prestige of
                                                                                   .
the natural sciences to the social sciences by recognizing only the methods

of the natural sciences as being appropriate for the social sciences.

      Natural science made its great forward strides to the extent that it

was able to shake off animistic interpretations of nature and substitute

empiricism. Animism is the superstitious attribution of human—like motives

to natural phenomena, for instance, interpreting earthquakes in terms of

punishment by the earth spirits. Science recognizes that natural phenomena

have no such meaning, and that all the scientist can do is record observable

phenomena and try to generalize to empirically testable propositions. Posi-

tivistic economics therefore restricts itself to statements about objectively

observable behavior, such as that reflected in the consumer's preference

structures, and tries to make empirically testable statements about this

behavior.

      The Austrian theory of the marginal use boldly flies In the face of

positivism by attributing human motives to human beings. It would be a waste

of time for a natural scientist to speculate about what he would do in such—and—

such a situation if he were an electron. However, it might be very fruitful

for an economist to make inferences about the demand for water, gasoline, auto-

mobiles and lawns by speculating about whether a consumer will fuel his car

with water and sprinkle his lawn with gasoline, or vice—versa. The fact that

the economist is one of the subjects of his own study means that he can exploit

empathy or "understanding" in Dilthey's sense, a tool that is not available

to the natural scientist.


         1See Lachmann (1966) and Dilthey (1962).
                                      —33—



         The distinction between the behavioristic Hicks—Allen approach to

    consumer preference theory and the empathic Austrian approach may be

    likened to two men observing a stream. The behaviorist observes a bulge in

    the surface of the stream (or indifference surface) and declares that nothing

    more can be said than that the stream bulges in such and such a manner. To

    him, it is senseless, even unscientific, to inquire what is going on beneath

    the surface. The Austrian, on the other hand, is not afraid to observe that

    there is a rock beneath the surface that is deflecting the current. The

    Austrian looks beneath the surface to investigate and understand the meaning

    of the superficial phenomenon.'

          The sterility of the orthodox behavioristic theory of consumer choice

    has led many economists working independently of the Austrian school to move

    in a similar direction. Lancaster (1966, 1971) investigates how goods are used

    to provide "characteristics," similar to Austrian wants, that are the ultimate

    objects of consumer preference. Becker and his students (e.g. Michael and

    Becker 1973) have developed a similar model, in which market goods are

    combined in a "household production function" to create hypothetical "com-

    modities" which are the ultimate preference objects.

          However, neither of these approaches insists, as the Austrians do, that

    preferences on market goods can be broken down in terms of ultimate independent


          'Many Austrian school economists have unfortunately overreacted to the
    behavioristic preoccupation with indifference curves, by denouncing these curves
    as inadmissible. Kauder (1965, 108) traces this "tabboo" on anything smacking
    of mathematics back to Hans Mayer. This tradition is in the position of a man
    who, having noted that a submerged rock is deflecting the current, denies that
    it is meaningful to say that the stream even has a surface (after all, every
    point is either in the water or in the air), let alone to discuss the effect
    of the deflection on the shape of the surface.

 preference—objects, nor do they develop the ALEP criterion and its Implications,

 or recognize the ordinal character of marginal utility. Nevertheless, these

approaches do belong with the Austrians in the camp of animistic economics.


THE GUSSEN—JEVONS LAW OF DIMINISHING ENJOYMENT VERSUS THE AUSTRIAN LAW OF
DIMINISHING MARGINAL UTILITY


      Menger gives the following example of the various wants among which an

individual might like to allocate a given supply of a good:

        An isolated farmer, after a rich harvest, has more that two hundred
      bushels of wheat at his disposal. A portion of this secures him the
      maintanance of his own and his family's lives until the next harvest,
      and another portion the preservation of health; a third portion assures
      him seed—grain for the next seeding; a fourth portion may be employed
      for the production of beer, whiskey, and other luxuries; and a fifth
      portion may be used for the fattening of his cattle. Several remaining
      bushels, which he cannot use further for these more important satis-
      factions, he allots to the feeding of pets in order to make the balance
      of his grain in some way useful. (1950,129—30).

Only two of these six satisfactions are brought about by successive doses of

the commodity in the same activity, i.e., eating bread made from the wheat.

Gossen, Jevons, and the other traditional utility theorists had this sort of

"dinner table" situation in mind when they stated their laws of diminishing

enjoyment. Supposedly the successive doses provide successively less enjoyment,

which in turn is to be "measured" by the utility function. Thus, the Gossen—

Jevons law of diminishing marginal utility might be called a psycho—physiological
law of satiation.

      The Austrian law, in the other hand, arises logically from situations in

which the individual can choose from among several completely different con-

sumption activities. The Austrian law could be characterized as a mental law

of the logic of choice in the face of scarcity. The Austrians do introduce
                                 —35—




Instances in which two different concrete wants are satisfied by successive

doses of a good in the same activity, but they do it prinicipally to proliferate

the number and variety of importance of the wants they deal with. In fact,

                                                                       to the
these "dinner table" examples potentially provide some embarrassment

Austrian theory, which always supposes that the consumer is free to choose to

satisfy any wants he pleases. In Menger's example, however, there is no way his

farmer could choose merely to provide for health and decline to provide for life

by consuming just one portion. Fortunately, as a general rule the successive

doses are less important to the individual, so that the Austrian theory does

not break down.

      Von Mises has pointed out this difference between the Gossen—Jevons and

the Austrian laws of diminishing marginal utility:

      The [Austrian] law of marginal utility and decreasing marginal value
    is independent of Gossen's law of the saturation of wants (first law
    of Gossen). In treating marginal utility we deal neither with sensuous
    enjoyment nor with saturation and satiety.... Our statement is formal
    and aprioristic and does not depend on any experience. (1963, 234)

Gatan Pirou gives a related appraisal of the general approach of the

Austrian school:

    Menger's system is sometimes called "psychological economics." On
    reflection, it appears to me that the term psychological may not be
    exact.... Menger's work is more an "economic logic" than a "psycho-
    logical economics." (1945, 64, my trans.)

 This unique approach sets the Austrian school methodologically apart from the

 Jevonian and Lausanne approaches to economics.


JOINT SATISFACTION


      Yet another type of technological interrelationship between goods and

wants is that of jointness, which arises when one unit of a good can satisfy
                                  —36—




more than one want simultaneously. This relationship is important when one
                                                                                     S
of the wants can also be satisfied by a second good. The relation between

jointness and inferiority (in the sense of having a negative income elasticity)

deserves careful analysis. Can inferiority (in some qualified sense applicable

to discretely divisible goods) arise in the absence of joint want satisfaction?

It would appear not, although I have not been able to demonstrate it.

      The assumption of additivity is perfectly natural until it is made explicit.

Then it becomes apparent what a restrictive assumption it is. Are we really

justified in assuming that the consumer's underlying wants are not interrelated?

Lancaster allows his underlying "characteristics," which correspond roughly

to Austrian wants, to be highly interrelated. However, I think that if we

reflect on the types of interrelationship that are likely to occur, they can

be reduced to purely technological interrelationships affecting the satisfaction     5
of unrelated ultimate wants. It would appear that the categories of rivalness,

compleinentarity, and jointness are sufficient to explain any conceivable tech-

nological interrelationship.


CONVEXITY OF THE INDIFFERENCE CURVES


      Notice that inFigures 2, 3, and 4 we were always able to draw indifference

curves that were convex to the origin and were never forced to draw a concave

portion. Menger gives an example in which he shows that although a little

exchange may be advantageous at a given price ratio, as more and more i traded,


          this case, the first and second goods would correspond to Menger's
goods of "superior" (höher) and "Inferior" (minderer or niederer) quality.
(1950, 144—5 and 1934, 118—9).



                                                                                     .
                                   —37—




a peak in utility may be reached after which the individual is increasingly

worse off. Eventually, he may be worse off than when he started. This

phenomenon, which Nenger (1950, 187) describes under the heading of the

"limits of exchange," Is closely related to convexity.

      I conjecture that it can be proven that convex indifference curves may

always be found in the Austrian system of utility, subject only to the reser-

vations given In the next section. This has already been proven in the case

two independent goods by Jeffrey Smith (McCulloch and Smith, 1975). This

issue is of great interest for economic theory. Hick is not satisfied that

he has given adequate justification for his bald assumption of convexity, or

what is the same thing, of diminishing marginal rate of substitution:

      Since we know from experience that some points of possible equilibrium
      do exist on the indifference maps of nearly every one..., it follows
      that the principle of diminishing marginal rate of substitution must
      sometimes be true.
         However, for us to make progress in economics, it is not enough
      for us to know that the principle should be true sometimes; we require
      a more general validity than that. (1946, 22)

Fortunately, the Austrian utility theory leads to a more satisfying development

of this important proposition.

      Convex indifference curves were first developed in economics as an

implication of diminishing marginal utility, provided the goods were on net

independent or were net complements. Note, however, that they work out to

have the usual curvature even In our example of rival goods.


INSTANCES OF INCREASING NARGINAL UTILITY


      Suppose that one unit of X will satisfy want a, but that it takes no

less than two units to satisfy want b; one unit cannot "half—way" satisfy b.
                                     —38—



Suppose that b is "much greater" than a. If an individual has one unit of
                                                                                      .
X he will use it to satisfy a.     If he has two, he will satisfy b. The

marginal utility of the first unit is then the importance of a, while the

marginal utility of the second is (b,a), the importance of replacing a with b.

If b is sufficiently important and a sufficiently unimportant, the marginal

utility of the second unit may actually be higher than that of the first

unit.1 Von Mises has recognized that circumstances like these may arise when

several units of a good must be used together to provide a given effect, and

that they provide exceptions to the general law of diminishing marginal utility.

However, as Mises points out, "All this is in perfect agreement with the rightly

formulated law of marginal utility.

        If more than one unit of a good must be combined to produce a given effect,

either by itself or in a complementary package with another good, we would

similarly expect to find instances where we are forced to draw concave segments

of our indifference curves. Therefore any proof of convexity arising from

the Austrian theory of the marginal use must be qualified to hold only if for

each good there is a single quantity in which it enters into the consumption

technology.

       Nevertheless, we would still expect dinimishing marginal utility and

convexity to hold for a given individual as a general rule, if not in every

instance. Furthermore, when we look at masses of Individuals, we might find

that any "lumpiness" in the consumption behavior of any individual becomes



      1We may say for certain that the second unit has hIgher marginal utility
than the first if there Is a third want c and b   ac   c   a   0. By deleting
a from both sides of b   ac, we get (b,a) '    whence (h,)    a.

       2Mises (1963, 125).   My conjecture is that by "marginal. utilit:y"
he   here has in mind "Grenznn" which is less confusingly read as"marginal use."
                                          —39—



insignificant in examining the behavior of the group as a whole. Consequently,

when describing the reaction of large numbers of individuals to price changes,

income transfers, etc., we might expect them to behave, as a general rule, as

if for each one decreasing marginal utility and convexity held, even though

this may not be exactly true in each individual case.


IS IT REALLY ORDINAL?


      It may have occurred to the reader that the easiest way to generate an

additive ordering on a set of subsets is to assign a real number, say m(ai),

to each element a of W, i = 1, 2, ...            n.   For each subset P of W define

m(P) =      I   m(a). Then for each pair P and Q of subsets of W, let P                Q
       aiEP
whenever m(P) > m(Q).       We will call an ordering generated in this manner

"essentially cardinal." Clearly such an ordering is additive, for if P                     Q,


then m(P)        m(P—Q)+m(PAQ) > m(Q) = m(Q—P) + in(PflQ), whence           in (P—Q) > m(Q—P),   so

that P—Q i.     Q—P.   Similarly, P—Q -    Q—P   implies   P.   Q, so   that any essentially
cardinal    ordering is also additive.

         For example, Tables 21 and 22 show how the additive orderings of Tables 1

and 10 can arise from such a cardinal measure. In Table 21, a, b, c, and d

respectively have been given measures 11, 8, 6, and 4. In Table 22, the five

wants a, b, c, d, and e have been given measures 9.5, 8.5, 5.7, 5.2, and 2.2.

 Such numbers will in general not be unique if W is finite.

         It seems plausible that all additive orderings, at least on finite sets

 and sufficiently reasonable infinite sets,must be essentially cardinal. In

 fact, in 1949 the Italian statistician B. de Finetti conjectured that this

 is true. If so, it would seem to be mere quibbling to retain an ordinal

    approach once the assumption of additivity is made, for we could then derive

    all properties of the ordering from a few numbers which we can manipulate in

    familiar ways. In any case, it could then be argued that the Austrian utility

    theory is only superficially ordinal, that their assumptions amount to the

    same thing as cardinality.

          For several years de Finetti's conjecture remained unsolved. In 1959,

    Kraft, Pratt and Seidenberg finally proved it false by publishing a counter—

    example. Take for instance the additive ordering of Table 4. It contains the

    four relations be }       cd, bc   ae, ce     b, and ad }    bce.     If the ordering arose

    from a measure m( ), we would have m(b) + m(e) > m(c) + m(d), m(b) + m(c) > m(a)

    + ni(e), m(c) +   m(e)>   m(b), and inCa) + m(d) > m(b)     + in(c)   + m(e). Adding these

    four numerical inequalities together we get that m(a) + 2rn(b) + 2m(c) + m(d) +2m(e)

    must be strictly greater than itself, a contradiction. Therefore the additive

    ordering of Table 4 cannot be essentially cardinal. Similarly, the additive

    ordering of Table 16 contains the four relations b }           ce, cd     be, ae   bc, and

    bce   ad, which would also imply a contradiction if the ordering were essentially
                1
    cardinal.

          Since additivity does not imply measurability, it follows that the Austrian

    theory of the marginal use is intrinsically ordinal. It admits of situations

    where no cardinal utility function is possible.

          The Austrian literature is full of contradictory statements as to whether

    utility is expressible cardinally. Wieser tells us,


          1Kraft et al. (1959) attribute this conjecture to B. de Finetti (1951,
    1—10). The ordering of Table 16 is due to Kraft et al. That of Table 4, has,
    to the best of my knowledge, never been published. See Krantz et al. (1971,
    chapt. 5)for theorems relating to additivity. In McCulloch and Smith (1975) It
,   is demonstrated that if W has 5 elements, there are at least 1920 different
    intrinsically ordinal additive orderings on W.
                                  —42—




      Strictly speaking, we cannot measure [messen] different strength
                                                                                  .
      degrees of intensity of interest   [Intensittsgrade des Interesses]
      against one another or reduce them to a conunon unit. Nor can we
      estimate how many times stronger one degree is than another. Since
      the concepts of unit, of multiple, and of number are not applicable
      to the degrees of strength of inner phenomena, we may say that we
      can ascribe to them only intensive, and not extensive or numerical,
      magnitudes. (1884, 180—1, my trans.)

Yet a few pages later (196), we catch him multiplying a marginal utility by a

integer!

      When Böhm—Bawerk assigns numbers to the importance of different wants, he

is careful to emphasize that they are only an ordinal index:

      To correct misunderstandings which have arisen despite my precautions,
      I should like to state explicitly that the descending scale represented
      by the arabic numerals 10 to 1 in this table do not symbolize anything
      beyond the fact that each concrete want designated by a given number
      has a lower intensity or importance than any want or wants designated
      by a higher number or numbers. The series of numbers is not meant to
      convey the 4çgree to which the importance of a want with a higher index
      exceeds that of a want with a lower index. It is not by any means my
      intention to make the statement that a want with an index of 6 is exactly
      three times as important as one with aft index of 2, nor that one with
      an index of 9 possesses an importance exactly equal to that of wants
      with indices of 6 and 3 combined. (1959 II, 423, n. 17 to p. 141)

But then, a few sections later, he takes the opposite position:

      We should be permlttted to hope for unanimity on the question of
      man's ability to decide whether one pleasurable emotion is stronger
      or weaker than another. And it should even be reasonable to suppose
      that there can be no doubt that we can judge whether one feeling of
      pleasure is considerably or only negligibly stronger than another.
      But is it possible for us to determine the degree of difference more
      exactly, and express it in numerical terms? Can we judge whether
      pleasurable emotion A is, let us say, three times as great or strong
      as pleasurable emotion B?
         I believe we can really do that or something very much like it.
      (1959 II, 197—8)

He even devotes one of his "Excurses" to defending the measurability of sen-

sations (1959 iii, 124_36).l

      Hayek (in Menger 1934, xiv, xv) and Stlgler (1937, 240) both refer

to the following passage in Menger as proving that he had in mind ordinal

utlity: "I need hardly point out that the figures in the text are not intended

to express numerically the absolute but merely the relative magnitudes of

importance of the satisfactions in question." (1950, 183n.) But if we go

to the source and read on, Menger's very next words are, "Thus when I

designate the importance of two satisfactions with 40 and 20 for example, I

am merely saying that the first of the two satisfactions has twice the Importance

of the second to the eainomlzing Individual concerned." Menger Is simply

espousing the usual, intermlnate—up—to—a—lInear transformation, cardinal utility.

In numerous instances we find him adding utilities together)

      Only the later Austrian school economists, such as von Mlses (above, p. 11).

BilimovI (1934), and Rothbard (1956), can be said to take a consistently

ordinal position.

      The persistent Inconsistency of the older Austrians on the cardInality

question is understandable In light of the close relation between measurability

and their Implicit assumption of additlvlty. They can hardly be taken to task

for being unclear In the nineteenth century about a distinction which mathe-

maticians did not even state until 1949 and did not resolve until 1959. It

is natural to draw on cardinal Illustrations to force additivity, even if the

cardinality has no necessary place in the theory. Perhaps Böhm—Bawerk had this

in the back of his mind when he added the proviso "or something very much like it"



      1See, e.g., Menger (1950, 179). Note also p. 293, n. 1, "...value is
a magnitude that can be measured."
                                  —44--



                                                                                  .
(above) to his statement that utilities may be expressed in multiples of
one another.

      One situation that does lead to essentially cardinal preferences is

the hypothetical one in which goods and wants are perfectly divisible. It

can be shown that if W* is additively ordered in such a way that W can be

partitioned into arbitrarily insignificant subsets, its ordering must be

essentially cardinal (Krantz et. al., 1971 I, 2O67)) Thus, if a good such

as an automobile could be divided into arbitrarily small pieces satisfying

arbitrarily trifling wants which when put together would comprise the important

wants satisfied by the whole automobile, utility would be essentially cardinal.

Such an assumption is not very realistic, to be sure. We would not want to

make it a fundamental postulate of all utility theory. Nevertheless in some

applications this convenient simplification might be harmless, provided we

recognize it as the simplification it is. When we do indulge in it, the

additivity of preferences on wants, together with the Austrian logic of choice,

will imply as a theorem that the derived cardinal marginal utility diminishes.



      1Similarly, Alt (1936) demonstrates that any Bernardelli utility index
 (1938) that is expressible as a continuous function on commodity space can be
monotonically transformed in such a way that Bernardelli's conditional utility
is the arithmetic difference of his total utility. If the Bernardelli utility
index is not continuous, however, it cannot necessarily be so transformed. As
a counterexainpie, consider the derived commodity preferences that would arise
when there are several different indivisible goods, each one of which is
capable of satisfying a different basic want, when the ordering on W* happens
to be intrinsically ordinal. (There must be five or more goods for this to
happen.)
       In a published comment on Bernadelli's paper, Samuelson (1939) called
attention to crucial flaws in a functional example Bernardelli attempted to
work out in his mathematical appendix. Sainuelson's comments, however, do not
reflect on the text of Bernardelli's paper.



                                                                                  .

PROBABILISTIC CARDINALIZATION OF UTILITY


      It is a fairly straightforward exercise to adapt the well—known von

Neutnann—Morgenstern probabilistic axioms1 to the Austrian framework and come

up with a cardinal utility index for the wants and therefore for commodities.

In fact, the additivity concept can be integrated into the traditional von

Neumann—Morgenstern axiom sytem in a way that virtually eliminates one of the

traditional axioms. What's more, when this is done, the Austrian wants—structure

will imply that the resulting cardinal utility index on commodity space will

be mathematically concave, and therefore exhibit diminishing marginal utility

and indifference curves that are convex toward the origin.

      However, doing this rules out intrinsically ordinal rankings on W*. There-

fore economists cannot have both the von Neumann—Morgenstern axioms and the

possibility of intrinsically ordinal preferences. One or the other has to go.

Several economists have questioned the von Neumann—Morgenstern system. Georgescu—

Roegen (1954) argues that perhaps preferences are lexocographic and linear,

ruling out the possibility of indifference that is crucial to the von Neumann—

Morgenstern approach. Taking a different tack, Quandt (1960) and Meginniss (1976)


      1See von Neumann and Morgenstern (1953, Appendix) or any advanced text on
microeconomics, and Morgenstern (1976, 809). It is a curious Inconsistency in
the state of economic doctrine that the leaders of the profession acknowledged
soon after 1944 that the von Neumann—Morgenstern cardinalization of utility was
plausible, yet refused for decades to grant that it meant that the 1934 HIcks—
Allen objections to the ALEP criterion were no longer valid. Only thirty years
later was Samuelson willing to draw this obvious conclusion (1974, 1264—1265).
He was by then even willing to go so far as to acknowledge it as " von
Neumann risk—utility metric" (1974, 1263, emphasis added). Even so, in the same
paper he took pains to deny that he was "backsliding" from the Hicks—Allen version
of ordinality without marginal utility (1285 n23).
                                  —46—




have questioned whether expected utility maximization is necessary for
                                                                                     .
rationality. These authors argue that there is nothing irrational about

consumers who instead maximize expected utility plus a term that depends on

the standard error of the utility of the gamble (Quandt), or on the entropy

of the gamble (Meginniss). Intrinsically ordinal preferences might not be

ruled out for consumers like these.

      In summary, the issue of probabilistic cardinalization of utility is

still up in the air. I personally find intrinsically ordinal preferences and

the von Neumann—Morgenstern axiom system about equally plausible. Until this

inconsistency is resolved, however, it should be remembered that the purely

Austrian approach does admit intrinsically ordinal marginal utility.


TRADUTTORE, TRADITORE


      If the Austrian theory of the marginal use is so powerful, why has so

little attention been given to It outside of a relatively small circle? We

offer two reasons.

      First, the Austrian analysis has suffered greatly in translation out of

German, since "marginal utility" has traditionally been used as the translation of

their technical term "Grenznutzen." The Austrian theory swings on the theorem

that a good's "value" or marginal utility is determined by Its marginal use.

In conventional translations, however, this important theorem comes through

as the trivial assertion that a good's marginal utility is determined by its

marginal utility. It is small wonder English—speaking economists have been

unimpressed.




                                                                                     .
                                 —47—



     This confusion was not so much the fault of the translators as of the

principals themselves. The source of the problem is the dual meaning of the

word "utility" in English. Its common meaning is merely "usefulness." But

economists have used it to mean "subjective value."1   It is understandable

that when Wieser and Böhm—Bawerk first became aware of Jevons and Wairas,

they would assume that their Grenznutzen,or marginal use, corresponded to the

English marginal utility. Nutzen is very close to the common English utility,

though not to the economist's utility, which in fact corresponds to the

Austrians' subjektiver Wert.2 Unfortunately, after Wieser casually suggested

a correspondencebetween his Grenznutzen and Jevon's "final degree of utility"

(above p. 7n), it was accepted as a matter of fact by all parties concerned.3

This correspondence remained unquestioned for over eighty years, when it was

finally challenged by Georgescu—Roegen (1968, 251).

      Perpetuating the confusion has been the Anglo—Saxon's provincial belief

that everyone writes and thinks in English. One could read H. J. Davenport's

1902 "Proposed Modification in Austrian Theory and Terminology" without ever

realizing that Austria is any less English—speaking than Australia. Perhaps

he confused the two. He cites two examples in Wieser's Natural Value where

      in the second case [WeiserJ employs the word value for seemingly precisely
      the same meaning as was in the former case expressed by utility, the two
      statements together being perhaps mostly serviceable as illustrating the
      confusion of utility with value characteristic of Austrian discussion.
      (1902, 362n.)

     'Thus we find Menger's translator rendering "Nutzllchkeit" as "utility,"
and then adding a footnote to make it clear that utility is not really utility
(1950, 118, n. 6). The translation of Wieser's Natlirlicher Werth is equally
confusing. For instance, the translator gives Nutzen as "utility" on page 1,
and then as "use" a few pages later (1889, 1, 11 and 1893, 1 and 12).
      21n referring to Jevons and Wairas, Wieser identifies "Gebrauchswerth,"
with their "utility" and "utilité." (1889, 26n.) Jevons confirms that "Wert,"
as least as used by Gossen, is Identical to his "utility." (1931, xxxiv).

                                   —48—




Examination of the original, however, reveals that in both instances Wieser
                                                                                     .
used "Gebrauchswerth"! (1889, 27n., 43n.) It Is the translator who was

confused, not Wieser. One would think that before proposing modifications to

the Austrian terminology, it would have occurred to Davenport to have ascer—

tamed just what their terminology was.

        To top it off, by a process of reverse translation the "utility" of Jevons

and Hicks has crept back into German as "Nutzen," even in the writings of some

of the later Austrians. Already in 1934, Bi1imovi thus uses Grenznutzen to

mean marginal utility. Today this seems to be the word's standard meaning

(MUhler—Groeling, 1965). Througout Ludwig von Mises' career spanning six

decades, however, he continued to use "Grenznutzen" (and marginal utility" in

his English writings after World War II) in Wieser's original sense of "marginal

use."

        What's to be done? Menger's Principles and Böhm—Bawerk's Capital and

Interest are still well worth reading in their present English translations,

provided the reader is wary of the word "utility." In Menger, the underlying

word is often "Nutzhichkeit," and the reader can substitute "usefulness."

In Böhm—Bawerk, it may be "Nutzen" and the reader should try substituting "Use,"

especially in the expression "marginal utility." The same substitution usually

makes sense in von Mises' Human Action. Unfortunately, simple substitution is

not so easy in the important section of von Mises' Theory of Money and Credit

term marginal utility Is In correspondence with the German term Grenz—nutz [sic}."

2 February 1887, especially the paragraph written but struck out admitting his
weakness in German (Antonelli 1953, 285—6). Bell (1953, 423, 431) first intro-
duced the term "marginal use," though even he did not directly question the
traditional equation of "Grenznutzen" with "marginal utility." In a letter to me
dated March 28, 1975, Böhm—Bawerk's translator, Hans Sennholz, now concurs with
the distinction between Grenznutzen and marginal utility.

relating to the value of money (1924/1953, 97—154).

      The second reason we offer for the neglect of the Austrian theory is

that they are not well known even in German speaking countries. Two World

Wars disturbed the continuity of the school. Their own country, Austria—

Hungary, was dismembered after World War I. The Austrian fragment became

uninhabitable around 1935; von Mises' exile to Switzerland in that year marked

the end of Vienna as an intellectual center for the Austrian school) And

Menger's methodological disputes with Schmoller, the head of the official

German historical school, effectively prevented adherents of the Austrian

theories from obtaining academic positions in Germany.2

CONCLUS ION
                                                                                     .
       The Austrian theory of the marginal use raises almost as many pro-

blems as It has solved. We list here a few of these unsolved problems.

      Compleinentarity and rivalness do lead to the ALEP criterion in the

examples we worked out above, but we have made no attempt to formalize this

rule into a general theorem. Intuitively, the ALEP condition must appear when

the complementary or rival relationships are somehow active in the inner or

outer marginal uses, but it Is not clear exactly what the circumstances are

under which this holds.

      Although the theory leads to quasi—concavity of commodity preferences

over goods In the particular cases we worked out, even when rival or complementary

interactions are present, it has only been proven that this must be generally

true when there are two goods, and then only In the case when the two goods

are independent. Perhaps preferences do not really have to be quasi—concave

after all.

      And finally, it must be resolved whether the possibility of intrinsically

ordinal preferences nullifies the von Neumann—Morgenstern axiom system, or If

instead the validity of those axioms rules out Intrinsically ordinal preferences.

       After over a century, the Austrian theory is still in its youth.

Perhaps the day has come for Felix Kaufmann's young Grenznutzler to return

from the netherworld of economic doctrine:


              There I will quietly lie In wait,

              Amid my neglected writings,

              Until I hear the trumpet call

              of Complementary Goods.
                           —51—



     Then through the sky will gallop Böhm—Bawerk,

     Polemics will thunder and flash!

     Then armed with a quill I'll rise up from the grave,

     To fight for the Grenznutzen school!1
