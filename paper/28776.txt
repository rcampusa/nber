Household Debt Overhang Did Hardly Cause a Larger Spending Fall during the Financial
Crisis in Australia

                                          ABSTRACT

The "debt-overhang hypothesis" ­ that households cut back more on their spending in a crisis
when they have higher levels of outstanding mortgage debt (Dynan, 2012) ­ seems to be taken for
granted by macroprudential authorities in several countries in their policy decisions, as well as by
the international organizations that evaluate and comment on countries' macroprudential policy.
New results for Australian microdata are presented that reject the debt-overhang hypothesis. The
results instead support the "spending-normalization hypothesis" of Andersen, Duus, and Jensen
(2016), what can also be called the "debt-financed overspending" hypothesis ­ that the
correlation between high pre-crisis household indebtedness and subsequent spending falls during
the crisis reflects high debt-financed spending pre-crisis and a return to normal spending during
the crisis. As discussed in Svensson (2019, 2020), this is consistent with the above correlation
reflecting debt-financed overspending through what Muellbauer (2012) calls the "housing-
collateral household demand" channel and Mian and Sufi (2018) the "debt-driven household
demand" channel.

1        Introduction
At the micro level, several papers--including Mian and Sufi (2010) and Dynan (2012) for
the US, Andersen, Duus, and Jensen (2016) (ADJ) for Denmark, and Bunn and Rostom
(2014, 2015) for the UK--have established a correlation between the level of household
indebtedness before the Global Financial Crisis and consumption spending cuts during the
crisis. But, as emphasized by ADJ, the mechanism behind this correlation has not been
well understood. A common interpretation is indeed that the correlation reflects a negative
causal impact of pre-crisis household indebtedness on spending cuts during the crisis, what
can be called the "debt-overhang hypothesis" (Dynan, 2012). ADJ calls this interpretation
the "household balance-sheet hypothesis." One potential mechanism behind such a causal
effect is that households having high levels of debt prior to the crisis were suddenly facing
binding borrowing constraints when the crisis broke out and therefore cut spending. Another
is that the housing-wealth loss due to falling housing prices and even finding themselves
"underwater" induced highly indebted households to delever. A third is that highly levered
households cut spending voluntarily due to precautionary motives.
    The debt-overhang hypothesis seems to be taken for granted by macroprudential au-
thorities in several countries, as well as by the international organizations that comment
on countries' macroprudential policy. Here are two examples, from Finansinspektionen (the
Swedish FSA) and the Bank of England:1

         The risks associated with household debt are primarily related to the possibility
         that highly indebted households may sharply reduce their consumption in the
         event of a macroeconomic shock. This development was noted in other coun-
         tries during the financial crisis in 2008­2009. If many households reduce their
         consumption at the same time, this can amplify an economic downturn. (Fi-
         nansinspektionen, 2017, p. 1)
         [H]ighly indebted households are more likely to cut their consumption sharply to
         keep paying their mortgages, deepening the economic downturn. (Carney, 2020,
         p. 20)

    However, ADJ emphasize that the correlation between pre-crisis indebtedness and subse-
quent spending cuts during the crisis could also reflect that the high debt level among some
households was simply the result of high debt-financed spending in previous years, while the
subsequent drop in spending reflected a return to normal levels. In this latter interpreta-
tion, the observed correlation does not reflect a causal effect from high debt on spending.
ADJ (p. 99­100) refer to this mechanism as the "spending-normalization hypothesis." Thus,
according to this hypothesis, some households decided to temporarily boost their spending
    1
        See Svensson (2019, 2020) for examples from the international organizations.


                                                       1
to high levels relative to their income before the crisis. Financed by borrowing, the high
spending level pushed up pre-crisis debt-to-income ratios for these households. But since the
spending boost was only temporary, spending subsequently dropped more for these house-
holds than for others, thus generating a negative correlation between pre-crisis indebtedness
and spending growth during the crisis.
    In examining the Danish microdata, ADJ first find a strong negative correlation between
pre-crisis indebtedness of households and the change in spending during the crisis. Then they
show that this reflects that highly indebted households spent a larger share of their income
than their less-indebted peers prior to the crisis. During the crisis the spending share of their
income fell back to a normal level. This is consistent with these households having borrowed
in order to finance overspending relative to income pre-crisis, resulting in larger increases in
debt for these households in these years. This borrowing and the overconsumption ceased
during the crisis, and spending fell back to a normal level. In particular, once ADJ condition
on the size of the pre-crisis change in debt, a high level of debt is no longer associated with
a larger spending decline. Thus, they reject the debt-overhang hypothesis for Denmark and
find support for their spending-normalization hypothesis.
    A possible explanations to such a temporary increase in spending pre-crisis is a credit
supply shocks, for example, through lower lending standards (Mian and Sufi, 2018). Suppose
that some households used easy access to credit before the crisis to borrow large amounts
for spending purposes, thus elevating their spending very much relative to their income. If
these households were no longer able to borrow because of tighter credit restrictions after the
crisis broke out, they would then have to reduce spending, prompting a large decline relative
to the pre-crisis level. An alternative explanation centers on expectations for future income
(Kaplan et al., 2019): Suppose some households had unusually optimistic expectations about
future income growth. According to the life-cycle model, those households would have spent
a higher fraction of their income than less optimistic households. But the fact that these
households were unusually optimistic before the crisis may also imply that they lowered their
expectations about future income more than others once the crisis hit, prompting a larger cut
in spending. Another alternative explanation mentioned by ADJ is that the indebtedness-
spending correlation is related to the timing of purchases of large durable consumption goods,
such as cars: Households that happened to buy a car in 2007 most likely saw a large upwards
spike in spending in that year. If most of them realistically did not buy a car again within
the next two years, the spike in spending was then followed by a large subsequent drop. If
financed by borrowing, the car purchase would at the same time have implied a significant
increase in debt in 2007 for these households. Under these circumstances, perhaps even
random differences in the timing of purchase of large durables can potentially explain the



                                               2
observed correlation between pre-crisis leverage and weak subsequent spending growth.2
    As an additional possible explanation, Svensson (2019, 2020) emphasizes debt-financed
overspending through what Muellbauer (2012) calls the "housing-collateral consumption de-
mand channel " and Mian and Sufi (2018) call the "debt-driven household demand channel."
Through this channel, housing prices--or, more precisely, changes in housing prices--can
affect household consumption. As housing prices rose before the crisis, many households
increased their mortgages through housing-equity withdrawal (HEW) in order to finance
overspending relative to their income. This showed up in a lower household saving rate.
When the crisis hit and housing prices stopped rising and began to fall, further HEW was
no longer possible. When the overspending ceased, spending fell back to a more normal level
in relation to income and the saving rate rose. The housing-collateral channel--with HEW
used for consumption--was not only operating in Denmark, Australia, and the UK before
and during the crisis, but also in the US.3 4
    For Australia, Price, Beckers, and La Cava (2019) (PBLC) provide an extensive and
thorough exploration of the relationship between owner-occupier mortgage debt and the
level of spending, using detailed HILDA panel microdata on households. They focus on
the level of spending in more "normal" years, not on the fall in spending during the crisis
years. In particular, they examine whether high levels of household debt causes a weaker
level of spending, what they call a "debt-overhang effect "--to be distinguished from what
is here called the debt-overhang hypothesis, which refers to the effect of high debt levels
on the fall in spending during the crisis years, as in Mian and Sufi (2010) and Dynan
(2012) for the US, ADJ for Denmark, Bunn and Rostom (2014, 2015) for the UK, and the
present paper for Australia. PBLC do indeed find evidence of such a debt-overhang effect.
They furthermore conclude that this debt-overhang effect is not driven by the spending-
normalization hypothesis of ADJ. However, they do not test this hypothesis by running
exactly the same regressions as ADJ have done.5
   2
      ADJ (p. 113) separately examine whether the observed borrowing and spending pattern can be entirely
explained by car purchases. They find that the share of households with large debt increases that purchased
a new car in 2007 was much higher than for other households, but it was still only about 15 percent. For
the remaining 85 percent of these households, something else than car purchases must have been behind the
large increase in debt and subsequent drop in spending.
    3
      As discussed in Price et al. (2019, appendix B), there are institutional features of the Australian
mortgage market in the form of so-called offset or redraw facilites that most borrowers have attached to
their mortgages. These make housing equity more liquid than otherwise and provide convenient ways to
withdraw housing equity for spending purposes.
    4
      As noted by Guren et al. (2019, p. 1): "In the mid-2000s boom and subsequent bust, housing wealth
extraction through the mortgage market boosted consumption in the boom and reduced consumption in the
bust (e.g., Mian and Sufi, 2011; Mian et al., 2013)."
    5
      Kearns et al. (2020) provide a both broad and detailed analysis of the riskiness of Australian household
debt, including stress tests of banks and households. One of their results is that "the household DTI ratio
is a poor measure of the extent of risk [posed by Australian household debt]."



                                                      3
    The ADJ results thus reject the debt-overhang hypothesis for Denmark and support the
spending-normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis. A most relevant question is
whether or not the ADJ results hold for other countries.
    In a companion paper to the present one, Svensson (2021) shows that the ADJ results
hold also for UK microdata, so the debt-overhang hypothesis--and results in Bunn and Ros-
tom (2015)--are rejected for these UK data, and the spending-normalization/debt-financed
overspending hypothesis receives some support.
    The present paper tests these hypotheses for the Australian HILDA microdata, using
the same regressions as ADJ did. The ADJ results are confirmed for the Australian mi-
crodata. That is, the debt-overhang hypothesis is rejected for this data and the spending-
normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis is supported. The result is robust to
an interaction effect and the variation in the base years allowed by the sample. To my
knowledge, this is the first paper that explicitly tests these hypothesis with the ADJ method
for microdata from other countries than Denmark.
    The paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 presents the simplest possible model of
debt-financed overconsumption through the housing-collateral channel. Section 3 reports
the relevant ADJ results for the Danish microdata. Section 4 presents the new results for
Australian microdata. Section 5 relates the results to those of Price et al. (2019). Section 6
presents some conclusions.


2    The simplest model of debt-financed overconsump-
     tion through the housing-collateral channel
In order to set up the simplest model of debt-financed overconsumption through the housing-
collateral channel, consider a credit- and liquidity-constrained household with owner-occupied
housing. Let it be a (wealthy) hand-to-mouth (HTM) household (Campbell and Mankiw,
1989; Kaplan et al., 2014; La Cava et al., 2016) with the the simple budget constraint

                                 Ct = EIt - it Dt-1 + Dt .                               (2.1)

where Ct denotes nominal (non-housing) consumption (spending) during year t, EIt denotes
the household's (after-tax) earned income, Dt denotes nominal mortgage debt held at the
end of year t, it denotes the (after-tax) nominal interest rate paid in year t on nominal debt
held at the end of year t - 1, and Dt  Dt - Dt-1 denotes the annual change in debt.
The household does not receive any transfers, owns no assets except its housing, and has no
liabilities except its mortgage debt. For simplicity, there is no operation and maintenance
cost of housing, and thus no depreciation of the housing. (Appendix A generalizes the model
slightly by including mandatory amortization.)

                                              4
    The right-hand side of (2.1) is a measure of the household's cash-flow surplus available
for consumption and saving, that is, earned income minus interest payments plus the debt
increase. An HTM household uses all the available cash-flow surplus for (non-housing) con-
sumption and does not save anything in cash or other liquid assets. The implicit assumption
is that the household is credit- and liquidity-constrained to consume less than it would pre-
fer. Its rate of time preference is higher than the interest rate, so the household would prefer
to increase its current consumption by borrowing more, if it could.
    By (2.1),
                                  Ct                Ct
                                        = 1 and           = - it .                         (2.2)
                                  Dt               Dt-1
The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of a higher debt increase is positive and
unity, whereas the MPC out of a higher (lagged) debt level is small and negative, because
the interest rate is much smaller than unity. For an interest rate of 4%, the magnitude of
the MPC out of a higher debt increase is 25 times the magnitude of the MPC out of a higher
debt level.6
    Clearly, here variations in debt changes will have a much larger effect on fluctuations in
current consumption than differences in the lagged debt level.
    Assume that the household is subject to a loan-to-value constraint, if it wants to increase
its debt,
                                     Dt  Pt if Dt > 0.                                     (2.3)
Here  denotes the maximum LTV ratio (for example, 85%) and Pt denotes the nominal
price of the household's housing in year t. Restricting the LTV constraint to apply only
when debt is increased implies the realistic property of LTV constraints that the household
does not have to reduce its debt if housing prices fall and cause the LTV constraint to be
violated. (There are no margin calls for mortgage debt.)
    Because the household is constrained to consume less than it would prefer, it takes out
the maximum possible mortgage--maximizes HEW--each year. If the LTV constraint is not
violated at an unchanged debt level, the household will borrow to make or keep the LTV
constraint binding. If housing prices have fallen so as to cause the LTV constraint to be
violated, the household will keep the debt level constant,
                                     
                                     P
                                          t    if Dt-1  Pt ,
                               Dt =                                                    (2.4)
                                     Dt-1 if Dt-1 > Pt .

   6
      We can also see that Ct /it = -Dt-1 . The consumption of highly-indebted HTM households is
very sensitive to the interest rate. This is the cash-flow channel of monetary policy (La Cava et al., 2016;
Flod´en et al., 2018). It implies that highly indebted households with variable interest rates benefit from
lower interest rates in crises. With flexible exchange rates and flexible inflation targeting, interest rates
become low in recessions. Thus, high debt and variable interest rates provide indebted households with some
insurance against bad times (Svensson, 2020, section 3.2).

                                                     5
   Suppose prices are--and have been--non-decreasing, Pt  0, so the the household will
keep the LTV constraint (2.3) binding, Dt = Pt . It then follows from (2.1) that

                    Ct = EIt - it Pt-1 + Pt              if Pt-1  0 and Pt  0.                        (2.5)

Consumption will be very sensitive to changes in housing prices (as long as they are non-
decreasing). This is an example of the housing-collateral household-demand channel with a
binding LTV constraint. Thus, the housing-collateral channel is a channel through which
housing prices affect consumption.7
   The household's disposable income equals earned income plus capital income (which is
negative here) plus imputed rental income from ownership of the housing.8 Introduce DIXt ,
disposable income excluding imputed rental income, which then equals earned income plus
capital income,
                                    DIXt = EIt - it Dt-1 .                           (2.6)
Then the budget constraint can be written

                                           Ct = DIXt + Dt .                                           (2.7)

(Non-housing) consumption (spending) will equal DIX plus the change in debt.
    Figure 2.1a shows an example in which earned income is constant and set at 110.9 After
having been constant at 440, housing prices start to grow at 4% per year after year 1 but
stop growing and stay constant from year 10 onward. The rising housing prices allow the
household to increase its mortgage through HEW while maintaining the LTV ratio at the
cap of 85%. Thereby it can increase its consumption substantially above DIX from year 2.
DIX is less than earned income by the interest payments. When debt rises, DIX falls further
below earned income.
    When prices stop growing, the household can no longer increase its mortgage and the
debt-financed overconsumption relative to DIX has to stop. Consumption drops by 19% in
year 11 and thereafter remains constant to just equal DIX, the earned income less interest
on the debt. Because debt and thus interest payments are higher in year 11 than in years 1
and 2, consumption and DIX from year 11 onward is lower than in years 1 and 2. This
reflects that Ct /Dt-1 = - it-1 = -0.04.
   7
      See Muellbauer (2012), Mian and Sufi (2018), and Svensson (2019, 2020) for further discussion of the
housing-collateral/debt-driven household demand channel.
    8
      The imputed rental income from owner-occupied housing in year t in theory equals the user cost of
housing in year t. In the absence of any operation and maintenance cost and under the simplifying assumption
that the cost of housing equity equals the mortgage interest rate, the user cost equals
[it+1 Pt - (1 -  )Pt+1 ]/(1 + it+1 ), where  is the (nominal) capital-gains tax on housing.
    9
      The parameters and initial values are  = 85%, P0 = P1 = 440, and D0 = P0 = 374, and EIt = 110
and it = 4% for t  0.

    Figure 2.1b shows another example, in which housing prices also start to grow at 4%
after year 1 but do not remain constant from year 10 onward. Instead they drop by 25% in
year 11 and then resume to grow at 4%. The drop in housing prices increases the LTV ratio
from 85% to 113%. This prevents further HEW, and consumption drops by 19%. The rising
housing prices reduce the LTV ratio back toward 85% and in year 19 the household resumes
HEW and debt-financed overconsumption relative to DIX.
    In figures 2.1a and b, we can interpret year 11 as a crisis year and year 10 as a pre-crisis
year. The consumption change from year 10 to year 11 is in these examples by (2.1) given
by
                                                                               g
       C11 - C10 = C11 = EI11 - i D10 + (D11 - D10 ) = - i                        D10 - D10 .          (2.8)
                                                                              1+g

Here we use that EIt and it = i are constant; that iD10 = igD9 = igD10 /(1 + g ), where g
is the constant growth rate of housing prices and debt up to year 10; and that D11 = 0,
because debt is constant after year 10 for several years.
    With i = 4% and g = 4%, on the right-hand side of (2.8) the coefficient of D10 is only
minus 0.0015, whereas the coefficient on D10 is minus 1. So in these simple examples, the
consumption fall during the "crisis" overwhelmingly depends on the pre-crisis debt increase,
D10 , not on the pre-crisis debt level, D10 .10 The pre-crisis debt level has a small increasing

          Appendix A shows that this result also holds when mandatory amortization is included.

effect on the consumption fall due to the interest payments on the pre-crisis debt increase,
iD10 = igD10 /(1 + g ).11
    What causes the consumption fall in these examples? First, the credit- and liquidity-
constrained HTM household desires to increase its consumption (its rate of time preference
exceeds the after-tax mortgage interest rate). This implies a binding LTV constraint (when
housing prices are non-decreasing). Second, a period of rising housing prices eases the LTV
constraint and allows debt increases through HEW to finance a welcome overconsumption
relative to the households disposable income. Third, an end to the period of rising housing
prices prevent further HEW-financed overconsumption, which forces consumption to fall
back to equal DIX (disposable income excluding imputed rental income). Thus, given the
setup, the fall in consumption is caused by the stop in HEW, which in turn is caused by
the end of the period of rising housing prices. The HEW during the period of rising housing
prices is caused by the households desire to increase its consumption.

       data
ADJ test the debt-overhang and spending-normalization/debt-financed overspending hy-
potheses on Danish microdata (registry data). The crucial regression is of the form

containing a range of household characteristics as of year t. The expression (Zth )High denotes
a dummy for Zth exceeding its 75th percentile in year t.12
    We note the similarity of (3.1) to (2.8). We also note that, by (2.8), any normalization by
pre-tax income or any other variable in (3.1) should involve dividing the spending change on
the left-hand side and the debt level and change on the right-hand side by the same variable,
in this case pre-crisis pre-tax income.
   11
      If we do not assume a constant interest rate, the term iD10 is replaced by i11 D10 - i10 D9 = i11 D10 +
i11 D9 . This illustrates that a fall in the interest rate during the crisis, i11 < 0, will for a large debt level
through the fall in interest payments have a large dampening effect on the consumption fall of the HTM
household (the cash-flow channel of monetary policy).
   12
      The registered-based data ADJ use do not include consumption or spending at the household level.
They instead rely on a spending measure imputed on data from household disposable income, assets, and
liabilities. In order to exclude capital gains on housing, they restrict the sample to households that have not
bought or sold one or more homes during the sample. The sample still include close to 500,000 households
(ADJ, section 3).

    According to the debt-overhang hypothesis, high indebtedness of a household in 2007
caused a larger drop in the household's spending from 2007 to 2009. A test of the hypothesis
is then whether or not the estimate of the coefficient 1 is negative as well as statistically
and economically significant.
    According to the spending-normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis, a larger
fall in spending from 2007 to 2009 is due to overspending in 2007 financed by a high debt
increase from 2006 to 2007. The hypothesis then implies that the fall in spending is predicted
by a high debt increase rather than by a high debt level in 2007.13 A test of the hypothesis
is then whether--when the debt increase is included among the explanatory variables--the
estimate of the coefficient 2 is negative as well as economically and statistically significant,
together with the estimate of 1 being small and economically insignificant. Put differently,
whether a regression with the debt level as regressor without the change in debt is subject
to an omitted-variable problem.

     According to this hypothesis, it is an increase in spending intentions that leads to a debt increase to
support consumption. That is, there is reverse causality. Therefore, the debt increase predicts rather than
causes the fall in spending.
  14
     Note that the second regressor in (3.1) refers to the change in debt from 2006 to 2007 divided by income in

                                                         9
column (1) of the table, with the dummy for a high debt level as the only regressor (besides
controls), gives some support for the debt-overhang hypothesis. However, in column (3),
where the dummy for a high debt change is added as a regressor, the debt-overhang hy-
pothesis is rejected and the spending-normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis
is supported. The negative correlation between high pre-crisis debt and larger subsequent
spending falls is entirely driven by the fact that a large share of the households with high
debt-to income ratios in 2007 had increased their debt by large amounts for consumption
purposes in the run-up to the crisis. The level of debt itself does not help to explain the larger
spending decline for this group. Not including the change in debt among the explanatory
variables thus results in a standard omitted-variable bias of the estimate of the coefficient
on a high DTI ratio.
    Columns (6) and (7) show that the same result occurs when the change in debt from
2003 to 2007 is substituted for the change from 2006 to 2007.
    ADJ (p. 108) summarize the main result as,

      within groups of households that experienced similar-sized changes in debt from
      2006 to 2007, those with a high level of debt in 2007 did not reduce spending
      more from 2007 to 2009 than those with only little debt in 2007. But those that
      experienced a large increase in debt from 2006 to 2007 cut spending by more
      than those that did not experience a large increase, even if they had similar debt
      levels at the end of 2007. . . [T]he results are the same if we instead use the change
      in debt since 2003, rather than 2006.

Broadbent (2019) summarized the result as:15

      Once you know the change in a household's indebtedness ahead of the crisis,
      knowing the level tells you nothing more about its subsequent spending.

    Thus, the ADJ result rejects the debt-overhang hypothesis for Denmark and supports
the spending-normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis. An important question
is to what extent the ADJ result holds for other countries.
2007, not the change in the debt-to-income ratio from 2006 to 2007, as has been confirmed in correspondence
with Asger Andersen. The heading/note to ADJ (table 4) causes some confusion by mistakenly referring to
the change in the debt-to-income ratio, but the text of the paper is clear.
  15
     Broadbent (2019) provides an insightful discussion and several examples of why the level of house-
hold debt--at very different points of time, across countries, and even for individual households--is a poor
predictor of subsequent financial distress, and why debt growth does better.

4     New results for Australian microdata
4.1    The main result
Table 4.1 reports new regression results for Australian HILDA survey data (DSS and Mel-
bourn Institute, 2018) using exactly the same regressions as in ADJ (table 4) and table 3.1.
The results are qualitatively similar to the ADJ results for Denmark, except that in col-
umn (1) the small negative coefficient on a high debt ratio is not significant. Thus, the
debt-overhang hypothesis does not receive any support from this regression alone. Further-
more, when a high change in debt is introduced as an explanatory variable in column (3), its
coefficient is negative and significant at the 5% level (significant at the 10% level in column
(7)), whereas the coefficient on the high debt is closer to zero and not signifiant. Thus,
the debt-overhang hypothesis is rejected also for this Australia data, and the spending-
normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis is supported.
    The estimated coefficients on debt changes for Australia are about a fifth of the ADJ esti-
mates for Denmark. That they are smaller than for Denmark is plausible, because Australia
was considerably less affected by the Global Financial Crisis. Unemployment only increased
in early 2009 but quickly stabilized and was dampened by the mining investment boom.
Housing prices only fell briefly and soon recovered. With most households having variable
mortgage rates, cuts in the RBA policy rate reduced mortgage rates and eased households'
budget constraints directly through the cash-flow channel of monetary policy (Reserve Bank
of Australia, 2012; La Cava et al., 2016) (see also figure 5.1 below).
    Are the coefficients still economically significant? The coefficient of -0.048 in column (3)
implies that the 25% of households with the highest debt increases relative to income in 2007
cut their spending from 2007 to 2009 by on average 5% more of their pre-tax income than
households with less debt increases. That seems economically significant.


4.2    The spending-normalization hypothesis for other years
ADJ refer to the regressions in table 3.1 on the change in spending from 2007 to 2009,
divided by (pre-tax) income in 2007, as having the base year 2007. They also test the
spending-normalization hypothesis for other base years than 2007, namely thus whether

      the larger decline in spending among highly indebted households is the result of
      a spending-normalization pattern that is also found in other years than during
      the crises, rather than a causal effect of high debt levels suppressing household
      spending during the crisis. (ADJ, abstract)

    ADJ (table 5, not shown here) show regression results that support the spending-normalization

hypothesis for not only the base year 2007, as in table 3.1, but also for all the base years 2003­
2009.
    Running the same regression as in ADJ on the Australian data for other base years than
2007 is constrained by the fact that durable spending and thereby total spending was only
collected in the HILDA survey for the years 2006­2010. This means that it is only possible
to run the regression for the additional base years 2006 and 2008. The results are reported in
table 4.2, panels a and c. The results for base year 2006 (panel a) are very similar and even
somewhat stronger than that for base year 2007 (panel b). The results for base year 2008
(panel c) is weaker than that for base year 2007. The p-values for the coefficients on high
debt and high debt change in column (2) is 79% and 11%, respectively, so the coefficient on
the latter is close to significant at a 10% level.
    There is certainly no support for the debt-overhang hypothesis. Overall, there is support
for the spending-normalization hypothesis also for the year before and--to some extent--the
year after the base year 2007.


4.3       Interaction between high debt levels and changes
ADJ do not include an interaction term between the debt change and the debt level. An
implicit assumption is then that the effects of the debt change and the debt level are additive
and independent. However, it might be the case that a household that increases its debt a

lower level.
    Table 4.3, column (2) therefore examines the interaction of a high debt level and a high
debt change, by adding a dummy for this. The rejection of the debt-overhang hypothesis and
the support for the spending-normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis is robust
to such an interaction.

5      Relation to the results of Price, Beckers, and La
       Cava (2019)
The focus in the above analysis is whether or not high household debt indebtedness causes
deeper downturns in crises and, more precisely, whether the data is consistent with the debt-
overhang hypothesis or the spending-normalization/debt-financed overspending hypothesis
best explaining the spending cuts during the crisis.
    Price, Beckers, and La Cava (2019) (PBLC) provide an extensive and thorough explo-
ration of the relationship between owner-occupier mortgage debt and the level of spending
in Australia, using detailed HILDA panel data on households, with a different focus. They
focus on the level of spending during more "normal" years, not on the fall in spending
during the crisis years. In particular, they examine whether high levels of household debt
causes a weaker level of spending, what they call a "debt-overhang effect ". This is thus to
be distinguished from the debt-overhang hypothesis, which refers to the effect of high debt
levels on the fall in spending during the crisis years, as in Mian and Sufi (2010) and Dynan
(2012) for the US, ADJ for Denmark, Bunn and Rostom (2014, 2015) for the UK, and the
present paper for Australia.
    PBLC do indeed find evidence of a debt-overhang effect for Australia. They further-
more conclude that this debt-overhang effect is not driven by the "spending-normalization
hypothesis" of ADJ.



                                                       14
   Among several specifications, PBLC estimate a regression of the form

                   Cth = 0 + 1 Dt
                                h          h     h       h   h  h

where Cth denotes spending of household h in year t, Dt  h
                                                          -1 denotes the lagged level of owner-
occupied mortgage debt, Yt denotes disposable income, sand Ah
                             h
                                                                    t-1 denotes the lagged re-
ported home value. The vector Xh   t denotes a set of control variables to summarize the other
observed determinants of spending, including factors associated with a household's perma-
nent income, such as age, education and labour force status. Furthermore,  h denotes a
household fixed effect which captures household characteristics that determine spending but
are plausibly invariant over time (for example, degree of impatience and risk aversion). The
inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) transformation are applied to the main variables of interest,
to allow small, zero, or negative values. This means that estimated coefficients of the main
variables of interest can be interpreted as approximate elasticities.
    PBLC estimate several versions of (5.1), including OLS with and without the household
fixed effect and an IV estimation without the fixed effect, and they conduct multiple robust-
ness tests. Their preferred benchmark estimate of 1 is -0.03, significant at a 5% level, for an
OLS fixed-effect estimation on the sample 2006­2010 with total spending (nondurable plus
durable) as the dependent variable (their table 2, column 8). That is, the estimated (partial)
elasticity of total spending with respect to lagged debt, which can be denoted Ct /Dt-1 ,
is -0.03.
                                                                                 h        h
    PBLC also test the ADJ spending-normalization hypothesis, by adding Dt        -1 - Dt-2 as
a regressor in (5.1). Because of the IHS transformation of the debt levels, this term can be
interpreted as the lagged debt growth rate. The coefficient on the lagged debt growth rate
is close to zero and not significant (PBLC, table 5, column (2)). The estimated elasticity of
spending with respect to lagged debt is unchanged and equal to their benchmark estimate.
They then conclude:

     In contrast to Andersen et al. (2016), we find no evidence that... lagged changes
     in debt explain lower spending today. (p. 20)

   However, PBLC run a different regression than ADJ have run, namely (5.1) with lagged
debt growth added. This is also different from the model equation (2.8). As we have
seen, running the same regression as in ADJ, (3.1), rejects the debt-overhang hypothesis
and supports the spending-normalization/debt-financed overconsumption hypothesis (which
hypotheses then refers to the dependent variable being the fall in spending during the crisis
years, not the level of spending during more normal years).




                                              15
5.1     The marginal propensity to spend out of a higher debt level
Given the PBLC benchmark estimate of the elasticity of spending with respect to debt,
Ct /Dt-1 = -0.03, one can construct an approximate estimate of the aggregate marginal
propensity to spend (MPC) out of a higher (lagged) debt level, Ct /Dt-1 , by using the
relation
                            Ct       Ct C              C
                                  =           = - 0.03 ,                          (5.2)
                           Dt-1     Dt-1 D             D
where C/D is the ratio between average household spending and average household mortgage
debt.
    PBLC state that, from 2006 to 2010, the ratio of annual spending for both indebted and
non-indebted households to owner-occupied mortgage debt averages around 1.05. Using this
in (5.2) results in an MPC of about -0.03 · 1.05 = - 3.2%.
    However, one could argue that the relevant ratio of spending to owner-occupied debt is
that of indebted households, those with mortgage debt, thus excluding non-indebted house-
holds.16 PBLC (table C1, left column) reports annual total spending and mortgage debt
during 2006­2010 for indebted households, from which the spending-to-debt ratio can be
calculated to be
                                C     AUD 50, 346        1
                                   =                 =      .                         (5.3)
                                D     AUD 226, 211      4.5
It follows that the MPC out of a higher debt level for indebted households would be
                              Ct      0.03
                                   =-      = - 0.0067 = - 0.67%.                                      (5.4)
                              Dt-1    4.5
    This is arguably a rather small number. It may be instructive to compare with what
MPC follows from the (wealthy) hand-to-mouth household discussed in section 2, which by
(2.2) is given by Ct /Dt-1 = - it , where it is the mortgage interest rate paid in year t.
    Figure 5.1 shows that Australian mortgage rates were on average about 7.5% during 2006­
2010, the sample period of PBLC, which might suggest a marginal propensity to spend out
of a higher debt level for indebted HTM households of about -7.5%, an order of magnitude
larger than the estimate -0.67% in (5.4) and about double the PBLC estimate of -3.2%.
    We furthermore see that mortgage rates fell quickly by 3.8 percentage points from a peak
of 9.6% in August 2008 to a trough of 5.8% in April 2009. During this period, the Reserve
Bank of Australia cut its policy rate, the cash rate, by 4.25 percentage points from 7.25%
to 3%. With the typical Australian mortgage having variable rates, this improved the cash
flow of indebted households, which supported spending, in line with the Australian cash-flow
channel of monetary policy.17
  16
     According to Australian Bureau of Statistics (2018), in 2015­16 only about a third of Australian
households had mortgage debt.

6     Conclusion
The new results for Australian microdata presented here reject the "debt-overhang hypothe-
sis" --that households cut back more on their spending in a crisis when they have higher levels
of outstanding mortgage debt (Dynan, 2012). The results instead support the "spending-
normalization hypothesis" of Andersen, Duus, and Jensen (2016), what can also be called the
"debt-financed overspending" hypothesis--that the correlation between high pre-crisis house-
hold indebtedness and subsequent spending falls during the crisis reflected high debt-financed
spending pre-crisis and a return to normal spending during the crisis. As further discussed
in Svensson (2019, 2020), this is consistent with the correlation reflecting debt-financed over-
spending through what Muellbauer (2012) calls the "housing-collateral household-demand"
and Mian and Sufi (2018) the "debt-driven household demand" channel.
    It follows that it was not high household indebtedness in itself that caused the fall in
spending during the crisis in Australia, Denmark, and the UK.18 There were some highly
indebted households that cut down their spending more than others did, but this is better
explained by these households having before the crisis engaged in a mortgage-financed over-
spending relative to income. This overspending could not continue during the crisis, and
spending fell.
    At the same time, increased mortgage loans for consumption purposes contributed to
institutional features of the Australian mortgage market which imply that the relationship between interest
rates and borrower cash flows is not as straightforward as suggested by the theory.

many households being highly indebted. Mortgage financing of overspending thus caused
both the fall in spending and to a certain extent the high indebtedness. This created a cor-
relation between high indebtedness and subsequent consumption declines--but not a causal
relationship between them.
    It follows that high household debt-to-income ratios in themselves contain little or no
information about risks of a spending fall associated with household indebtedness. This is
in contrast to what seems to be taken for granted by macroprudential authorities in many
countries, as well as by the international organizations that comment on countries' macropru-
dential policy. As discussed in Svensson (2019, 2020), in order to assess such risks, among
other things, one needs to examine whether there is any evidence of an active housing-
collateral channel and any mortgage-financed overspending of macroeconomic significance--
an aggregate debt-financed consumption boom, for example resulting in a low household
saving rate. As Muellbauer (2012) emphasizes, the strength of the housing-collateral chan-
nel varies considerably between countries depending on differences in the structure of housing
and mortgage markets as well as in customs and preferences. Furthermore, if there is signifi-
cant housing-equity withdrawal, it matters whether this is used for consumption purposes--
whether mortgages are effectively used as consumption loans--or for other purposes, such as
home improvement, paying off expensive consumer loans, or investment in financial assets,
including keeping a liquidity buffer.
    These issues for Sweden and their relevance for Swedish macroprudential policy are fur-
ther discussed in Svensson (2019, 2020).
    It remains to test these hypothesis for other countries than Australia, Denmark, and
the UK. I would not be surprised if rejection of the debt-overhang hypothesis and support
for the debt-financed overconsumption hypothesis is a pretty general result.

Appendix
A         Amortization
This appendix shows how to introduce amortization into the simple model of debt-financed
overconsumption. We start from (2.1),

                                     Ct = EIt - it Dt-1 + Dt .                      (2.1 revisited)

With amortization, we now have

                               Dt  Dt - Dt-1 = - at Dt-1 + Rt ,                               (A.1)

where at satisfying 0  at < 1 is the rate of mandated amortization (contracted or regulated)
and Rt denotes refinancing if Rt > 0 and voluntary additional amortization if Rt < 0.
    The household is assumed to be subject to a loan-to-value constraint, if it wants to
refinance,
                                    Dt  Pt if Rt > 0.                                  (A.2)
Restricting the LTV constraint to apply only when there is refinancing implies the realistic
property of LTV constraints that the household does not have to amortize more than the
mandatory amortization if housing prices fall and cause the LTV constraint to be violated.
(Again, there are no margin calls for mortgage debt, beyond the mandatory amortization.)
    Again, because the household is constrained to consume less than it would prefer, it takes
out the maximum possible mortgage--maximizes HEW--each year. If the LTV constraint
is not violated at an unchanged debt level, the household will refinance to make or keep the
LTV constraint binding. If housing prices have fallen so as to cause the LTV constraint to be
violated, the household will reduce the debt level according to the mandated amortization,

                                      Pt              if Dt-1  Pt ,
                              Dt =                                                            (A.3)
                                      (1 - at )Dt-1   if Dt-1 > Pt .

       By (2.6), disposable income excluding imputed rental income, DIXt , is given by

                                       DIXt = EIt - it Dt-1 ,                       (2.6 revisited)

and the budget constraint can be written

                                        Ct = DIXt + Dt .                            (2.7 revisited)

(Non-housing) consumption (spending) equals DIX plus the change in debt.
    Figure A.1a shows the same example as in figure 2.1a, except that there is a 2% amorti-
zation rate.19 Nevertheless, the outcome is the same as in figure 2.1a without amortization.
When housing prices rise and the LTV constraint is not violated, the household refinances
to cover both the amortization and a net debt incease to keep the LTV ratio at the cap
  19
    The parameters and initial values are as in section 2,  = 85%, P0 = P1 = 440, and D0 = P0 = 374,
and EIt = EI = 110, and it = i = 4% for t  0, with the addition of at = a = 2% for t  0.

of 85%. Again, the household can increase its consumption substantially above DIX from
year 2. DIX is less than earned income by the interest payments. When debt rises, DIX falls
further below earned income.
    When prices stop growing, the household can no longer maintain the high and growing
consumption, but it can still keep its mortgage constant at the binding LTV constraint by
refinancing to cover the amortization.20
    Figure A.1b shows the same example as in figure 2.1b, but with the addition of the
mandatory amortization rate of 2%. Here, when prices drop by 25% in year 11 and resume
to grow at 4%, the LTV constraint is violated for the years 11­15. This prevents refinancing,
and the household has to reduce its consumption further, below DIX, to amortize 2% per
year. Consumption therefore drops by a full 29% instead of by 19% in figure A.1a. The
amortization reduces debt, which falls until year 15. Meanwhile, DIX and consumption rise
a bit, due to the debt service falling a bit with lower debt. In year 16, the prices have risen
and debt has fallen so much that LTV constraint is no longer violated, and the household
can resume its refinancing and debt-financed overconsumption relative to DIX.
    In figures A.1a and b, we can still interpret year 11 as a crisis year and year 10 as a
pre-crisis year. The consumption change from year 10 to year 11 is in these examples by
  20
    See Hull (2017) and Svensson (2016) for further discussion of how refinancing or excess initial borrowing
can neutralize the effect of mandatory amortization requirements.

                                                       23
equation (2.1) given by

                  C11 - C10 = C11 = EI11 - i D10 + (D11 - D10 )                          (A.4)

   Furthermore, for the example in figure A.1a, the right-hand side equals that of (2.8), so
                                                 g
                              C11 - C10 = - i       D10 - D10                            (A.5)
                                                1+g
in figure A.1a, where we again use that that EIt and it = i are constant and that iD10 =
igD9 = igD10 /(1 + g ), where g is the constant growth rate of housing prices and debt up
to year 10. Furthermore, D11 = 0, because refinancing in year 11 equals the amortization
and keeps the debt level constant.
     However, in the experiment in figure A.1b, there is no refinancing in year 11, so by (A.1)
we have D11 = -aD10 , and instead of (A.5) we have
                                               g
                           C11 - C10 = -( i       + a)D10 - D10                          (A.6)
                                              1+g

    With i = g = 4% and a = 2%, on the right-hand side of (A.5) the coefficient of D10
is only minus 0.0015, whereas on the right-hand side of (A.6) it is minus 0.0415, larger in
magnitude, but still much smaller than the coefficient of minus 1 on D10 .
    So, in these simple examples, also when there is mandated amortization, the consumption
fall during the "crisis" overwhelmingly depends on the pre-crisis debt increase, D10 , not
on the pre-crisis debt level, D10 .
