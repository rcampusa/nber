     The Information in the Term Structure: Some Further Results




                                ABSTRACT



    This paper provides some refinements and updating of Fama's (1984)

evidence on the information in the term structure about future spot

interest rate movements. First, it uses econometric techniques that

properly correct standard errors for overlapping data and for conditional

heteroscedasticity. Second, it makes use of a new data set that has some

potential advantages over Fama's and which has more recent data.

Overall, the results are in broad agreement with those of Fama. The term

structure does help predict spot interest rate moventents several months

into the future. Indeed, updating Fama's results indicates that the

forecast power of forward rates is generally higher during the October

1982 to June 1986 period than it was during the sample periods Fama examined.

     In a recent important paper, Fama (1984) resurrects the view that

the term structure of interest rates contains information about the

future movements of spot interest rates. Using ordinary least squares

estimation, Fama finds evidence that the forward rate—spot rate

differential helps predict changes in the spot rate, while the difference

between adjacent maturity nrward rates helps predict the future

one-month changes in the spot rate.

     This paper provides some refinements of Fama's regression evidence.

First, it uses econometric techniques that properly correct standard

errors for overlapping data and for conditional heteroscedasticity.

Second, it uses an econometric procedure which can exploit additional

information in the term structure. Finally, it makes use of a new data

set that has some potential advantages over Fama's and which has more

recent data.'




                      II. The Methodology and Data



     In examining the information in the term structure about future

movements in spot interest rates, Fama runs the following ordinary least

squares (OLS) regressions:

                                                2(Ft - F(t_l)t)     +


where,
                    = the     one—month spot rate observed at time tfl-1,
             Ft = the         forward rate for month t+t            observed   at time t.

The    error term in these regressions will be serially correlated when t >
2   because the error term, which can be thought of as a forecast error,
is realized only after t            —I      periods. Thus           is likely to be
correlated with                                            and therefore fl_' will follow
a MA(t—2) process.        Because of the resulting serial correlation, the OLS
standard    errors of the coefficients -—               which is what Fama (1984) reports
——    will not be correct.
        A solution to this problem is provided by Hansen and 1{odrick (1980)
who develop the following consistent estimate of the variance—covariance
matrix of the parameter estimates.

             Vt = the variance—covariance matrix for the parameter
                    estimates of the equation t,
                = the matrix of explanatory variables for equation t, which
                    is Txk.
                    (T = the number of observations, k = the number of

                    explanatory variables).

                 = the variance—covariance matrix of the residuals


and the (i,j)th element of the estimated                is defined as


                           T
(4)         w(i,J) =       I                                  for p < q
                          59V11

                          = 0                                 otherwise

where p =   Ii   -
                     ii   and q =   the   order of the hA process, t - 2.


      Recause researchers have found that interest rate volatility has

changed markedly in the postwar sample period that Fama examined, the

error terms in equations (1) and (2) are likely to be conditionally

heteroscedastic.2 To obtain correct standard errors when there is

conditional heteroscedasticity, the Ilansen—ilodrick variance-covariance

matrix needs to be modified using the method described by White (1980).

This involves redefining w(i,j) to be,

(5)         w(i,j) =                                          for   p   q


                          = 0                                 otherwise



     2There is some evidence for conditional heteroscedasticity in the
regression equations here, but it is not always very stronj. In Fama's
February 1959 to July 1982 sample period when t = 2, for example, White's
(1980) test for c2nditional heteroscedasticity yields a test statistic
(distributed as x (1)) of 3.65. This statistic indicates a rejection of
conditional hoinoscedasticity at the 10% level but not at the 5% level.
On the other hand, Engl&s (1982) test for autoregressive conditional
heteroscedasticity, in which squared residuals are regressed on one lag
of the squared residuals, provides strong evidence for conditional
heteroscedasticity: in the February 1959 to July 1982 sam?le period when
t = 2, the lagrange multiplier statistic (distributed as x (1)) equals
21.95 which is highly significant. To check on the robustness of the
results, I also have calculated the standard errors for the coefficients
of regressions (1) and (2) under the assumption of conditional
homoscedasticity. Although the calculated standard errors do sometimes
differ appreciably from those found in the text (sometimes larger and
sometimes smaller), the conclusions from these results are the same as
the conclusions discussed in the text.

        A problem with the Ifansen—Jiodrick estimate of the variance-

covariance matrix and the variant allowing for conditional hetero-

scedasticity is that it need not be positive—definite in finite samples.

In practice this means that standard errors of coefficients and test

statistics may turn out to be negative. Newey and West (1985) have

proposed a solution to this problem which involves down-weighting the

off-diagonal elements of the        matrix to produce a consistent estimate

of the variance-covariance matrix which is guaranteed to be

positive—definite. The Newey-West estimate of the variance-covariance

matrix allowing for conditional heteroscedasticity calculates the w1(i,j)

elements of         as follows:




(6)         w(i,i) = [1     -
                                p/(q+1)]               for p   q


                      = 0                             otherwise

                information is available in the term structure that is
       Additional

not being used in ordinary least squares estimation because
contemporaneous errors in forecasting changes in the spot rate may be
highly correlated for different t's. Therefore, seemingly unrelated
regression (SIJR) estimates of the system of equations with different t's
may produce substantial gains in efficiency. Indeed in other research on

the information in the term structure, Ilishkin (1987) finds that taking

into account the      cross-equation correlation of the error terms resulted
in    the estimated standard errors of coefficients falling by over 50%.

       The SUR standard error estimates will again be incorrect because of

the serial correlation of the error terms. The Hansen—Hodrick,

Newey-West estimate of the variance—covariance matrix allowing for
                                               S




conditional heteroscedasticity can be generalized to apply to a seemingly

unrelated regression system of & equations as follows. The StJR method

assumes that the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals is

where,



             =   variànce—covariance matrix of the contemporaneous
                 residuals from the            equations,

             = TxT identity matrix.



      Using the Choleski decomposition Xl =            P'P,   we get the GLS (i.e.,

the SUR) estimates by premultiplying the system by PHI,. and then proceed

with OLS estimation. Allowing for conditional heteroscedasticity, the

Mansen-Hodrick variance—covariance matrix of the parameter estimates of

the transformed system is then,

                          —1'. d'   % % ' —l
(7)       V =    (X'X)      x'qrj'X(X'X)


where,
           V = variance—covariance matrix of estimated coefficients

             =
                 (PX,)r.
Writing the variance-covariance matrix out results in


           V = (X'

tiaking use of the fact that P'P =   11        and flq' =   U, the Newey-iJest

modification of flfl' matrix, the equation above can be rewritten as,


(9)          V = CX'
                     (f'I)X) 1X' (f1UT)Q(f1UT)X(X'               (ZIT)X)1
with the (i,j)th element of the U             block of U defined as follows,



             Wmn(J) = [1                               fori>j andp<q

                      = [1 -   p/(q+1)]P               for i C   j and   p >   q




                      = 0                             otherwise


where p =    Ii —. ii and q = the order       of the MA process for the error term

of equation in and     = the order of the NA process for the error term            of
equation    a.

      As in Fama (1984), the end-of-month Treasury bill rate data was

obtained from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) at the

University of Chicago and the one—month bill was defined to have a

maturity of 30.4 days, the two—month bill 60.8 days, on up to the six

month bill with a maturity of 182.5 days. For each defined maturity the

interest rate was interpolated from the bills that were closest to the

defined maturity. In effect, this means that the slope of the term

structure is assumed to be constant between these two bills. Fama (1984)

instead chooses a bill that has a maturity closest to six months and then

keeps on taking the interest rate from this same bill every month as its

maturity shortens in order to get interest rates on one to six-month

bills. In effect, Fama is assuming that the slope of the term structure

is zero around the desired maturity of the bill. The procedure used here
                                      7




which assumes the slope around the desired maturity is constant rather

than zero is less restrictive, which is an advantage when you are

examining the ability to predict future spot rate movements as in this

paper. However, Fama's procedure makes use of actual transaction price

data, which is an advantage when you are focusing on predicting future

premiums as in his paper.




                              III. The Results



     Table 1, which corresponds to Fama's (1984) Table 4, shows the

estimated r,   their   standard errors and the R2's for regression equation

(1), which regresses the change in the spot rate on the forward-

spot differential. The first six rows contain the results for the sample

periods in Fama (1984), and the coefficient estimates are typically quite

close to those found there. The standard errors of the coefficients,

however, are sometimes quite different from those found in Fama (1984))

For example, in Fama's full sample period, February 1959 to July 1982,

the standard errors of the coefficients for t = 2 to 6 were .07, .10,

.12, .10, and .10; the corresponding standard errors in the first row of

Table I are .11, .18, .24, .15, and .11, which are larger and in one case

is twice as large.4 In general, however, the conclusion from the results




     3This stems from the estimation technique and not from the
modification of Fain's data set. Ordinary least squares estimates wtth
the modified data set used here produced standard error estimates that
were very close to those reported in Fama (1984).

is similar to Fama's. In all cases, the forward rate-spot differential

for one month ahead, F2t -          has significant predictive power for the
                             R÷1,
change in the spot rate one month ahead, Rt+2 -
                                                   R÷i.   The forward-spot

differential also has significant explanatory power for changes in spot

rates further out in the future, although the number of significant

B-coefficients (five) is le-s than in Fama's Table 4 (nine).

    The last four rows of Table 1 contain results for a longer sample

period than Fama's, January 1959 to June 1986 and for three subperiods

January 1959 to September 1979, October 1979 to September 1982, and

October 1982 to June 1986. These subperiods are examined because the

Federal Reserve altered its techniques of monetary control in October

1979 and October 1982 and because previous research [Huizinga and Ilishkin

(1986) and Roley (1986fl have documented shifts in the stochastic process

of interest rates in October 1979 and October 1982. The results in these

sample periods indicate that forward rates do have predictive power for

spot rates several months in the future. The D—coefficient estimates for

one, two and three mouths in the future (I   =2   to 4) are statistically

significant at the 1% level in both the pre-October 1979 and post-October

1982 sample periods. However, since the B-coefficient estimates for t =

2 to 4 are higher in the October 1979to September 1982 period than in

the pre-October 1979 period, the failure to find statistical significance

when t = 3 and 4 in the October 1979 to September 1982 period is probably




     4llowever,   it is not always-the case that the estimated standard
errors here are   larger than those found in Fama (1984). For example, the
standard errors   in the February 1919 to July 1982 sample are smaller in
Table I than in   Fama's Table 4.
                                         9




due to the shortness of the sample period, which is only three years

long. Indeed, the p-coefficient estimates are generally higher in both

the post—October 1979 periods than in the pre—October 1979 period, as are

the R2's of the regressions. These results provide some support to the

conclusion in liardouvelis (1986) that the term structure has more

predictive power for spot rates after October 1979 than before.

        Table 2 provides Wald tests for whether the coefficients remain

unchanged in Fama's five subperiods and the three subperiods with breaks

in October 1979 and October 1982. The tests do not indicate that the

coefficients change over Fama's five subperiods; the marginal

significance levels of the test statistics are quite high, indicating

that the probability of obtaining the value of the test statistic or

higher under the null hypothesis that the coefficient estimates are equal

in the five periods is high. The tests for whether the coefficients

change in October 1979 and October 1982 do provide some evidence that the

a and      coefficients shift when t   = 2 or 3. However, tests for changes
in the p—coefficients alone do not provide significant rejections of the

equality of the n—coefficients in the three subperiods. Overall, there

is little support for instability of the information in the term

structure about future spot rate movements. However, it should be

recalled that the Wald tests reported here may not have very great

statistical power, and in addition, there is some evidence that for one

and two months in the future, the information in the term structure did

change with the shift in the Federal Reserve's operating procedures in

October 1979 and October 1982.

        The results on the marginal predictive power of forward rates on the

one-month changes in future spot rates is obtained from the equation (2)

regression of the future one—month changes in the spot rate, Rt+ -

          on the forward rate spread, Ft -   F(t—i).   Table 3 (which

corresponds to Fama's (1984) Table 5) provides the n-coefficients, their

standard errors and the R2's for these regressions. Although the results

are similar to those of Fama (1984), they are slightly less favorable to

the view that the term structure has marginal predictive power for

changes in the spot rate that are more than one month in the future. For

two months ahead or more Ct > 3), only four n-coefficients are

significant and positive in the Faoa sample periods and one coefficient

is even significantly negative; in contrast, Fama found six significant

positive coefficients and no significant negative coefficients. The

results for the post-October 1982 sample period, however, provide

additional evidence that the term structure has marginal predictive power

for changes in the spot rate more than one month in the future. The

results in the last row of Table 3 indicate that forward rate spreads

provide significant predictive power for the change in the spot rate up

to three months in the future (r C 4), a result also found in Hardouvelis

(1986).

     Table 4 which provides tests for shifts in the coefficients of the

Table 3 regressions suggests that there is more coefficient instability

for the marginal prediction equations of Table 3 than there were for the

regressions in Table 1.   In the first row of the table, there are two

significant rejections of the equality of the n—coefficients in the Fama

subperiods; while the last two rows of the table indicate that for I =

2, 3 and 4 there are significant shifts in the coefficients in October
1979 and October 1982.

    Tables S and 6 provide the seemingly unrelated regression (SUB)

estimates of the n-coefficients for the regression equations (1) and (2).

In contrast to results in Nishkin (1987) which finds large gains in

efficiency from SUB estimation when examining the information in the term

structure about future inflation, the estimated standard errors do not

decline substantially when SUB estimation is used here.5 An explanation

for the lack of success of the seemingly unrelated regression tecluiiqae

to produce large gains in efficiency is that the error terms of the

regression equations examined here are not that highly correlated across

equations. The contemporaneous correlations of the error terms across

equations in the Table S regressions ranges from .4 to .9, while the

correlations are near zero for the Table 6 regressions. Not

surprisingly, then, the Tables S and 6 results are very similar to those

found in Tables I and 3.




                             IV. Conclusion



     This paper provides some refinements and updating of Faina's (1984)

evidence on the information in the term   structure   about future spot

interest rate movements. Overall, the results are in broad agreement

with those of Fama. The term structure does help predict spot interest

rate movements several months into the future. Indeed, updating Fama's




     5lndeed, in some cases the estimated standard errors are higher in
Tables S and 6 than they are in Tables 1 and 3. Even though the SUB
estimates are asymptotically more efficient than OLS estimates, in small
samples estimated SUR standard errors can turn out to be larger than OLS
standard errors.
