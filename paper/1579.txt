                                   ABSTRACT



      This paper focuses on one aspect of long—term labor contracts——

employer—provided pensions——in order to develop a better understanding of

how such contracts affect employment patterns of older workers. Pensions

are one of the few elements of the employment package which explicitly

describe long term agreements between workers and their employers; con-

sequently they offer a unique opportunity to study these agreements. The

present paper combines labor supply and contract theory to examine pension

responses to changes in taxes, Social Security benefits, and the federal

government's recent decision to lift the age of mandatory retirement.

Evidence on a longitudinal sample of pension plans from 1960 to the present

suggests:

      (1) During the 1960—70 period, Social Security increases generated

changes in pensions favoring early retirement; and

      (2) During the 1970—80 period, some plans reduced private pension

benefits in response to the raising of the mandatory retirement age.

     In    the last few years analysts interested in long—term worker/firm

relationships have made a number of theoretical advances.'     Despite this

volume of theoretical work, empirical analysts have lagged far behind in

examining the form and function of real—world long—term agreements between

workers and firms. The present paper focuses on one aspect of the lifetime

labor contract—-employer—provided pensions——in order to develop a better

understanding of how such contracts operate.

     Private pensions are one of the few elements of the employment package

in which employers spell out their long—term promises to employers.

Because written documents containing pension promises are readily avail-

able, it is possible to quantify levels and changes in the value of

employers' promises regarding this important form of deferred compen-

sation.2      In this paper we develop a new longitudinal data set on

defined benefit pension plans covering the twenty—year period between 1960

and 1980, and evaluate how and why employers' pension promises changed

through time. Of special interest are private pension responses to

exogenous changes including Social Security, income and payroll taxes, and

the federal government's decision to lift the age at which mandatory

retirement can he imposed. Determining whether and how pension structures

adapted to these regulatory policies provides unusual insight about the

nature of these long—term contracts.


   See Azariadis and Stiglitz (1983) for a survey of the recent theoretical
   literature.

2 Detailed information has been provided to workers since the passage of the
   Employee Retirement Income Security Act in 1974 (ERISA); many firms also
   produced extremely detailed pension documents since the inception of their
   pension plans in the l940s and 1950s.
     It should be noted   at the outset that we do not   focus   on the Employee

Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, which set national stan-

dards for private pension eligibility and vesting provisions, accrual

formulas prior to reaching retirement age, and funding and insurance of

pension benefits. These regulations clearly affected the security of

retirement benefits immediately, but probably did not alter benefit levels

and profiles over the period under study.'

     The plan of the paper is as follows: Section 1 sketches some of the

key changes in the pension environment attributable to regulatory reforms

over the period 1960—1980. Section 2 outlines the theoretical model used

to predict how pensions responded to such changes in the regulatory

environment. Section 3 presents empirical findings. In a final section

we discuss the implications of the results for contract theory and policy

analysis.


1. jes in the Pension Environment: 1960 to 1980


      This section examines three major changes In the pension environment

between 1960 and 1980: mandatory retirement age changes, tax increases,

and Social Security benefit adjustments.

     Mandatory retirement has received considerable attention in the labor

economics literature, stemming mainly from the 1978 amendments to the Age

Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) which raised the permissable

mandatory retirement age from 65 to 70. Considerably less attention was

devoted to the original ADEA of 1967. This Act protected individuals ages


1   Because ERISA reduced the riskiness of vested pension benefits, employers
    may have an incentive to reduce workers' wage profiles in the long run.
    Ehrenberg (1980) finds evidence of a wage—pension risk tradeoff.
                                                                              3




40—65 from employment discrimination; age 65 was selected as the upper

limit because at the time it was the commonly specified age of mandatory

retirement in the private sector. It is interesting to note, however, that

the Supreme Court interpreted the 1967 Act as permitting mandatory retire--

ment prior to age 65 in the special case when the pension plan required it.

The 1978 amendments explicitly disallowed this interpretation of the

original Act, at the same time raising the protected age from 65 to 70.

Initially, economists predicted that the 1978 reform would bring about

changes in compensation aimed at achieving the same result (i.e. retire-

ment at age 65);l since then, however, a few studies have found that

mandatory retirement provisions were often not binding since a majority of

workers retired before age 65.2 The net effect of mandatory retirement

rules on pension structures is thus still open to debate.

     The 1960—80 period saw other changes in the pension environment in

addition to the revised mandatory retirement rules. Between 1960 and 1970

income and payroll tax rates rose though real net earnings held their own.

Between 1970 and 1980, in contrast, tax rates continued to rise, and in

addition, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security payroll tax

nearly quadrupled, going from $7800 to $25,900 (in contrast to the slower

growth of $4800 in 1960 to $7800 in 1979). As a result real earnings for

the average worker were only slightly higher in 1980 than in 1970.

     Along with changes in taxes came reforms in the way Social Security

benefits were computed. Benefits have always been based on workers'

earnings histories, and as noted above, the maximum earnings recognized for


   For example, Lazear (1979), Burkhauser and Quinn (1980).

Social Security purposes rose over the period, with most of the increase

occurring between 1970 and 1980. A retiree's basic monthly benefit, called

the Primary Insurance Amount or PIA, also increased by 39% in nominal terms

due to legislative reforms.'

     During the second decade two major alterations were made in the way

Social Security benefits were calculated. First, provisions were made for

automatic adjustments in benefit levels to keep pace with inflation.

Second, there were statutory increases in the multiples applied to earnings

and huge increases in the amount of earnings counted.   Finally, in 1977 a

new method of calculating benefits was legislated using a much simpler

formula based on indexed earnings.2 The cumulative effect of all these

changes was a nominal increase of 139%.

     The combined effect of these changes in the pension environment can be

illustrated with the help of Table 1. This table presents average net

earnings and Social Security profiles in 1960, 1970 and 1980 using the tax

and Social Security rules in effect at the time. All dollar values are

reported in 1970 dollars for ease of comparison; a discussion of how the

data were created appears in the appendix.

     Between 1960 and 1970, the most significant change was a large upward

shift in Social Security benefits both in annual and present value terms.

Annual benefits rose 33% in real terms for retirement at age 62and 28% for

retirement at age 65, while the present value of the real Social Security


1 The PIA is calculated in terms of a percentage of earnings. In 1960 the
   PIA equalled 58.85% of the first $110 earned, plus 21.4% of up to $290
   additional earnings. By 1970, the formula had been adjusted so that the
   PIA equalled 81.83% of the first $110, plus 29.76% of the next $290, plus
   27.8l. of the next $150, plus 32.69% of the next $100.

2 In 1980 the PIA equalled 90% of the first $194, plus 35% of the next $977,
   plus 15% of additional earnings up to the maximum.

benefit stream rose 24% and 20% for retirement at ages 62 and 65 respec-

tively. Between 1970 and 1980, Social Security benefit formulas rose 10%

for age 62 retirees, but dropped a bit for those deferring retirement until

age 65. Expected Social Security present value streams declined slightly at

age 62 (10%) and by a great deal (27%) at age 65.   This occurred primarily

because the system in 1980 rewarded deferred retirement less than it did

ten years previously. In other words, the slope of the Social Security

present value profile flattened and even became negative over the period

1970 and 1980.

     The other significant change during 1970—1980 was the increase in the

permissable mandatory retirement age. This is not evident from Table 1

because any changes in response to this would be expected in private

pension rules. Empirical evidence on pension response to regulatory change

is the subject of discussion in Section 3 of this paper.


2.   Predicting Pension Responses


     The regulatory changes described above clearly altered the economic

incentives confronting older workers in significant ways over the period

1960—80. By drawing on prior labor supply research, it is possible to

forecast how these budget set changes modified workers' desired retirement

patterns. In turn, contract theory can be used to predict how these new

behavioral outcomes would have elicited changes in the structure of

compensation packages offered to older employees. This section derives

predictions about the likely retirement age changes and consequent pension

changes expected in response to the regulatory reforms of the 1960—80

period. Actual empirical patterns are compared with the predictions in the

next section.
                                                                              7




        A. The 1960—1970 Period



        As noted in Section 1, the most significant change affecting the

 pension environment experienced during the 1960s was the large upward shift

 in   Social   Security benefits generating over 20%larger Social Security

 present values for an average worker. Understanding how such a significant

 change in older workers' budget sets would affect retirement patterns is

 facilitated by the use of an intertemporal labor supply model developed in

 Fields and Mitchell (1984). Here the worker's problem Is posed as one

 where the individual selects a retirement age to maximize his utility,

 which is a function of consumption (C) and leisure during his retirement

 years (RET):

        U = U(C,KET) where U1, U2 > 0 and U12, U21 < 0.       (1)

 Two constraints on the individual must be incorporated: First, there is a

 time constraint such that the time devoted to leisure plus the time spent

 working must not exceed time remaining until death (RET     T —    R).1
 Additionally there is the constraint that lifetime consumption must not

 exceed available wealth as of the date the retirement computations are

 made,2 plus the present discounted value of expected future income

 (PDVY). The PDVY term is composed of three parts in the analysis below:

 one part due to (net) labor market earnings over the employed period




 1    The problem is described in the certainty case for clarity here; the
      empirical work below replaces fixed and known life expectancies with
      survival probabilities which change with age.

• 2 The empirical analysis below assumes that detailed retirement plans are
    made when the worker attains age 60, since evidence suggest that retirement
    planning occurs fairly late in life for most workers.
                                                                               8




(PDVE),1 a second portion due to (net) Social Security payments over the

retirement period (PDVSS), and the last part due to (net) private pension

payments from retirement until death (PDVPP).2 These are readily

summarized as follows:3

        PDVY (R) = PDVE(R) + PDVPP(R) + PDVSS(R)                     (2)

        where


        PDVE (R) =1R E(t) ertdt, E(t) > 0 Vt;

        PDVPP KR) R' P(t,R)etdt;
     PDVSS (R) R' S(t,R)edt;
and R      year of retirement, t =   year in question, and 0 = base year for

retirement computations (age 60).

     All income components are subscripted with R to emphasize the direct

dependence of all present value streams on the worker's retirement age. In

the case of earnings, this dependence is straightforward as the formula

indicates. In the case of pensions and Social Security payments, the

annual benefits themselves vary depending on when the worker leaves his

job. For instance in some private pension plans, early retirees (at 60 or

61) receive a special supplement until they become eligible to file for

Social Security at age 62, whereupon the supplement is reduced to zero.

Alternatively, workers deferring benefits until after age 65 may sometimes


1 We abstract from part—time work or work after retirement from a main job
   since these practices were rare for the workers covered by our pension
   plans (See Mitchell and Fields, 1984). Post—retirement work has been
   examined by Gustman and Steinmeier (1984).

2 Income and payroll taxes are subtracted from all relevant income streams as
   explained in the appendix.

  Bequests may readily be incorporated in the theoretical model but are
  ignored here since our data contain no information on such amounts.
                                                                                  9




 receive special late retirement credits. In general, defined benefit
pension structures are not actuarially neutral, as the empirical work below

will demonstrate.

     Solving first order conditions and equating them reveals that the

worker's optimal retirement date is that which sets equal the marginal

utility of additional income gained by working another year, with the

marginal utility of leisure foregone from another year's work. This

optimal retirement age is defined implicitly as follows:




                                RR RR RT

                                                                         d
                                                                        Rt    I



         dU
     —        (C,RET) — 0                                               (3)


where R =     eT.   R* is the optimal retirement age solving equation (1).

     Evaluating the effect of increased generosity in Social Security

benefits such as those experienced during the l960s becomes straightforward

in this context. Cast in their simplest form, the benefit changes of the

first decade shifted out older workers' present value streams without

materially affecting their slopes, since levels rose but the rewards for

deferring retirement stayed practically the same. Figure 1 illustrates

this pattern graphically by depicting the tradeoff between years of leisure

foregone (years worked) and increments in income from Social Security

benefits.

     As is evident from the Figure, this restructuring of Social Security

would be predicted to have a powerful income effect increasing workers'

demand for leisure at older ages and hence encouraging them to retire

earlier than prior to the reform. In terms of equation 3, this occured

because the rise in benefits lowered the marginal utility of consumption

    from income and raised the marginal utility of leisure. In other words,

    raising Social Security benefits as was done during the 1960s induced

workers to retire earlier, holding all else constant.

        Given that older workers' desired retirement ages would most likely

have become earlier during the 1960s as a result of the changes in their

budget sets, it remains to ask how compensation structures might have

adapted to the new workforce patterns. In order to do so, it is necessary

to assume that employers would have responded to the legislated changes by

altering their pension structures (if they altered anything), rather than

by changing wage patterns. This seems most reasonable for the relatively

short period under consideration, since past earnings for workers nearing

retirement age would have been fixed and unalterable at that point.'

        Employers operating under a long—term contract are posited to equate

workers' lifetime compensation with their lifetime value of marginal

product streams. Using Lazear's (1984) notation, the firm specifies a

retirement age R+ at which lifetime productivity (V(R+)) at least equals

the sum of wages plus pensions:

        V(R) =   PDVE   (R) ÷ PDVP (R').                       (4)

When the workers' optimal retirement age R* coincides with the firm's

optimal R+, neither employers nor workers have an incentive to alter the

status quo.

        When the pension environment was altered in ways such as described

above, the firm/worker equilibrium would have been disturbed such that


1     In the short run, wages for new entrants could react to the policy changes,
      and certainly in the longer run, all elements of the compensation package
      including wages could be altered. However our focus on older workers and
      the relatively short period under consideration in the empirical section
      limits our attention to changes in pension profiles alone.
                                                                             12




lifetime productivity no longer equalled lifetime compensation. For

instance, raising Social Security payments during the 1960s would have

induced many workers to select an individually optimal retirement date

(R*_t) earlier than the date which had initially been optimal from both the

fit-rn's and the worker's viewpoint. At that new date, lifetime YMP   exceeded
the value of compensation paid by the firm:

     v(R*_t) > PDVE (R*_t) ÷ PDVP (R*_t).                   (5)

Maintaining the assumption that earnings streams for workers nearing

retirement were fixed, the only variable subject to change would have been

the value of the retiree's pension. Of course employers would have

preferred to leave the pension structure unchanged since they would then

receive an unexpected excess of worker output over compensation, as a

result of the reforms in Social Security. On the other hand, employees

would have attempted to equalize lifetime compensation and productivity by

demanding a higher pension value at the new, earlier retirement date R*_t.

     Which outcome was more likely depended, in part, on employees' ability

to induce employers to share the windfall gains generated as a result of

the reforms and subsequent change in behavior. Presumably In unionized

firms, workers could have forced some redistribution of these unanticipated

gains, both because of union strength per se and because unionized firms

tend to be larger and therefore more sensitive to reputation costs asso-

ciated with reneging on long—term promises of a contractual nature.' Thus

the increase in Social Security benefits of the 1960s, by inducing workers

to desire earlier retirement, generated an unanticipated surplus of

productivity over lifetime compensation for employers with long—term

   contract models.

    contracts. Workers most able to capture a portion of the windfall would be

    expected to demand higher pension levels at younger retirement ages, so as

    to equalize lifetime pay and output. In practice this would also tend to

    he accompanied by pension benefit structures providing more income for

    retirement at earlier ages, and perhaps less than actuarially fair amounts

    for those deferring rtirement. Unorganized employees would have desired

    the same changes in pension structures though the degree to which they

    could achieve these outcomes would be relatively less.


        B. The_1970—1980 Period


        During the subsequent ten years, three major regulatory changes

altered older workers budget sets: income and payroll taxes increased

dramatically, Social Security rewards for deferring retirement declined,

and the mandatory retirement age was raised to age 7O How desired

retirement patterns responded to these changes can again be sketched with

the aid of equation 3.

        Increased taxes directly reduced earnings available from continued

work by a significant amount.'      A reduction in earnings has a theore-

tically ambiguous impact on optimal retirement ages, since the income

effect implies the worker will remain on the job (purchase less leisure)

while the substitution effect suggests more leisure will be consumed and

retirement will occur sooner. Again earlier empirical work has suggested

that on average, people will respond by retiring earlier.




1
      For example, a 65 year old single worker earning a gross real salary of
      $9500 (1970$) would have taken home eleven percent less in the 1980s than
      in the l970s due to increased taxes.
                                                                                14



     Decreases     in the payoff for deterring retirement under Social Security

would   likewise   have theoretically conflicting influences, since the lower

rewards for waiting to retire would imply earlier retirement but workers

facing diminished income opportunities would tend to work longer. If the

substitution effect dominates as above, earlier retirement would be likely

to be the average response. (See Figure 2).

     In either of these two circumstances, pension structures would tend to

respond to earlier desired retirement ages as above. Again employers would
                                14_                41

less in earnings and pension at that earlier date. The windfall might be
shared in the form of higher annual pension levels and earlier pension

present value peaks in the case of organized workers. Nonunion employees

would have desired the same pension increases but would be less able to

effectuate them.

     Predictions derived from an examination of the impact of raising the

mandatory retirement age differ somewhat from those just mentioned. If

there were a case where an employee desired to remain on the job beyond the

original mandatory retirement date set in the long—term contract (say to

        lifetime compensation would exceed his value of output:

     v(R*÷t) K PDVE (R*+t) + PDVP (R*÷t).                      (6)

This windfall loss to employers of older workers would tend to be met by

changing the only available instrument: the pension benefit structure. In

particular, employers would attempt to cut costs by lowering the value of

pension benefits directly, and also by shifting to an earlier age the point

at which the PDVP profile attained a maximum. Thus pension profiles are

expected to peak at an earlier age as a result of raising the mandatory

retirement age as well as in response to Social Security and tax changes

during the 1970s. However, pension values would be lowered in response to

the change in mandatory retirement, but raised in response to changes in

taxes and Social Security. Which effect dominates is an empirical matter

examined next.


3. The Empirical Findipg

     In order to evaluate which of the theoretical predictions are in fact

sustained in empirical analysis, it is necessary to develop information on

pension incentive structures as they changed through time. No data set

exists on private sector pensions which is both longitudinal and suffi-

ciently detailed to provide the necessary insight into benefit structures.

Thus the present research extends earlier work by building on a data file

of detailed benefit formulas for fourteen pension plans described in Fields

and Mitchell (1984).

     Our sample was originally selected from a file collected in 1978 by

the U.S. Department of Labor entitled the Benefit Amounts Survey (BAS).

That file was not longitudinal, however, so that an analysis of pensions

through time required a new compilation of company and union pension

documents from the 1950s through 1984. The degree of detail in these

documents enabled us to devise computer algorithms for determining re—
                                                                               17




    tirees' incomes in three different decades: 1960, 1970 and 1980. No more

    representative data set with information on the identical plans through

time is now availablei

        The individual pension plans cannot be identified for confidentiality

reasons. However it is possible to say that the sample includes several

pensions basing benefits primarily on years of service; these pattern plans

are typical of four United Auto Worker (UAW) pensions for which we have

data. Also included are four other unionized firms in transportation,

construction and trade, as well as six nonunion plans including firms in

the service and finance sectors.

        Because individual benefit formulas are quite complex, and vary

according to a workers' years of seniority, salary and retirement age,

there is no simple way of summarizing benefit streams available to the

older worker in a given plan.     It is thus necessary to compute benefits for

illustrative workers to determine how pension opportunities varied over the

period 1960—80. This was in fact done for each pension plan using sixty

illustrative workers described in the appendix with several possible

combinations of earnings levels, seniority levels, and marital status

groups. In all cases, the perspective taken was a forward—looking one in




1
      Efforts to match pension plans described in Bankers' Trust data for 1975
      and 1980 are described in Lazear (1983). However the formula used to match
      these plans though time (which are not identified by name) is subject to a
      great deal of error. In addition the pension descriptions in those volumes
      are often so terse as to be uninformative about benefit levels as well as
      pre— and post—retirement increases. Thus our sample contains more pre-
      cisely measured pension specifications for a smaller sample than Lazear's.
                                                                            18




that we sought to model what a worker attaining age 60 would have antici-

pated receiving in financial terms if he retired immediately versus

deferring retirement to alternative dates between age 60 and the firm's

mandatory retirement date.1

     The individual contemplating retirement at age 60 would use the

pension rules then in effect at his firm to determine what would be

available if he retired immediately. In addition it would be necessary for

him to develop some notion of how benefits might change if he were to defer

retirement by one year, two years, and so forth. The figures below assume

that workers considered past adjustments in formulating forecasts of how

benefit rules might be expected to change in the future. For instance,

workers in unionized firms could have expected new contracts to incorporate

pension changes similar to those adopted in previous contracts; nonunion

employees could also look to the recent evolution of their own pension

structure in projecting how benefits would change with deferred retire-

ment. Our best estimate of workers' expectations about benefit levels are

thus devised by looking at how pension formulas actually changed during the

decade before the worker turned 60.

    An examination of the plans under study reveals that they were altered

surprisingly often over the period under consideration——sometimes as

frequently as three times a decade. These changes took many forms: some

simply raised dollar values associated with retirement at different ages,

while others revamped their benefit structures completely. For instance

one nonunion firm set benefits as a simple percentage of pay in 1960, while


1 For benefit computation purposes below, we used age 70 as the latest likely
   retirement age if no mandatory retirement age was given. Virtually no
   employee worked beyond that age in the pension plan data file for the
   1970s.
                                                                             19




by 1980 It moved to an integrated plan in which Social Security payments

were subtracted from retirees' private pension amounts. At times the

changes were quite subtle: in 1960, one firm designated the "normal"

retirement age as 65 and reduced benefits for early leavers, whereas by

1980 the same firm entirely eliminated the early retirement penalty even

though the formal definition of "normal" retirement was left unchanged.

This overview suggests that it is extremely difficult to obtain a simple

summary measure of pension incentives, and indeed prompts a full consi—

deration of benefit computations over time for the same set of plans to see

exactly how they changed. Most plans raised benefits In response to

inflation, though during the 1970s only 9 of the 14 had benefit Increases

which recouped even half of the benefit erosion due to Inflation. Benefit

increases after retirement were even less generous; only four plans had

benefits rising at one—half the inflation rate and the rest were lower.'

In all cases, pre— and post—retirement increases consistent with actual

experiences were built into the pension value computations.

     The data in Table 2 report pension benefit levels across plans for

the 1960, 1970 and 1980 cohorts using single worker tax tables; patterns

for married males are virtually identical.2 Benefit amounts in the top

panel represent annual pension payments (gross and net of taxes) under the

assumption that the worker filed for benefits as soon as eligible. The

second panel reports the net present discounted value of the annual streams

  Allen, and Sumner (1983) regarding the degree of inflation protection of
  pensions during the l970s.

computed as described in the Appendix, assuming a 2% real discount rate and

the inflation rate in effect when the worker turned age 60 and was evalua-

ting retirement Income options. All figures are in real 1970 dollars.

      The overall patterns are consistent with the predictions generated in

Section 2. Between 1960 and 1970, both annual and present value streams of

private pension payments increased in both gross and net terms rather

dramatically——more than doubling and sometimes tripling. A second change

is also evident if one examines the shape of the PDVP profiles: for

retirees in the 1960s, the PDVP stream attained a maximum at age 65

(underlined In the Table) whereas ten years later there simply was not much

difference between the size of the pension stream for retiring at ages 62

and 65. In other words, fot the sample as a whole, pension incentives went

from actively encouraging prolonged work in the l960s, to a far more

neutral pattern between ages 62 and 65 in the 1970's.

      In general then, the large upward shift in Social Security benefits

appears to have been reinforced by increases in private pension levels,

particularly at earlier retirement ages. Since these findings conform

remarkably well to the predictions derived in Section 2, it Is at least

plausible to accord some support to the contract theory as described above.

      Between 1970 and 1980, a rather different empirical picture emerges.

Annual pension values declined a bit at some retirement ages in real

terms, with roughly similar declines in PIJVP values. This is attributable

in part to the fact that most of the plans did not fully protect benefits

against inflation. In addition, the point at which the PDVP stream peaked

became rather more pronounced In the later year as well, with propor-

tionally larger benefit reductions for those choosing to work beyond age

62.

     It   will be recalled that two different predictions emerged from

Section 2 regarding anticipated empirical changes. Had the impact of

Social Security and tax reforms dominated, one would have expected to see

benefits rising, reinforcing patterns of the earlier decade. However

benefits were predicted to fall if raising the mandatory retirement age was

more influential. The data indicate that employers slightly reduced

pension benefits and, in many cases, lowered the payoff for workers

retiring at ages other than 62.1 Thus the weight of the evidence so far

would seem to be more compatible with the conclusion that the change in the

mandatory retirement age had the stronger impact on pension benefit

structures 2

     Table 3 offers a detailed breakdown of the way pension structures

changed between the l960s and 1980s, by separately identifying those

pensions directly negotiated by union employees (grouped into United Auto

Workers plans and other unions plans), and the remaining non—union plans.

The hypothesis advanced earlier was that during the 1960—70 period,

organized employees might have been better able to obtain both earlier

retirement and a share of the firm's windfall compensation gain due to

earlier retirement, as compared to workers with less negotiating power.

Patterns in Table 3 bear out this prediction: between 1960 and 1970, the

UAW plans increased benefit levels far more quickly than either of the

other two groups. At the same time, the UAW pension incentives were


1 Our findings thus confirm Lazear's (1983) results on pension changes
   occurring between 1975 and 1980 using Bankers' Trust data.

2 It would be useful to show that in the absence of changes in the pension,
   workers would have opted to remain employed beyond their firm's initial
   mandatory retirement age. However, empirical data on workers covered by
   these plans is not available for analysis at this time.

completely reversed so as to reward most highly those retiring before age

65. By way of contrast, the non—UAW union as well as the non—union groups

experience a far smaller pension benefit increase over the 1960's. There

was also no change in the age—65 pension peak. The difference in these

patterns is consistent with the interpretation that employers outside the

strong union sector probably benefited from Social Security changes during

that period, since most did not increase pension benefits as much as the

UAW sector did.

     Pension profiles by 1980 had a pronounced peak at age 62, as opposed

to being flat from 62 through 65 as in 1970. This is consistent with the

hypothesis that firms wished to discourage workers who otherwise might have

wished to remain on their jobs beyond that point. Interestingly, Table 3

again reveals some differences between groups of workers: the non—UAW

union plans became more like the UAW set, developing a pension peak at the

early age of 62. Nonunion pension profiles continued to be fairly neutral

from ages 62 to 65.

     Table 4 confirms these conclusions in a somewhat different format by

presenting descriptive regressions across hypothetical workers and plans.

The dependent variable is the age at which workers' pension present values

peaked, taking each of the three decades separately and also pooling years.

All explanatory variables in the micro data are dichotomous, taking the

value of 1 if the worker had the characteristic in question, and 0 other-

wise. (See Table 4 for variable descriptions). Coefficients on the year

dummy variables emphasize the point that a tremendous turnaround in pension

incentives was experienced between 1960 and 1970, moving from a system

which generally encouraged work at later ages, to one In which deferred

retirement was actively penalized in many cases. That the same remained

true in 1980 is evident form the 1980—year dummy, though the effect is

attenuated slightly as compared to 1970. The regression analysis also

supports the finding that workers subject to pensions negotiated by the UAW

had significantly earlier retirement incentives, even controlling on

pension bonuses for seniority and pay.

      A direct method of examining the effect of mandatory retirement

reforms on pension structures is also available. Table 5 presents an

analysis of changes in the age at which the pension benefit structures

peaked, comparing the 1970 benefit structure with that in 1980. Under the

hypothesis that lifting the mandatory retirement age induced employers to

alter pension incentive patterns, one would expect to observe that the PDVP

result. This is exactly what the pooled data show. Firms that initially

imposed mandatory retirement ages prior to age 70 were also those which

reduced the age at which their pension benefit stream peaked between 1970

and 1980, after they were forced to raise their mandatory retirement ages.

Further, the pattern is the same irrespective of whether the firms had

initially specified mandatory retirement at age 65 or at some later age,

and does not seem sensitive to the inclusion of other control variables.

      Finally, pension levels changed between 1970 and 1980 in rather

interesting ways. Benefits fell for the UAW workers, a finding compatible

with the conclusion that this group was more strongly affected by the ADEA

reforms. The other pension plan values rose, in contrast, consistent with

a stronger response to changes in taxes and Social Security rules.'

4.   conclusions

     The question motivating this analysis was whether private pension

systems react in predictable ways to changes in their environment, where by

"predictable" we mean in accordance with contract theory. The particular

changes examined here include innovations in taxes, Social Security and

mandatory retirement regulations over the period 1960—1980. Our findings

indicate that pensions did infact appear to behave in ways consistent with

contract theory, in that benefit levels and patterns of benefit incentives

changed over time in ways that agreed with the model's predictions.

     The most significant changes observed in our sample of fourteen

pension plans were those occurring during the 1960—70 period. It was

argued that Social Security reforms encouraged employees to opt for earlier

retirement, and in many cases private pension offerings adapted to accom-

modate these new retirement patterns. Union plans, especially those

negotiated by the United Auto Workers, appeared to be especially successful

in restructuring pension incentives to fit workers' changing behavior.

     The 1970—80 period saw two regulatory policies with theoretically

different effects: a real reduction in the value of Social Security

payments for early retirees, and the passage of the ADEA amendment raising

the age at which firms could require mandatory retirement. While few

workers in fact remained on the job long enough to be constrained by

mandatory retirement rules, it is still reasonable to argue that firms

altered their pension patterns in anticipation of changes in worker

behavior. Some support for this proposition was detected, in that pensions
                                                                             28




requiring mandatory retirement during the 1960s and 1970s altered their

benefit incentives by 1980 so as to encourage earlier retirement and UAW

plans actually reduced the value of pension benefits between 1970 and 1980.

     It must be emphasized that this analysis is based on a small sample of

pension plans so that the results must be replicated elsewhere before they

can be generalized. On the other hand there is certainly sufficient

evidence to indicate that a longitudinal study of pension agreements is a

fruitful method of uncovering empirical evidence on long—term contractual

arrangements between workers and firms. In addition it seems clear that

private pension systems do respond in predictable ways to changes in the

economic and regulatory environment in which they operate. This last point

is often overlooked in policy studies investigating the impact of Social

Security reform, tax changes, and other labor market retirement income

innovations. Future research on such policy issues should begin to acknow—

ledge the potential for pension responses to changes in their environment,

using contract theory as a base.

five pay profiles, six tenure patterns, and two marital status groups. An

intermediate pay trajectory utilized the average annual earnings for male

employees in the Social Security Administration's Longitudinal Retirement

History Survey (LRHS) covered by a pension plan.1                      In addition two other

workers were devised at 80% and 135 of the LRHS average providing a

reasonable salary range about the mean.2

      This procedure generates a group of illustrative workers reaching age

60 as of 1970. These were used in benefit computations for the decade of

the l970s. It was also necessary to specify earnings profiles for cohorts

reaching age 60 in 1960 and 1980 as well. Nominal earnings streams for the




1 The sample selection criteria for LRHS workers are described In Fields and
   Mitchell (1984). Imputed earnings rather than actual earnings were
   employed so as to avoid possible sample selection bias that might arise if
   earnings from non—retirees alone were used.

2 Analysis of the workers covered by the 14 plans In the MS sample indicates
   that their earnings fell within the salary range set by the LRIIS workers.

three LRFIS workers were thus deflated to 1960 values and inflated to 1980

values using the CPI. This holds constant real earnings by age in the

three decades so as to better be able to compare resultant benefit patterns

through time.

     In order to assess whether the benefit figures generated were specific

to LRIIS earners, we also devised two additional earnings streams. A low

earnings worker was devised by attributing to him for each year of work the

statutory minimum wage (times 2000 hours of work per year), and a high wage

worker was one who always earned a salary placing him at the taxable

earnings ceiling for the purposes of Social Security taxation. The text

refers to averages across all six earnings profiles, since these results

proved sufficiently similar to the underlying individual patterns so as not

to warrant separate mention.

     The six seniority profiles were measured in terms of the tenure

accumulated as of age 60: 10, 20 and 30 years (groupings commonly seen in

retirement data), as well as 15, 22 and 25 years representing the minimum,

mean and maximum years of seniority found in earlier research using

retirees from the 14 plans during the 1970s. Finally, these thirty

pay—tenure combinations became 60 by considering both a single and a

married worker for each case.


2. Taxes


     lEn order to determine net income values for alternative retirement

ages, it was necessary to deduct both payroll and income taxes from

employment earnings and retirement income. Actual tax schedules were used

until the worker attained age 60; thereafter tax forecasts were assumed to

be based on changes in the formulas experienced during the workers'
                                                                             32




previous ten years. This set of computations produced net annual earnings

streams for the illustrative workers had they remained on the job, as well

as net pension and Social Security payments if instead they had retired at

alternative points. Net income streams were computed for both single and

married workers (assuming standard deductions) to see whether changing

income and payroll taxes altered retirement incentives differentially by

marital status through time. The text refers to results for single workers

since those for married taxpayers are qualitatively similar.


3.   Social S e cBeits

     Workers' expectations about Social Security benefits available for

immediate retirement were assumed to be based on the rules in effect at the

beginning of the planning period; anticipated future Social Security

changes incorporated pre— and post—retirement increases consistent with

those experienced during the decade prior to that when the worker turned

age 60. Throughout its history, Social Security has been constantly

redesigned by Congress: for instance, a worker retiring in 1960 or even in

1970 would reasonably have expected real Social Security payments to remain

constant or even rise somewhat after retirement since benefits had done

just that throughout the previous decades. Since the mid—1970s, of course,

benefits have been formally indexed. These assumptions were incorporated

in the computations for both married and single workers, assuming that

married workers' spouses filed for one—half of their husbands' benefits.

rate and survival probabilities based on life tables specific to each
