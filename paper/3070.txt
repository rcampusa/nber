                         TAXATION OF FOREIGN-OWNED LAND



                                    ABSTRACT

     This paper examines the welfare effects of a tax on foreign purchases of

domestic land.   Using a simple static framework the paper shows that an appro-

priately chosen tax will generally be welfare-improving for the domestic

country.
