                                             ABSTRACT

The consumption of high-consumption households is more exposed to fluctuations in aggregate consumption
and income than that of low-consumption households in the Consumer Expenditure (CEX) Survey.
The exposure to aggregate consumption growth of households in the top 10 percent of the consumption
distribution in the CEX is about five times that of households in the bottom 80 percent. Given real
aggregate per capita consumption growth about 3 percentage points less than its historical mean during
the past year, these figures predict that the ratio of consumption of the top 10 percent to the bottom
80 percent has fallen by about 15 percentage points (relative to trend). Using income data from Piketty
and Saez (2003), we show that the income (especially the wage income) of rich households is more
exposed to aggregate fluctuations, so their higher income exposure is a likely contributor to their higher
consumption exposure. Finally, we find a striking change in the exposure of the incomes of high-income
households: prior to the early 1980’s, the incomes of high-income households were not more exposed
to aggregate fluctuations. Thus, while high-income households currently bear an inordinately large
share of aggregate fluctuations, this is a recent occurrence.

      As we write in late December 2008, the economy is mired in a year-long recession, the US

stock market is down 40% for the year, and real per capita consumption of nondurables and

services has fallen roughly one percent over the last year. The welfare costs of these declines

depend significantly on their allocation across households.

      In this paper we study differences in exposure to aggregate fluctuations across households,

focusing on high-consumption and high-income households. In doing so, we bring together two

somewhat disparate literatures. One line of research has documented increases in income and

consumption inequality over the past 25 years (e.g. David Cutler and Lawrence Katz (1991),

Dirk Krueger and Fabrizio Perri (2003), Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez (2003), Georgio E.

Primiceri and Thijs van Rens (2008)). This work, typically framed within a basic permanent

income model, focuses on the extent to which income shocks are insured and pays less attention

to the extent to which insurance of aggregate shocks differs across households.

      This contrasts with the literature in asset pricing that has documented that equity risk is

born disproportionately by households with large stock market wealth (e.g. N. Gregory Mankiw

and Stephen P. Zeldes (1991), Parker (2001) and Christopher Malloy, Tobias J. Moskowitz, and

Vissing-Jørgensen (2008)). This work studies differences in the covariation of consumption

growth only with equity returns and not with aggregate fluctuations more generally.1 For our

purposes, this is significant since the share of aggregate income that comes from labor is roughly

double the share coming from capital. As with the literature on consumption inequality, this

research is limited by under-representation of households with very high consumption in

 Malloy et al. (2008) show higher sensitivity of the consumption growth of wealthy stockholders to both the stock
market and to aggregate consumption growth. Here, we instead sort households by income and consumption levels,
and analyze both aggregate income and consumption fluctuations, exposure by type of income, and inequality.

standard consumption datasets.

     We have five main results. First, the consumption growth of high-consumption households

is significantly more exposed to aggregate fluctuations than that of the typical household in the

Consumer Expenditure (CEX) Survey. The exposure to aggregate consumption growth of the

consumption growth of households in the top ten percent of the consumption distribution in the

CEX is about five times that of households in the bottom 80 percent. Second, this pattern

predicts a significant decline in consumption inequality over the past year. With real aggregate

per capita consumption growth about 3 percentage points less than its historical mean (of 2

percent) during the past year, the ratio of consumption of the top 20 percent to the bottom 80

percent is expected to fall by about 9 percentage points, relative to its evolution under trend

growth.

     Third, we provide evidence on the channels which lead to higher exposure for high-income

households using income data from the tax return data set assembled by Piketty and Saez (2003).

In the period covered by the CEX, we show that a higher exposure of the income of rich

households to aggregate consumption and income fluctuations is a likely contributor to their

higher consumption exposure. High-income households (top 1 percent) earn more than half of

their non-capital gains income from wage income, and their wage income is far more exposed to

aggregate fluctuations than that of lower income households. Fourth, we find even higher income

exposure to aggregate fluctuations for very high-income households (top 0.01 percent) than for

high-income households, suggesting that our consumption estimates may understate the exposure

of high-consumption households thought to be omitted from the CEX.

     Finally, we find a striking change in the exposure of the incomes of high-income

households: prior to the early 1980’s, the incomes of high-income households were not more



                                               2
exposed to aggregate fluctuations. Thus, while high-income households currently bear an

inordinately large share of aggregate fluctuations, this is a recent occurrence.



I. The exposure of the consumption of high-consumption households to aggregate

fluctuations and its implications for inequality

    We use the CEX surveys from 1982 to 2004 to study whether the consumption of high-

consumption households is more exposed to aggregate fluctuations. We construct average log

consumption growth rates for each group and period using expenditures on nondurable goods

and a subset of services deflated by the CPI for nondurables.2 To reduce the impact of

households exiting and entering the CEX, we construct average consumption growth for a group

by taking a CEX-weighted average across household-level, quarterly log growth rates within a

group. A household’s percentile in the (weighted) cross-sectional distribution of consumption is

defined based its expenditures in the first period of the change.3 We sum four quarterly average

log changes to obtain a of annual growth rates (available at monthly frequency), defined as the

growth rates from a three-month period to the same three-month period the following year.

        Panel A in Table 1 shows the extent of consumption inequality across percentile groups

in the CEX. Panel B shows the results of regressing a group’s average annual change in log

consumption on month dummies and contemporaneous change in log aggregate real per capita

consumption of nondurable goods and services, deflated as described in Parker (2001) and

2
  The expenditure definition and CEX sample period follows Malloy et al. (2008). Since we cannot adjust for family
size or changes in family size in the income data used in the section below on income, we do not adjust consumption
for family size effects in the CEX. All CEX levels and growth rates are thus to be interpreted as per household.
3
 Sorting on initial consumption leads to non-standard measurement error when analyzing consumption growth rates
of percentile groups. We show in an unpublished appendix posted on our web pages that using log growth rates
ensures consistent estimates of the sensitivity of group consumption growth to aggregate consumption growth if the
primitive measurement error is classical. For consistency across data sets we use log growth rates in all tables.

constructed from monthly data to match the timing of the CEX series. The growth rate of those

in the top ten percent of households in the distribution of consumption typically changes by

about 5 percentage points when the growth rate of aggregate consumption per capita changes by

1 percent, while the change in the growth rate of the bottom 80 percent is only about a half

percent.4 Exposure to aggregated CEX consumption is somewhat less concentrated on high-

consumption households than NIPA consumption (Panel D). The top five percent of households

 At a quarterly frequency there is a smaller difference across groups, at lower frequencies, there is a larger
difference across groups. The results are similar if the left hand side is calculated from the change in the log of mean
group consumption (as opposed to the mean of the log changes) among households present in both periods.

are estimated to be about 4.5 (=2.51/0.56) times more exposed to changes in CEX consumption

that those in the bottom 80 percent.

   If the sensitivities in Panel D were all one, the share of aggregate consumption fluctuations

borne by a group would be its share of initial consumption: the fraction the group constitutes of

the population times the average ratio of group consumption to average consumption (e.g.

0.10*2.15=0.215 for the top 10 percent). We estimate the actual fraction borne by a group by

regressing   (Change    in   real   group   consumption    per   household)*(Group      share   of

population)/(Lagged aggregate real consumption per household) on the growth rate in aggregate

real consumption per household. Across subgroups of households, the numerators sum to the

total real dollar change in consumption per household, so the regression coefficients sum to one.

As shown in Panel E, the fraction borne by the top 10 percent of household is 45 percent --

driven by both higher average consumption and higher sensitivity to aggregate shocks.

     Given the large exposure of high-income and high-consumption households to movements

in aggregate income or consumption, we expect recent poor aggregate economic performance to

reduce inequality. To match recent figures, we consider the effect of a decline in the growth rate

in aggregate real per capita consumption of nondurables and services from 2 percent to minus 1

percent, i.e. a 3 percentage point growth rate decline (for one year). Based on the Panel B in

Table 1, a 3 percentage point decline in the growth rate of aggregate real per capita consumption

of nondurables and services will lead to a decline of about 1.5 percentage points in the growth

rate of real per household consumption for those in the bottom 80 percent, of around 10

percentage points for those in the top 20 percent, and of around 16 percentage points for those in

the top 10 percent – all relative to trend. Thus, the consumption of the typical household in the

top 20 percent (top 10 percent) will decline by about 9 percent (15 percent) relative to the



                                                5
consumption of the average household in the bottom 80 percent.

   We conclude that in the CEX data, the consumption of high-consumption households is more

exposed to aggregate booms and busts than that of the typical household. But we also see the

exposure rising significantly only quite high in the distribution, and, according to BLS

statisticians, households in the top 5 to 10 percent of the distribution of expenditures are under-

represented in the CEX. What we denote the top 10 percent may thus represent the 85th to the

95th percentile. To investigate this further, and to better understand the channels behind higher

consumption exposure, we turn to information on high income households.



II. The exposure of the incomes of high-income households to aggregate fluctuations

   We use the Piketty and Saez (2003) data on taxable income by type and income level, which

are based on large samples of very high-income households. We initially study the period from

1982 (to match our CEX data) to 2006. For our purposes, these data have two disadvantages:

they do not track the same households over time and they do not have information on low-

income households. We subsequently show that the first disadvantage likely biases down the

extent to which exposure to aggregate fluctuations differs by income, and we account for the

second by using national totals from NIPA Table 2.1 (as do Piketty and Saez (2003)).

   For two reasons, we focus on income excluding capital gains. First, the IRS data only

measure realized capital gains and the timing of capital gains realizations is an endogenous

choice of a household. Second, since we study only the cash flow from human capital (wages),

for comparability we study only the cash flow from non-human capital (dividends, interest,

rental income and proprietors' income). This said, income including true capital gains on human

and financial capital would of course be preferable.

    Panel A of Table 2 shows the extent of income inequality in the data. Panel B shows that

wage income is still a substantial source of income for high-income households. Even the top 0.1

percent have nearly half their income from wages, with the remainder constituted by 28 percent

from proprietors' income (roughly triple the population average), 10 percent from dividends

(roughly double the population average), and 14 percent from interest and rental income.

           Turning to the stochastic properties of income, we regress the log growth rate in real

income per tax unit onto the log growth rate of either aggregate real consumption per tax unit or

aggregate real income per tax unit (calculated from NIPA consumption data, NIPA total income

across the five sub-categories of income, and the IRS number of tax units). Panels C and D show

that the incomes of very high-income groups have dramatically larger sensitivities to aggregate

growth rates: the incomes of the top 0.1 percent of tax units have sensitivities of about 7 to

aggregate consumption growth and about 3 to aggregate income growth.5 Figure 1 displays this

strikingly different cyclicality across groups.

    Results are similar if we omit the two years after the 1986 tax reform which have unusually large income growth.


                                                           8
           What drives these differences in exposure? One might expect that the labor income of

high-income households is more insulated from aggregate fluctuations than that of low-income

household, but in fact it is more exposed. The high sensitivities for the rich are mostly due to the

higher sensitivity of their wage income to changes in aggregate consumption and income.

         A concern in our use of this income data is that the percentile group into which a household

is allocated in a given year is based on income in that year. Thus, the incomes used to calculate a

given growth rate do not represent the same households in each period (unlike our analysis in the

CEX). If high-income households are more exposed to aggregate fluctuations, some of them will

fall into lower percentile groups when aggregates fall and will rise up the distribution when

aggregates rise. This composition bias actually biases down the relative exposure of high-income

groups. A high-income group’s measured decline in bad times is reduced by initially lower-

income, less-exposed households entering the high-income group, and the group’s measured rise

in good times is reduced by these households leaving the high-income group. The converse

occurs for lower-income groups, biasing upward their measured exposure to fluctuations.

          To judge the empirical significance of this bias, we introduce it artificially into our

analysis of consumption in the CEX. Panel C of Table 1 reports the exposure to aggregate

consumption of the consumption of a changing population of households in the CEX constructed

analogously to the tax data. Relative to the unbiased (fixed-group) sensitivities in Panel B, Panel

C shows greater exposure to aggregate growth rates for the low-consumption group and lower

exposure for the high-consumption groups. Therefore, the estimates of the exposure of high-

income households to aggregate fluctuations in Table 2 are likely downward biased.6

         The finding in Table 2 that exposure of income to aggregate consumption (and income)


6
    The different approaches to constructing group level growth rates also affect average growth rates.


                                                            9
fluctuations increases dramatically from the top 10 to the top 1 or top 0.01 percent suggests that

the exposure of consumption to aggregate consumption fluctuations of very rich households is

likely to be larger than documented in Table 1, given under-representation of the very rich in the

CEX. However, we cannot conclude this with certainty since differential consumption exposure

across groups may be driven not only by differential income exposure but also by differences in

capital gains exposure or in the relation between wealth and consumption across groups.



III. Changes in the exposure of the incomes of high-income households

     The larger exposure of the incomes of high-income households is only a recent

phenomenon: prior to the last twenty five years, the incomes of high-income households were

not more exposed to aggregate fluctuations. Table 3 shows a subset of the statistics from Table 2

but over the period from 1929 to the availability of the CEX data sample (with roughly similar

conclusions if we focus on the post-war period up to 1982).

       High-income households have less of their income from wages and more from dividends,

relative to the more recent period, suggesting higher exposure of the very high-income

households to stock market fluctuations pre-1982. More importantly, Panel C and D show that in

the earlier period the incomes of high-income households have about the same sensitivity to

aggregate consumption as the income of all households, and a lower sensitivity to aggregate

income. This is due mainly to lower exposure of the wage income of the rich to changes in

aggregate fluctuations in the earlier period and to lower exposure of non-wage income

(disproportionately earned by the rich) to changes in aggregate income in the earlier period.

IV. Conclusion

        High-consumption and high-income households are highly exposed to aggregate booms

and busts. This implies large effects of the current recession on consumption inequality. We

document that this exposure represents a significant break from the past. Prior to the last 25

years, high-income households were not more exposed to aggregate fluctuations. We find this

fact – high-income households becoming more exposed to aggregate changes in income and


                                                 11
consumption – tantalizing. It begs further study both in terms of measurement and in terms of

understanding the underlying labor and capital market mechanisms.
