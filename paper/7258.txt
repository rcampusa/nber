        A variety of recent theoretical and empirical advances have renewed interest in
monopsonistic models of the labor market. However, there is little direct empirical support
for these models, even in labor markets that are textbook examples of monopsony. We use
an exogenous change in wages at Veterans Affairs hospitals as a natural experiment to
investigate the extent of monopsony in the nurse labor market. In contrast to much of the prior
literature, we estimate that labor supply to individual hospitals is quite inelastic, with short-run
elasticity around 0.1. We also find that non-VA hospitals responded to the VA wage change
by changing their own wages.

1. Introduction

      Standard competitive models assume that individual firms are price-takers in

the labor market. However, since Robinson (1933) first coined the term “monopsony,”

economists have considered the alternative case in which individual firms face upward

sloping labor supply curves and, therefore, have market power which enables them to

set wages. Originally, monopsony power was thought to exist primarily in fairly

specialized labor markets, in which a single firm bought labor in an isolated labor

market (analogous to a monopolist in a product market). More recently, a variety of

theoretical models have suggested that monopsonistic behavior may be pervasive, with

individual firms facing upward-sloping labor supply curves because of the presence of

oligopoly, differentiation between firms, moving costs, costly job search, or efficiency

wages (Boal and Ransom, 1997).

      Empirical evidence of monopsony is quite mixed (see Boal and Ransom, 1997,

for a recent review). On the one hand, monopsony provides a possible explanation for

a variety of facts that are difficult to explain in the competitive model. For example,

monopsony has been used to explain why an increase in the minimum wage led to an

increase in employment (Card and Krueger, 1995), why there is a positive relationship

between firm size and wages (Green, Machin and Manning, 1996), and why there are

persistent differences across firms in wages and vacancy rates (Boal and Ransom, 1997;

Card and Krueger, 1995; Yett, 1975). On the other hand, direct estimation of the

elasticity of labor supply to individual firms suggests that firms have very little market



                                                2
power over wages even in labor markets that are textbook examples of monopsony

such as nurses (Sullivan, 1989; Hansen, 1992) and coal miners (Boal, 1995).

       This paper investigates whether individual hospitals have monopsony power in

the labor market for Registered Nurses (RNs). The RN labor market is a popular

textbook example of monopsony (e.g., Ehrenberg and Smith, 1987) because of persistent

variations in wages across regions and across hospitals, along with nearly continuous

reports of shortages since World War II (Yett, 1975; Aiken, 1982; Roberts, et al., 1989;

Greene and Nordhaus-Bike, 1998). Thus, if one found no evidence of monopsony

power in this market, it would be difficult to argue that monopsony was a pervasive

feature of the labor market.

       We analyze the effect of an exogenous, legislated change in RN wages at

Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals. Our analysis differs in two important ways

from the prior literature estimating monopsony power at the firm level. First, previous

studies have used measures of output demand as instruments for wages in estimating

the supply elasticity. In contrast, our source of identification comes from a legislated

change in wages at certain hospitals. Thus, our empirical approach relies on a similar

source of identification as that used in recent studies of the minimum wage (Card and

Krueger, 1995). Arguably, this legislated change in wages provides the perfect “natural

experiment” with which to answer the key question: does an exogenous change in

wages at one hospital affect employment at that hospital or at competing hospitals? A

second difference from the prior literature is that our empirical analysis is explicitly

motivated by a model of geographic differentiation among firms, similar to Salop

                                                 3
(1979), in which hospitals compete directly only with their nearest neighbors. This

model suggests that other hospitals will change their wages in response to the VA

wage change, and the response will be largest at hospitals that are nearest to the VA.

      Our empirical results are consistent with the presence of monopsony power in

the RN labor market, generated by geographic differentiation between hospitals. We

find that wages at non-VA hospitals responded to the VA wage change, and this

response was largest among hospitals located within 15 miles of a VA hospital. In

addition, we find that RN employment at individual hospitals responded very little in

the short run to the resulting changes in relative wages between hospitals. Our

estimates of the short-run elasticity of labor supply to an individual hospital average

around 0.1, far lower than previous estimates in the literature. Overall, this evidence

suggests that hospitals are wage-setters in the RN labor market, with considerable

market power.



2. Previous studies of monopsony in nursing

      Studies of monopsony in the nursing labor market have been motivated by two

observations. First, in rural regions, there may be only one hospital and few other

employers for registered nurses, potentially providing RN employers with market

power. Second, as stated above, there have been persistent reports of nursing

shortages since the 1940s. Research on nursing labor markets has provided conflicting

evidence about the monopsony hypothesis.




                                               4
       Studies of nursing monopsony generally have taken two approaches. One line

of literature has examined whether there is a relationship between labor market

concentration and wage levels in cross-sectional analyses. Several studies have found

that RN wages are lower when there are fewer hospitals or when hospital markets are

more concentrated (Hurd, 1973; Link and Landon, 1975; Bruggink, et al., 1985;

Robinson, 1988). However, studies that more carefully adjust for other area specific

factors, such as the cost of living, find no evidence that market concentration per se is

associated with lower wages (Adamache and Sloan, 1982; Feldman and Scheffler, 1982;

Hirsch and Schumacher, 1995).

       A more recent approach has sought to explicitly estimate the elasticity or inverse

elasticity of labor supply to an individual hospital. In a simple static model of

monopsony, the inverse elasticity of labor supply is a measure of “exploitation”

analogous to the Lerner index, and equals the percentage amount that the wage lies

below marginal revenue product (see Boal and Ransom, 1997). Sullivan (1989)

estimated a wage elasticity of supply to individual hospitals of 1.26 over a one year

period and 3.85 over a three year period using a national sample of hospitals from 1980

to 1985. In contrast, Hansen (1992), using an almost identical methodology, found that

supply was very elastic in California from 1980 to 1987. Hansen’s estimates of the labor

supply elasticity ranged from 29 to 56. In a dynamic model these short-run elasticity

estimates will overstate the amount of exploitation if labor supply is more elastic in the

long run. Under reasonable assumptions, even Sullivan’s estimates suggest that




                                                 5
monopsony power is small in this market, with RN wages no more than 10 percent

below their competitive level (Boal and Ransom, 1997).

       There are two reasons to believe that these estimates may overstate the short-run

supply elasticity (and thereby understate the amount of monopsony power). First, in

both papers hospital days are assumed to be exogenous demand shifters and serve as

instruments in estimating the supply curve by two stage least squares (2SLS).

Therefore, these papers’ 2SLS estimates of elasticities greater than 1 reflect the fact that

for a given decline in hospital days, we observed RN employment to fall by more

(often much more) than RN wages. However, reimbursement of hospitals changed

dramatically over this period with the introduction of Medicare’s Prospective Payment

System in 1984, and hospitals responded to this change by reducing days spent in the

hospital (Coulam and Gaumer, 1991). This suggests that much of the observed

variation in hospital days over the early 1980s was endogenous. If hospital days were

chosen endogenously, one would expect a positive association between the error in the

supply equation and hospital days. This would bias the 2SLS method towards

overstating the positive relationship between hospital days and RN employment, and

therefore bias upward the estimate of the elasticity of supply.

       A second reason to believe that these estimates may overstate the short-run

supply elasticity is that both studies measure the wage using the average RN wage in

the hospital. If a wage increase results in disproportionate hiring at the entry level, and

entry level workers are paid less, then the change in the average wage will tend to

understate the actual change in the wage (because of the shift toward entry-level

                                                 6
workers). As a result, estimates of the labor supply elasticity will be biased upwards

(Boal and Ransom, 1997, fn. 25).




3. RN wages and the VA policy

       In 1991, the VA went from paying RNs based on a national scale to a system that

set RN wages based on a local wage survey. This legislated change in RN wages at VA

hospitals provides an ideal opportunity to examine whether there is monopsony in the

RN labor market, while avoiding many of the problems of the previous literature. A

short panel of data is available for VA and non-VA hospitals with complete information

on staffing levels, patient caseloads, wages (including starting wages), and other

hospital characteristics. The data can be first-differenced to control for variation in the

cost of living and unmeasured attributes of hospitals. Finally, no assumptions need to

be made about exogenous demand shocks, since the legislation generates exogenous

changes in wages at VA hospitals, and these changes can in turn be used to construct

instruments for wage changes at competing non-VA hospitals.

       Prior to 1991, the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) set registered nurse (RN)

wages in all of its hospitals according to a national pay scale, with only minor

adjustments to wages for hospitals in high wage markets. This policy seriously affected

the VA's ability to recruit and retain RNs for two reasons. First, VA wages tended to

lag behind the market throughout the 1980s, as real wages of RNs rose rapidly. More

importantly, this policy caused VA wages to diverge from those of local labor markets,


                                                 7
because nurse wages vary widely across regions. VA hospitals could respond

somewhat to market conditions by obtaining waivers from the VA Central Office for

wage increases. Although the waiver system improved the ability of VA hospitals to

match market wages, the waivers were constrained by VA budgets and were often

granted after local wages had risen further. For example, based on data from 1990 (see

section 5, below), starting RN wages in Milwaukee – a relatively low wage market --

averaged $11.20/hour at non-VA hospitals while the VA starting wage was competitive

at $11.65/hour. However, in San Francisco – a relatively high wage market -- the VA

wage lagged well behind the market, with non-VA hospitals paying an average hourly

wage of $16.30 and the local VA hospitals paying only $14.00.

      The VA sought to remedy this problem with the passage of the Nurse Pay Act of

1990, which changed how the VA set wages for RNs, effective April 7, 1991. This law

tied RN wages at each VA hospital to those that prevail in its local labor market, with

market wages determined by an annual survey of other hospitals in each VA’s region.1

As a result, wage scales of RNs were immediately raised to match the market in the

roughly two-thirds of VA hospitals that had been paying below the prevailing market

wage.2 At the remaining VA hospitals that were paying above market, wages were

held constant in nominal terms until they came in line with the prevailing market wage.

Thus the law generated an exogenous change in RN wages at VA hospitals, with the

magnitude of the wage change varying across hospitals.

       In addition to mandating wage changes, the Nurse Pay Act of 1990 provided

each VA with additional funds in its budget to finance their increased wage bill. As a

                                               8
result, individual VA hospitals that had their wages raised by the act were free to hire

additional RNs up to previously determined staffing needs (which were well above

staffing levels for nearly all VA hospitals), with the costs being passed on to the central

office. Thus, VA hospitals were essentially free to hire all nurses willing to work at the

legislated wage level.

       In summary, the Nurse Pay Act of 1990 provides a unique opportunity to

examine the extent of monopsony power in the nurse labor market. We can estimate

the elasticity of supply of RNs to individual hospitals based on a legislated change in

the wage, unrelated to changes in supply shocks, at VA hospitals in which labor

demand was not binding. Moreover, we can learn to what extent hospitals have wage

setting power by observing whether non-VA hospitals adjusted their wages in response

to the change in VA wages.



4. Theoretical model

       Consider a general model of monopsony in which firms face a labor supply

curve that is upward sloping in their own wage and downward sloping in the wage of

competitors:

           Li = f(w1, w2, … ,wk) where MLi/Mwi>0, MLi/Mwj<0 for i≠j, i=0,…,k             (1)


A profit-maximizing firm will set wages to maximize R(L i) – Li*wi, where R(.) is the

firm’s revenue function, Li is the firm’s employment, and wi, is the firm’s wage. The

first-order condition for this problem implies:




                                                  9
                                        MRP − w
                                                = ε −1                                   (2)
                                          w


Where MRP is the marginal revenue product of labor, and ε is the own-wage elasticity

of labor supply. Thus, the own-wage elasticity of labor supply is the key to measuring

monopsony power, and summarizes the extent to which a firm may reduce wages

below the competitive level.

       To guide our empirical work, we consider a simplified version of equation (1).

Our model is an application of Salop’s (1979) model of competition around a circle. We

assume RNs are distributed uniformly around a circle, and they choose to work at one

of N hospitals. Given our focus on short-run labor supply, we ignore the issue of

hospital entry and exit, and treat N as fixed.3 Hospitals are located equidistant around

the circle, with the distance between hospitals (and the number of nurses located

between hospitals) equal to α. A nurse located between two hospitals will choose to

work at the hospital at which the wage net of travel costs is highest. Letting τ represent

the travel costs per unit distance, it is straightforward to derive the labor supply facing

a given hospital as a function of its own wage and the wage of its nearest competitors:

                                      1     w + wi +1 
                           Li = α +     wi − i −1      , i=0,…,N                       (3)
                                      τ           2   


where wi-1 and wi+1 are wages at the two adjacent hospitals. Thus, the simple structure

of competition along a circle yields a labor supply equation that depends only on the

gap between a hospital’s wage and the average wage of its two nearest competitors.

Total labor supply to the market is assumed fixed (e.g. a doubling of all wages does

                                                 10
not affect the labor supply to any individual hospital).

       Wages at the VA are set exogenously by federal policy, but wages at all other

hospitals are assumed to be set endogenously. If the marginal benefit to a hospital of

employing a nurse is β, we assume that hospitals set wages to maximize the total net

benefits derived from RNs; i.e., they choose w to maximize L(β-w). The first order

condition for this maximization problem provides the wage setting equation (i.e., labor

demand) for the model:

                                        wi = β-τLi                                        (4)


Thus, wages are set below marginal product and the size of the wage mark-down

depends on the slope of the labor supply equation (3).

       Equations (3) and (4) provide the structural equations for the model. The labor

supply equation (3) cannot be estimated by OLS, since wages are set endogenously

according to equation (4). Estimation of the labor supply equation requires valid

instruments, i.e. variables that are correlated with wages but not correlated with the

error in the labor supply equation (α). If one hospital in the market (the VA) sets the

wage independently of α, then that wage can serve as an instrument since it will affect

the wage at all other hospitals in the market.

       It is relatively straightforward to solve this model of competition on a circle, and

derive the reduced form equation for each hospital’s equilibrium wage. Note that this

reduced form equation is important in that it serves as the first stage equation in

estimating labor supply. In the standard model of competition on a circle, all hospitals



                                                 11
would be identical and the solution would be a symmetric wage equilibrium with w* =

β - ατ. Our model is not symmetric, since the VA hospital differs from all non-VA

hospitals in that its wage is set exogenously. Therefore, the equilibrium is asymmetric

with equilibrium wages at non-VA hospitals depending on the distance between each

hospital and the VA. Distance is measured by the number of hospitals (d) located

between a given hospital and the VA (e.g. d=0 for the two hospitals located adjacent to

the VA).

      If there is only one VA hospital setting wages exogenously in each market, then

(after some algebra) equilibrium wages at non-VA hospitals can be shown to be a

weighted average of the VA wage (wVA) and the symmetric equilibrium wage (w*):

                                     wi = (1-θi)w* + θiwVA                               (5)


The weight placed on the VA wage (θi) captures the effect of VA wage on wages at non-

VA hospitals, and depends only on the number of hospitals (N) in the market and on

each hospital’s distance from the VA (d). It is straightforward to derive three useful

properties of θi in this model. First, θi is between 0 and 1/2 which implies that non-VA

hospitals will respond partially to VA wage changes. Furthermore, θi decreases with

distance from the VA (Mθi/Md<0), as one would expect if hospitals are differentiated by

location. Finally, θi decreases with the number of competitors on the circle (Mθi/MN<0),

suggesting that non-VA hospitals will respond less to VA wage changes when the VA

has a smaller share of the market.

      This simple model of the RN labor market is useful for two reasons. First, the



                                                 12
model has empirical implications. Structural labor supply to a particular hospital

depends only on the wage gap between a given hospital and its nearest neighbors,

increasing with the wage paid by that hospital and decreasing with the wage paid by

nearby hospitals. Furthermore, wages at non-VA hospitals are positively related to VA

wage changes, with the strongest effect of VA wages at hospitals located near the VA

and with few competitors. The second reason that the model is useful is that it

demonstrates how changes in VA wages can be used to identify the labor supply

equation. Changes in VA wages provide a natural instrument for identifying the labor

supply equation, since these changes are arguably exogenous and affect wages at all

hospitals either directly (at VA hospitals) or indirectly (at non-VA hospitals through

equation (5)).




5. Data

       The data used in this study are obtained from several publicly available sources

and from the VA’s records. The unit of observation for our analysis is a hospital. Our

primary source of information about nurse wages and employment in non-VA

hospitals is the American Hospital Association’s (AHA) Nursing Personnel Surveys (NPS)

of 1990 and 1992. Thus, we have one year of data prior to the Nurse Pay Act (1990), and

one year of data that was entirely post-implementation (1992). Unfortunately, data is

not available from the NPS after 1992.




                                               13
      The 1990 Nursing Personnel Survey surveyed all hospitals in the United States,

while the 1992 data are limited to non-Federal facilities. This survey collects detailed

information about RN employment and wages, along with a wide variety of additional

information such as budgeted positions, the mix of nursing staff (RNs, LPNs, etc.),

tenure, education, vacancy and turnover rates, work schedules, collective bargaining,

and temporary and foreign nurse utilization. The NPS was used to obtain wages for

non-VA hospitals, to calculate market wages faced by all hospitals, and to provide

background information about each hospital. In 1992, less than half of the hospitals

surveyed responded to questions about wages and employment levels, limiting our

sample size significantly.

      The AHA’s Annual Survey of Hospitals provides additional data on hospital

characteristics for VA and non-VA facilities and is available in 1990 and 1992 for most

hospitals in the United States. These surveys provide a wide range of information

about general hospital characteristics, and provided us with information on hospital

location. The AHA survey also includes some data about nurse staffing, which were

used to check the validity of the Nursing Personnel Survey.

      The VA Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data (PAID) system, salary

surveys conducted for the Locality Pay System, and published VA data on

employment levels of nurses provide most of our information on VA hospitals, since

federal hospitals did not respond to the NPS in 1992. The VA’s CALM system 830 file

contains facility level information on the aggregate number of RNs on staff (full-time

equivalent) and their average salary. The VA PAID system data file is used to measure

                                               14
starting wages for RNs at VA hospitals. The Personnel Office at the VA’s Central Office

provided copies of the Nurse Pay Act RN pay schedules for each VAMC and copies of

the wage surveys. These provide additional data on the changes in RN wages at VA

hospitals and wages at hospitals that compete with the VA hospitals. We also use these

data to check the accuracy of the NPS data in 1990.

       Cross-checks of the different data reveal little inconsistency in our measures of

wages, employment levels, and hospital characteristics. This alleviates any concern

arising from the fact that the NPS and AHA data are based on hospital responses to

surveys. Similarly, the VA accounting data should be of high quality, since they are

from an internal accounting system instead of survey responses. While it is likely that

some measurement error exists in our data, we do not believe that it is sufficiently large

to bias the results of this study.

       The employment of RNs is measured as the full-time equivalent (FTE)

employment of RNs in each hospital for which we have data. Wages are the lowest

hourly wage reported by the hospital. We selected the lowest hourly wage for our

wage measure for two reasons. First, the lowest wage will apply to entry level nurses

with basic education and no experience. Thus, changes in this wage measure will not

be biased by differences across hospitals or over time in average RN characteristics

such as tenure or experience. Second, one might argue that labor supply is particularly

sensitive to entry-level wages, because hospitals often offer non-pecuniary benefits to

retain more senior RNs, such as more choice of shifts.




                                               15
      Based on the latitude and longitude centroid for the zip code of each hospital,

we calculated the distance from each hospital to the nearest VA. Our final sample is

limited to hospitals that are within 60 miles of a VA, and our empirical work

distinguishes hospitals that are more than 15 miles and more than 30 miles from a VA.4

Similarly, for each hospital we calculated the number of other short term general

hospitals (from the AHA Annual Survey) within a 15 mile radius. Finally, we used

similar distance calculations to identify the two nearest competitors for each hospital.

The wage at each hospital’s two nearest competitors is defined as the average log wage

of the two hospitals nearest to the hospital in question who report wages in both 1990

and 1992.

      To some extent, each VA may have had some influence over the wage change it

experienced between 1990 and 1992 through discretion over which hospitals to include

in the wage survey. This would raise doubt about the exogeneity of the VA wage

changes. An alternative measure of the change imposed on VA hospitals by the Nurse

Pay Act is the gap between market wages and VA wages in 1990, prior to the Nurse Pay

Act’s implementation. This 1990 wage gap is not influenced by the VA’s actions

following the Act, yet will measure the impact the Nurse Pay Act should have had on a

VA hospital’s wages.

      For each VA, we calculated the gap between the VA wage and its market’s wage

in 1990 as the difference between the average log wage in each VA’s market area

(weighted by hospital beds) and the VA log wage. The VA market area is defined as

either the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area, the Metropolitan Statistical Area

                                               16
(if the CMSA does not exist), or, for rural hospitals, the market area includes all other

rural hospitals in the state.

       Finally, to control for differences in the cost of living and local labor market

conditions, we construct dummy variables for the CMSA/MSA in which each hospital

is located and, for rural hospitals, dummy variables for the remainder of the state.

       Table 1 presents selected summary statistics for all hospitals, for VA hospitals,

and for non-VA hospitals. In 1990, just under 60 percent of VA hospitals paid wages

that were below market, with the average VA hospital paying 1.9 percent below

market. There was considerable variation in the wage gap across VA hospitals. The

Nurse Pay Act brought VA wages up to the market level in 1992. As a result, VA

wages increased more between 1990 and 1992 (12.5 percent) than did wages at non-VA

hospitals (9.9 percent), and the variation in wage growth was larger at VA hospitals as

well. Growth in employment also was more rapid at VA hospitals, with RN FTEs

increasing by 8.3 percent as compared to 5.6 percent in non-VA hospitals. Thus, VA

wages increased by 2.6 percent more than non-VA wages following the Nurse Pay Act,

and VA employment increased by 2.7 percent more than non-VA employment. These

estimates suggest a labor supply elasticity of around 1, although the standard error on

this simple Wald estimate is over 0.7.

       The remaining variables in Table 1 describe the ownership and location of the

hospitals in our sample. Just over 10 percent of the sample are VA hospitals. Non-VA

hospitals are, on average, 23 miles from the nearest VA, with over half of the sample

more than 15 miles from the nearest VA and about one third more than 30 miles. On

                                                17
average, both VA and non-VA hospitals have more than 10 competitors within a 15

mile radius, although there is significant variation in the number of competitors.




6. Empirical Analysis

Reduced Form Wage Equations for Non-VA Hospitals

       We examine the effect of the VA’s wage changes on wages at other hospitals by

estimating the reduced-form wage equation (5) in differenced form:

           ∆(lnwi) = α 0 + α 1∆(lnwiVA) + α 2D15i∆(lnwiVA) + α 3D30i∆(lnwiVA) + ε i         (6)


where wi is the wage at a non-VA hospital, wiVA is the wage at the nearest VA hospital

to hospital i, and D15i and D30i are dummy variables which equal one if hospital i is

more than 15 or more than 30 miles from a VA. We take the difference of each variable

between 1990 and 1992 to control for hospital characteristics which are constant over

time. As discussed above, we expect α 1 > 0 and α 2 , α 3 < 0; i.e., the change in the VA

wage should have a positive effect on the wage change in other hospitals, but this effect

should decline in magnitude as hospitals are further from the VA.

       Estimates of equation 6 are presented in Table 2. The dependent variable in all

the regressions is the change in the log wage of RNs at non-VA hospitals. Several

variations of this equation were estimated. The first column includes only the change

in the log wage at the nearest VA. The second column interacts the VA wage change

with two dummy variables: one for whether the hospital is more than 15 miles from a



                                                 18
VA and another for whether there is more than a 30 mile distance. The third column

adds MSA dummy variables to allow for area specific trends in wages. Finally, the

fourth column adds dummy variables for being more than 15 and 30 miles from a VA.

       The results for all specifications are consistent with the theory. The VA wage

change has a positive and significant effect on wages at neighboring hospitals, but this

effect is significantly smaller (about half the magnitude) in hospitals that are 15-30

miles from a VA, and disappears almost entirely for hospitals more than 30 miles from

a VA hospital. For example, in the first column we estimate that the elasticity of wages

at non-VA hospitals with respect to the VA wage is .128, i.e. a 1.28 percent increase in

response to a 10 percent increase in the wage at the nearest VA. In the second column

we allow the effect of the VA wage to vary with distance to the VA. The estimated

elasticity increases to .178 for hospitals within 15 miles of a VA (the reference group),

but is significantly lower for hospitals 15-30 miles from the VA (.100), and lower still for

hospitals more than 30 miles from the VA (.051).5 Results for the remaining

specifications are quite similar.

       Changes in the VA wage were not entirely determined by the law since VA

hospitals had some discretion in determining which hospitals to survey in setting 1992

wages. Thus, some of the positive correlation between VA wage growth and wage

growth at nearby hospitals may reflect the VA’s response to wages at other hospitals.

The gap between the market wage and the VA wage in 1990 is used in Table 3 as a

proxy that predicts the wage growth that resulted from the Nurse Pay Act. This wage

gap in 1990 is not influenced by the VA’s later actions. The first column of Table 3

                                                19
estimates the relationship between this proxy and actual wage growth between 1990

and 1992 at the VA hospitals. There is a very strong relationship between the wage gap

that existed for each VA in 1990 and each VA’s subsequent wage growth, with a

precisely estimated coefficient on the wage gap that is near one and an R-squared on

this simple regression of just over 0.5.

       The remaining columns of Table 3 (columns II-V) estimate the same

specifications as in Table 2 for non-VA hospitals using the wage gap from 1990 in place

of actual wage growth at the nearest VA. The results are quite similar to those of Table

2 (although the estimated elasticities are noticeably larger when MSA dummies are

included). In particular, the wage gap has a positive, statistically significant effect on

wage growth at non-VAs, and this effect is smaller at hospitals that are further from the

VA.

       The first two columns of Table 4 investigate whether the effect of the VA wage

change on other hospitals’ wage growth is larger in markets with fewer competitors, as

suggested by our simple model. The first column limits the sample to hospitals that

had fewer than five competitors within 15 miles, and the second column limits the

sample to hospitals with five or more competitors within 15 miles. Each regression

includes the VA wage gap in 1990, this gap interacted with dummy variables for being

more than 15 and more than 30 miles from a VA, and MSA dummy variables. The

point estimates indicate that changes in the VA wage has similar effects on hospitals in

competitive markets to those in less competitive markets. These results provide no

evidence that a wage change at an individual hospital is less important when there are

                                                20
more hospitals in the market. However, the standard errors on these estimates are

quite large, so the power of this test is obviously low.

       When the VA implemented the Nurse Pay Act, it did not change nominal wages

at hospitals that paid higher wages than the market. Thus, we should not observe a

response by non-VA hospitals to the 1990 VA wage gap if the gap is negative because

the negative gap was not correlated with the actual wage change at the VA. Columns

III and IV of Table 4 examine this possibility. Column III presents the coefficients of an

equation for non-VA hospitals with a positive wage gap at the nearest VA (i.e., the VA

wage is lower than the market wage). As expected, the VA wage change has a large,

statistically significant effect on non-VA hospitals’ wages. Column IV presents the

same equation for hospitals for which the VA wage gap is negative. Where the VAMC

paid more than the market, and thus didn’t change its wages with the Nurse Pay Act,

the VA wage gap has no effect on the wages of other hospitals.


Labor Supply Equations for All Hospitals

       We estimate the labor supply equation (3) in a first-difference form to measure

the elasticity of supply of RNs:

                             ∆(lnL i) = θ0 + θ1∆(lnwi - lnwj) + µi                       (7)


Li is the number of RN FTEs employed at hospital i (for VAs and other hospitals), wi is

the wage at hospital i, and lnwj is the average log wage at hospital i’s two nearest

competitors. θ1 is the elasticity of supply of RNs to an individual hospital. We found

evidence of heteroskedasticity in the error, and therefore weight all regressions by the


                                                  21
number of beds at the hospital in 1990.

      As discussed earlier, OLS estimates of equation (5) are biased. We estimate

equation (7) using two-stage least squares. The VA wage change mandated by the

Nurse Pay Act provides the instrument for the change in the log wage gap ∆(lnwi -

lnwj). We take care in specifying the first stage equation. According to theory, the

impact of the VA wage change on ∆(lnwi - lnwj) depends on whether the hospital and

its nearest neighbors are VA hospitals and, if not, which VA the hospital is closest to

and how far it is from that VA. The estimates in Tables 2, 3, and 4 suggest that the wage

growth in any given hospital should be specified as:

∆lnwi=π 0+DVAi(π 1+ π 2∆lnwiva)+
(1-DVAi)(π 3∆lnwiva+π 4D15+π 5D30+π 6D15∆lnwiva+π 7D30∆lnwiva)                            (6)


where DVA is an indicator for being a VA hospital. In the first stage equation, we wish

to estimate the difference in wage growth between a hospital and its two nearest

neighbors. Therefore, the appropriate specification for the first stage includes the

differences between the hospital and each of its two nearest neighbors. Table A1

provides estimates of the first stage equations for various specifications. The

coefficients are generally as expected. F-tests indicate that the instruments are strongly

correlated with the change in the wage gap.

      Estimates of labor supply elasticities from two-stage least squares estimates of

equation (7) are given in Table 5. The first three columns construct the instruments

using the actual wage change at the VA. The first specification does not include the

instruments that rely on distance from a VA, while the second specification adds these

                                               22
instruments. Column III adds MSA dummies and a dummy for being a VA to the

supply equation. The MSA dummies capture local factors (such as alternative wages)

that may influence supply, while the VA dummy captures any common change at the

VA that may have made employment more or less attractive at the VA. The remaining

three columns of Table 5 repeat these specifications but construct the instruments using

the wage gap at the VA in 1990 as a proxy for the actual VA wage change (for reasons

discussed earlier). For all specifications, we tested and could not reject the over-

identifying restrictions; therefore, our instruments appear appropriate for our model.

          The labor supply elasticities estimated in Table 5 are reasonably consistent

across specifications. The estimates range from 0 to 0.2, with standard errors of about

0.13. Thus, for the specifications in Table 5, we estimate an inelastic short-run labor

supply curve facing hospitals. Even the high end of the 95% confidence intervals for the

labor supply elasticity does not go above 0.5. These estimates of labor supply elasticity

are an order of magnitude smaller than those estimated by Sullivan (1989) and Hansen

(1992).

          Table 6 estimates specifications similar to those in Table 5, but allows the change

in own wage and the change in the nearest competitor’s wage to have separate effects

rather than constraining them to enter as a difference.6 If the specifications of Table 5

are correct, own wage and competitor’s wage should enter with opposite signed

coefficients of the same magnitude. The coefficients are generally opposite signed and

the magnitudes are small, with elasticity estimates for these specifications remaining in

the 0 to 0.2 range. The only exception is for the specification that includes MSA

                                                  23
dummies and the actual change in the VA wage: for this specification the coefficient on

the wage change at competitors is poorly identified and the point estimate is wrong-

signed.

       Table 7 investigates the sensitivity of these estimates when the sample is

restricted to (1) VA hospitals, (2) non-VA hospitals, (3) hospitals with fewer than five

competitors within 15 miles, (4) hospitals with five or more competitors within 15

miles, and (5) hospitals for which the nearest VA had a positive wage gap. The basic

conclusions are not particularly sensitive to these sample restrictions. All of the

elasticity estimates remain small relative to the previous literature. There is more

range in the elasticity estimates for these specifications (from -0.1 to 0.6) but this might

be expected given the relatively large standard errors for these specifications relative to

those reported in Table 5.



7. Discussion

       Our analysis provides two pieces of evidence which suggest that hospitals have

market power in the nurse labor market and act as monopsonists in setting wages.

First, we find that competing hospitals respond to legislated wage changes at the VA --

a ten percent increase in wages at the VA is estimated to have increased wages by two

percent at hospitals within 15 miles, and by roughly one percent in hospitals 15-30

miles from the VA. Second, we find that the labor supply curve facing an individual

hospital is very inelastic – a ten percent increase in wages is estimated to increase labor

supply by between zero and two percent;


                                                 24
       These results contradict much of the recent literature investigating monopsony.

This literature has found little (if any) evidence of monopsony power in the labor

market. In particular, our estimates of the labor supply elasticity are an order of

magnitude below comparable estimates in the literature. This raises the question: Why

is this so?

       One key difference between this study and others is in the instruments used to

identify the supply elasticity. We rely on a legislated change in the wage at the VA as

an instrument. Thus, our identification is similar to recent studies of the minimum

wage, which also find that legislated changes in wages have small positive effects on

employment. Moreover, these legislated changes in wages are arguably ideal

instruments for this problem because they come close to simulating the thought

experiment that matters for labor supply: how will an exogenous increase in wages

affect the VA’s ability to attract nurses? The earlier literature used changes in caseload

at the hospital as an instrument. As argued earlier, there are reasons to believe that

caseload may not be a valid instrument and the potential bias would be in the direction

of overstating supply elasticities.

       A second difference is our data. We have relied on starting wage data (rather

than average wages) which avoids potential aggregation bias that may lead to bias in

estimating wage changes. In addition, we are more careful to focus on the difference

between a hospital’s wages and those of its nearest competitors, while the existing

literature has generally measured competing wages as average wages at the county or

MSA level. Finally, our estimates rely on data from 1990-92, while both Sullivan (1989)

                                               25
and Hansen (1992) use data from the early and mid 1980s when dramatic changes in

hospital reimbursement may have resulted in bias.

       Apart from differences in our data and instruments, our focus on VA hospitals

may be generating the difference in our findings. Our evidence of market power may

be due to the fact that hospitals are a textbook example of monopsony, and VA

hospitals are highly differentiated workplaces (by being a federal employer and

serving a unique cohort of patients). The supply of nurses might thus be segmented

according to RNs’ preferences for working or not working at VA facilities, reducing the

response of labor supply to the change in the VA wage. On the other hand, it is not

clear that the case of a VA hospital is that different from employers in other sectors of

the economy. For example, within the fast-food or high-tech industries, workplaces are

also highly differentiated in terms of corporate culture and customer base. Therefore,

our results may be representative of the monopsony power exercised by many

employers.

       Our estimates of the short-run labor supply elasticity around 0.1 are quite low.

If these were long-run elasticity estimates, they would imply that the marginal revenue

product (MRP) of RNs was about 10 times their wage. However, common sense and

most empirical studies (Sullivan, 1989; Hansen, 1992) suggest that long-run elasticities

are considerably higher than short-run elasticities. Unfortunately, data were

unavailable to examine longer-run supply elasticities.7 However, if we assume that the

long-run elasticity is infinite, then Boal and Ransom (1997) have shown that the amount

of “exploitation” – the difference between MRP and the wage as a fraction of the wage –

                                                26
is given by the short-run inverse elasticity of supply multiplied by r/(1+r), where r is

the discount rate. Thus, for a discount rate of 5%, our elasticity estimates imply that the

MRP of RNs was about 50% above their wages. This evidence, therefore, suggests that

firms have considerable monopsony power.

All wages refer to starting (lowest) wages of RNs.
The market wage is calculated as the average starting wage in 1990 among hospitals in each VA's market.
The market wage is a weighted average, using the number of hospital beds as weights. Markets are CMSAs;
MSA for hospitals not in a CMSA; and state for hospitals not in a MSA or CMSA.

All regressions are weighted by the number of hospital beds in 1990. Standard errors in parentheses.
All wages refer to starting (lowest) wages of RNs. Wages of competitors (CompWage92,Compwage90) are the
average log wage of the hospital's two closest competitors who report wages in both 1990 and 1992.
Columns IV-VI use the VA log wage gap in 1990 (log(market wage)-log(VA wage)) in place of the change in the log
VA wage in constructing all independent variables. The market wage is constructed as discussed in the footnote to
Table 3.

1   The local market for each VA is defined as the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical

Area (CMSA) or Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in which the VA is located. The 27

VA hospitals in rural areas are allowed to determine their local competitors within

reasonable limits. If there are 15 or fewer non-VA hospitals in the local market, all

hospitals are surveyed. If there are more than 15 other hospitals, the survey is based on

a sample of the other hospitals.

2   These figures are computed from the data discussed below.

3   The 1992 American Hospital Association survey discussed below has about one

percent fewer observations than the 1990 data. Thus, the assumption that the number

of hospitals is constant does not seem overly restrictive.

4   Our results are not sensitive to the 60-mile limit to our sample.

5   Note that equation 6 is specified so that the effects are cumulative, e.g. the effect of the

VA wage on wages at hospitals more than 30 miles away is .178-.078-.049=.051.

6   For the specifications in Table 6 we include own wage growth and wage growth at the

two nearest competitors separately and instrument for both. In those specifications we

add the undifferenced versions of the right hand side variables in equation (6) to our

instrument list – these added instruments can predict wage growth at a hospital,

whereas the differenced versions can only predict the difference in wage growth

between a hospital and its neighbors.
