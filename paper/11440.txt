This paper examines the co-movement among stock market prices and exchange rates within a three-

country Center-Periphery dynamic equilibrium model in which agents in the Center country face

portfolio constraints. In our model, international transmission occurs through the terms of trade,

through the common discount factor for cash flows, and, finally, through an additional channel

reflecting the tightness of the portfolio constraints. Portfolio constraints are shown to generate

endogenous wealth transfers to or from the Periphery countries. These implicit transfers are

responsible for creating contagion among the terms of trade of the Periphery countries, as well as

their stock market prices. Under a portfolio constraint limiting investment of the Center country in

the stock markets of the Periphery, stock prices also exhibit a flight to quality: a negative shock to

one of the Periphery countries depresses stock prices throughout the Periphery, while boosting the

stock market in the Center.

1.     Introduction

As the volume of international trade in the world continues to grow and ﬁnancial markets become
more integrated, the transmission of shocks across countries has intensiﬁed. Nowadays, even rela-
tively small markets may set oﬀ worldwide ﬁnancial instability. The most prominent examples are
the 1994 Mexican, 1997 Asian, and 1998 Russian crises. Without a doubt, the extent and severity
of the transmission of these crises surprised many—academics and practitioners—and sparked a
vast literature on international ﬁnancial contagion.

     International transmission have been typically attributed to one of the two channels. The ﬁrst
one, put forward by the international trade literature, is the terms of trade.1 A shock to one of the
countries aﬀects its terms of trade with the rest of the world. Consequently, the trading partners of
the country see their goods become more or less valuable, aﬀecting their proﬁts and ultimately their
stock prices. The second channel, highlighted in the international asset pricing literature, is the
common worldwide discount factor for cash ﬂows (common state prices).2 Provided that ﬁnancial
markets are frictionless, stock prices of all ﬁrms in the world have to be equal to their expected
cash ﬂows, discounted with the same state prices. Innovations to these state prices then have to
aﬀect stock returns worldwide, generating the co-movement in stock returns even when there is
no correlation in their cash ﬂows. While these two transmission channels are clearly at play, they
cannot account for many important transmission patterns found in the data. First, empirical studies
have cast doubt on the relative importance of the trade channel, demonstrating that even countries
with insigniﬁcant trade relationships see their stock prices co-move very strongly. For instance,
during the 1998 crisis in Russia, stock markets of Argentina and Brazil suﬀered more than those
of some of Russia’s neighbors. Even more surprising is the ﬁnding that some countries sharing
strong trade relationships with a country in crisis, did not suﬀer at all. For example, Honduras and
Guatemala were unaﬀected by the Mexican crises; the same can be said about Chile, Colombia and
Costa Rica in reference to the 1994 Mexican, 1999 Brazilian, and 2002 Argentinean crises. Second,

     For the theory of contagion through trade, or what is also known as “competitive devaluations”, see Gerlach
and Smets (1995), as well as Corsetti, Pesenti, Roubini, and Tille (1998) and Corsetti, Pesenti, Roubini, and Tille
(2000). These papers concentrate solely on the trade channel. For the empirical evidence of trade as the propagation
mechanism see Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz (1996). See also Bae, Karolyi, and Stulz (2000), Baig and Goldfajn
(1998), Baig and Goldfajn (2000), Eichengreen and Mody (2000), Glick and Rose (1999), Gregorio and Valdes (2001),
Ito and Hashimoto (2002), Karolyi and Stulz (1996) Kelejian, Tavlas, and Hondroyiannis (2003), and Novo (2002).

     See Ammer and Mei (1996), Cochrane, Longstaﬀ, and Santa-Clara (2004), Dumas, Harvey, and Ruiz (2000),
Kodres and Pritsker (2002), and Kyle and Xiong (2001). These papers are all cast in a single-good framework, and
hence highlight exclusively the role of the common discount factor channel (or attribute the cross-stock spillovers to
portfolio rebalancing, which is equivalent in this framework).



                                                          1
the relative importance of the common discount factor channel has also been questioned. Although
this theory is able to explain why a crisis may spill over to countries with no trade relationships, it
cannot explain why some countries suﬀer disproportionately more than others. At times of crises,
the industrialized economies seem to the aﬀected the least. One further challenge is to explain
why events such as credit rating downgrades have a ﬁrst-order eﬀect both on the level and on the
degree of international co-movement in the short run (Eichengreen and Mody (2000), Kaminsky
and Schmukler (2002), and Rigobon (2002)). According to the trade and the common discount
factor theories, a change in a credit rating should have no immediate economic consequences.

    The view we advocate in this paper is that stocks belonging to the same asset class, e.g., stock
markets of emerging economies, have to exhibit additional co-movement beyond that entailed by the
above two channels.3 It is commonplace amongst institutional investors, pension funds and mutual
funds to face a portfolio constraint limiting exposure to a certain asset class. Then a tightening or
a loosening of such a constraint should aﬀect prices of all assets belonging to this class.

    We try to understand formally the workings of this channel within a uniﬁed framework which
also encompasses international propagation both through the terms of trade and the common dis-
count factor. We thus account for important general-equilibrium interactions of the possible trans-
mission mechanisms. The main message of the paper is that ﬁnancial constraints generate wealth
transfers among international investors, which are the central force behind the portfolio constraints
channel of contagion. From the methodological viewpoint, this paper presents a ﬂexible model
which can be used to study many diﬀerent constraints. The model produces non-trivial implica-
tions for the impact of the constraints on the terms of trade, stock prices, and their co-movement,
which can be characterized in closed-form. While diﬀerent constraints may have diﬀerent implica-
tions for asset market dynamics, they all operate through their impact on investors’ distribution of
wealth and the ensuing wealth transfers.

    We consider a three-country Center-Periphery dynamic equilibrium model. We think of the
Center country as a large developed economy and of the two Periphery countries as emerging
markets. Each country produces its own good via a Lucas (1978) tree-type technology, where
each tree’s production is driven by its own supply shock. Each country consumes all three goods
   3
     The ﬁrst work proposing this channel is Calvo (1999) which argues that limits of arbitrage (margin requirements)
are at the heart of the Russian contagion. See also Boyer, Kumagai, and Yuan (2005), Gromb and Vayanos (2002),
Mendoza and Smith (2002), and Yuan (2005). For evidence on how mutual funds respond to shocks in emerging
markets see Broner, Gelos, and Reinhart (2004), Edison and Warnock (2003), Gelos and Wei (2002), Kaminsky,
Lyons, and Schmukler (2000), Karolyi (2003), Stulz (1999), and Stulz (2003).



                                                         2
available in the world, albeit with a preference bias towards its own good. There are no frictions in
the goods markets, but ﬁnancial markets are imperfect in that agents in the Center country face a
portfolio constraint. We specialize countries’ preferences so that, absent the portfolio constraints,
the model entails (i) constant wealth distribution and (ii) identical portfolio compositions across
international investors. This allows us to better disentangle the eﬀects of the portfolio constraint
from those of the other two channels. The portfolio constraint alters the wealth distribution and
the portfolio compositions, introducing a common stochastic factor, which reﬂects the tightness of
the constraint, into the dynamics of the stock prices and the terms of trade.

       A constraint imposed on the Center country is thus responsible for generating endogenous
wealth transfers to or from the Periphery countries. One can then appeal to the classic Transfer
Problem of international economics to pinpoint the directions of the responses of the terms of trade
to a tightening of the portfolio constraint.4 A wealth transfer to the Periphery countries improves
their terms of trade; this in turn boosts their stock market prices. The eﬀect of the transfer on the
Center country is the opposite. The portfolio constraint thus always increases the co-movement
among the stock market prices and the terms of trade of the Periphery beyond that implied by
the trade and the common discount factor channels, and decreases their co-movement with the
Center. We verify that these results hold even when the Periphery countries do not trade amongst
themselves.

       Finally, to gain further insight, we consider two examples of portfolio constraints and fully
characterize the states in which they tighten (loosen) and hence the direction of the ensuing wealth
transfers. Both constraints impose a limit on how much the Center can invest in the stocks of
the Periphery countries. We ﬁnd that both constraints give rise to two eﬀects we highlight: an
ampliﬁcation and a ﬂight to quality. An ampliﬁcation is said to occur when a shock to one country
has a larger impact on its stock market than that entailed by the unconstrained model. A ﬂight
to quality refers to the phenomenon where a negative shock to one of the Periphery countries (an
emerging market) depresses stock prices throughout the Periphery, while boosting the stock price
of the Center (developed) country.5
   4
     The Transfer Problem stems from the argument made originally by Keynes that in a world with a home bias
in consumption (like ours) an income transfer from one country to another will improve the terms of trade of the
recipient country.
   5
     There are other deﬁnitions of a “ﬂight to quality” employed in macroeconomics, international economics, and
ﬁnance, which diﬀer across applications. See e.g., Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1996), Eichengreen, Hale, and
Mody (2001), and Vayanos (2004).




                                                        3
      In terms of the modeling framework, the closest to our work are the two-good two-country asset-
pricing models of Helpman and Razin (1978), Cole and Obstfeld (1991), and Zapatero (1995), which
feature both the trade and the common discount factor channels of international transmission. All
these are tractable asset pricing models like ours. In contrast to our paper, however, all these works
share an implication that stock markets worldwide are perfectly correlated, and therefore, ﬁnancial
markets are irrelevant for risk sharing purposes. Indeed, Cole and Obstfeld argue that in such a
model Pareto optimality is achieved with or without ﬁnancial markets. All three works call for a
variation on the model that does not produce such abnormal equilibrium behavior, and our model is
one such attempt. Neither our benchmark unconstrained economy, nor the economy with portfolio
constraints possess the undesirable property that the ﬁnancial markets are irrelevant.6 Also related
is the literature on portfolio constraints in asset pricing. Basak and Croitoru (2000), Basak and
Cuoco (1998), Detemple and Murthy (1997), Detemple and Serrat (2003), Gallmeyer and Holliﬁeld
(2004), Shapiro (2002), among others, all consider the eﬀects of portfolio constraints on asset prices.
While we employ a similar solution methodology, our implications are quite diﬀerent because we
depart from their single-good framework.


2.      The Model

Our goal is to investigate how portfolio constraints aﬀect the co-movement of asset prices and
terms of trade. Towards that end, we develop a three country Center-Periphery model in the
spirit of Lucas (1982). We think of the Center country as a large developed economy and of
the two Periphery countries as small emerging markets. First, we present our model, designed
to capture standard features of asset pricing and open economy macroeconomics models in the
simplest possible setting. The only ﬁnancial market imperfection we allow for in the model is that
investors in the Center face a portfolio constraint. Second, we solve the model in the absence of
the constraint—our benchmark—and characterize the mechanism underlying the co-movement of
asset prices and terms of trade. Third, we study the general constrained case and show that a
constraint gives rise to an additional common factor driving the co-movement of the terms of trade
and stock prices in the Periphery countries. This factor is proportional to the relative wealth of
international investors. We then demonstrate that our main insights carry through in the setting
  6
    Other recent attempts to break the result of Helpman and Razin are Engel and Matsumoto (2004), Ghironi, Lee,
and Rebucci (2005), Pavlova and Rigobon (2003), Serrat (2001), as well as Soumare and Wang (2005), which is the
closest to ours in terms of the modeling framework.



                                                       4
where there is no trade among the Periphery countries. Finally, we consider two speciﬁc constraints,
a concentration and a market share constraint, and demonstrate how portfolio constraints can cause
ampliﬁcation of shocks and a ﬂight to quality.


2.1.      The Economic Setting

We consider a continuous-time pure-exchange world economy along the lines of Pavlova and Rigobon
(2003). The economy has a ﬁnite horizon, [0, T ], with uncertainty represented by a ﬁltered prob-
ability space (Ω, F, {Ft }, P ), on which is deﬁned a standard three-dimensional Brownian mo-
tion w(t) = (w0 (t), w1 (t), w2 (t)) , t ∈ [0, T ]. All stochastic processes are assumed adapted to
{Ft ; t ∈ [0, T ]}, the augmented ﬁltration generated by w. All stated (in)equalities involving ran-
dom variables hold P -almost surely. In what follows, given our focus, we assume all processes
introduced to be well-deﬁned, without explicitly stating regularity conditions ensuring this.

      There are three countries in the world economy, indexed by j ∈ {0, 1, 2}. Country 0 represents
a large Center country (e.g., an industrialized economy) and countries 1 and 2 smaller Periphery
countries (e.g., emerging economies). Each country j produces its own perishable good via a strictly
positive output process modeled as a Lucas (1978) tree:

                   dY j (t) = µY j (t) Y j (t) dt + σY j (t) Y j (t) dwj (t),   j ∈ {0, 1, 2},     (1)

where µY j and σY j > 0 are arbitrary adapted processes. The price of the good produced by
country j is denoted by pj . Since prices are not pinned done in a real model such as ours, we need
to adopt a numeraire. We ﬁx a basket containing β ∈ (0, 1) units of the good produced in Country
0 and (1 − β)/2 units of each of the remaining two goods and normalize the price of this basket
to be equal to unity. We think of β as the size of the (large) Center country relative to the world
economy.

      Investment opportunities are represented by four securities. Each country j issues a stock S j ,
a claim to its output. All stocks are in unit supply. There is also the “world” bond B, which is a
money market account locally riskless in units of the numeraire.7 The bond is in zero net supply.
It is convenient to deﬁne the terms of trade from the viewpoint the Center country (country 0):
q 1 ≡ p1 /p0 and q 2 ≡ p2 /p0 are the terms of trade of the Periphery countries 1 and 2, respectively,
with the Center country.
  7
      All other bonds are redundant.

      A representative consumer-investor of each country is endowed at time 0 with a total supply of
the stock market of his country; the initial wealth of agent i is denoted by Wi (0). Each consumer i
chooses nonnegative consumption of each good (Ci0 (t), Ci1 (t), Ci2 (t)), i ∈ {0, 1, 2}, and a portfolio
                                                    0        1       2

In our preferences speciﬁcation, we are building on the insights from the open economy macroeco-
nomics. In particular, we require that our speciﬁcation possesses the following cornerstone prop-
erties: it must be consistent with a broader set of models incorporating non-tradable goods and
it must be suﬃciently ﬂexible to capture demand shifts. The presence of non-tradable goods pro-
duces a home bias in consumption, well-documented empirically and widely accepted to be the force
behind the improvement in the terms of trade in response to a demand shift toward domestically-
produced goods (or an income transfer). Instead of explicitly modeling the non-tradable goods
sector, we adopt a reduced-form approach that produces the same implications: we set the prefer-
ence weight on the domestically-produced good, αi , to be greater than 1/3 (and less than 1).8 This
assumption is responsible for the home bias in consumption occurring in our model.
  8
    This assumption may be replaced by explicitly accounting for the demand of non-tradables and assuming that
the non-tradables are produced using domestically produced goods. The implications of both models are identical
and we hence adopted the more parsimonious speciﬁcation. Furthermore, note that the purpose of the assumption is
to generate a home bias in consumption, and not in portfolios.



                                                         6
       The other component, demand shifts, is also an important source of uncertainty behind our
theory of asset price co-movement. First, in the absence of demand uncertainty, free trade in goods
may imply excessively high correlation of stock market prices (see Helpman and Razin (1978), Cole
and Obstfeld (1991), and Zapatero (1995)). Second, empirical evidence indicates that demand
uncertainty is of the same order of magnitude as supply uncertainty (see Pavlova and Rigobon).
The literature oﬀers several alternative modeling approaches that capture demand shocks. In this
paper we have opted to follow the seminal contribution of Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson
(1977). A change in αi in our model exactly parallels their demand shifts toward domestically
produced goods. Although the interpretation we favor is the one from Dornbusch, Fischer, and
Samuelson, it is important to highlight that in our reduced-form model a demand shock may also
be interpreted as a shift in the demand toward non-tradable goods. We assume that each αi is a
martingale (i.e., E[αi (s)|Ft ] = αi (t), s > t), and hence can be represented as

                               dα1 (t) = σα1 (t) dw(t),       dα2 (t) = σα2 (t) dw(t),

where σα1 (t) and σα2 (t) are such that our restrictions on α1 and α2 are satisﬁed.9 Since our primary
focus is on the Periphery countries, for expositional clarity, we keep the preference parameter of the
Center country, α0 , ﬁxed. The log-linear speciﬁcation of the preferences is adopted for tractability:
it allows us to derive closed-form expressions for stock prices. These preferences also generate
wealth eﬀects driving portfolio rebalancing in our model, which are essential for understanding the
portfolio constraints channel of contagion. In Section 6 we discuss potential drawbacks of log-linear
utilities.

       Investment policies of the residents of Periphery countries 1 and 2 are unconstrained. However,
the Center (country 0) resident faces a portfolio constraint, which we here specify in the most general
form, suggested by Cvitanić and Karatzas (1992). Namely, portfolio values x0 are constrained to
lie in a closed, convex, non-empty subset K ∈ R3 . Moreover, the subset K may be replaced
by a family {Kt (ω); (t, ω) ∈ [0, T ] × Ω}. Making the constraint set stochastic, and in particular

emerging markets S 1 and S 2 . This speciﬁcation can also capture constraints on borrowing, VaR
constraints, margin requirements, collateral constraints, etc. In this paper, we do not provide
a model supporting the economic rationale behind imposing portfolio constraints. Typically, such
constraints are either government-imposed or arise in response to an agency problem in institutional
money management as a device limiting risk-taking choices of a manager (see, for example, Basak,
Pavlova, and Shapiro (2005), Dybvig, Farnsworth, and Carpenter (2001)). The later are prevalent
in developed countries, where risk management practices are particularly sophisticated, motivating
our choice of studying the eﬀects of portfolio constraints imposed on the Center country.


2.2.      Countries’ Optimization

Periphery countries 1 and 2 are unconstrained and are facing (potentially) dynamically complete
markets.11 This implies existence of a common state price density process ξ, consistent with no
arbitrage, given by

                                      dξ(t) = −ξ(t)[r(t)dt + m(t) dw(t)],                                                         (3)

where r is the interest rate on the Bond and m is the (vector) market price of risk process associated
with the Brownian motions w0 , w1 , and w2 . The quantity ξ(t, ω) is interpreted as the Arrow-Debreu
price per unit probability P of one unit of the numeraire delivered in state ω ∈ Ω at time t.

       Building on Cox and Huang (1989) and Karatzas, Lehoczky, and Shreve (1987), we convert
optimization problems of consumers i = 1, 2 into the following static variational problem:

    Although we have three independent sources of uncertainty and four securities available for investment, market
completeness is not necessarily guaranteed (see Cass and Pavlova (2004)). To ensure the validity of our solution
method, we need to verify that none of the securities comprising the investment opportunity set ends up being
redundant in the equilibrium we construct.


                                                                     8
    On the other hand, the Center country is facing ﬁnancial markets with frictions, and hence,
in general, the above state price density process would not appropriately reﬂect its investment
opportunity set. Instead, the state price density faced by the Center is

                                  dξ0 (t) = −ξ0 (t)[r0 (t)dt + m0 (t) dw(t)],                                                           (8)

where the Center-speciﬁc subscript                 0    denotes the quantities that, in general, are country-speciﬁc.
These quantities reﬂect the impact of the portfolio constraint on the investment opportunity set of
the Center country. The optimization problem of the Center subject to the portfolio constraints is
formally equivalent to an auxiliary problem with no constraints but the Center facing a ﬁctitious
investment opportunity set in which the unrestricted investments are made more attractive relative
to the original market and the restricted investments are made relatively less attractive (Cvitanić
and Karatzas (1992)). Cvitanić and Karatzas show that the tilt in the ﬁctitious investment oppor-
tunity set is characterized by the multipliers on the portfolio constraints. Furthermore, one can still
represent the constrained consumer’s problem in a static form, with the personalized state price
density ξ0 replacing ξ in (4)–(5):

    As is to be expected in a model with log-linear preferences, the consumption expenditure on
each good is proportional to wealth. This is a direct consequence of the optimality conditions
(6)–(10). However, in our economy the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth is stochastic,
due to possible demand shifts.

       Lemma 1 allows us to easily generalize the standard implication of the single-good models
that logarithmic agents follow myopic trading strategies, holding only the Merton (1971) mean-
variance eﬃcient portfolio. Let σ represent the volatility matrix of the (unconstrained) investment
opportunity set.

Corollary 1. The countries’ portfolios of risky assets are given by

                     x0 (t) = (σ(t) )−1 m0 (t),    xi (t) = (σ(t) )−1 m(t),     i ∈ {1, 2}.


Note that the portfolio of the investor in the Center generally diﬀers from those chosen by the
investors in the Periphery because his investment opportunity set is augmented by the portfolio
constraint in the sense that his eﬀective market price of risk m0 diﬀers from that faced by the
(unconstrained) investors in the Periphery. Only when the constraint is absent or not binding all
investors in the world economy hold the same portfolio.12


2.3.      Benchmark Unconstrained Equilibrium

To facilitate the comparisons with the economy where the Center’s consumer faces a portfolio
constraint, we solve for an equilibrium in a benchmark economy with no constraints. Our solution
approach replies on aggregating the countries’ representative consumers into a world representative
agent. The representative agent is endowed with the aggregate supply of securities and consumes
the aggregate output. His utility is given by
  12
    This result may appear surprising because the investors in our model are heterogenous. However, it follows from
Lemma 1 that their consumption expenditures constitute the same fraction of wealth. Thus the investors trade assets
to achieve the maximal possible consumption expenditure (which requires the same portfolios), and then allocate this
expenditure among goods through importing/exporting.

where λi > 0, i = 0, 1, 2 are the weights on consumers 0, 1, and 2, respectively. These weights
are going to be constant in the unconstrained economy, but will be stochastic in the economy with
portfolio constraints. In the unconstrained case, these weights are the inverses of the Lagrange
multipliers on the consumers’ intertemporal budget constraints. Since in equilibrium these multi-
pliers, and hence the weights, cannot be individually determined, we adopt a normalization λ0 = 1.

These consumption allocations are similar to familiar sharing rules arising in equilibrium models
with logarithmic preferences. In the benchmark economy with perfect risk sharing, the correlation
between consumption of a particular good and its aggregate output would have been perfect if not
for the demand shifts.

   Since consuming the aggregate output must be optimal for the representative agent, the terms

Since in our model the terms of trade would play a central role in linking together the countries’
stock markets, we structure our benchmark economy so as to be able to capture some of their
most important properties highlighted in international economics. First, the terms of trade of the
Periphery countries with the Center decrease in their domestic output and increase in the Center’s
output. This is a standard feature of Ricardian models of international trade: terms of trade
move against countries experiencing an increase in productivity or output as their goods become
relatively less scarce.13 Second, we attempt to capture the “dependent economy” eﬀects highlighted
in open economy macroeconomics: the terms of trade improve for a country, i, that has experienced
a positive demand shift (an increase in αi ). The intuition for this result is that a higher demand
for domestic goods increases the price of domestic relative to foreign goods, improving the terms
of trade.

      Finally, in our model stock prices can be computed in closed-form (Lemma 2 in the Appendix):
                                                          1

                                                                             Y 0 (t)(T − t),                      (16)

                                                      q 1 (t)
                              S 1 (t) =          1−β 1        1−β 2
                                                                             Y 1 (t)(T − t),                      (17)
                                            β+    2 q (t) + 2 q (t)
                                                      q 2 (t)
                              S 2 (t) =          1−β 1            1−β 2
                                                                             Y 2 (t)(T − t).                      (18)

      Equations (11)–(18) summarize the prices and allocations which would prevail in the competitive
equilibrium in our economy. At this point it is important to note that wealth distribution in the
economy does not enter as a state variable in any of the above equations. This is because wealth
distribution is constant, determined by the initial shareholdings:
                                         W1 (t)                    W2 (t)
                                                = λ1      and             = λ2 .                                  (19)
                                         W0 (t)                    W0 (t)
The equalities in (19) follow from, for example, (11), combined with Lemma 1. This is a convenient
feature of our benchmark equilibrium, allowing us to disentangle the eﬀects of the time-varying
wealth distribution in the economy with constraints, presented in the next section.

      This result is independent of the wealth distribution and the consumption shares.

     The drift term I(t) is tedious but straightforward to compute. Given our focus on asset returns
correlations and not on their expected returns, it does not concern us in our analysis.

     Proposition 1 decomposes stock and commodity markets returns into responses to ﬁve under-
lying factors: demand shifts in Periphery countries 1 and 2 and output (supply) shocks in all three
countries. There responses are captured in matrix Θu , henceforth referred to as the unconstrained
dynamics. Some of the elements of Θu can be readily signed, while the signs of others are ambigu-
ous. In particular, the directions of the transmission of the supply shocks to the stock markets and
the terms of trade are unambiguous, while those for the demand shifts depends on the relative size
of the countries involved.

     Understanding the responses of the terms of the terms of trade to the shocks is key to under-
standing the transmission of the shocks to the remaining quantities. Thus, a positive supply shock
in country j creates an excess supply of good j in the world, and hence its equilibrium price has
to drop. The stock of country j beneﬁts from a higher output, while those of the other countries
beneﬁt from a higher relative price. This result is independent of the relative sizes of the countries,
and is primarily due to homothetic preferences.

     On the other hand, a positive demand shift in, say, country 1, implies a shift in the expenditure
share away from foreign goods and towards the domestic good. Assuming that the preferences of
all other countries are intact, this increases the demand for good 1 in the world and lowers the

                                                         13
demand for the other goods. Clearly, this implies that the price of good 1 relative to all other
goods increases, but what is the impact on the relative price of goods 0 and 2? This depends on
how big the demand drop for each good is. This is where the relative sizes of the countries come
into play. If, for example, countries 1 and 2 are similar and small relative to country 0, then the
resulting drop in the demand will be relatively more important for (small) country 2 than for (large)
country 0. In the limit of country 0 being close in size to the entire world economy, shocks in the
Periphery countries 1 and 2 have very small eﬀects on it. Finally, it is important to mention that
in our baseline model, all countries have trade relationships with each other, which gives rise to
this indirect eﬀect through a change in the relative price of goods 0 and 2. Absent some such trade
relationships, the responses of the relative prices to the demand shifts are unambiguous; we present
them in Section 4. The model we have developed in this paper has the purpose of studying the
implications of portfolio constraints on investors from relatively large developed countries (USA,
Europe, Japan, etc.), on the prices of relatively similar and small countries (Argentina, Brazil,
Mexico, Russia, South East Asian countries, etc.) Therefore, the following conditions are likely to
be satisﬁed:

Condition A1. The Periphery countries are small relative to the Center.

   Let us now discuss the details of the transmission mechanisms in our model and relate them to
the literature. Table 1 summarizes the patterns of responses of the terms of trade and stock prices
to the underlying shocks. One immediate implication of Table 1 is that supply shocks create co-
movement among stock market prices worldwide. The co-movement is generated by two channels of
international transmission: the terms of trade and the common worldwide discount factors for cash
ﬂows (common state prices). To illustrate the workings of the former channel, consider a positive
supply shock in country j. Such a shock has a direct (positive) eﬀect on country j’s stock market.
Additionally, it has an indirect (also positive) eﬀect on the remaining stock markets through the
terms of trade. As discussed earlier, a supply shock in country j creates an excess supply of good

j, and hence causes a drop in its price relative to the rest of the goods—i.e. the terms of trade of
country j deteriorate against the rest of the world (consistent with the Ricardian trade theory).
This implies that the prices of all the other goods increase relative to good j, boosting the value
of the stock markets in the rest of the world. This explanation of the transmission of shocks
across countries appears to be solely based on goods markets clearing, where the terms of trade
act as a propagation channel. This channel, however, is not unrelated to the second transmission
vehicle: the well-functioning ﬁnancial markets creating the common discount factor for all ﬁnancial
securities. Indeed, in our model, clearing in good markets implies clearing in stock and bond
markets as well, and hence the above intuition could be restated in terms of equilibrium responses
of the stock market prices. Such intuition for ﬁnancial contagion was highlighted by Kyle and
Xiong (2001), who see contagion as a wealth eﬀect (see also Cochrane, Longstaﬀ, and Santa-Clara
(2004)). An output shock in one of the countries always increases its stock market price and hence
each agent’s wealth (because all agents have positive positions in each stock market). At a partial
equilibrium level, a wealth increase triggers portfolio rebalancing. In particular, it is easy to show
that, for diversiﬁcation reasons, our agents demand more of all stocks. At an equilibrium level,
of course, no rebalancing takes place because the agents have identical portfolios and they must
jointly hold the entire supply of each market. Therefore, prices of all stocks move upwards to
counteract the incentive to rebalance. So the two transmission channels—the terms of trade and
the common discount factor—interact and may potentially be substitutes for each other. Note
that none of these arguments makes any assumption about the correlation of output shocks across
countries—in fact, in our model they are unrelated. The existing literature, then, would identify
the phenomenon we described here as “contagion” (the co-movement in stock markets beyond the

                                                    15
co-movement in fundamentals). In our personal views, this co-movement is not contagion—we view
it as nothing else but a simple consequence of market clearing and hence a natural propagation
that is to be expected in any international general equilibrium model. Our deﬁnition of contagion
is the co-movement in excess of the natural propagation described above.

       While supply shocks induce co-movement among the countries’ stock markets, demand shocks
potentially introduce divergence among the stock markets. Consider, for example, a positive de-
mand shift occurring in country 1. Country 1 now demands more of the domestically-produced
good and less of the foreign goods, which unambiguously increases the price of the domestic good.
The direction of the response of the other Periphery country’s terms of trade depends on its wealth
relative to the Center, λ2 . If the country is small (Condition A1), it suﬀers disproportionately
more due to a drop in demand for its good, and its terms of trade with the Center deteriorate.
The impact on the stock markets, however, requires a more detailed discussion. We can repre-
sent the stock market prices of the countries in the following form: S 0 (t) = p0 (t) Y 0 (t)(T − t),
S 1 (t) = q 1 (t)p0 (t) Y 1 (t)(T − t), and S 2 (t) = q 2 (t)p0 (t) Y 2 (t)(T − t). A demand shift in country 1
improves its relative price q 1 and deteriorates the other Periphery countries relative price q 2 , push-
ing S 1 up and S 2 down—this is the direct eﬀect. However, there is also an indirect eﬀect due to a
fall in the price level in the Center country. The conditions of similar and small Periphery countries
ensure that the impact of these demand shocks on the Center price p0 are small, forcing the terms
of trade eﬀect to dominate.14 However small, there is a drop in the price of the Center’s good p0 ,
and hence the stock price of the Center falls.

       In summary, supply- and demand-type shocks have the opposite implications on the co-movement
of the stock prices worldwide: the supply shocks are responsible for co-movement, while the demand
shifts induce divergence. The overall response of the stock markets, then, depends on the relative
importance of the two eﬀects, and, of course, on the correlation between the supply and demand
shocks.


3.       Equilibrium in the Economy with Portfolio Constraints

The previous section outlines two of the most prominent channels behind co-movement among
stock markets across the world: the trade and the common discount factor channels. Although the
  14
   In practice, this is a reasonable outcome. It is equivalent to saying that the price level of the U.S. production is
unaﬀected by the demand in a country like Russia.



                                                          16
empirical literature has shown that these two transmission mechanisms are important components
of the international propagation of shocks, it has been argued that other channels could be at play,
primarily those resulting from ﬁnancial market imperfections.15 One of the most popular imperfec-
tions raised by practitioners and academics is portfolio constraints. For example, an investor in the
Center might face an institutionally imposed portfolio constraint on exposure to the stock markets
of the Periphery. Such a constraint is likely to introduce additional co-movement between the stock
markets as investors subject to the constraint simultaneously adjust their holdings in each market
as the constraint becomes tighter. In this section, we explore the validity of this insight in a general
equilibrium framework, for a large class of portfolio constraints.


3.1.     The Common Factor due to Constraints

In the economy with ﬁnancial markets imperfections the equilibrium allocation would not be Pareto
optimal, and hence the usual construction of a representative agent’s utility as a weighted sum (with
constant weights) of individual utility functions is not possible. Instead, we are going to employ
a representative agent with stochastic weights (introduced by Cuoco and He (2001)), with these
stochastic weights capturing the eﬀects of market frictions.16 This representative agent has utility

where λi (t) > 0, i = 0, 1, 2 are (yet to be determined) weighting processes, which may be stochastic.
We again normalize the weight of the Center consumer to be equal to one (λ0 (t) = 1). The
advantage of employing this approach is that a bulk of the analysis of the previous section can
  15
     Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Végh (2003) presents a thorough review of the literature. See Calvo (1999), Yuan
(2005) for theories in which margin calls are responsible for the excess co-movement. See also Geanakoplos (2003).
See Kaminsky and Schmukler (2002) and Rigobon (2002) for empirical evidence suggesting that the co-movement
of country stock returns depends on the credit rating and on an asset class its sovereign bonds belong to. One
such example is Mexico whose correlation with other Latin American countries dropped by a half when its debt got
upgraded from non-investment grade to investment grade. Other examples include Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand
whose debt got downgraded during the 1997 Asian crisis, resulting in a sharp increase of the correlation of their stock
markets amongst themselves, as well as with Latin American markets.

     The construction of a representative agent with stochastic weights has been employed extensively in dynamic
asset pricing. See, for example, Basak and Croitoru (2000), Basak and Cuoco (1998), and Shapiro (2002). A related
approach is the extra-state-variable methodology of Kehoe and Perri (2002). For the original solution method utilizing
weights in the representative agent see Negishi (1960).

be directly imported to this section. In particular, the only required modiﬁcation to equations
(11)–(15) is that the constant weights λ1 and λ2 are now replaced by their stochastic counterparts.
The expressions for stock market prices (16)–(18) also continue to hold in the constrained economy,
although the proof of this result is substantially more involved than in the unconstrained case
(see Lemma 2 in the Appendix). Note that, as a consequence of the consumption sharing rules
and Lemma 1, we again conclude that λ1 (t) = W1 (t)/W0 (t) and λ2 (t) = W2 (t)/W0 (t). So in the
constrained economy the wealth distribution, captured by the quantities λ1 and λ2 , becomes a new
state variable. Finally, in the constrained economy, we also have an analog of Proposition 1, except
now the weighting processes λ1 and λ2 enter as additional factors. These factors capture the eﬀects
of the portfolio constraint imposed on the Center consumer.

Proposition 2. (i) In an equilibrium with the portfolio constraint, the weighting processes λ1 and
λ2 are the same up to a multiplicative constant.
    (ii) If such equilibrium exists, the joint dynamics of the terms of trade and three stock markets
in the economy with the portfolio constraint are given by

where λ(t) ≡ λ1 (t), Xλ is reported in the Appendix, and where the unconstrained dynamics matrix
Θu (t) is as deﬁned in Proposition 1.


       Proposition 2 reveals that the same transmission channels underlying the benchmark economy
are present in the economy with portfolio constraints. Ceteris paribus, the sensitivities of the
terms of trade and stock prices to the demand and supply shocks are exactly the same as in
Proposition 1. The only diﬀerence from the benchmark economy comes in the ﬁrst, dλ/λ, term.
This term summarizes the dynamics of the two stochastic weighting processes λ1 and λ2 , which end
up being proportional in equilibrium, and hence represent a single common factor we labeled λ.17
  17
    This ﬁnding depends on the fact that the two Periphery countries face the same investment opportunity set:
here, they are both unconstrained. If these two countries faced heterogeneous constraints, in general, one would not
expect their weighting processes to be proportional, and hence both λ1 and λ2 would enter as relevant factors.

Thus, the process λ should be viewed as an additional factor in stock prices and the terms of trade
dynamics, arising as a consequence of the portfolio constraints.

       One can already note the cross-markets eﬀect of portfolio constraints: the constraint aﬀects not
only the Center’s stock market, but also Periphery stocks, as well as the terms of trade. This ﬁnding
is, of course, to be expected in a general equilibrium model. The eﬀects of constraints in ﬁnancial
markets get transmitted to all other (stock, bond, and commodity) markets via pertinent market
clearing equations. Our contribution is to fully characterize these spillover eﬀects and identify their
direction. The signs of responses to the supply and demand shocks are, of course, the same as in
the benchmark unconstrained equilibrium. Additionally, we can sign the responses of all markets
to innovations in the new factor; some signs are unambiguous, and some obtain under the following

       Table 2 reveals the contribution of ﬁnancial markets frictions to international co-movement.
The ﬁrst striking implication is that the terms of trade faced by both Periphery countries move
  18
     In Appendix B we investigate this condition further, representing it as a combination of two eﬀects: (i) the
impact of a change in λ (the implied wealth transfer) on the demand for good 0 and (ii) the cross-country demand
reallocation in the Periphery countries.


                                                       19
in the same direction in response to an innovation in the λ factor. A movement in λ should be
viewed in our model as a tightening or a loosening of the portfolio constraint. Given the deﬁnition
of λ, such innovation reﬂects a wealth redistribution in the world economy to or away from the
Periphery countries. Parallels may be drawn to the literature studying the eﬀects of wealth transfers
on the terms of trade. It is well-known from the classic “Transfer Problem” of the international
economics literature that an income (wealth) transfer from one country to another improves the
terms of trade of the recipient. As wealth of the recipient of the transfer goes up, his total demand
increases, but because of the preference bias for his own good, the demand for the domestic good
increases disproportionately more. Hence the price of the home good rises relative to the foreign
goods, improving the terms of trade of the recipient.19 In our model, a decrease in the factor λ
is interpreted as a wealth transfer to the Center country. Just like in the Transfer Problem, it
results in an improvement of its terms of trade against the world and hence a deterioration of the
terms of trade of both Periphery countries—the reverse for an increase in λ. The main diﬀerence
between our work and the Transfer Problem literature is that the latter considers exogenous wealth
transfers, while wealth transfers are generated endogenously in our model as a result of a tightening
of the portfolio constraint. The direction of such a transfer (to or from the Periphery countries) in
response to a tightening or a loosening of the constraint depends on the form of a constraint.

       There exists ample empirical evidence documenting contagion among the exchange rates or the
terms of trade of emerging markets (Periphery countries, in our model).20 We oﬀer a simple theory
in which this contagion arises as a natural consequence of wealth transfers due to ﬁnancial market
frictions.

       The intuition behind the occurrence of the wealth transfers in our model is simple. Assume
for a moment that there is no constraint. Then each country holds the same portfolio. When
a (binding) constraint is imposed on the investors in the Center, their portfolio has to deviate
from the benchmark, and now the portfolios of the Center and Periphery investors diﬀer. This
means that stock market price movements will have diﬀerential eﬀects on the investors’ wealth.
  19
     See, for example, Krugman and Obstfeld (2003) for a textbook exposition. The original “Transfer Problem” was
the outcome of a debate between Bertil Ohlin and John Maynard Keynes regarding the true value of the burden
of reparations payments demanded of Germany after World War I (see Keynes (1929) and Ohlin (1929)). Keynes
argued that the payments would result in a reduction of the demand for German goods and cause a deterioration of
the German terms of trade, making the burden on Germany much higher than the actual value of the payments. On
the other hand, Ohlin’s view was that the shift in demand would have no impact on relative prices. This implication
would be correct if all countries have the exact same demands (in our model this requires an assumption that αi = 1/3,
i = 0, 1, 2.)
  20
     See, for example, Kaminsky and Schmukler (2002) and Rigobon (2002).



                                                         20
The movements of wealth obviously depend on the type of the constraint. For any constraint that
binds, however, one can say that the distribution of wealth will ﬂuctuate. Moreover, since the
Periphery countries hold identical portfolios, their wealth moves in tandem. That is, the resolution
of uncertainty always aﬀects the Periphery countries in the same way: they either both become
poorer or both become richer relative to the Center.

      The portfolio constraint also generally induces the co-movement between the stock markets of
the Periphery countries. This co-movement may be partially confounded by the Center good price
eﬀect, which is of the same nature as the one encountered in the case of the demand shifts in the
benchmark model (see Section 2). Consider, for example, a response to a positive shock in λ. While
the improving terms of trade eﬀect boosts the Periphery stock markets, the associated downward
move in p0 may potentially oﬀset this. However, given our Condition A3, the latter eﬀect is dwarfed
by the improvement in the terms of trade. If we were to quote stock market prices of the Periphery
in terms of the production basket of Center, rather than the world consumption basket, the two
Periphery markets would always co-move in response to a tightening or a loosening of the portfolio
constraint. On the other hand, the response of the stock market of the Center is unambiguous
and goes in opposite direction of λ, reﬂecting the eﬀects of an implicit wealth transfer to or from
the Center. So, in summary, the implicit wealth transfers due to the portfolio constraint create
an additional co-movement among the terms of trade of the Periphery countries, as well as their
stock market prices, while reducing the co-movement between the Center and the Periphery stock
markets.


4.      Contagion without Trade

The previous section have dealt with a model in which the Periphery countries are trading in
goods among themselves as much as with the Center country, in that the expenditure shares of
Periphery country 1 on the Center and on the other Periphery country goods were identical. In
practice, however, emerging markets trade with industrialized economies much more than amongst
themselves. Moreover, recent empirical studies of emerging markets have cast doubt on the ability
of trade relationships to generate international co-movement of observed magnitudes and have
documented that contagion exists even among countries with insigniﬁcant trade relationships.21
How much trade there is between Russia and Brazil? Since the movements in the terms of trade is

      See Kaminsky, Reinhart, and Végh (2003), and Broner, Gelos, and Reinhart (2004).

an essential ingredient of the contagion mechanism in our model, it is natural to ask whether our
results still hold under alternative assumptions regarding the extent of trade (in goods) between
the Periphery countries. In this section we take our setting to the limit and show that even when
Periphery countries do not trade at all, their stock markets will co-move as described in the baseline
analysis.

   To examine this scenario, we modify the countries’ preferences as follows:
                                      
                     u0 C00 , C01 , C02 = log C00 (t),
                                      
                     u1 C10 , C11 , C12 = (1 − α1 (t)) log C10 (t) + α1 (t) log C11 (t),
                                      
                     u2 C20 , C21 , C22 = (1 − α2 (t)) log C20 (t) + α2 (t) log C22 (t).

That is, we assume that the goods produced by the Periphery countries are non-traded. Moreover,
the only trade occurring in the model is that between each Periphery country and the Center. We
continue to assume that there is a home bias in consumption by restricting αi to be a martingale
lying between 1/2 and 1. As before, the Center country’s portfolios are constrained to lie in a
closed, convex, non-empty subset K ∈ R3 .

   Under this speciﬁcation, the terms of the trade of each Periphery country with the Center are
                                            αj (t)λj (t)                 Y 0 (t)
               q j (t) =                                                         ,       j ∈ {1, 2},   (22)
                             1 + λ1 (t)(1 − α1 (t)) + λ2 (t)(1 − α2 (t)) Y j (t)
where the relative weights λ1 and λ2 are possibly stochastic. It is straightforward to show that the
expressions for the stock prices remain the same, given by (16)–(18).

Table 3: Terms of trade and stock returns in the economy with portfolio constraints and no trade
between the Periphery countries. A stands for “ambiguous.”

   In the interest of space, we do not provide the dynamics of the terms of trade and stock prices
in this economy; we just present a table (Table 3) that mimics Table 2 of Section 3. In contrast

to Table 2, only two signs in Table 3 are ambiguous; the remaining implications do not require
any further conditions. The eﬀects of the demand shocks on the terms of trade are now clear-cut
because a demand shift in a Periphery country 1 not only increases the world demand for good 1
relative to all other goods (as before), but also decreases the demand for good 0, while leaving the
demand for good 2 unchanged. Therefore, the price of good 0 drops relative to that of both goods
1 and 2. Another set of signs that becomes unambiguous is that for the eﬀects of the innovation
in the wealth shares of the Periphery countries captured by λ on the stock prices in the Periphery
(see Appendix B for the mechanism).
     Within this economy it is easy to derive the real exchange rates faced by the Periphery countries.

Remark 1 (Real Exchange Rates). The price indexes in each country, derived from the coun-
tries’ preferences, are given by
                                       1−α1 (t)  1 α1 (t)                     1−α2 (t)  1 α2 (t)
  0        0        1          p0 (t)              p (t)       2          p0 (t)              p (t)
P (t) = p (t), P (t) =                                      , P (t) =                                  .
                             1 − α1 (t)            α1 (t)               1 − α2 (t)            α2 (t)
The real exchange rates, expressed as functions of the terms of trade, are then
                          P j (t)                                             αj (t)
                                                αj (t)−1       −αj (t)
               ej (t) =           = (1 − αj (t))         αj (t)         q j
                                                                            (t)        ,   j ∈ {1, 2}.
                          P 0 (t)
Our primary concern is the incremental eﬀect of a change in λ on the real exchange rates, as in the
ﬁrst column of Table 3. Since the utility weights αj are positive, the real exchange rates respond to
a change in λ in the same direction the terms of trade do. This implies that the excess co-movement
in the terms of trade due to the portfolio constraint translates into the excess co-movement of the
real exchange rates of the Periphery countries.


5.     Examples of Portfolio Constraints

The purpose of this section is to illustrate the applicability of our general framework to studying
speciﬁc portfolio constraints. Under a speciﬁc constraint, we can fully characterize the countries’
portfolios and hence identify the direction of the constraint-necessitated wealth transfers. This will
allow us to address questions of the following nature, “Does a positive shock in the Center entail a
wealth transfer to the Center?”, “How does the origin of a shock aﬀect stock returns worldwide?”,
“Does the constraint amplify the shocks?”


5.1.    Pure Wealth Transfers: A Portfolio Concentration Constraint

Here, we return to our workhorse model presented in Section 2 and specialize the constraint set K
to represent a portfolio concentration constraint. That is, the resident of the Center country now

                                                            23
faces a constraint permitting him to invest no more than a certain fraction of his wealth γ into the
stock markets of countries 1 and 2:

                                         1          2
                                      xS0 (t) + xS0 (t) ≤ γ,          γ ∈ R.                                 (23)

While we think this constraint is reasonable, we do not intend to argue that such a constraint is
necessarily behind the patterns of correlations observed in reality. Our goal is to merely illustrate
the workings of our model. We feel that (23) is particularly well-suited for this purpose, since
its impact on the portfolio composition and hence the entailed wealth transfers are very easy to
understand.22

    For the concentration constraint, we can fully characterize the process λ and hence the remaining
equilibrium quantities. Note that the consumption allocations, terms and trade, and stock prices
all depend on the primitives of the model and the unknown stochastic weights. Therefore, once the
process λ and the constants λ1 (0) and λ2 (0) are determined, we would be able to pin down all of
these equilibrium quantities. It follows from (6), (9), and Lemma 1 that

                                                        y0 ξ0 (t)
                                             λ(t) =               .
                                                        y1 ξ(t)

Recall that due to the portfolio constraint, the Center country and the Periphery face diﬀerent state
price densities, ξ0 and ξ, respectively. In particular, the (constrained) Center country’s eﬀective
interest rate and the market price of risk, r0 and m0 , are tilted so as to reﬂect the extent to which
the country’s investments are constrained. Applying Itô’s lemma, and using the deﬁnitions of ξ
and ξ0 from (3) and (8), we obtain

          dλ(t) = λ(t)[r(t) − r0 (t) + m(t) (m0 (t) − m(t))]dt − λ(t)(m0 (t) − m(t)) dw(t).                (24)

Substituting this dynamics into the expressions in Proposition 2, we have the following represen-
tation for the volatility matrix of the stock returns, σ:
  22
     We concede that other constraints, especially government-imposed, may be more economically relevant, but in
this section we consider only two possible constraints. Another set of restrictions absent from the model is those
on the Periphery countries. The model possesses suﬃcient ﬂexibility to accommodate these alternative constraints,
but we leave this analysis, as well as a formal calibration, for future applications, and mainly focus on economic
mechanisms underlying our framework.

economy or at times when the constraint is not binding, all countries face the same state price

with its counterpart in the benchmark unconstrained economy.

portfolio constraints, is presented in the following proposition.

   Equations (26)–(27) are the complementary slackness conditions coming from the constrained
portfolio optimization of the resident of the Center. At times when the constraint is not binding,
the market price of risk faced by the Center coincides with that faced by the Periphery. Therefore,
the portfolio of the Center is given by the same equation as the unconstrained portfolios. When
the constraint is binding, however, there is a wedge between the market prices of risk faced by the
Center and the Periphery (27). Equation (28) is the direct consequence of market clearing in the
consumption goods. Together, (26)–(28) allow us to pin down the equilibrium market prices of risk
of Center and Periphery, and hence the responses of all three stock markets to innovations in the
underlying Brownian motions w0 , w1 , and w2 , as functions of the state variables in the economy.
Once the market prices of risk processes m0 and m are determined, it is straightforward to compute
the eﬀective interest rate diﬀerential faced by the Center country (Proposition 4), which completes
our description of the dynamics of the process λ in (24). This, together with the countries’ portfolio
holdings reported in Corollary 1, concludes the full characterization of the economy.

Proposition 4. If equilibrium exists, the diﬀerential between the interest rates faced by countries
1 and 2 and that eﬀectively faced by country 0 is given by

                                              γ − (i1 + i2 ) (σ(t) )−1 m(t)
                          r(t) − r0 (t) =                                           γ.            (29)
                                            (i1 + i2 ) (σ(t)σ(t) )−1 (i1 + i2 )

From (26)–(27) and (29), one can easily show that the interest rate diﬀerential is always nonpos-
itive. That is, the interest rate eﬀectively faced by the Center country is higher than the world
(unconstrained) interest rate. This accounts for the eﬀects of the portfolio constraints. Recall
from Section 2.2 that the optimization problem of the Center subject to a portfolio constraint is
formally equivalent to an auxiliary problem with no constraints but the Center facing a ﬁctitious
investment opportunity set in which the bond and the Center’s stock (the unrestricted investments)
are made more attractive relative to the original market, and the stocks of the Periphery countries
(the restricted investments) are made relatively less attractive (Cvitanić and Karatzas (1992)). In
this ﬁctitious market, the Center optimally invests more in the bond and in the Center’s stock
relative to the original market, and less in the Periphery countries’ stocks. See Section 6 for further
discussion.

   We now turn to analyzing the equilibrium prices in our economy. The (unique) solution to
equations (26)–(28) is best illustrated by means of a graph. We chose the parameters such that
supply shocks dominate the stock price dynamics in the unconstrained economy. Recall that in our

model there are only three primitive sources of uncertainty—the Brownian motions w0 , w1 , and
w2 —so the supply and demand shocks are necessarily correlated. In Pavlova and Rigobon (2003)
we ﬁnd that in the data demand shocks are positively correlated with domestic supply innovations.
Therefore, we assume that a demand shift in country j has a positive loading on wj and zero
loadings on the remaining Brownian motions. The parameters used in the analysis are summarized
in Table 4. All time-dependent variables in Table 4 are the state variables in our model. In the
interest of space, in our ﬁgures we ﬁx all of them but the wealth shares of the Periphery countries
λ1 (t) and λ2 (t). These stochastic wealth shares are behind the additional common factor driving
the stock prices and terms of trade that we identify in our model, and it is of interest to highlight the
dependence of the prices and portfolios in our model on these wealth shares. Hence, the horizontal
axes in all the ﬁgures are λ1 and λ2 .

       The reasoning behind the choice of these parameters is the following. So far we have assumed
that the Periphery countries are small, so for the choice of the numeraire consumption basket we
decided that they represent 5 percent of the world. We have chosen 75 percent as the share of
expenditures on the domestic good, which is a conservative estimate, given the share of the service
sector in GDP. In terms of output, the Periphery countries are one tenth of the Center, and twice as
volatile. We assume that the wealth ratios relative to the Center for both Periphery countries may
range from 0.1 to 0.35, and ﬁnally, we assume that the demand shocks only depend on domestic
productivity shocks. That is, we assume that there is a shift in the preference toward the domestic
good when there is a positive supply shock at home.23 Using these parameters we compute the
  23
    We have repeated the analysis using diﬀerent coeﬃcients and have found that the main message remained
unaltered—in so far as the supply shocks dominated the dynamics of asset prices in the unconstrained economy.
Remember that the demand shocks have the “divergence property;” they introduce negative correlation among
countries’ stock prices. Because in our model, the demand shocks are a function of the supply shocks, we can
parameterize it so that the supply eﬀect is the one that dominates.




                                                     27
region where the constraint is binding, the prices, and the responses of the terms of trade and stock
prices to the diﬀerent shocks.

    To develop initial insight into the solution we examine the region where the constraint is binding.
The tightness of the constraint is measured by the multiplier ψ from equations (26) and (27). As is
evident from Figure 1, for small wealth shares of the Periphery countries, the portfolio constraint is
not binding, and the multiplier is zero. As their wealth shares increase the constraint tightens: the
multiplier is increasing in both λ’s. In the unconstrained economy, larger λ’s imply that Periphery
countries constitute a larger fraction of world market capitalization, and hence, they command a
larger share of the investors’ portfolios. Therefore, given the same upper bound constraint on the
investment in the Periphery countries, the larger these countries are, the tighter the constraint.

    Let us now concentrate on how the portfolio constraint aﬀect portfolio decisions by the investors
in the Center. Figure 2 depicts the changes in portfolio weights relative to the unconstrained
economy: the “excess” weight in the Center country is shown in panel (a), and the “excess” weight
in the Periphery country 1 is shown in panel (b).24 For the range of λ’s over which the constraint is
not binding, the portfolio holdings are identical to those in the unconstrained equilibrium. For the
range in which it becomes binding, the investor in the Center is forced to decrease his holdings of
the Periphery markets. The freed-up assets get invested in the stock market of the Center country
and the bond, making the Center country over-weighted in the Center stock market relative to its
desired unconstrained position. Of course, the Periphery countries take the oﬀsetting position so
that the securities markets clear. In other words, the portfolio constraint forces a “home bias” on
the Center and the Periphery investors. As we will demonstrate, this “home bias” implies that the
wealth of the investor in the Center is more sensitive to shocks to the Center stock market, while
the wealth of the Periphery investors is relatively more susceptible to shocks to the Periphery.


5.1.1.    Transfer Problem, Amplification and Flight to Quality


The next goal is to analyze how the distribution of wealth evolves in response to shocks in the three
countries. From equation (24) we have computed the diﬀusion term in the evolution of λ’s—the
wealth shares of the Periphery countries, which appears in Figure 3. (Recall that the two are
perfectly correlated.) Panel (a) depicts the move in these wealth shares when the Center receives
a positive shock, and panel (b) shows what happens to it when a shock originates in one of the
  24
     In our parametrization the Periphery countries are symmetric, and therefore we only show ﬁgures for one of the
countries.


                                                        28
Periphery countries. Again, because of symmetry we only consider one of the Periphery countries.
The response of the wealth share of the Periphery countries clearly depends on the origin of the
shock: a shock in the Center depresses the share (a wealth transfer from the Periphery to the
Center), while a shock in the Periphery increases it (a wealth transfer from the Center to the
Periphery). To understand this eﬀect, consider the representation of the evolution of λ in terms of
the countries portfolios:
                                                                    
         dλ(t)                          dS 0 (t) dS 1 (t) dS 2 (t)
               = Drift terms dt +               ,        ,               (xi (t) − x0 (t)),   i = 1, 2,   (30)
          λ(t)                           S 0 (t) S 1 (t) S 2 (t)
which follows from (24) and Corollary 1. The portfolios are the same over a range where the
constraint is not binding, and hence no wealth transfers take place. In the constraint-binding range,
the ﬁrst component of the vector xi (t) − x0 (t) is negative, while the last two are positive. This is
because the investor in the Center (Periphery) is over-weighted (under-weighted) in the Center’s
stock market and under-weighted (over-weighted) in the Periphery stock markets. One can verify
that, although country-speciﬁc shocks spread internationally inducing co-movement, the eﬀect of a
shock on own stock market is bigger than on the remaining markets (because of divergence).

   Notice that a tighter constraint implies larger transfers; a looser constraint implies smaller
transfers, and in the limit when the constraint is not binding, there are no wealth transfers taking
place. Consequently, the eﬀects of the transfers on the terms or trade and the stock prices become
larger when the constraint is tighter. For brevity, we here omit a ﬁgure depicting the eﬀects of
the supply shocks on the terms of trade, which simply conﬁrms the intuition we gathered from the
Transfer Problem.

   The incremental eﬀect on the stock prices, brought about by the portfolio constraint, mimics
the eﬀects on the terms of trade. A country experiencing an improvement of its terms of trade
enjoys an increase in its stock market, and that experiencing a deterioration sees its stock drop.
Now we can fully address the issue of the co-movement among the stock markets that the portfolio
constraint induces. These results are presented in Figures 4. Panel (a) demonstrates the impact
that a shock to the Center has on the Center’s stock market, beyond the already positive eﬀect
that takes place in the unconstrained economy. In the unconstrained region the eﬀect is zero, but it
is positive elsewhere. That is, the eﬀect of a shock to the Center is ampliﬁed in the presence of the
constraint. Furthermore, the magnitude of the eﬀect increases with the λ’s, which is to be expected
because the higher the wealth shares of the Periphery countries are, the tighter the constraint. The
exact same intuition applies to the eﬀects of the shocks in the Periphery on domestic stock prices

                                                     29
(panel (d)), except that here the shock is negative.

    The transmission of shocks across countries is depicted in panels (b), (c), and (e). The impact
of a productivity shock in the Center on the Periphery stock prices is shown in panel (b), that
of a shock in a Periphery country on the Center in panel (c) and, ﬁnally, that of a shock in one
Periphery country on the other Periphery country in panel (e). Again, these are incremental eﬀects
due to the constraint, net of co-movement implied by the unconstrained model. The emerging
pattern is consistent with the ﬂight to quality and contagion eﬀects, observed in the data. The
ﬂight to quality and contagion refer to a transmission pattern where a negative shock to one of the
Periphery countries (emerging markets) is bad news to other countries in the Periphery, but good
news for the Center country (an industrialized economy). Panels (c)–(e) demonstrate that in our
model a negative shock to one of the Periphery countries reduces its stock price, decreases the price
of the other Periphery country (contagion), and increases the price in the Center (ﬂight to quality).
A similar pattern occurs if the Center receives a positive shock.


5.2.    Varying Restrictiveness: A Market Share Constraint

The previous constraint is one of the simplest that can be studied within out framework. However,
it generates some counterfactual implications. For instance, a negative shock to the Periphery
relaxes the constraint, instead of tightening it.25 We therefore consider a constraint of a diﬀerent
nature, a market share constraint, which becomes more restrictive when the market share of the
Periphery countries in the world drops:
                                                                                
                          1         2                    S 1 (t) + S 2 (t)
                       xS0 (t) + xS0 (t) ≤ γ F                                       ,   γ ∈ R,               (31)
                                                     S (t) + S 1 (t) + S 2 (t)
                                                      0


where F is an arbitrary function. This constraint is very similar to the concentration constraint,
with the only diﬀerence that the upper bound on the investment in the Periphery is speciﬁed not
in absolute, but in relative terms, reﬂecting the market capitalization of the Periphery.

    The characterization of the equilibrium quantities of interest in the economy with the market
share constraint (31) is as before, with the only diﬀerence that each entry of γ in Propositions 3–4
gets replaced with the term on the right-hand side of equation (31). This is due to the fact that
logarithmic preferences induce myopic behavior, and hence the investors in the Center do not hedge
against changes in the restrictiveness of their portfolio constraint.
  25
     It has been argued in the empirical literature that recent contagious crises in emerging markets may have been
caused by the tightenings of constraints in developed countries in response to a crisis in one emerging market.


                                                          30
     We again describe the eﬀects of the constraint on the economy by means of plots. We have
tried an increasing linear and increasing polynomial functions F , and they all produce very similar
patterns. In fact, the qualitative implications are identical. Figures 5 depicts the multiplier on
the market share constraint. One can easily see that in contrast to the case of the concentration
constraint, presented in Figure 1, the multiplier is zero when the wealth shares of the Periphery
countries are large. As the wealth shares of the Periphery countries in the world fall, the constraint
starts to bind, becoming more and more restrictive the lower the wealth shares are. The tilt in
the portfolio of the Center country reﬂects the restrictiveness of the constraint: the highest tilt
occurs when the wealth shares of the Periphery countries are small. The sign of the tilt in the
asset allocation of the Center is the same as before: the Center is over-weighted in the Center’s
stock market and under-weighted in the Periphery stock markets, relative to the unconstrained
economy. Like the concentration constraint, the market share constraint restricts the investment
in the Periphery, causing wealth transfers to/from the Periphery in response to a shock in the
Center or the Periphery (Figure 7). However, unlike in the case of the concentration constraint, the
restrictiveness of the constraint changes in response to a wealth transfer. For example, a wealth
transfer from the Periphery to the Center makes the constraint more restrictive as the market share
of the Periphery falls. These two eﬀects—a wealth transfer and a change in the restrictiveness of the
constraint—interact in our model, producing rich variations in the pattern of capital ﬂows. Now
the Center withdraws funds from the Periphery when it receives a wealth transfer, because the
constraint becomes more restrictive. Therefore, the ﬂight to quality pattern emerging in Figure 8,
where a negative shock to one of the Periphery depresses stock prices in the other Periphery country
(panel (e)), while boosting the stock market in the Center (panel (c)), is accompanied by a capital
ﬂight from the Periphery towards the Center. That is, in response to a negative shock in a Periphery
country, the Center becomes more constrained, causing it to sell shares in the Periphery and invest
domestically, as well as invest in the bond. This pattern represents a more realistic model of the
world, as it is consistent with recent crises in which some developed countries have been forced to
withdraw funds from emerging markets in order to meet tightened constraints at home.


6.     Caveats and Extensions

Our model captures (and fully characterizes) several aspects of the asset price co-movement among
emerging and developed economies, in a general equilibrium framework. To do so, we had to


                                                 31
make a number of simplifying assumptions, that might produce counterfactual implications in
dimensions that we have not addressed in the paper. For example, our benchmark has no home
bias in portfolios, although there is ample evidence of the contrary. Our purpose is to study the
incremental eﬀect of a constraint relative to an unconstrained benchmark, and our benchmark
where every investor holds the same portfolio has been particularly convenient for this purpose.
The model can be extended to exhibit a home bias in portfolios in the benchmark. This can be
done by changing the speciﬁcation of our demand shocks (e.g., along the lines of Pavlova and
Rigobon (2003)). The important point is that in the benchmark, even if there is a home bias in
portfolios, the wealth shares (λ’s) remain constant, and hence the transmission due to the constraint
occurs through the same channel, wealth transfers (changes in λ’s). The second counterfactual
implication of our model is that the interest rate in the Center (developed economy) is higher
than the interest rate in the Periphery (emerging economies). Clearly, this is not supported by the
data. However, we have not included important determinants of interest rates, such as default risk,
labor productivity, monetary and ﬁscal policy, political risk, capital-labor ratios, taxation, contract
enforcement, institutional quality, etc. Including any of these aspects in the model would have
made it intractable. Finally, agents are myopic in our model since their preferences are log-linear.
However, this has allowed us to solve the model in closed form, even in the presence of ﬁnancial
market frictions.

     The framework developed in our paper can be easily extended to study alternative investment
restrictions, government- or institutionally-imposed: for example, borrowing constraints, or special
provisions such as margin requirements, VaR, and collateral constraints. For all of these ﬁnancial
market imperfections, equilibrium can be characterized in closed form. These alternative ﬁnancial
constraints may entail interesting and realistic patterns in cross-country capital ﬂows. Other poten-
tial extensions of the framework include explicit modeling of the production decisions by ﬁrms and
the incorporation of non-tradable goods. Another aspect left for future research is the quantitative
assessment of our ﬁndings: in particular, a formal calibration and an examination of the business
cycle properties of our model.


7.     Concluding Remarks

Empirical literature has highlighted the importance of ﬁnancial market imperfections in generating
contagion. We have examined a form of such imperfections, portfolio constraints, in the context of


                                                  32
a three-country Center-Periphery economy, where the interactions between the portfolio constraints
and the traditional channels of international propagation can be fully characterized.

   We have shown that a portfolio constraint gives rise to an additional common factor in the
dynamics of the asset prices and the terms of trade, which reﬂects the tightness of the constraint.
Countries in our model are diﬀerentially aﬀected by the new factor: the co-movement of the terms
of trade and the stock markets of the Periphery countries increases, while the co-movement of the
Center country with the rest of the world decreases. These results are consistent with the empirical
ﬁndings documenting contagion among the stock prices and the exchange rates or the terms of
trade of countries belonging to the same asset class. Our ﬁnding may also shed light on why stocks
markets of emerging economies are less correlated with those of the industrialized countries than
otherwise expected. However, to better investigate this question, one needs to extend our model
beyond three countries, so that one could draw a distinction between an asset class subject to an
institutionally imposed constraint (a set of Periphery countries) and an asset class that is not (the
remaining Periphery countries).

   The workings of the portfolio constraint in our model are easily understood once one recognizes
that portfolio constraints give rise to (endogenous) wealth transfers to or from the Periphery coun-
tries. From that point on, one can appeal to the classic Transfer Problem to understand how the
constraint aﬀects the terms of trade. Making use of the positive relationship between the terms of
trade and the stock prices in our model, one can then fully describe the responses of countries’ stock
markets to a tightening of the portfolio constraint. We thus provide a theoretical framework in
which changes in the wealth share of the constrained investors aﬀect stock returns and the degree of
stock price co-movement. Our insight regarding the eﬀects of wealth transfers applies more gener-
ally: any portfolio rebalancing should be associated with a wealth transfer, and hence the intuition
behind the “portfolio channel of contagion” (see e.g., Broner, Gelos, and Reinhart (2004)) can be
alternatively represented as the outcome of cross-country wealth transfers, like in our constrained
equilibrium. Finally, our model predicts that wealth of ﬁnancially constrained investors enters as
a priced factor in stock returns: this prediction is yet to be tested empirically.

that W0 (t) and Wi (t), i = 1, 2, have representations

Making use of the ﬁrst-order conditions (6) and (9), we arrive at the statement of the lemma.

represent the objective function of country 0 in the form

Since the investor of country 0 takes prices in the good markets pj , j = 0, 1, 2 as given, and hence
from his viewpoint the last three terms in the integrand are exogenous, this objective function
belongs to the family considered by Karatzas and Shreve. A similar argument applies to investors
1 and 2. Q.E.D.


Weights in the Planner’s Problem. To conform with the competitive equilibrium allocation,
the weights λ1 and λ2 in the planner’s problem in Section 2 are chosen to reﬂect the countries’ initial
endowments. Since we normalized the weight of Country 0, λ0 , to be equal to 1, the weights of the
two remaining countries i = 1, 2 are identiﬁed with the ratios of Lagrange multipliers associated
with the countries’ Arrow-Debreu (static) budget constraint yi /y0 , i = 1, 2, respectively. (This
follows from the ﬁrst-order conditions with respect to, for example, good 0 (6) and (9) combined
with the sharing rules for good 0 (11)). The values of λ1 and λ2 are inferred from Lemma 1 and
the sharing rules (12)–(13) combined with the model assumption that the initial endowments of
countries 1 and 2 are given by Wi (0) = S i (0), i = 1, 2, and substituting pertinent quantities from
(6), (9), and (17)–(18).


Lemma 2.        In the economy with portfolio constraints, stock prices are given by

     S 0 (t) = p0 (t)Y 0 (t)(T − t),   S 1 (t) = p1 (t)Y 1 (t)(T − t), and S 2 (t) = p2 (t)Y 2 (t)(T − t).

Hence, by multiplying (A.8), (A.9) and (A.10) by p0 (t), p1 (t) and p2 (t), respectively, and adding
them up, we can show that

        W0 (t) + W1 (t) + W2 (t) = p0 (t)Y 0 (t)(T − t) + p1 (t)Y 1 (t)(T − t) + p2 (t)Y 2 (t)(T − t).

This, together with (A.6) yields the required result. Q.E.D.

These expressions are the same across Propositions 1 and 2, except that in Proposition 1 λi (t) are
constant weights.
    To demonstrate that λ1 (t) and λ2 (t) are the same up to a multiplicative constant, we use (6),
(9), and Lemma 1 to conclude that

The result then follows from the observation that y1 and y2 are constants.

Proof of Proposition 3. Equations (26) and (27) are derived at a partial equilibrium level. The
partial-equilibrium constrained optimization problem of country 0 closely resembles the problem
solved in Teplá (2000). Teplá considers a borrowing constraint, which in our setting is equivalent
      0         1         2                                                        0
to xS0 (t) + xS0 (t) + xS0 (t) ≤ γ. Our constraint does not contain the ﬁrst, xS0 (t), term. It is
straightforward to modify Teplá’s derivation for the case of our constraint. Our problem is even
simpler, because we consider logarithmic preferences.
    Equation (28) follows from market clearing, coupled with the investors’ ﬁrst-order conditions.
It follows from, for example, (6) and (11) that

It follows from Propositions 1 and 2 that the eﬀect of demand shift in country 1 (2) on the terms
of trade in country 2 (1) is negative iﬀ  a(t) < 0 (b(t) < 0), which are the conditions in our
Condition A1. Deriving the signs of the responses of the stock prices to the demand shifts is then
straightforward, given the characterization in Propositions 1 and 2. Condition A2, the rationale
for which is given in the body of Section 2, provides a suﬃcient condition for the eﬀects to result
in the signs reported in Tables 1 and 2.

                                                             38
   The eﬀects of a change in λ on the terms of trade of each Periphery country are positive
                      > 0—guaranteed by the assumption that αi ∈ (1/3, 1) (home bias in
because A(t) > 0 and A(t)
consumption).
    We now derive an alternative form of Condition A3 and elaborate on the intuition behind it.
It follows from Proposition 2 that the impact of the constraint (the eﬀect of a change in λ) on the
                                                                                                 
stock prices of the Periphery countries is positive iﬀ (20)–(21) hold. Notice that if A(t) < A(t),
                                                     
condition (21) is trivially satisﬁed, and if A(t) > A(t), (20) is the one that is trivially satisﬁed.
This means that, in general, only one of the conditions needs to be checked. If we assume that
         
A(t) < A(t),  then a suﬃcient condition for both eﬀects to be positive is that (20) is satisﬁed. The
                                       is
condition guaranteeing that A(t) < A(t)

                                         3α1 (t) − 1   λ2 (t)
                                                     <        .                                 (A.22)
                                         3α2 (t) − 1   λ1 (t)

After some algebra and using the fact that α1 (t) > 1/3 one can show that (20) is satisﬁed when

This is a suﬃcient condition guaranteeing that Condition A3 is satisﬁed. The left hand side
of equation (A.23) represents the direct eﬀect of lambda (the wealth transfer, as explained in
Section 3) on the relative price of good 1. The terms on the right-hand side represent the two
indirect eﬀects: (i) the impact of the drop in the demand for good 0, and (ii) the impact of the
cross-country demand reallocation in the Periphery countries. To clarify the intuition it is simpler
to think of a change in λ as a wealth transfer.
    First, let us close the cross-country demand reallocation eﬀects in the Periphery so as to concen-
trate on the ﬁrst eﬀect. To do so, assume total symmetry throughout the Periphery (α1 = α2 and
λ1 = λ2 ). An increase in λ increases wealth of both Periphery countries by the same proportion,
while reducing wealth of the Center. The drop in wealth in the Center implies a drop in demand
for all goods by the consumer in the Center. However, because of the home bias in consumption,
the drop in the demand for good 0 is larger than that for each of the remaining goods. On the other
hand, due to the wealth transfer, the Periphery will now increase its demand. But again, because
of the home bias in consumption, the increase in demand results in a larger increase in the demand
for the Periphery’s goods than for the Center’s good. The net eﬀect is that the demand for the
Periphery goods increases while the demand of the Center good decreases. Hence, the price of good
0 falls. Due to the symmetry assumption, prices of the two Periphery goods increase, and do so
by exactly the same proportion. The weighted average of the three prices in the numeraire basket
is, of course, has to stay equal to one. Now recall the expressions for stock prices from Lemma
2. Since the price of good 0 decrease and the prices of goods 1 and 2 increase unambiguously, the
Center’s stock falls while the Periphery stocks rise. In this case, the direct eﬀect dominates the
indirect eﬀect in that both stock prices in the Periphery increase. Second, let us introduce the
cross-country demand reallocation eﬀects in the Periphery and explore what happens when the de-
mands of the Periphery countries diﬀer. Since the Periphery enter the demand with the exact same
expenditure shares, the drop in the Center’s demand for the two goods is identical. Furthermore,

                                                  39
the wealth shares of the Periphery countries increase proportionally. The diﬀerences arise because
the expenditure share of Periphery country 1 on good 2 is diﬀerent from that of Periphery 2 on
good 1. These cross-country demands could make the impact on prices of the two goods diﬀer. For
instance, assume that the consumer in Periphery country 1 has an expenditure share of its good α1
close to 1/3, while the consumer in Periphery country 2 has an expenditure share α2 close to 1. In
this case, the wealth transfer to country 1 will increase its demand for good 2 by almost as much
that for good 1. However, the exact same wealth transfer to country 2 aﬀects primarily its demand
for good 2, with the demand for good 1 increasing by a only a small fraction. This means that the
increase in the demand for good 2 is larger than that one for good 1. What is the net eﬀect? The
demand for good 0 goes down unambiguously, and in this example, the demand for both goods 1
and 2 goes up unambiguously, but more so for good 2 than good 1. The price of good 0 clearly
falls. At the same time, the price of the good with the highest demand increase goes up (that would
be good 2 in this example). So, it follows from Lemma 2 that S 0 falls, while S 2 rises. However,
since the price of the numeraire basket has to be unity (and hence the weighted sum of changes
in all prices has to be zero), it may happen that in absolute terms the price of good 1 goes down
even though it increases relative to good 0. In that case, S 1 falls. To prevent this from happening
one of the two conditions need to hold: (i) the numeraire basket has a high weight on good 0, or
(ii) the changes in the demand for good 1 and good 2 are close. Indeed, the condition (A.23) is
always satisﬁed when (i) β is suﬃciently close to one or (ii) 3α3α2 (t)−1
                                                                    0 −1
                                                                          λ2 (t) is close to 3α3α1 (t)−1
                                                                                                   0 −1
                                                                                                         λ1 (t).
The second condition is always satisﬁed in the model developed in Section 4, where the Periphery
countries do not demand each other’s goods, implying that the cross-demand eﬀects are not present
(and hence the prices of the Periphery good always change by the same proportion). Therefore, for
any numeraire, the impact of λ on the Periphery stock markets is always unambiguous.
