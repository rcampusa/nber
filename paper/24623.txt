We develop a method to compare levels and trends in inequality in mortality in the United States
and France in a similar framework. The comparison shows that while income inequality has
increased in both the United States and France, inequality in mortality in France remained
remarkably low and stable. In the United States, inequality in mortality increased for older
groups (especially women) while it decreased for children and young adults. These patterns
highlight the fact that despite the strong cross-sectional relationship between income and health,
there is no necessary connection between changes in income inequality and changes in health
inequality.

1   Introduction

    In recent years, several highly publicized studies have analyzed changes in inequality in

life expectancy and mortality, sparking broad public debate in the United States (Deaton

2002; Ezzati et al. 2008; Cutler et al 2011; Pijoan-Mas and Rios-Rull 2014; Chetty et al.

2016; Currie and Schwandt 2016a,b; Shiels et al. 2017). These studies show that mortality at

older ages decreased more among the rich than among the poor over the past twenty years,

indicating a widening of the mortality gap between the rich and the poor. A particularly

worrisome development has been documented for non-Hispanic whites in the United States,

who experienced increases in mortality at middle ages (Shiels et al. 2017; Case and Deaton

2015, 2017). Two recent studies by Currie and Schwandt (2016a,b) extended the analysis to

younger ages, finding more positive developments for infants, children and adolescents. In

these age groups, mortality improvements were particularly pronounced among the poor,

leading to a sharp decline in mortality and a reduction in inequality in mortality at younger

ages.

    There is a long tradition of research on economic inequality and inequality in mortality in

France (Desplanques 1984; Piketty et al 2006; Barbieri 2014; Baron 2016), but this research

has been underrepresented in the current debate, perhaps due to differences in methodology

that make it difficult to directly compare developments in France and the United States.

Cross-sectional analyses confirm that there is a positive relationship between socioeconomic

status and health in France, just as there is in the United States. (Hollande 2016; Heritage

2009), which in turn may reflect a positive relationship between socioeconomic status and

health-seeking behaviors (Jusot, Or, and Sirven 2012).

    Our focus is on the evolution of inequality in mortality by age in France and the United

States, and we aim to measure it in a way that allows comparisons between the two countries.

This comparison is of interest in part because the health care systems in the two countries are



                                                2
often contrasted. The so called “French model”—with its principle of equal access to care

and its funding methods— aims to promote equality of access to health care among citizens

(Nay et al. 2016). In 2000, (before the recent Affordable Care Act, sometimes known as

“Obamacare”), the French health care system was regarded by the World Health Organization

as one of the best health care systems in the world, while the United States ranked only 54th

in the World Health Report 2000 (World Health Organization, 2000).

    We use mortality register data from France and vital statistics mortality data from the

United States to analyze trends in inequality in age-specific mortality rates over the past 20

years. In France, we focus on mortality trends in groups of départements, where

départements are first ranked by their poverty rates and then divided into 20 groups each

representing 5% of the French population. These départements groups are ranked by their

poverty rates so that we can consistently compare mortality in the lowest and highest ranked

slices of the population. Similarly, for the United States we first rank counties using poverty

rates and then group them into ventiles so that we can compare mortality trends in the richest

and poorest places. By comparing trends in mortality inequality in France and the United

States over time using the same methods and similar data for both countries, we hope to shed

light on cross-national differences in the evolution of inequality in mortality.

    We find that while income inequality has increased in both the United States and France,

inequality in mortality in France remained remarkably low and stable. In the United States,

inequality in mortality increased for older groups (especially women) while it decreased for

children and young adults. These patterns highlight the fact that despite the strong cross-

sectional relationship between income and health, there is no necessary connection between

changes in income inequality and changes in health inequality. In other words, it may be

possible to effectively use public policy to buffer the effects of income inequality on health.




                                                3
    A further analysis of differences in the effects of leading causes of death in the two

countries indicates that there is no one cause of death that is a “smoking gun” that would

explain the large differences in mortality across all age groups. However, two causes stand

out as particularly important. For younger groups, differences in deaths due to accidents

account for over a third of the gap in mortality between the two countries. For older groups—

where most mortality is concentrated— we find that applying French mortality rates for heart

disease to the U.S. data would have dramatic effects. For example, it would close the gap in

death rates between French and American elderly men in the poorest places and would result

in lower than actual death rates in the richest U.S. places. In contrast, despite their

prominence in the literature on U.S. mortality rates, differences in “deaths of despair” (deaths

from suicide, homicide, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related causes) have relatively little

impact on the U.S.-French mortality gap. For cancer, French male death rates are higher than

those in the United States, especially in lower poverty areas, so that if American men had the

French cancer death rate, American mortality rates would actually increase.

    The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes some of the background literature.

Section 3 describes the data and the methods. Section 4 displays descriptive statistics and our

main results regarding the comparison between France and the United States. Section 5

simulates U.S. mortality rates in 1990 and 2010, assuming the 2010 French rates for selected

causes and age groups in order to focus on specific reasons for the differences between the

two countries. Finally, Section 6 summarizes our conclusions and highlights avenues for

future research.



   2. Background

   According to the U.S. National Academy (National Academies of Science, Engineering,

and Medicine (NAS) 2015), there are three ways to measure inequality in mortality: “One



                                                 4
looks at differences in the mortality of populations of U.S. counties in relation to county-level

economic measures. Another looks at mortality by educational attainment. A third approach

looks at mortality by career earnings.”

   Many U.S. studies divide the population by level of education (Pappas et al. (1993); Elo

and Preston (1996); Preston and Elo (1995); Olshansky et al. (2012); Meara et al. (2008);

Cutler et al. (2011); Montez and Berman (2014); and Montez and Zajacova (2013)), although

the share of the population with high school or college education has increased dramatically

over time (Dowd and Hamoudi 2014; Hendi, 2015; Bound et al., 2014; Godring et al., 2015).

If those who would have been expected to have less education in 1990 have moved into

higher education categories by 2010, then it would not be surprising if the remaining high

school dropouts proved less healthy in 2010.

   Using education as the main measure of socioeconomic status has also been popular in

France (Leclerc et al. 2006; Menvielle et al. 2007; Menvielle et al. 2008; Saurel-Cubizolles et

al. 2009). However, just as in the United States, strong increases in educational attainment in

France over the period we examine mean that in younger cohorts, the less educated are a

smaller and more negatively selected group than in previous cohorts. This type of selection

could lead to a measured increase in mortality inequality even if the distribution of relative

mortality risk across the population remained constant.

   French studies have also examined the relationship between individual occupational

changes and mortality (Cambois 2004) though causality could run both ways in explaining

this association. Other studies have investigated the relationship between economic inequality

and mortality across different European countries with somewhat inconclusive results (Leigh

and Jencks 2007; Mackenbach et al. 2008; Strand et al. 2010; Wood et al. 2012; Mackenbach

et al. 2016). One general challenge of these studies is that they typically rank individuals by

socioeconomic indicators, such as educational attainment, that are difficult to compare across



                                                5
countries. A high school dropout, for example, might be much more negatively selected in

Norway than in Bulgaria where a larger share of the population does not complete high

school. As a consequence, the mortality gap between high school dropouts and more educated

groups would be expected to be much larger in Norway than in Bulgaria, everything else

being equal. Our method is not subject to these concerns, as we are comparing the same

percentiles of the population in each country.

   The closest equivalent in the United States may be studies that focus on inequality in

mortality by relative income (NRC 2015; Pappas et al. 1993; Waldron 2007; Waldron 2013;

Bosworth and Burke 2014; Pijoan-Mas and Rios-Rull, 2014). However, low income could be

caused by ill health rather than the reverse (Smith 1999, 2005, 2007).

   Finally, one can pursue the strategy we use here and examine mortality by geographical

areas. Selective migration is a possible concern. For example, if the healthiest people in a

declining area leave, then the average health of the area may decline even if the health of all

individuals remains the same. Some previous studies following this geographical approach

have not accounted for selective migration (for example, Wilmoth et al. 2011; Kulkarni et al.

2011; Wang et al. 2013; Murray et al. 2006). Sing and Siahpush (2006) confront this problem

by dividing U.S. counties into groups based on an index of the socioeconomic status of the

population in 1980 and following these same county groups up to 2000— a strategy that is

also followed by Currie and Schwandt (2016a,b). Barbieri (2014) follows a similar strategy

when analyzing longevity trends across French département and finds large geographical

disparities in mortality. To our knowledge, ours is the first paper to apply these methods to a

comparative analysis of the United States and a large European country.




                                                 6
   3. Data and Methods

    For both the United States and France, we first rank geographic areas by the fraction of

poor in each area and then create groups of areas that each account for approximately 5% of

the national populations. In this way we can consistently compare, for example, the bottom

fifth to the top fifth of the population, without the confounding that can be caused by changes

in the composition of educational or occupational groups.

   In France, we rank by département, which is the level of government in between the

administrative regions (until 2015, there were 27 of these regions; in 2016, the number was

reduced to 18) and the smaller communes. We rank all 96 mainland départements in 1990,

2000, and 2010 by their poverty level in 2010 and then divide them into 20 roughly equal

groups (Figure S1). We use the 2010 level for all years because the poverty and income

measures available from the Institut National de la Statistique et des études économiques

(INSEE) before 2006 are not produced with a single consistent methodology.

   However, we also show results below for alternative rankings by educational outcomes,

which are available for 1990, 1999, and 2012 and therefore allow us to re-rank départements

in every year. As we discuss below, this re-ranking does not affect our results. Note that

ranking by educational level is different than tracking a single educational group over

time.For example, we can look at areas with the highest fractions of high school dropouts,

even if the fraction of high school dropouts is declining over time.

   In what follows, we will refer to the département groups with the highest (lowest)

fractions of their populations in poverty as the poorest (richest) areas. In France, the poverty

rate is defined as the share of population living with less than 60% of the median national

disposable income. The INSEE, like EUROSTAT and other European countries, measures

income poverty in a relative manner whereas other countries (such as the United States and

Australia) take an absolute approach. To measure poverty in relative terms, a poverty line



                                                7
is determined with respect to the distribution of income in the whole population. Specifically,

in France, a family with less than 60% of the national median income is considered poor.

   In the United States, the Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary

by family size and composition in order to determine who is in poverty. If a family's total

income is less than the family's threshold, then that family and every individual in it is

considered to be in poverty.

   Figure 1 shows a map of French départements ranked by their level of poverty and a map

of the United States showing counties by their poverty ranking. The figures show that in

France, the poorest areas are in the extreme north and south of the country, while in the

United States there is a concentration of poverty in Appalachia and in the south, with pockets

of poverty scattered across other areas.

   Ranking départements by their poverty rate in 2010 and dividing them into ventiles of the

overall population results in groups that contain an average of 3 million people each in France

and approximately 15 million people each in the United States, consistent with the United

States' having a much larger population (Figure 2, Table A1). In France, the lowest poverty

group had a poverty rate of 9.33% in 2010, while 22.48% of the population in the top poverty

group was poor. In 2010, median French income reached €42,259 in the richest group, while

it was €31,751 in the poorest group. Thus, there is substantial variation in these measures

across France. Comparable figures for the United States in 2010 are 5.58% poor in the richest

group (with a median income of €61.336) and 28.30% poor in the top poverty group (with a

median income of €24,831).

   Mortality data in France are from the Centre d'épidémiologie sur les causes médicales de

décès (CépiDc). The CépiDc maintains a database with more than 20 million death records

since 1979. Data are gathered from two documents: the medical certificate and the bulletin of

civil status of death. Total deaths are available by département, year, gender, and age group.



                                                8
We focus on mortality rates for 1990, 2000, and 2010 in order to have the best quality

population data to create death rates.

   In the United States, mortality data are constructed at the level of county group, gender,

and age by dividing death counts from the United States. Vital Statistics by population counts

are from the decennial Census.



3. Results

   We will present most of our results graphically, for ease of interpretation. Figure A1

provides a schematic overview of how our graphs reflect different inequality trends.

Mortality rates will be measured on the y-axis, while the x-axis indicates poverty percentiles;

a place with a poverty percentile near zero is a rich place, and a place with a poverty

percentile near 100 is among the poorest places. The well-known positive cross-sectional

relationship between income and health suggests that we should expect to see the lines on the

graph slope upwards, indicating higher mortality in poorer places. The slope of the line

indicates how strong this relationship is—flatter lines indicate more equality in mortality

outcomes. If mortality falls over time, then we should expect to see the lines representing

later decades lie below the line for 1990.

   Finally, in order to ask whether inequality in mortality increased, decreased, or remained

constant over time, we look at the relative slopes of the lines for the different decades. A

parallel shift indicates that mortality has fallen by roughly the same amount for everyone, so

that there is no change in inequality in mortality. If mortality fell more in the richest places,

there will be an increase in inequality in mortality and the lines representing different decades

will appear to converge as one moves from left to right across the figure. Conversely, if

mortality fell more in the poorest places, then there will be a decrease in inequality in

mortality and the lines representing different decades will appear to diverge or fan out.



                                                 9
        With this schematic in mind, we turn to our main results, which are summarized in

Figure 3. More detailed figures (plotting the points for each ventile of the distribution) are

shown for France in Figure A2 and for the United States in Figure A3. Table 1 reports the

exact mortality rates for the highest and lowest poverty percentiles plotted in Figure 3, while

the slopes of the lines plotting mortality against poverty percentiles are shown in Table 2,

along with p-values for a test of the hypothesis that the slope is non-zero.

        The first panel of Figure 3 focuses on mortality for males (which is higher at all age

groups than mortality for females in both countries), while the second panel focuses on

mortality for females. The solid lines refer to France, while the dashed lines refer to the

United States. Bolded lines represent 2010, while lighter lines represent 1990. Thus, this

figure allows one to examine inequality in mortality both within countries over time and

across countries. As discussed above, flatter lines indicate less inequality in mortality (lower

and flatter lines are better).

        Figure 3 shows several striking patterns. First, as of 2010, age-specific mortality was

higher in the United States than in France for all ages and both genders. Moreover, the

French gradients are remarkable flat relative to the U.S. gradients. In fact, Table 2 indicates

that for males less than 24 and for females less than 34, there is no relationship between

mortality and the poverty percentile in France as of 2010. In contrast, in the United States,

the 2010 relationships are all strongly upward sloping and significantly different than zero for

every age and gender group, indicating a strong relationship between poverty percentile and

mortality.

        Comparing mortality levels in the United States and France shows that in 1990, the

French and U.S. lines for males 25–64 crossed at between the 20th and 60th poverty

percentiles. What this means is that in 1990, rich Frenchmen had higher mortality rates than

rich American men. That is, compared to Americans, some of the strong equality in outcomes



                                               10
among Frenchmen was achieved via worse prospects for the rich rather than through better

prospects for the poor. However, by 2010, these crossovers (which never existed for females)

had largely disappeared. In 2010, the richest French people do as well as the richest

Americans in many, though not all, age categories, but poorer Americans do much worse than

poor French people in terms of mortality. It is striking that even in richer areas, American

women over 65 have higher mortality than French women of the same age.

       Turning to the evolution of inequality in mortality, Figure 3 suggests that there was

very little change in the slopes of the lines relating mortality rates to poverty percentiles in

France. Table 2 confirms that there were no statistically significant changes in the slope of

this relationship, indicating no change in inequality in mortality.

       In contrast, the development of inequality in mortality in the United States showed

more variation, both over time and across groups. Consistent with Currie and Schwandt

(2016a,b) we show that inequality in mortality fell for American children and young adults

between 1990 and 2010, while inequality in mortality among older adults increased,

especially among women. Note however that these increases in inequality in mortality at

older ages are milder than those based on data for whites only. That is because, as Currie and

Schwandt show, there was tremendous improvement in mortality among African-American

men and women over this period. Hence, pooling whites and African-Americans (who had

higher mortality rates to begin with) together as we do here, tends to mute increases in

inequality in mortality for older adults.

       Overall, the evolution of mortality in France over this period is quite remarkable. Not

only were mortality rates much more equal to begin with, mortality also improved over time

more strongly than in the United States, especially for women over 15 and for men aged 35 to

54. The much greater decline in mortality for women aged 75–84 in France relative to the

United States is especially noteworthy given that in 1990, mortality in this age and gender



                                                11
group was approximately equal in the two countries. These patterns indicate that the “social

justice” achieved in France does not come at the expense of lower rates of innovation and

health improvements.



Specific causes of death

       It is natural to ask whether there are specific causes of death that show especially large

differences in mortality rates across the two countries, in terms of either levels or changes.

Table 3 shows the three leading causes of death for each age group. Appendix Table A3

provides more information on the underlying International Classification of Disease Codes

that were used to create these categories. Following Case and Deaton’s famous work, we

have adopted the category “Deaths of Despair,” which includes homicides, suicides,

accidental drug poisoning, and alcohol/liver disease. Further information about each of these

separate causes of death is shown in Appendix Table A4.

       Table 3 indicates that the most common causes of death shift as people age. For

infants, complications arising from labor and delivery in the perinatal period are the leading

cause. As children get older, unintentional injuries (accidents) become the leading cause of

death, while for prime-age adults, it is deaths of despair. Finally, as adults age further, cancer

(malignant neoplasms) and heart disease become leading causes.

       In the rest of this section, we consider how overall mortality for males and females in

a specific age group would be affected if the U.S. mortality rate by poverty percentile was set

equal to the French mortality rate for the same poverty percentile for selected leading causes

of death in each age group. Each figure shows the actual U.S. rates for 1990 to 2010 as

dashed lines and the actual 2010 rates for France as a solid line. A fourth, dotted line shows

the counterfactual U.S. rate that would be observed if the U.S. mortality rate was set to the

French mortality rate for one specific cause.



                                                12
       Figure 4 considers accident rates for people aged 1–24 and 25–44, age groups where

accidents are among the leading causes of death. Comparing the dotted line indicating the

counterfactual to the actual lines for the United States and France in 2010, one can see that

reducing U.S. accident rates to French levels would close the gap in overall mortality rates by

between 30% to 40% depending on the gender and age group. Thus, higher death rates from

unintentional injuries are a leading cause of the gap in death rates at younger ages between

these two countries. One might conjecture that higher accident rates in the United States are

largely a matter of lifestyle (reflecting factors such as more vehicle miles driven) and thus

beyond the reach of policy. However, according to the Institute of Medicine (1999), factors

as diverse as product regulation, safety education, and the organization of trauma care can all

play a role in reducing the burden of injury, which makes injury reduction an appropriate

target for public policy.

       Figure 5 focuses on deaths of despair in the 25–44 and 45–64 year-old age groups;

they have become leading causes of death for these groups and have received a great deal of

attention in the United States (see Case and Deaton 2015, 2017). As reported in Table 3C,

deaths of despair have increased by 42% and 106% for U.S. middle-aged males and females,

respectively, while they decreased by 17% and 35% in France over the same period. Given

this development, one might expect to see that overall, U.S. mortality rates in these age

groups would have been much lower if the French mortality rates for deaths of despair had

prevailed in the United States. Perhaps surprisingly then, Figure 5 suggests that setting U.S.

rates to French rates would have had little impact on either U.S. mortality rates or on the

closing of the gap between U.S. and French rates. The dotted line, showing simulated U.S.

mortality with the French rate for deaths of despair, is only marginally lower than the actual

U.S. mortality rate for these age groups.




                                               13
       There are two reasons U.S. deaths of despair do not make much of a difference in this

cross-country comparison. First, deaths of despair are relatively high in France, driven

primarily by suicides, which are slightly higher in France than in the United States, for both

middle-aged men and women (see Appendix Table A4). Moreover, deaths of despair only

make up between one-third and one-tenth of all deaths at middle and older ages. Overall,

Figure 5 suggests that deaths of despair can therefore play only a minor role in explaining

differential mortality developments in France and in the United States. One reason this

observation is interesting is that it suggests that whatever underlying social malaise is driving

U.S. deaths of despair, it is not a peculiarly American phenomenon.

       Before turning from deaths of despair, it is worth discussing homicides specifically,

as higher rates of violent crime are one of the things that distinguishes the U.S. from Europe

(Lynch and Pridemore 2011). Figure 1 shows that setting U.S. homicide rates to French rates

would have little impact on deaths among women, but it would have an impact on death rates

among men, especially at men at younger ages in the highest poverty places.

       Figure 6 focuses on cancer deaths, in the 45–64 and 65–84 year-old age groups where

cancer is a leading cause of death. These figures indicate that among men, applying French

cancer death rates to the United States would actually increase U.S. overall mortality rates.

That is, French men have higher death rates from cancer than American men, particularly at

ages 45–64. It is not clear whether this gap represents differences in prevalence, screening, or

treatment, or all three. Among women, applying French cancer rates to the U.S. data would

result in very slight reductions in American mortality in these age groups. This means we can

rule out differential cancer mortality as a primary reason for higher U.S. mortality rates.

       One reason for the lower cancer mortality rate among older U.S. males could be

declining smoking rates in these cohorts. The United States has experienced great success in

smoking cessation that occurred first among men and only later among women (the affected



                                               14
women have not yet entered old age). In France, reductions in smoking rates have been more

moderate and occurred later as discussed further below.

    Figure 7 shows that applying French mortality rates from ischemic heart disease to the

U.S. data for ages 45–64 would reduce the gap in mortality between French men and

American men by about two-thirds in the higher poverty percentiles. In the low poverty

percentiles, the French death rates are actually higher than the equivalent U.S. rates. In these

percentiles, applying the French rates for heart disease would result in an even lower overall

death rate. At ages 65–84, when ischemic heart disease becomes a more prominent cause of

death, applying the French rates eliminates the mortality gap at the top poverty percentile.

Moreover, at all other poverty percentiles, the resulting simulated rate is below the actual rate

in both the United States and France!

    Among women, there is a very large gap in mortality rates, particularly for women aged

65–84; applying French heart disease mortality rates would have only a small impact on the

gap between U.S. and French rates.



4. Discussion and Conclusions

       Our focus on using département groups and counties as the unit of analysis to examine

inequality has advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is that by grouping smaller

geographic areas into groups each representing a fixed slice of the population, we can focus

on trends in a relatively constant share of the population over time and thus avoid the large

changes in composition that complicate analyses when grouping people by characteristics

such as education or occupation (Strand et al. 2010; Mackenbach et al. 2016). Départements

and counties are also large enough to provide precise mortality estimates even in age ranges

with low mortality. Arguably, our method is well suited to conducting comparative research,




                                               15
as even administrative units of different average size can be converted into ventiles of the

population, which can then be compared across countries.

    The main limitation of our approach is that it focuses on differences between groups of

départements whereas some variation in inequality will occur within départements. It is

unclear, for example, whether low poverty areas are healthier simply because they contain

more rich and healthy people or whether poor people who live in rich areas are also healthier.

Chetty et al. (2016) argue that in the United States, the poor appear to be better off in places

where there are more rich people, presumably because the quality of public services and

amenities are better and the poor cannot be completely excluded from enjoying these benefits.

It will be important for future work to determine which sorts of amenities are most

responsible for reducing mortality in these areas.

    A second limitation is that because there is no consistent data on département-level

poverty rates available over time in France before 2004, we are unable to rank the

départements using contemporaneous poverty rates in each year and hence use the 2010

poverty rate for all our rankings. (However, this procedure also has the advantage that the

poorest area in 2010 is identified as the poorest area throughout the entire period of analysis,

rather than shifting from decade to decade).

    To address this issue, we have redone our calculations ordering département by education

levels (specifically, by the fraction of the population without a baccalaureate degree).

Education is available consistently for each département in 1990, 1999, and 2012, and the

fraction without a baccalaureate is highly correlated with the fraction of poor (see Figure A7).

Note that we can consistently identify areas with the lowest levels of education, even when

there are large changes over time in the fraction of the population in each education category.

    As one would expect, the results based on education rankings look quite similar to those

discussed above (see Figure A4). Moreover, with these data it is possible to compare the



                                                16
effects of reordering the départements in each year with the estimates obtained above when

only the education ranking in 2012 is used. A comparison of Figures A3 and A4 shows that

the results are virtually identical. This finding is in line with Currie and Schwandt (2016a,b),

who demonstrate that in the United States, results are also very similar when county groups

are reordered every year rather than being kept constant over time.

       Our results point to stark differences in both levels and trends in inequality in

mortality in the United States and France. Age-specific mortality was higher in the United

States than in France for all ages and both genders in 2010, though this was not always the

case:in 1990, middle-aged Frenchmen in wealthy areas were more likely to die than men in

wealthy American areas. By 2010, in general, rich Americans did as well as rich French

citizens, with the main exception being elderly American women, who had much higher

mortality rates than elderly French women. However, Americans in poor areas were more

likely to die that French people in poor areas in all age and gender groups.

       Overall, the French mortality-poverty percentile gradients are remarkably flat relative

to the comparable U.S. gradients, and this is especially true for children and young adults—in

France, inequality in mortality has largely been eliminated in these groups. In contrast, in the

United States, the traditional strong relationship between income and health continues to hold

for all groups, which is reflected in strongly upward sloping gradients.

       The French gradients also show remarkably little change over time. Thus, over a

period when income inequality increased sharply in France (Garbinti et al., 2017), there was

essentially no change in inequality in mortality. This fact is significant because it shows that

there is no necessary relationship between income inequality and health inequality;while it is

true that on average, income and health are related, they do not necessarily move in lockstep.

(This is in line with Leigh and Jencks (2007), who find no relationship between inequality in

income and inequality in mortality for 12 developed countries over the past century).



                                               17
         The U.S. trends also support this conclusion. While income inequality increased

greatly between 1990 and 2010 and fueled a large body of academic literature (c.f. Piketty

2014; Piketty and Saez 2003; Piketty, Saez, and Zucman 2018), inequality in mortality grew

for some demographic groups but shrank for others. As we demonstrate above, inequality in

mortality fell for American children and young adults between 1990 and 2010, while

inequality in mortality among older adults increased, especially among women.

         What are the protective factors that can prevent increases in income inequality from

being reflected in increases in inequality in mortality? Health care systems are likely to play a

role. As discussed above, France has a system dedicated to ensuring equal access to care.

France has seen many changes in the organization of health care over this period, though it is

not known to what extent they have driven the changes we document here.1 The French

health insurance system remains one of the most redistributive systems in the OECD, with

particularly low out-of-pocket expenditures. However, despite the generosity of the system,

some inequality in mortality remains among adults and the elderly in France, pointing to the

continued importance of social determinants of health such as education, access to

employment, and income supports, which have recently been identified as priorities in

France’s national health strategy (Touraine, 2014).

         In the United States, the reductions in inequality in mortality among poor infants and

children may be attributable at least in part to the tremendous expansion of public health

insurance for poor infants and children that took place beginning in the late 1980s. The

eligibility of pregnant women for public health insurance coverage of their pregnancies and

deliveries increased by roughly 30% , and this increase was associated with an 8.5%



1
  Between 1990 and 1999, a funding reform for public hospitals introduced global budgeting, and Act #91-748
aimed to balance health-care delivery across French regions and to introduce strategic planning for hospitals.
The 1996 reform aimed to create "universal health insurance" giving the right to social security to anyone over
the age of 18 regularly residing in French territory. Many changes occurred after 2000 as well, including the
reorganization of the health insurance governance system starting in 2004.


                                                       18
reduction in infant mortality (Currie and Gruber 1996a). Over the same period, a 15%

increase in eligibility for public health insurance coverage among children reduced the

probability that children went without any doctor visits over the course of a year by 9.6%

(Currie and Gruber 1996b).

       Recently, several studies have examined the longer-term impact of the expansions of

children’s public health insurance coverage (Brown, Kowlaski and Lurie 2015; Cahodes et al.

2014; Currie, Decker, and Lin 2008; Miller and Wherry 2014; Wherry and Meyer 2015;

Wherry et al. 2015). Many of these studies rely on a cohort design that compares cohorts who

received Medicaid coverage in early childhood because they were born after the cutoff date

for eligibility, to cohorts who were born just prior to that cutoff. The affected cohorts attain

more education, are more likely to be employed and have higher earnings, and are in better

health as adults. Most relevant for this study, Wherry and Meyer (2015) show that cohorts

eligible for the Medicaid expansions had lower child mortality than slightly older cohorts and

that the effect was largest in demographic groups with the highest increase in eligibility.

       Aizer and Currie (2014) identify many additional U.S. policies that may have been

important for safeguarding the health of young children, including measures to reduce

domestic violence and improve nutrition. Thus, a possible interpretation of the U.S. data is

that an underlying tendency for inequality in mortality to follow trends in inequality in

income found expression among older people, but was counterbalanced among young people

by a tremendous multi-pronged policy effort to improve the health of American children.

       Following Preston (2006), Currie and Schwandt (2016a,b) also argue that cohort-level

smoking patterns maybe responsible for some of the increasing inequality at older ages. In the

United States, when the dangers of smoking became widely known, people of higher

socioeconomic status stopped smoking much sooner than persons of lower socioeconomic




                                                19
status. Smoking increased in France longer than the United States (Hill 1998), implying a

similar effect on inequality for old-age mortality in France.

       To conclude, the results of this paper suggest that policy makers should not be

fatalistic about the link between income and health. Ideally, public policy would eliminate

poverty. However, while policy makers struggle with that difficult task, there is much that

can be done to improve health among the poor and eliminate health disparities. We have

identified public health insurance and tobacco control policies as two of the factors that have

been responsible for some of the recent improvements in health and reductions in inequality

in mortality. Policies that target other modern threats to health, such as opioid addiction and

obesity, may also prove promising.

                         Notes: Poverty quantiles are constructed by ranking French départements and U.S. counties
                         by their 2010 poverty rates and dividing them into 20 groups, each representing
                         approximately 5% of the total population.

Note: Slopes are fitted using OLS regressions of mortality on the poverty percentile, including an intercept. The p-value of the difference is
derived from a pooled OLS regression, including an interaction term of the poverty percentile with the year 2010. Regressions are weighted by
gender-specific population.

Diseases): ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. ICD-9 was used to encode deaths from 1979 to 1999.
ICD-10 was used to encode deaths from 2000 to 2017. See Anderson et al. (2001) for
comparability ratios.
