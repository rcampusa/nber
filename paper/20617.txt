                                              ABSTRACT

We ask two questions related to how access to credit affects the nature of business cycles. First, does
the standard theory of unsecured credit account for the high volatility and procyclicality of credit and
the high volatility and countercyclicality of bankruptcy filings found in U.S. data? Yes, it does, but
only if we explicitly model recessions as displaying countercyclical earnings risk (i.e., rather than
having all households fare slightly worse than normal during recessions, we ensure that more households
than normal fare very poorly). Second, does access to credit smooth aggregate consumption or aggregate
hours worked, and if so, does it matter with respect to the nature of business cycles? No, it does not;
in fact, consumption is 20 percent more volatile when credit is available. The interest rate premia increase
in recessions because of higher bankruptcy risk discouraging households from using credit. This finding
contradicts the intuition that access to credit helps households to smooth their consumption.

1.      Introduction


Significant developments have taken place in the unsecured consumer credit market since the 1980s.
The balance of gross total unsecured credit increased from 5 percent of GDP in 1980 to 8 percent of
GDP in the 2000s. At the same time, the number of bankruptcy filings increased, from 0.36 percent
of all households in 1980 to more than 1.4 percent in the early 2000s.1 Yet surprisingly, the business
cycle properties of households’ access to credit have not been studied in the literature.


We ask two questions in this paper:



     1. Does the standard theory of unsecured credit, as posed, for example, by Chatterjee, Corbae,
        Nakajima, and Rı́os-Rull (2007) and Livshits, MacGee, and Tertilt (2007), suitably extended
        to address business cycles, offer correct predictions about the cyclical behavior of unsecured
        household credit and bankruptcies? Both variables are highly volatile in the data (3.5 and 6.5
        times the volatility of output), with unsecured credit being somewhat procyclical (having a 0.3
        correlation with output) and bankruptcies being somewhat countercyclical (-0.2 correlation with
        output).

     2. Does the large increase in credit in the consumer credit market affect the nature of business
        cycles? In particular, we are interested in whether the main macroeconomic aggregates behave
        differently — and if so, to what extent — as a result of the existence of household access to
        credit under the U.S. legal system. The variables that we examine are aggregate consumption
        and investment and, to a lesser extent, aggregate hours worked.



From an ex-ante point of view, the contribution of households’ increased access to borrowing and
default to aggregate fluctuations is not clear. One might be tempted to think that increased access
1
    These numbers represent total consumer bankruptcy filings. For Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings, the proportion is 0.26
    percent in 1980 and about 1 percent in the early 2000s.

to credit allows households to smooth their consumption and more easily endure fluctuations in the
business cycle. Herkenhoff (2014), however, argues that it allows households to prolong job searches,
thereby inducing deeper and longer recessions. Alternatively, one might conclude, in light of the Great
Recession, that the financial sector destabilizes the economy by encouraging oscillations in private
consumption.


We investigate these issues by posing model economies in which heterogeneous agents are subject to
idiosyncratic shocks to their earning possibilities. We compare the properties of economies in which
households have access to credit and bankruptcy (a feature intrinsically associated with unsecured
credit) with the properties of economies in which households either do not have access to credit or do
have access, but without the possibility of filing for bankruptcy. The types of economies we pose are
essentially a combination of the economies with bankruptcy à la Chatterjee et al. (2007) or Livshits
et al. (2007) and those with aggregate shocks à la Krusell and Smith Jr. (1998).


Regarding our first question, we find that the model economies share the main cyclical properties of
borrowing and default with the U.S. economy: Borrowing is procyclical, and bankruptcy filings are
countercyclical. Bankruptcy filings are quite volatile, but credit is less volatile than in the data, leading
us to believe that the volatility of consumer credit may itself be subject to shocks, rather than being
solely the result of households’ choices in response to aggregate shocks to earnings.


With respect to the second question, we find that the availability of credit makes consumption more
volatile, about 20 percent more volatile. The behavior of hours worked is more subdued. The availability
of credit increases only slightly the volatility of hours, about 2 percent more. Consequently, output does
not vary differently across credit regimes, thereby implying that the larger volatility of consumption when
there is access to credit is accompanied by a smaller volatility of investment. Note that the behavior
of consumption is the opposite to what one could think that credit is, an additional tool to smooth
consumption. Then, why does its availability lead to a higher consumption volatility?




                                                     3
Our findings require some qualifications, two of which are common to all the economies within the
class that we study: that lending institutions themselves do not contribute to economic instability (we
model lenders as if they were banks with 100 percent reserves) and that the origin of the fluctuations in
the business cycle is some form of total factor productivity (TFP) shock. The rest of the qualifications
are more subtle. The first one is that we model recessions as a period during which all households
are faring a little worse than normal, but some households are faring very poorly, as implied by the
findings about the countercyclicality of earnings risk of Storesletten, Telmer, and Yaron (2004) and
Guvenen, Ozkan, and Song (2012). The second qualification is that the legal system matches that
in the United States, where households have easy access to filing for bankruptcy. This feature is
what makes credit procyclical: It implies lower expected bankruptcy rates in good times and hence
better credit terms for borrowing households. Clearly, this feature is also necessary in accounting for
bankruptcies themselves. Economies with credit but without default have countercyclical credit and
less volatile aggregate consumption. Another issue we explore is that there are occasionally very large
recessions, which do not seem to matter, and hence the size of the recessions does not qualify our
findings.


To study the interaction between unsecured credit and business cycles, we bring together the following
four strands of literature for the first time. First, our model features uninsurable idiosyncratic labor
income shocks (Bewley (1986), İmrohoroğlu (1989), Huggett (1993), Aiyagari (1994)). Second, we
introduce unsecured credit and equilibrium bankruptcies (Chatterjee et al. (2007), Livshits et al. (2007)).
Third, we introduce aggregate fluctuations to the economy in which consumers are subject to uninsured
idiosyncratic shocks (Krusell and Smith Jr. (1998), Castañeda, Dı́az-Giménez, and Rı́os-Rull (1998)).
Finally, the business cycles in our model pose countercyclical earnings risk as argued by Storesletten
et al. (2004) and Guvenen et al. (2012). Two more important papers related to ours are Kiyotaki and
Moore (1997) and Neumeyer and Perri (2005). In the former, credit also turns out to be procyclical,
albeit for reasons very different from ours. The latter shows that consumption volatility in emerging
economies is magnified by the countercyclical movement of borrowing interest. Arellano (2008) and


                                                    4
Chatterjee and Eyigungor (2012) provide a theory for these movements that is related to what goes
on in our environment.2 Nakajima and Rı́os-Rull (2005) explored aggregate fluctuations in endowment
economies where aggregate fluctuations are announced in advance. The findings there are that for those
environments both bankruptcy and credit are extremely procyclical. Clearly, the choice of environment
misses the relevant properties of the data. Recently, there has been some new work that explores
business cycle properties of economies where households can file for bankruptcy. In Chapter 4 of his
thesis, Fieldhouse (2014) (jointly written with Livshits and MacGee) explores the aggregate properties
of endowment economies with aggregate endowment shocks and unsecured credit. The authors find
that aggregate fluctuations in earnings generate countercyclical bankruptcy filings, but credit is also
countercyclical. In addition to failing to replicate the cyclicality of credit, the volatilities in filing,
interest rates, and debt are well below the data. Gordon (2013) explores how the presence of aggregate
risk affects the welfare assessment of different policies when there are state contingent contracts that
allow intermediaries to always have zero profits. Because the paper barely explores the business cycle
properties of the model, we see this paper as complementary to ours. Corbae and D’Erasmo (2014)
explore the cyclical behavior of loans in a model of the banking industry where financial intermediaries
can and do default, and they also find procyclical lending.


The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the business cycle properties of the
main macroeconomics aggregates and those of credit and bankruptcy. Section 3 describes the model.
The specification of the parameterization to map the model economies to U.S. data is in Section 4,
and Section 5 briefly discusses computation arising from the complexity of the environment. The main
analysis is in Section 6. Section 7 explores how our findings change when we depart from the two
assumptions that we make in our baseline model economy: that there is countercyclical earnings risk
and that there is a possibility of rare but large recessions. Finally, some concluding thoughts are in
Section 8. Appendix A provides a detailed description of the computation of the model. Appendix B
displays additional tables.

    While countercyclical interest rate hikes occur as in our economy, the sovereign default literature points to individual
    histories with persistent shocks. Instead, these hikes happen here because of countercyclical earnings risk.

2.    Credit and Bankruptcy Facts Related to the Business Cycle


Table 1 describes the business cycle properties of the U.S. economy using yearly data. The data include
the volume of credit and the number of personal bankruptcies under all legal forms as well as only
those under Chapter 7, which is what our model replicates. The data are from the period after 1980,
when data on the number of bankruptcies are available. We filter the data using the Hodrick-Prescott
(H-P) filter with the smoothing parameter of 6.25, following Ravn and Uhlig (2002). In 2005, a major
bankruptcy reform made filing more difficult and thereby induced many people to file for bankruptcy
preemptively. In 2008, the Great Recession began. For both of these reasons — bankruptcy reform
and the onset of the Great Recession — we report the data in two different panels. Panel A reports
the data up to 2004, and Panel B reports up to the most recent available year.


The table displays the standard business cycle facts: Consumption is less volatile than investment, and
all aggregates are highly correlated. With respect to credit and bankruptcy, we see that consumer credit
is quite volatile — about three times more volatile than output — and that it is clearly procyclical,
although less strongly than consumption or investment. Bankruptcies are extremely volatile — about
twice as volatile as investment — and are slightly countercyclical. Both properties are exacerbated if
we include the data up to 2013.


At this stage, we should point out that the procyclicality of credit does not square well with its possible
role as an instrument to smooth consumption in bad times. Still, before passing judgment, we will wait
to see what the model tells us.



3.    The Model


The model extends Chatterjee et al. (2007) by introducing aggregate shocks. The environment is
inhabited by a mass of households that can save or borrow and that can and often do default on their

debt. The punishment for defaulting in the model captures the punishment for Chapter 7 consumer
bankruptcy in the United States. There is a large number of financial intermediaries that extend
loans to households, adjusting the terms and conditions of loans for different aggregate states and
different types of households, depending on the expected default probability and the expected rate of
return for risk-free assets. Generally, high-risk borrowers are charged a high default premium, and,
because of their persistence, recessions increase the default premium for all borrowers. In equilibrium,
predicted default probabilities that are used to compute the default premium for different types of loans



                                                         7
are consistent with the optimal default decision of borrowers, given the default premium offered by
financial intermediaries.


3.1.   Bankruptcy Filings in the Model


The procedure and the consequences of bankruptcy filings are modeled to capture those of the Chapter
7 consumer bankruptcy filings in the United States. Let h ∈ {0, 1} denote the credit history; h = 1
indicates a record of a bankruptcy filing in the household’s recent credit history; and h = 0 indicates
the absence of any such record. We will refer to h as simply the household’s credit history, with the
rating either good (h = 0) or bad (h = 1). A household with a good credit history can borrow and can
default on its debt. Upon bankruptcy, the filing household experiences the following events:



   1. Creditors can garnish a fraction ξ of the labor income. This garnishment represents both partial
       repayment by the borrower before defaulting and the creditors’ attempt to garnish income before
       the borrower files for bankruptcy.

   2. The unsecured debt balance of the borrower that is not covered by the garnished labor income is
       discharged. The creditors lose any future claims to the discharged debts.

   3. When defaulting, the household is not permitted to save a positive amount in the current period.
       The assumption is a simple way to recognize that a household’s attempt to accumulate assets
       during the period of bankruptcy filing results in those assets being seized by creditors.

   4. The household begins the next period with a bad credit history (h = 1).

   5. A household with a bad credit history (h = 1) cannot get any new loans. This assumption is
       broadly consistent with the experience of bankrupt individuals reported in Musto (1999). There
       are no restrictions on saving.

   6. There is a positive probability λ that a credit history of a household is cleared, and the household


                                                    8
       will start the next period with a good credit history (h = 0). This is a simple way of modeling the
       fact that a history of a bankruptcy filing remains on an individual’s credit history for only a finite
       number of years. After the history of defaulting is cleared, the past default has no consequences.



Since loans might not be repaid because of the option of a bankruptcy, profit-maximizing financial
intermediaries have to take into account the probability of repayment in determining the terms of
loans. Moreover, since borrowers with different opportunities for future earnings and with different
amounts of debts have potentially different probabilities of repayment, the terms of the unsecured
loans are a function of the borrower’s characteristics, the state of the economy, and the size of the
loans. Further details are discussed in the section following the household’s problem.


3.2.   Demographics


There is a continuum of households of measure one at each point in time. Each household faces an
exogenous survival probability π. In each period, measure (1 − π) households are born and replace
the deceased households, keeping the size of the population constant. We assume a complete annuity
market for survival risk. This concise life-cycle structure ensures that households are born with zero
assets and therefore do not have time to accumulate as many precautionary assets as they would want,
thus creating the conditions for an active loans market.


3.3.   Preferences


The preferences of a household are given by the expected value of a discounted sum of period utilities:


            (∞                          )
             X
                      t
       E0         (βπ) γt u (ct , 1 − `t ) ,                                                             (1)
            t=0




                                                      9
where β ∈ (0, 1) is the discount factor, π ∈ (0, 1) is the survival probability, γt ∈ [0, 1] is an idiosyncratic
preference shock that follows a finite-state Markov process with Markov transition matrix Γγγ,γ 0 , ct is
consumption in period t, and `t is hours worked. E0 is the expectation operator taken with respect to
information in period 0. The utility function u is continuous, strictly increasing, and strictly concave
in both arguments.


The use of preference shocks as a trigger for indebtedness deserves some discussion. Expenditure shocks
have often been used (e.g., Chatterjee et al. (2007), Livshits et al. (2007)) to capture events such as
large uninsured medical expenditures, divorces, and unwanted births that may trigger defaults without
borrowing. In that case, the volume of indebtedness of households does not closely depend on the risk
premium or on the aggregate state of the economy. A household that is hit by a preference shock,
however, chooses to borrow a certain amount and may then subsequently default if such a choice turns
out to be optimal. Preference shocks that increase the marginal utility of consumption interact with
the aggregate state of the economy to determine how much is borrowed and how much is defaulted —
a feature that turns out to be crucial in generating the procyclicality of credit in our model economies.


3.4.   Technology


There is one good produced via z F (K , L), where z is an aggregate productivity shock that follows
a finite-state Markov process with Markov transition matrix Γzz,z 0 , K and L are aggregate capital and
labor measured in efficiency units, and F is a constant returns to scale aggregate production function,
strictly increasing, strictly concave, and satisfying Inada conditions. The good can be either consumed
or invested in physical capital. The aggregate resource constraint is


       Ct + Kt+1 = (1 − δ)Kt + zt F (Kt , Lt ),                                                             (2)


where Ct is aggregate consumption in period t and δ is the depreciation rate of physical capital.




                                                      10
3.5.    Endowments


A household is born with zero assets and is endowed with one unit of time each period. Following
Storesletten et al. (2004), individual labor productivity consists of three components. The distribution
of the permanent shock e is denoted by Γee , and the persistent shock p follows a finite-state Markov
process with Markov transition matrix Γpp,p0 |z 0 , explicitly depending on z 0 . We use this feature when
we calibrate the model so that earnings risk is countercyclical. There is also a transitory shock t with
distribution Γtt .


3.6.    Market Arrangements


Households cannot trade state-contingent securities but can smooth consumption by changing their
hours worked, by saving or borrowing, and by defaulting on their debt. The asset position of households
is denoted by a ∈ A, with a < 0 indicating that the household is borrowing.


In order to emphasize that the interest rate of loans is specified at the time the loan is made, we
keep track of the face value of the loan or promised amount to pay the following period. A borrower
that promises to repay a0 tomorrow (primes denote the value of variables next period), provided that it
decides not to file for bankruptcy, receives q a0 in the current period, so q is the discount price of the
loan. Savings are recorded in the standard way. A household that saves a0 receives (1 + r 0 )a0 in the
following period, where r 0 is the rate of return on savings that is determined in the next period and is
thus subject to aggregate shocks.


There is also a perfect annuity market, which insures the mortality risk: A household that saves πa0 will
receive a0 only if it survives. This feature has no interesting consequences; it just ensures that assets
do not disappear after the death of households.

3.7.   Household’s Problem


The individual state variables are {x, h, a}, where we use x to summarize the exogenous individual shocks
to a household (γ, e, p, t). Naturally, we use Γxx,x 0 |z 0 to denote the Markov transition probabilities of
x. Recall that γ is the preference shock, e is the individual permanent productivity shock, p is the
individual persistent productivity shock, and t is the individual transitory productivity shock. h ∈ {0, 1}
is the household’s credit history, and a is the current asset position of the household. The aggregate
state variables are {z, K , m}, where z is an aggregate shock to productivity, K is the aggregate capital
stock, and m(x, h, a) ∈ M is a type distribution of households. Aggregate capital K is an aggregate
state variable in addition to m, because m is not a sufficient statistic for K , since it depends on the
type distribution in the previous period. In addition, to determine wages and rates of return, we need
to know aggregate labor, L, an equilibrium object. We write L = φL (z, K , m) as the function that
determines aggregate labor supply. The laws of motion for the state variables are φK (z, K , m) for
aggregate capital and φm (z, z 0 , K , m) for the type distribution. The latter contains z 0 as an argument
because the distribution of the persistent productivity shock in the next period, p 0 , and thus the type
distribution in the next period, m0 , depends on z 0 . To solve their problem, households also need to know
wages, w (z, K , L, m), rates of return, r (z, K , L, m), and prices for each type of loan, q(z, K , m, x, a0 ).
We write wages and rates of return as being functions of the state variables and of labor to stress that
they are (mostly; see the discussion below) marginal productivities that depend on the total amount of
inputs. In a strict sense, however, factor prices depend on state variables only after substituting labor
using equilibrium function φL .


Let us first consider the problem of a household with a good credit history (h = 0) that does not file for
bankruptcy. Given pricing functions, labor function, φL (z, K , m), and laws of motion, φm (z, z 0 , K , m)
and φK (z, K , m), the household solves the following problem:




                                                      12

                                         L = φL (z, K , m),                                                                      (5)

                                     K 0 = φK (z, K , m).                                                                        (7)


V0 (z, K , m, x, 0, a) is the value for a household with a good credit history if it chooses not to file for
bankruptcy. The household chooses current consumption c, hours worked `, and the asset position
in the next period a0 . V (z, K , m, x, h, a) is the value function. Equation (4) is the standard budget
constraint. Asset holdings for the next period, a0 , are multiplied by π (perfect annuities term) and
q(.). For savers, q(.) = 1, that is, there is no discount due to default risk. For borrowers who might
default on their loans, q(.) includes not only the inverse of the expected interest rate (the interest
rate charged to risk-free borrowers), but also any premium due to the risk of default. The return on
savings, r (z, K , L, m), is multiplied by 1a≥0 , where 1 is the indicator function that takes the value 1(0)
if the condition attached to it is true (false), because only savers earn interest. The interest charged to
borrowers is implicit in q(.). Equation (5) yields the equilibrium quantity of labor necessary to compute
factor prices, and equations (6) and (7) are forecasting functions for the type distribution and aggregate
capital stock in the next period.


A household with good credit history (h = 0) that files for bankruptcy (h0 = 1) solves the following




                                                       13

and conditions (5-7). Upon filing for bankruptcy, the household cannot save during the current period,
and there is garnishment of labor income by creditors, which is a proportion ξ to the household’s current
labor income. Moreover, the household starts the following period with a bad credit history (h0 = 1)
and no assets (a0 = 0).


The household optimally chooses whether to file for bankruptcy. Formally, V (z, K , m, x, 0, a) satisfies


      V (z, K , m, x, 0, a) = max {V0 (z, K , m, x, 0, a), V1 (z, K , m, x, 0, a)} .                                                       (10)


A household with a bad credit history (h = 1) cannot file for bankruptcy, and its problem is

and conditions (5-7). One notable difference from the previous problems is the existence of                                               h0

In particular, Γh1 = (1 − λ) (credit history remains bad) and Γh0 = λ (credit history becomes good).
The budget constraint (12) is simpler, since the household cannot borrow with a bad credit history as
reflected in condition (13).


Decision rules are denoted c = g c (z, K , m, x, h, a) for consumption, a0 = g a (z, K , m, x, h, a) for bor-

rowing or saving, ` = g ` (z, K , m, x, h, a) for hours worked, and h0 = g h (z, K , m, x, a) for defaulting.
The latter function does not have an argument h because there is no bankruptcy decision for a house-
hold with a bad credit history. Using these decision rules, the probability that a household of type
x = (γ, e, p, t) with a good credit history (h = 0) and amount of debt a0 in an aggregate state
(z, K , m) files for a bankruptcy in the next period is given by

3.8.    Unsecured Credit Industry


The financial intermediaries that make unsecured loans are owned by mutual funds (explained in the
next section) and operate with zero costs, and the industry has free entry. The opportunity cost for
the mutual fund is the return on the alternative investment, real capital. Ignoring the subtle issues
associated with the lack of perfect correlation between the rates of return on both assets, we simply
assume that equilibrium requires that both assets yield the same expected rate of return. The return
on a loan depends on the interest rate charged, on the probability that the loan is repaid, and, in the
case of default, on how much income can be garnished. Although whether a loan is repaid depends
on the realization of idiosyncratic shocks, lenders can eliminate the idiosyncratic risk by lending to a
positive mass of the same type of borrowers and exploiting the law of large numbers, making profits
linear in the measure of each type of loan. At the same time, because of free entry, the expected
profit of each firm that lends to a certain type of household with a certain amount of debt is driven to
zero. Although in the steady state actual profits are zero, with aggregate uncertainty, realized profits
are typically nonzero; hence, the role of the mutual funds that own lending firms to absorb profits and
losses. In sum, the expected zero profit condition of a firm in the credit industry that makes one loan




                                                                          15

using conditions (5-7). We use g 0h and g 0` as shorthand for g h (z 0 , K 0 , m0 , x 0 , a0 ) and g ` (z 0 , K 0 , m0 , x 0 , h0 , a0 ),
respectively. The first term on the right-hand side represents the income garnishment in case the bor-
rower defaults, and the second term represents the amount of the loan repaid. This expected zero
profit condition implies the following formula for q(.):

                                X                                  1g 0h =1 ξ e 0 p 0 t 0 g 0` w (z 0 , K 0 , L0 , m0 ) + 1g 0h =0 (−a0 )

Notice that, when for some (z, K , m, x, a0 ) no borrowers default, we have

                                X                                   1
       q(z, K , m, x, a0 ) =               Γzz,z 0                                      .                                                       (17)

The inverse of the discount rate of financial assets is the expected interest rate of savings. Finally, for
a0 ≥ 0, q(z, K , m, x, a0 ) = 1.


3.9.     Factor Prices and the Mutual Fund


We assume a constant returns to scale production technology where the price of an efficient unit of
labor is the standard marginal condition


       w (z, K , L, m) = z FL (K , L).                                                                                                          (18)




                                                                              16
In aggregate state (z, K , m), total labor input in efficiency units, L, is given by

                                Z
       L = φL (z, K , m) =          g ` (z, K , m, x, h, a) e p t dm(x, h, a).                         (19)


The aggregate amount loaned today, D, is

                  Z
       D=−            1g a <0 π g a q(z, K , m, x, g a ) dm(x, h, a),                                  (20)


where g a is shorthand for g a (z, K , m, x, h, a). The aggregate capital stock in the next period, K 0 , is
total wealth tomorrow net of loans made today:

              Z
         0
       K =        π g a q(z, K , m, x, g a ) dm(x, h, a) − D.                                          (21)


Capital earns the marginal rate of return rK according to the production technology, and the return
on loans, rD , is a weighted average of the returns of each type of loan. We assume that there is
a representative risk-neutral mutual fund and that all savers hold their wealth in this mutual fund.
Because of risk neutrality, although the return on the loans rD can be different from the rate of return
on capital rK ex-post, they have to be the same ex-ante. Specifically, the return on the mutual fund,
r (z, K , L, m), is

                                K                       D
        r (z, K , L, m) =          rK (z, K , L, m) +      rD (z, K , L, m),                           (22)
                              K +D                    K +D
       rK (z, K , L, m) = z FK (K , L) − δ,                                                            (23)
                            1a<0 [1g h =1 ξ e p t g ` w (z, K , L, m) + 1g h =0 (−a)] dm
                          R
       rD (z, K , L, m) =                                                                − 1.          (24)
                                                         D

Equation (22) defines the return on the mutual fund as the weighted average of the return from capital
(rK ) and the return from loans (rD ). Equation (23) is the standard marginal condition for capital, and
equation (24) characterizes the ex-post return of loans — basically the total income from loans divided



                                                            17
by the amount loaned.


The use of this risk-neutral mutual fund allows us to circumvent the problem of how to determine the
portfolio of savers. This convention has another property that we want to emphasize: that the lending
institutions are not leveraged at all. They are like banks with 100 percent reserves. As such, any losses
that they may suffer during large recessions — and they do suffer them — are absorbed by all savers
in what is simply a proportional reduction to their wealth. Consequently, our economies have none of
the problems that can be thought of as associated with the systemic risk of large banks.

        laws of motion, q(z, K , m, x, a0 ) satisfies the expected zero profit condition (16).

   4. Competitive factor prices. rK (z, K , L, m) and w (z, K , L, m) satisfy (23) and (18), respectively.

   5. Mutual fund’s indifference of allocations of investment. r (z, K , L, m) satisfies (22).

   6. Consistency/market clearing. φm (z, z 0 , K , m) is consistent with the consumer’s optimal deci-
        sion rules and the law of motion for exogenous shocks, and φK (z, K , m) satisfies condition (21).

4.     Mapping the Model to Data


We specify the model period to be one year. Table 2 summarizes the calibration and contains three
panels. Panel A includes the parameters that can be pinned down without solving the model. Panel B
includes six parameters that are pinned down by solving a system of six equations that target steady-
state values for the number of bankruptcies, the wealth-to-income ratio, the proportion of disposable
time spent working, the number of borrowers, the size of their debt, and the cross-sectional coefficient
of variation of earnings. Panel C consists of the parameters associated with business cycles. We have
not targeted the wealth distribution explicitly, because the computational demands already loom large.
This paper is about how the fear of being at the bottom of the income and wealth distribution shapes
the behavior of the economy with various credit arrangements; therefore, we are concerned with the
left tail of the distribution, not the right tail.

Demographics The survival probability, π = 0.98, implies that an average household’s adult life is
50 years.

Preferences We use a per-period Cobb-Douglas utility function, u(c) =                   1−σ
                                                                                                   ,   where σ is
set to 3.72 so that the coefficient of risk aversion for consumption is 2. The process for preference
shocks is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with two values; one of them, γ1 = 1, is a
normalization. We think of γ1 as the normal state, whereas γ2 captures the state in which the marginal
utility from consumption is high. This state captures various occasions that often lead to defaulting,
such as large uninsured medical expenditures, a divorce, an unwanted/unplanned pregnancy, and so on.


The discount rate, β, the share parameter of consumption, α, the value of the impatient state, γ2 , and
its probability, Γγ2 , are determined jointly to target various aggregates and are described in Section 4.2.

Technology We assume a Cobb-Douglas production function, Y = zF (K , L) = zK θ L1−θ , where the
capital share, θ = 0.36, is calibrated to match the average capital share of income in the United States


                                                  20
(the contribution of interest income to capital share is very small). The depreciation rate is set to
δ = 0.08.


Endowments We use the estimates of Storesletten et al. (2004) to specify the process of individual
shocks to the efficiency units of labor, but we adjust the parameter values to take into account that the
estimates of Storesletten et al. (2004) are for earnings, whereas our shocks are for labor productivity.
In particular, individual productivity i takes the following form:


      log i = log e + log p + log t,                                                                (25)


where the permanent shock e is drawn at birth from N(0, (ησe )2 ), and the transitory shock t is drawn
each period from N(0, (ησt )2 ). The persistent shock p follows the following AR(1) process:


      p 0 = ρp p + p    p ∼ N(0, (ησp|z )2 ),                                                     (26)


where η is an adjustment factor that adjusts the variance of all individual productivity shocks equally.
This adjustment is necessary because the estimates of Storesletten et al. (2004) are for earnings, and
in this model earnings are the product of the shocks and the choice of hours worked. We set this factor
so that the implied coefficient of variation of earnings matches its data counterpart. This adjustment
requires that we solve the model to determine its size. We come back to the determination of η in
Section 4.2. We set the standard deviation of the innovation for the AR(1) process, σp , to 0.13, the
average values reported by Storesletten et al. (2004).


In computing the model, we determine that the permanent shock to individual productivity e is approx-
imated by a two-state distribution using the method developed by Adda and Cooper (2003). Similarly,
the transitory shock t is approximated by a three-state distribution. As for the persistent shock p, we
apply the method of Tauchen (1986) with 15 grid points.




                                                    21
Bankruptcy Filings The parameter that regulates the length of the borrowing exclusion, λ = 0.10,
implies that a history of past bankruptcy filing remains on the credit history for 10 years on average.
This is consistent with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which prohibits keeping a record of past defaults
for more than 10 years. See Chatterjee et al. (2007) for a more detailed discussion about how to map
the legal environment of the United States to the model. The fraction of labor income that can be
garnished, ξ, is determined in the second stage of the calibration, which is described next in Section 4.2.


4.2.     Calibration of the Residual Parameters


The six parameters that are calibrated via solving a system of equations that require model moments
to satisfy certain targets are the discount rate, β, the share parameter of consumption, α, the value of
the impatient state, γ2 , its probability, Γγ2 , the adjustment factor for individual productivity shocks, η,
and the fraction of labor income that can be garnished, ξ, upon a bankruptcy filing. The targets and
parameter values are shown in panel B of Table 2, but they merit a discussion. We target a capital-
output ratio of 3.0 in the steady state. Although the wealth-to-output ratio can be argued to be slightly
higher, we are very interested in getting the wealth of the poor right. Consequently, if we obtain both
too little wealth as well as too few ultra-wealthy people, this seems to be a reasonable way to obtain
the right wealth holdings of the poor while still having a reasonable aggregate amount of capital.3 As
for the proportion of time spent working, we target one-third. We target the proportion of consumers
in debt in the steady state to be 8.4 percent, and the average amount of debt per debtor to be 20
percent of the average income. Both targets are obtained by using households with a head between
ages 20 and 65 in the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) in 2004. The proportion of consumers filing
for bankruptcy each year is 0.84 percent of the population (as computed by Livshits et al. (2007)). In
our attempts to target these moments with these parameters, γ2 was pushed toward (and beyond) its
natural limit of zero. Consequently, we set it to zero. Notice that the only relevant implication for
a consumer that has γ = γ2 = 0 is that it consumes as much as it can in the current period. With

this limit, we were close to obtaining the targets that we wanted. Finally, the adjustment factor for
individual productivity shocks η has a value of 0.75. This implies that the shocks to productivity are 75
percent of the measures of the shocks from Storesletten et al. (2004) if we want the endogenous choice
of hours to imply an earnings coefficient of variation of 81.5 percent.4 Table 3 shows the precision with
which we attain the targets.


Our estimates imply that ξ = 0.340. Considering that the federal garnishment limit for defaulters is 25
percent of income, and the garnishment parameter also includes the attempts by the debtors to repay
after deciding to default, we find ξ = 0.340 to be within the reasonable range. Our estimate for β
is 1.001. This estimate may seem large, but notice first that β has no real meaning independent of
the model, that there is early mortality (even though a perfect annuity market is available), and that
the effective β is actually the product of β and the probability of not being impatient (γ = γ1 ), which
yields 0.970 given that our estimate of Γγ2 is 0.031.


4.3.     Specification of Aggregate Shocks


We assume three states for aggregate productivity shocks. The three states correspond to expansion,
recession, and disaster. The latter allows us to explicitly consider sample paths in which an event like
the Great Recession occurs, and the other two states represent normal business cycles. We assume the
4
    We use the coefficient of variation instead of, for example, the cross-sectional variance of log earnings because some
    households in the model choose not to work, thereby making their earnings zero.

Seven parameters are to be determined: the four parameters above, plus the three values of the shock,
which we write as {1 + ν1 , 1 − ν2 , 1 − ν3 }. Our choices are to have a disaster that happens every
50 years on average (γ3z = 0.02). We also normalize the values of the shock by setting ν1 = ν2 .
We also want a disaster that is twice as bad as a normal recession, ν3 = 2ν2 . We set the average
duration of normal expansions and recessions, conditional on a disaster not occurring, to be three
        z      z
years (γ1,1 = γ2,2 = 2/3).5 We assume the average duration of a disaster to be one-and-a-half years
  z
(γ3,3 = 1/3). The final parameter, ν1 = 0.013, is calibrated such that the standard deviation of H-P
filtered log output in the model matches the empirical counterpart, which is 1.2 percent. We employ
the model with occasional disasters as our baseline, and in Section 7.2, we discuss briefly whether
modeling disasters matters for cyclical properties of the model (it does not).


With respect to the countercyclical earnings risk, Storesletten et al. (2004) obtain that the standard
deviation of the individual earnings shock is 0.088 in expansions, whereas it is 0.162 in recessions. On
the other hand, the skewness of one year log earnings growth calculated by Guvenen et al. (2012)
has an average over the 1979-2010 period of -0.31, with a standard deviation of 19.5 percent, and a
correlation with output of 0.63. To implement these features, we set in our economy σp|z = η 0.088 in
expansions (z = 1) and σp|z = η 0.162 in recessions (z = 2) and disasters (z = 3). Notice that we use
the same adjustment factor η already calibrated. This choice yields the same properties reported by
Storesletten et al. (2004). With respect to the skewness, we obtain a much lower average (-0.05) and
standard deviation (1.2%) than Guvenen et al. (2012). We replicate, however, its cyclical behavior,
obtaining a very large correlation of skewness and output (0.89).
5
    Whether we include the term (1 − γ3z ) or not does not matter, since σ3z is tiny.

5.      Computation


We solve the model numerically, since there is no analytical solution. In particular, our solution method
is based on the approximate aggregation approach developed by Krusell and Smith Jr. (1997) and
Krusell and Smith Jr. (1998). Our computational requirements are more involved than theirs. In their
1997 paper, the computation of equilibrium requires the determination of factor prices or the risk-free
interest rate, which requires the joint determination of a price and quantity (either labor and wages,
or bond holdings and the risk-free interest rate) and the forecast of capital. In our model, we not only
have to forecast capital and jointly determine wages and the quantity of labor, but we also have to
forecast the prices of discount bonds for all types of borrowers and all sizes of debt.


In the same spirit as Krusell and Smith Jr. (1997), we pose agents with bounded rationality in the size of
the state space, taking advantage of the approximate aggregation feature of this type of environment.
Specifically, we assume that agents summarize the aggregate state of the economy by the aggregate
productivity shock, capital stock, and average individual labor productivity (necessary because of the
countercyclical variance of individual productivity) (z, K , S), instead of using the proper state space
(z, K , m). Unlike Krusell and Smith Jr. (1997), in our model, agents use forecasted rather than actual
factor prices and risk-free interest rates, as has recently become the norm (e.g., Krusell, Mukoyama,
and Şahin (2010) or Krusell, Mukoyama, Rogerson, and Şahin (2012)). As long as the rate of return of
the mutual fund, r , and aggregate capital stock in the next period, K 0 , are well forecasted by (z, K , S),
and average individual labor productivity in the next period, S 0 , is well forecasted by (z, z 0 , K , S),
this drawback is not a serious one.6 We will show that (z, K , S) or (z, z 0 , K , S) has sufficiently high
predictive power over the important variables to be forecasted. The details are in Appendix A.
6
    Notice that in the case of our baseline model with countercyclical variance of individual productivity, it is necessary
    that the next period TFP shock z 0 be known to forecast average individual labor productivity in the next period S 0 ,
    because the distribution of individual productivity in the next period depends on the realization of the TFP shock in
    the following period, z 0 .

6.     Result: Business Cycle Properties


Table 4 displays the main findings of our analysis. The top panel shows the aggregate statistics. Our
choice of the size of the productivity shock was to match output volatility, so we do so. This is
accomplished by having a larger variance of the shock than that of the Solow residual of the U.S.
economy and a large Frisch elasticity of labor (an implication of Cobb-Douglas preferences). The
aggregates agree with the data in the main features: Both consumption and investment are strongly
correlated with output, and the latter is a few times more volatile than the former.


6.1.   Cyclical Properties of Credit and Bankruptcy


The bottom panel of Table 4 shows the cyclical properties of credit and bankruptcy. Credit is highly
procyclical, even more than it is in the data. Recall our statement that this behavior may be counter-
intuitive: An expansion is characterized by more credit, so credit is not used mostly to accommodate
temporary bad times, as intuition may tell us. Credit is also quite volatile — more so than output, yet
not as much as in the data. Bankruptcy filings are extremely volatile, as they are in the data. They
are also countercyclical, even more than they are in the data.

The procyclicality of credit in the model deserves further study, since it goes against the intuition that
it is during times of distress, which are more prevalent during recessions, when households use credit
to smooth their consumption. The key to the explanation is in Table 5. Although the rate of return
on savings (the mutual fund rate, first row) is perfectly procyclical and highly volatile, the average
interest rate charged on loans (fourth row) is only slightly procyclical and even more volatile. This
result arises from the extreme volatility and weak cyclicality of the loan premium (the last two rows):
During recessions, lenders raise the default premium, and thus the interest rate of loans relative to
capital, because they expect defaults to be higher. When the interest rate of loans is higher during
recessions, households borrow less, which offsets the rise in the average loan rate during recessions.
This is why the average loan rate turns out to be relatively acyclical.


The second and third rows of Table 5 show that loans play a very small role in the performance of
the mutual fund. For the mutual fund, what matters is the return on physical capital (in our baseline
model, aggregate capital stock is 300 percent of output on average, and the total amount of debt is
1.3 percent). Moreover, the correlation between both components of the mutual fund is almost one,
thereby easing any concern that the mutual fund may allocate its funds differently in search of some
form of insurance.


We want to reemphasize at this point that we should think of lenders in this economy as banks with


                                                       27
100 percent reserves, since not only do poorly performing loans have low volatility, but also any possible
losses are absorbed by the mutual fund without reducing the capacity to make additional loans.


At this point, we have answered the first question addressed in this paper. The standard theory of
unsecured credit aligns with the cyclical behavior of credit and bankruptcy in the U.S. data. We will
see in Section 7.1 how the cyclicality of the variance of earnings qualifies this answer.


Still, even though the model economy has the right properties of credit and bankruptcies relative to
the data and the right volatility of bankruptcy filings, the volatility of credit is only about one-third
that of the U.S. data. Moreover, although the correlations in the model have the right sign relative to
the data, they are too large. One possible explanation for this disparity is that the credit variable in
the data is gross revolving consumer credit, whereas in the model we use negative net asset positions,
which are not exactly the same. Another clear possibility is that additional shocks may affect the credit
channel directly.


6.2.     The Contribution of Access to Credit to Business Cycle Fluctuations


We now turn to answering the second question addressed in this paper: Does access to credit contribute
to fluctuations in the business cycle? We pose the question by comparing the business cycle properties
of the baseline economy in which households have access to unsecured credit that is characteristic of
that in the U.S. economy (i.e., borrowers have the right to file for bankruptcy unilaterally — a right
that many people exercise) with the properties of otherwise identical economies in which households
either do not have access to credit or do have access to credit but without the possibility of filing
for bankruptcy.7 Notice that we use the same shocks that generate aggregate fluctuations. Table 6
displays the findings.


As Table 6 shows, the volatility of output is highly similar across all economies. The economy with
7
    Table A3 in the appendix reports the steady-state properties of these economies.

access to credit and bankruptcy is slightly more volatile, due to the slightly higher volatility of hours.
The volatility of the different components of output varies more across economies. In the baseline
economy (the one in which households have access to credit and can file for bankruptcy), consumption
is much more volatile — about 15-20 percent more volatile — than in the other two economies. As a
consequence, investment is less volatile. The economy in which households have access to credit but
no possibility of filing bankruptcy has less volatile consumption — not only less volatile than that in
the baseline, but also less volatile than in the economy with no access to credit.


The rest of the cyclical properties are almost identical between the economies in which households
have no possibility of defaulting. As is evident, the intuition that access to credit helps households to
smooth their consumption in times of financial distress is applicable only when there is no possibility of
defaulting and hence no interest rate premium when borrowing. But even in this case, the differences
between that economy and the economy with no access to credit are small.


We conclude that the combination of access to credit and the possibility of filing for bankruptcy makes
consumption more, not less, volatile, and that the role of the interest rate premium is fundamental in
shaping the cyclical properties of credit.

7.      Analysis of Nonstandard Features


Besides credit and bankruptcy, our baseline model economy has two relatively nonstandard features.
One feature is the countercyclical earnings variance documented by Storesletten et al. (2004). The
other feature is the explicit distinction between large and small recessions, which allows us to analyze
the impact of the Great Recession.


7.1.     No Countercyclical Earnings Variance


To explore its importance, we have recalibrated the baseline to eliminate the dependence of the variance
of the idiosyncratic risk on the aggregate state of the economy.8 The most important change is a higher
variance of the process for the aggregate shock, which is orchestrated in order to achieve the same
volatility of output in the version of the economy with access to credit and the possibility of filing
for bankruptcy. Table 7 displays the properties of the three versions of this economy that differ with
respect to the type of credit available.
8
    Tables A3 and A4 in the appendix show the details of how the economies are recalibrated.




                                                          30
Without the countercyclical earnings variance, the details of the credit markets matter less. Still, access
to credit and bankruptcy yields a higher variance of consumption than the other two types of credit
arrangements, but only about 2 and 10 percent more, respectively.


In comparing the baseline economy with access to credit and bankruptcy and a countercyclical variance
of earnings with the economy with the same credit arrangements but no countercyclical variance of
earnings, we see some important differences. In the baseline economy, credit is highly volatile and
procyclical, as it is in the U.S. data. In the economy with no countercyclical variance of earnings,
however, credit is countercyclical and slightly less volatile than output. This difference is, in part, the
result of the lower loan premium arising from fewer bankruptcies in the economy without a counter-
cyclical earnings variance. We believe that this feature, along with the slightly higher volatility of hours
displayed in the baseline economy, points to the need for modeling recessions not as situations in which
all households fare slightly worse than normal, but as situations in which more households than normal
fare very poorly.


The answer to our second question, however, is not affected by the details of how we model aggregate
fluctuations. In all cases, access to credit and default that is characteristic of the U.S. economy increases
the volatility of consumption and hours, although the role of that access is more important in a credit
arrangement with countercyclical earnings variance.


We have also explored the robustness of these findings to recalibrating the various model economies
when we change the extent of access to credit to ensure that total wealth is the same. We conduct this
exercise because different forms of access to credit imply different amounts of precautionary savings in
the economy. Table A5 in the appendix shows the business cycle properties of versions of the baseline
economy with no credit and with credit but no option of default, calibrated to have the same aggregate
capital as in the baseline model economy. The cyclical properties of these economies are identical to
those in Table 6. Whether to recalibrate the discount factor (β) so that the model economies have the
same amount of capital does not matter in terms of business cycle properties.


                                                     31
7.2.   Credit, Default, and Great Recessions


To see whether our assumption of having one state in which the recession is larger than usual makes
any difference to our findings, we compared two versions of the model economy. In the first, there are
two types of recessions (large and small — the baseline economy). In the second, all recessions are of
the same (normal) type. The quantitative properties of these two economies are found to be virtually
identical. Figure 1 shows the sample paths of the two economies: In one, large recessions or disasters
occur in 1929, 1930, and 2008 (left panels); in the other economy, the recessions at these dates are of
normal size (right panels).


The two economies have very similar paths for all variables except for output, which is exogenously set
to differ at those dates. Remember that, in the model with disasters, TFP in disasters declines twice as
much as in normal recessions. The amounts of loans and the number of bankruptcies are very similar
in both economies. We conclude that the efforts to model a situation resembling the Great Recession
do not change the answers that we obtain — at least to the extent that disasters are simply large
reductions in average productivity and do not further increase (beyond the fraction typical in a normal
recession) the fraction of households that are faring very poorly.



8.     Conclusion


We have explored how access to credit affects the nature of business cycles, and we have asked two
questions. First, does the standard theory of unsecured credit account for the high volatility and
procyclicality of credit as well as the high volatility and countercyclicality of bankruptcy filings found in
U.S. data? We find that it does, but only if we explicitly model recessions as displaying countercyclical
earnings variance. That is, rather than having all households fare slightly worse than normal during
recessions, we ensure that more households than normal fare very poorly. The second question asks
whether explicitly modeling access to credit smooths aggregate consumption or aggregate hours worked.

We have found that it does not. The crucial mechanism at work here is that the interest premium in
recessions increases because the high risk of bankruptcy discourages households from using credit in



                                                                33
these situations. This finding contradicts the intuition that access to credit helps households to smooth
their consumption. Such intuition is valid only in environments that do not include the right to default
— a right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.


Some questions remain. The volatility of credit in our model economies is still lower than in the data,
pointing to the possibility that credit availability may itself be a source of business cycle fluctuations.
In addition, bankruptcy filings are too procyclical, indicating that we have yet to understand some of
the subtleties involved in these economies.

A.     Computation Appendix

This section provides an overview of the algorithm that solves the baseline model with countercyclical
variance of individual productivity. As we discussed in Section 5, we assume that (z, K , S) rather
than (z, K , m) is the set of aggregate state variables. We first define the approximate equilibrium with
(z, K , S) as the state variables. We then describe the solution algorithm of the approximate equilibrium.
At the end of this section, we argue that future aggregate state variables are precisely forecasted by
(z, K , S) or (z, z 0 , K , S), which justifies the use of approximation.

A.1.    Definition of Approximate Equilibrium

Definition 2 An approximate recursive equilibrium is a value function, V (z, K , S, x, h, a), associated
decision rules, g c (z, K , S, x, h, a), g a (z, K , S, x, h, a), g ` (z, K , S, x, h, a), and g h (z, K , S, x, a), pricing
functions, rK (z, K , L, S), w (z, K , L, S), and q(z, K , S, x, a0 ), and forecasting functions, φr (z, K , S),
φL (z, K , S), φK (z, K , S), and φS (z, z 0 , K , S), such that


   1. Household optimization. Given pricing functions and forecasting functions, V (z, K , S, x, h, a)
      is a solution of the household’s optimization problem, and g c (z, K , S, x, h, a), g a (z, K , S, x, h, a),
      g ` (z, K , S, x, h, a), and g h (z, K , S, x, a) are associated decision rules.

   2. Forecasted aggregate labor. Aggregate labor in efficiency units, which is computed by condi-
      tion (19), is forecasted by φL (z, K , S).

   3. Expected zero profit condition for unsecured credit industry. Given pricing and forecasting
      functions, q(z, K , S, x, a0 ) satisfies the expected zero profit condition (16).

   4. Competitive factor prices. rK (z, K , L, S) and w (z, K , L, S) satisfy (23) and (18), respectively.

   5. Forecasted mutual fund return. The rate of return on mutual funds, which is computed by
      (22), is forecasted by φr (z, K , S).

   6. Consistency/market clearing. Average individual labor productivity in the next period is fore-
      casted by φS (z, z 0 , K , S). Aggregate capital in the next period, which is computed by condition
      (21), is forecasted by φK (z, K , S).




                                                            36
A.2.     Computation Algorithm

We specify the forecasting functions in the following log-linear functional form:

        log K 0 = log φK (z, K , S) = φ0K ,z log K + φ1K ,z log S,                                                                (A1)
        log L = log φL (z, K , S) = φ0L,z log K + φ1L,z log S,                                                                    (A2)
        log r = log φr (z, K , S) = φ0r ,z log K + φ1r ,z log S,                                                                  (A3)
        log S 0 (z 0 ) = log φS (z, z 0 , K , S) = φ0S,z,z 0 log K + φ1S,z 0 ,z 0   log S.                                        (A4)

Notice that average labor productivity in the next period, S 0 , depends on the current aggregate state
(z, K , S) and on the realization of the TFP shock in the next period z 0 . We are looking for parameters
Φ = {φ0K ,z , φ1K ,z , φ0L,z , φ1L,z , φ0r ,z , φ1r ,z , φ0S,z,z 0 , φ1S,z,z 0 } for ∀z, z 0 that satisfy condition (6) of the definition
of approximate equilibrium.

Algorithm 1 (Solution Algorithm for the Approximate Recursive Equilibrium)
  1. Guess parameters of forecasting functions Φ0 . The initial guess can be obtained by running the
     complete market version of the model and running regressions with simulated data. With Φ0 ,
     (K 0 , L, r , S 0 (z 0 )) can be forecasted. Furthermore, using forecasted L, wage w can be computed
     using marginal conditions.

   2. Guess the bond price function q 0 (z, K , S, x, a0 ).

   3. Guess the value function V 0 (z, K , S, x, h, a).

   4. Using the Bellman equations described in Section 3.7, obtain the updated value function
      V 1 (z, K , S, x, h, a).

   5. Check convergence of the value function. If the distance between V 0 (z, K , S, x, h, a) and
      V 1 (z, K , S, x, h, a) is smaller than a predetermined tolerance criterion, convergence is achieved.
      Go to the next step. Otherwise, update the value function using
      V 1 (z, K , S, x, h, a) = V 1 (z, K , S, x, h, a) and go back to step 3.

   6. Record the optimal decision rules g c (z, K , S, x, h, a), g a (z, K , S, x, h, a), g ` (z, K , S, x, h, a), and
      g h (z, K , S, x, a) associated with the converged value function.

   7. Using the optimal decision rules obtained in the previous step and equation (16), compute the
      updated bond price function q 1 (z, K , S, x, a0 ).

   8. Check convergence of the bond price function. If the distance between q 0 (z, K , S, x, a0 ) and
      q 1 (z, K , S, x, a0 ) is smaller than a predetermined tolerance criterion, convergence is achieved. Go
      to the next step. Otherwise, update the bond price function using the following formula (where
      ψq controls the speed of updating) and go back to step 2.

                q 0,new (z, K , S, x, a0 ) = (1 − ψq ) q 0,old (z, K , S, x, a0 ) + ψq q 1 (z, K , S, x, a0 ).



                                                                  37
   9. Simulate the model for N0 + N1 periods. Simulating the model gives the sequence of aggregate
      variables {zt , Kt , St (z 0 ), Lt , rt }Nt=1
                                                 0 +N1
                                                       .

       (a) Use the type distribution in the steady state as the type distribution in period 1.
       (b) At the beginning of each period, (z, K , S) are known. The type distribution of households,
                                                                   e 0, e
           m, is also available. Using the forecasting functions, (K            e 0 (z 0 )) are forecasted.
                                                                        L, er , S
       (c) Wage w can be computed using (z, K , e   L).
       (d) Furthermore, by solving the optimization problem of households in the next period, condi-
           tional on z 0 , the exact bond prices q(x, a0 ) in the current period can be computed.
       (e) Solve the household’s optimization problem to obtain optimal decision rules.
       (f) Using the type distribution of households and optimal decision rules, true (K 0 , L, r , S 0 (z 0 ))
           can be computed. The updated distribution m0 can also be computed.
       (g) Once z 0 is drawn, the next period aggregate state (z 0 , K 0 , S 0 ) is obtained.

 10. Using the sequence of aggregate variables {zt , Kt , St (z 0 ), Lt , rt }N
                                                                              t=N0 +1 , update the forecasting
                                                                                1


     function. Notice that the first N0 periods are dropped. Use ordinary least squares (OLS) regres-
     sion. Regressions then give updated parameters of forecasting functions Φ1 .

 11. Check convergence of the forecasting functions. If the distance between Φ0 and Φ1 is smaller than
     a predetermined tolerance criterion, an approximate recursive equilibrium is obtained. Otherwise,
     update the forecasting functions using the following formula (where ψφ controls the speed of
     updating) and go back to step 1.

            Φ0,new = (1 − ψφ ) Φ0,old + ψφ Φ1 .


A.3.   Predictive Power of Forecasting Functions

Table A1 summarizes the predictive power of the forecasting function in the baseline model economy
with countercyclical variance of individual labor productivity represented by the adjusted R 2 . We make
three remarks. First, perhaps not surprisingly, the adjusted R 2 is extremely high for S 0 . Even though
the distribution of individual productivity is exogenous, there is a loss in predictive power by not keeping
track of the exact type distribution. Second, the adjusted R 2 for L and r when a disaster state z = z3
hits the economy is slightly lower than in the other aggregate states, because a disaster shock affects
the type distribution of households in a relatively significant manner. Third, our assessment of the
performance of the forecasting functions is more than satisfactory for our purposes.

Table A3 compares the steady-state statistics of the baseline model, the model without credit, the model
without bankruptcy (but with credit), and the model without countercyclical earnings risk. Cyclical
properties of the first three models are compared in Table 6. In the model without credit, all the
parameters are the same as in the baseline model economy with the borrowing constraint, which is now
exogenous, set to zero. In the model without bankruptcy, again, all the parameters are the same as in
the baseline model economy. The exogenous borrowing constraint is set such that the total amount of
debt is twice as large as in the baseline model economy.

Table A4 compares the parameters of the baseline model economy and those of the model economy
without countercyclical variance of individual earnings. Since the two model economies are the same in
the steady state, the parameters calibrated using the steady-state version of the model (top panel of the
table) are the same. The only difference is the size of the TFP shock. In the model economy without
countercyclical earnings variance, the size of the TFP shock is recalibrated so that the standard deviation
of log detrended output is 1.2 percent, which is its empirical value. Since the average individual labor
productivity in the baseline model moves countercyclically, the size of the TFP shock is smaller without

bankruptcy, in order to keep the total amount of savings the same across different models. In Section 6,
we keep the value of β and thus do not control the total amount of savings in the alternative model
economies. By comparing Table A5 and Table 6, it is easy to see that recalibrating β is not important
in shaping the cyclical properties of the model.

Table A6 is the expanded version of Table 6. The table also compares the cyclical properties of the
baseline model economy with the alternative model economies without credit and without bankruptcy,
but it contains more variables than Table 6.
