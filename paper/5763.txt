                              THE WAGES AND LANGUAGE SKILLS
                                    OF U.S. IMMIGRANTS

                                               ABSTRACT

        This paper finds that immigrants on average earned about 50 cents an hour less than native-

born Americans in 1989. Immigrants from some regions earned considerably more than natives,

while others, especially from Mexico, earned much less. This paper also finds that when immigrants

first arrive in the U.S. they earn significantly less than native workers, but they close the gap by

about 0.8 percentage points with each added year of residence.     As a result, the wage of the typical

immigrant    who arrived in the 1950s and 1960s eventually surpassed the average native wage.

Improvements in English language skills contributed 6 to 18 percent of this narrowing, depending

on sex and education level. The remainder came from unmeasured sources of assimilation.

        However,    since the 1950s and 1960s the wage gap between natives and newly arrived

immigrants has widened by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points annually.      Because they start with a larger

disadvantage,   the average wage of more recent immigrants may never exceed the average native

wage. A decline in the average education of newly arrived immigrants accounts for 4 to 23 percent

of the starting wage gap, and shifts in the source countries of new immigrants from Europe to Latin

America and Asia accomt for 73 to 95 percent. Changes in English skills and in other factors have

played little role in this relative decline.

        This analysis also finds a significant return to English skills.    Even afier controlling   for

education, region of origin, and years of U.S. residence, workers are rewarded for speaking English

well. Differences between each of the five English skill categories reported in the Census data are

about the same as the return to an additional year of schooling.

           THE WAGES AND LANGUAGE SKILLS OF U.S. IMMIGRANTS

                                       Geoffrey     Carliner

I. Introduction

       Recent public discussion of the role of English in the U.S. has called attention to the

language skills of immigrants.   This paper e *S        how the wages of immigrant workers

relative to U.S. natives have changed since the 1950s. I estimate how improvements in the

English skills of immigrants have contributed to the catching up (assimilation) that ~

with increased residence in the U.S. I also estimate the trend in the relative wages of newly

mived immigrants (cohort eff~t) and the contribution of changes in country of origin,

education, and other tigrant     characteristics to this frend.

       A large literature, smeyed   by Borjas (1994), uses data fim    two or more cross

section samples to estimate the relative -gs        of native-born and immigrant workers. This

literature finds that when immigrants fit   tive,   they earn less than native U.S. workers, but

immigrants reduce this earnings gap with increased U.S. residence and often overtake native

workers. However, the relative earnings of new cohorts of immigrants have been falling over

time, partly because the average skills of new immigrants have declined relative to natives’

skills (a moving target) and partly because the relative wages of less skilled workers, native

or immigran~ have fallen since the 1970s.

       Another literature has used single cross section samples to estimate the effect of

language skills on immigrants’ earnings. Much of this research has fwussed on Hispanic men

in the U.S., but other immigrant groups and other measures of labor market perfo~ce         have

also received attention. McManus, Godd, and Welch (1983), Grenier (1984), Tainer (1988),

Kossoudji (1988), McManus (1990), Rivers-Batiz (1990), (1991), (1992), Chiswick (1991),
                                                  2

Bloom and Grenier (1992), Chiswick and Miller (1992), Daneshavry et al (1992), and

Chiswick (1993) all report that immigrants receive substantial returns for their English

language skills, both before and tier holding other c~stics            constant. Although point

estimates vary by sample, measures of language skills, and other aspects of specificatio~ all

these studies find significant returns to English skills.

        Other studies report similar re~ts    for other ~iving    wuntries.    Carliner (1981),

Chiswick and Miller (1988), Bloom and Grenier (1992), and Chiswick and Miller (1992) find

that immigrants to Canada earn a significant wage premium for speaking English or French.

Chapman and Iredale (1993) and Chiswick md Miller (1995) for Adia                and ~

(1994) for Gemany find that immigrants receive substantial returns to speaking or writing the

dominant language of those countries.

        None of these studies examines changes in immigrants’ language skills in a way that

distinguishes between changes in the skills of newly tived       immigrants (mhort changes) and

changes that occur with increased residence in the host mun~        (assimilation).   They also do

not estimate the contribution of these two types of changes in language skills to earnings

differences between bigrants       and natives. This paper extends the research on mhort and

assimilation   effects pioneered by Borjas (1985) to include the attribution     of language skills,

using pooled data from the 1980 and 1990 U.S. Censuses of Popdation.

        The next section presents a tiework       for anal-g     assimilation and cohort eff~ts on

the relative wages of immigrants.    The third section describes the data used in the estimation

and presents descriptive information on the wages, English skills, and education of immigrants

by region of origin. The foti      section discusses the resdts of wage regressions, while the

    eff~.      A mnclusion surnrnfis     the -s      fidings.



    II. Measuring Assimilation

              Immigrants typically arrive in the U.S. with less human capital than natives, and when

    they ti     enter the U.S. labor market they ~ive       lower wages. On average, immigrants have

    slightly less schooling than native workers. They edso know less about American customs

    and work practices when they tive.       ~eir   English skills are generally weaker, and they do

    not have as wide a network of friends and relatives to learn of job openings.

              With increased residence in the U.S., immigrants dly       improve these tiormal    types

    of human capital. They acquire ~ter        knowledge of U.S. labor market practices, and ofien

    invest time and effort in learning better English. As a resd~ additional experience has a

    greater effect on immigrants’ wages than on natives’ wages, and the gap between them

    narrows. Whether immigrants eventually overtake natives is a question of some dispute. In

    any case, the freer growth in wages for immigrants than for natives is a measure of

    assimilation.

              Over calendar time, other fxtors also W@ the relative wages of immigrants and

‘   natives. The human capital of newly arrived immigrants may change, including average

    educatio~ English language skills, the distribution of source counties, and other

    characteristics.   Changes in U.S. immigration law, especially in the 1%0s, and political aud

    economic changes in many countries around the world have resulted in large shifi in the

    home countries of immi~ts        over the past 30 y-.       Shifts in labor demand may also raise
                                               4

or lower average wages for all workers over time. Improvements      intechnology,   and increases

in physical and human capital have historically raised wages over long periods, though

perhaps not in the recent past.

       Equation (1) captures this story.


       (1)   wit= a. +a111+a2YSMit+a3                 mi+a4Expit+a5Z’               +eit

In this simple model, Wtiis the log of the hourly wage of the ith individual in year t. I is a

dummy variable equal to 1 for immigrants and m       for natives, and a, is the wage

differential between mtives and new immigrants.     YSM is the nmber     of years since en~    for

an immigrant in year t and zero for natives. YRM is the year of arrival for immigrants and

zero for natives. Exp is the standard measure of experience, equal to an individurd’s age in

year t minus years of education minus 6. T reflects labor market wnditions in year g as well

as changes over time in the average education and other skills of native workers. In this

model, az is the rate of assimilation, and as captures the simple trend in the human capital of

newly arrived immigrants.   The number of years required for irn.migrants who arrived in year

m to catch up with natives is

(-al - a~ m)faz.

       Not all researchers have used this model to _te       assimilation and mhort effmts.

Early studies, for example Chiswick (1978) and Carliner (1980), relied on cross section da~

inwhich   YRM and YSM were not separately identifi~       sinw YSM = T - YRM and T is the

same for all obsemations.   Because of data availability, most studies of the wage effwts of

language skills have also used one cross section. These studies implicitly assumed     that cohort


effects are zero, which may have been reasonable for immigrant flows from World War 11
                                                 5

until 1970 but does not seem to be true for flows since then. Fortunately, it is now possible

to pool cross sectional data sets. This allows identification of both assimilation and mhort

eff=ts.

          Equation (1) is designed to measure how much entering immigrants earn relative to

natives, not how much they earn relative to natives with similar c~stics.             Therefore it

does not include measures of their human capital, including their education and coun@ of

origin. If the average schooling of new immigrants fell sharply over calendar time, their

wages relative to natives’ would fall, and the mmlber of years of residence required for

catching up with natives would rise. But the estima~ of UJ in an equation which included

education or other personal characteristics would not reflect changes in the human capital of

new immigrants, and therefore such variables are not included in equation (1). A measure of

experience must be included in the equatio~ however, since the cohofi of immigrants who

an-ived in year t is aging but the stock of natives is not. Failing to mntrol for experience

would attribute all the wage growth of immigrants to assimilation and none to the normal

process of wage growth over the life cycle.

          Equation (1) will answer the question of how fast assimilation wurs     and whether

immigrant quality is changing over time, but additional equations are tied         to estimate the

contribution of increasing English language skills and other c~stics            to this process.

“Equation (2) is a standard wage equation that includes English skills (Lang) and other

personal characteristics such as education ~    as well as the independent variables in equation

(l).
                                                 6




The Ml assimilation effw is then the total derivative of w with respect to YSM.

Similarly for the fi,dl cohort effwt,




         The remaining partial derivatives in equations (3) and (4) can be estimated in

re~essions of language skills and other characteristics on YSM and YRM, similar to equation

(1) but including ody immigrants.

                                                  7

Equation (2) estimates mhort (~~) and assimilation (@l) cff’          on wages, holding wnstant

individuals’ English language skills and other ob~ed           human capiti ~.    These partial wage

effa   wodd not reflect either a dramaticdecline       inthe    ability of new immigrants to speak

English or large improvements in English skills with residence. Equations (5) and (6)

estimate
      whort     (L2) and assimilation (k]) eff~       on language ability and on other

titiStiCS      (y2 and y,).

       Equation (5) includes a m~        of the age at arrival (Agem) because immigrants who

arrived in the U.S. many years ago and are still in the sample arrived at younger ages on

average than more recent immigrants in the sample.’ Since age at tival           has a large effect on

English language skills, it must be included in equation (5) so that mhort and assimilation

effects will not & misestimated because the sample is censored by cmt             age.

       The Ml assimilation effect on wages is therefore ~z + ~~ai + ~byl and the share of

wage assimilation   due to the improvement in language skills that ames with increased

residence in the U.S. is simply   ~~ Al / (PZ + ~~ Al+ ~byl).        Similarly, the cohort eff~   on

wages can be separated into the portion that wines fim          changing English skills of new

immigrants ( ~~ Az),the portion that comes from changes in other measurable characteristics is



labor market skills of new immigrants (~,).




         1 Age at arrival (Agem) plus years since arrival (YSM) equals current age. People
over M are excluded bm the sample. Therefore Agem+YSM(65. If YSM is large, Agem
must be small. Because of retiremen~ dea~ and return migratio~ even if there were no age
restriction on the sample it wodd be censored by current age.

III. Data

       The data used to estimate these equations come firn the 1980 and 1990 Census of

Popdation.     Individuals were included in the regressions if they were between 18 and 64

years old, worked at least 40 weeks during the year -g            the _       and usually worked

positive hours each week. The wage rate was calhted         as inmme earned during the

preceding year, in 1989 dollars, divided by weeks worked last year times usual hours worked

per week. Individuals whose wage in 1989 dollars was less than $1.50 per hour were

excluded tim     the sample.

       Census data include the in-al     in which immigrants entered the U.S. but not the

exact year. The midpoints of these internals were used to define a wntinuous measure of

YRM, set equal to zero for the earliest immigrants in the sample. YSM was defined as the

Census year of the obsemation minus the midpoint of the intexval, and Agem was defined as

age in the Census year minus YSM. Immigrants who arrived before 1950 were dropped fim

the sample, since YRM, YSM, and Agem add            not be measured with any precision for this

open ended category.

       The 1980 and 1990 Censuses (but not earlier Censuses) asked respondents if they

spoke English only, very well, well, not well, or not at dl.   I used this Wormation to create a

mntinuous measure of English skills similar to a grade point average, with 4 for speaking

only English and O for speaking no English.    1 also defined dummy variables for seven region

of origin categories: English speaking muntries, Mex.iw, other western hemisphere, Europe,

Africa and the Middle ~        South %i~ and East Asia All wuntries fim        which at least half

the immigrants in the 1990 Census reported speaking oxdy English were classified as English
                                                   9

speaking. This category included C-          B~@          Jarnai~     hguill~     hti~     Aru~

Bahamas, Barbados, Cayman Islands, ~               Men_         St. Barts, St. Kitts, St. Luciz St.

VincenG Trini~      Turks and Caiws, Be&,      -           United Kingdom hlant           Gibraltar,

Liberia Zimbabwe, South A6i~        Australi~ and New Zealand. Guntries             of the former

Soviet Union were included with continental European muntries. The Middle East was

dew     to extend tim    Turkey to Iran. South Asia includes all countries tim           M@stan        to

Bangladesh. East Asia includes C-          Burma (Myanmar) and countries ~                  into the

Pacific Ocean. A classification based on country of origin is necessary in the absence of

Mormation on mother tongue in the Census data          Utio~tely,          it resdts in the anomaly

that a small number of tigrants      tim   English speaking wuntries (Canada) do not speak

English and other immigrants from nonEnglish speaking wuntries (India) were raised

speaking only English.

       Much remnt discussion in the popular press suggests that immigrants tier              a large

wage disadvantage in the U.S. In fu~ the wage diff~nce              for tiltime   male workers in 1989

was od y 54 cents. AS Table 1 shows, many immigrant groups earn more money and are

better educated than titives.   Only immigrants bm      Latin America and East Asia ~ve lower

average wages than natives, and only Latin American and European immi~ts                  have less

education. Indee& South Asians, the highest @orming           immigrant group, have on average

2.2 years more schooling and earn M.75 more per hour than native workers. Furthermore;

most working immigrants have strong English skills. Less than 10 percent of Europeans,

Aticans and Middle Easterners, and South Aians speak English not well or not at d.                  Only

among Latin Americans, especially Mexicans, is there a substantial percentage who do not
                                                   10
speak English well.



IV. Cohort ●nd Assimilation Effects

       To estimate cohofi and assimilation eff~ts on the wage gap &een              immigrants and

natives, I estimated a version of equation (1). The dependent variable was the log of the

hourly wage. The independent variables included YRM, YSM and YSM _                        Experience

and Experience squared, and dummy variables for immigrants and for obations                firn the

1990 census.

       Equation (1) implicitly assumes that shifts in labor demand over time tiect

immigrants and natives similarly. For the decade of the 1980s, this is probably not true.

Katz and Murphy (1992), Levy and Murnane (1992), and others have documented the shifi in

labor demand in favor of highly skilled workers. Since immigrants are less skilled than

mtives, their wages have stimed        more during the 1980s tim    the shifi in labor demand.

Constraining period effects to be the same for immigrants and natives will therefore yield

underestimates of assimilation.    h    alternative is to allow as, the coefficient on the year of

the observation, to vary by education category. To the extent that immigrants and natives

with the same education compete in the same labor markets, this approach will control for the

increased wage inequality bemeen 1980 aud 1990. If immigrants are less skilled than natives

with the same educatio~ this approach will still underestimate assimilatio~ though by less

than constraining period effm     to be equal for all workers.

       The disadvantage of estimating period eff-         _ly        by skill level is that it

mntrols for changes over tie      in the distribution of immigrants among education categories.
                                               11

Thus any change in the percentage of irnmigranu who were, for example, high school

graduates, would not be measured as a change in quality, though ,changes in average

education within each category wodd still be reflected in ~          of a3.

       Table 2 presents ~ “       of coefficients and ~         errors fim    log wage

regressions for all men and all wome~ and _ly          for workers with and without schooling

beyond high school. For both sexes and education groups, the dts        indicate that natives

earn significantly higher wages than new irnrnigrants. Natives’ advantage is mnsiderably

larger over less educated immigrants of both sexes than over immigrants with postsecondary

schooling. For men, the gap between natives md new immigrants is about 11 percent for

workers with more than high school and 15 percent for high school or less. For women the

differences are 10 peunt   and 18 percent for the two education groups.

       The resdts also indicate a trend increase in the wage gap keen         natives and new

immigrants of about 0.2 percentage points per Aendar      year for women aud for men with

postsecondary schooling and an annual decline of 0.6 percentage points for men with high

school or less. During the 25 years between the change in immigration laws in the 1960s and

the 1990 Census, the wage gap for such men widened by 15 percen~e            points. On the other

hand, immigrants’ wages grow more rapidly with experience than the wages of natives. Each

additional year of residence in the U.S. increases immigrants’ wages relative to natives’ by
                                                                                                ..   .
about 0.8 percentage points. This rate of catching up is slightly larger for women than for”

men and more concave for the well eduti        but surprisingly similar across sex and
                                                  12

education categories.2

         Table 2 also presents coefficients tim   regressions including all men ~d ~1 women.

These estimates assume, implausibly, that shim in labor demand during the 1980s aff~ted the

wages of immigrants and natives similarly. Compared with the regressions by education

category, they show a smaller wage decline during the decade for me~ and a wage increase

instead of a wage decrease for women. Because it und~               stheeff-    of theshifkin

labor demand on immigrants’ wages, this specification also yields higher estimates of the

downtrend in wages for new immigran@ and smaller ~              s of the rate of atching up.

         The worsening position of immigrants on arrival makes it harder for them to catch up

with natives. Table 3 presents estimates, derived bm      the coefficients in Table 2, of the

number of years required for average immigrants arriving in 1955, 1965, 1975, and 1985 to

ovetie    natives, by sex and education category. Male immigrants with Pomndary

schooling who arrived in the U.S. in 1955 codd expect to earn as much as natives within 12

years, while similar immigrants who arrived in 1985 would require 21 years for overtaking.

According to these estimates, the typical male immigrant without postsecondary schooling

who arrived in 1955 overtook the typical native worker after 19 years. However, by 1985 the

number of years to overtaking was 46, about as long as a high school graduate works in a

lifetime. Immigrant women required fewer years to overtake native womeu but the pattern

was similar. Those with Po-ndary          schooling who arrived in 1955 caught up with similar



    2 I also ran regressions which included separate variables for YSM and YSMSQ for
immigrants who tived in the 1970s and the 1980s. The coefficients on these interaction
terms were generally insignificant for men and small and negative for wornen. T’hey suggest
tit recent immigrants have had about the same assimilation or catch-up rates as earlier
immigrants.
                                                   13

natives in ordy 6.5 years, but those who arrived in 1985 required 12.5 years to catch up. The

typical immigrant woman without postsecondary schooling who arrived in the U.S. in 1955

caught up &        16.4 years, but similar women who arrived @ 1985 wi.Ucatch up only ~

41.5 years of residence.

        To examine the mntribution of changes in English skills, educatio~ and region of

origin to the   wage   gap be~een    immigrants and natives, I then estimated a log wage

regression which includd dummy variables for the Inguage and region of origin categories,

educatio~ education squared, as well as YRM, YSM, YSM sqti                     Experience (age minus

education minus 6), Experience squared, and a dummy variable for observations tim              the

1990 Census.

        The results, presented in Table 4, indicate that the trend decline in the relative wages

of newly tived      immigrants is completely explained by changes over time in English skills,

region of origin, and education.      Once these characteristics are held mnstan~ the coefficient

on year of tival       becomes very small and insignificant for all four sex-education categories.

(Note that the coefficients and ~dard        errors for YRM in Table 4 have been mdt.iplied by

100 so they codd be displayed with the same number of places as the other coefficients.)

However, rates of assimilation are Iittlechanged fim        the -fficients      in Table 2. Immigrants

narrow the wage gap with natives by about 0.8 ~tage              points per year, even &r

adjusting for other factom.

        Workers with weak English skills suffer large wage penalties, ~ially             men and

especially workers with Pomndary            education. Even &       an~lling      for educatiom region

of origin, and years of U.S. residence, well educated men who speak only English earn 5.4
                                                  14

  -t      more than similar men who speak English very well, 15 -t           more than men who

  speak English well, 22 percent more than men who speak English poorly, and 39 percent

  more than men who speak no English. For less educated men the differentials range tim          3.4

  percent to 23 ~rcent.     The diff~tials   for women are about half to two-thirds the

  differentials for men.3

         These rates of return fim     moving up a language catego~ are roughly equal to the

  rates of return from an additional year of education. The wage advantage between workers

  with 16 years of schooling over those with 15 years is 11 -L         and the increase km     11 to

  12 years is 8 percent. Learning to speak better English presumably requires an investment of

  time, energy, and perhaps money. Therefore it shodd not be surprising that many immigrants

  do not speak fluent English, even though the rewards for doing so are large. Not everyone

  graduates from high school, even though there are large returns to additional years of formal

  education.

         Although many immigrant groups eam higher wages than natives, once diffances            in

‘ education and other factors are taken into acwunL most new immigrants earn significantly

  less than natives. However, the adjusted wage disadvantage of new immigrants relative to

  natives, as measured by the -fficients     on the region of origin dummies, varies widely by




      3 Rivers-Bati.z (1992) estimates wage regressions using both self-assessed English skills
  and skills as measured by a test, and finds larger wage differentials by skill level for the test
  scores. Thus the wage differentials reported here are probably too low. It is curious that
  men who repofl speaking English ve~ well earn less than similar men who report _
  only English. Evidentially speaking another language _ionally        is associated with lower
  English skills than speaking English exclusively. In a re~ession restricted to native-born
  men, those who spoke ordy English earned significantly more than those who spoke English
  very well.

region of origin. Moreover, it is generally larger for immigrants with post-~ndary

schooling than for those without. For instance, well educated newly arrived European men

earn 15 pnt      less than

less than similar natives. For womq       the ti~          are 17 percent and 0.5 percent.

Similarly, the wage disadvantage for well educated Mexi~           is 26 pere.ent for men and 25

percent for wom~     but otdy 5 and 9 percent for less educated men and women. bong              new

immigrants fim     English -g        countries aud tim     Wca     and the Middle ~     the less

educated actually earn more than similar natives, while the well educated earn significantly

less.

        Borjm (1994) and Jasso and Rosenzweig (1986) have suggested that immigrants from

developed countries can transfm their skills more easily than immigrants tim        developing

countries. The pattern of regional coefficients provides very WA support for this hypothesis.

Among less educated men, immigrants from Europe and from English speaking countries do

relatively well, but so do immigrants tim     Africa and the Middle East. Among well educated

men, immigrants from English speaking muntries, South Asia and Europe earn more than

other immigrant groups, adjusted for other characteristics.      *ong   wome~ the coefficients for

immigrants from developing countries are ok          larger than the coefficients for develo@

wuntries, though the differenws are generally not statistically significant.



V. Changes k English Skills, R@orI of Originj md Education

        English skills, region of orig~   and education are dl important in explaining wage

differences among immigrants, but how important are they in explaining changes in the
                                                  16

“quality”of new i.rnmi~ts    since the 1960s? How much have chauges in these

characteristics among newly anived immigrants Iowd          their wages relative to natives? How

much have improvements in language skills and education with ~               time spent in the

U.S. contributed to -wing         the wage gap?

       Answering these questions requires estimating equations (5) md (6), which ~lai.n

how individual characteristics change with year of migration (YRM) and with years sinu

migration (YSM). As explained above, I used a measure of English skills similar to a grade

point average to estimate short     and assimilation effects on language ability. The

independent variables included YRM, YSM, YSM sq-               Age at migration (AGEM), and

AGEM squared. Coefficients and standard exTorsare shown in Table 5. The resdts indicate

a significant tiend decline in language skills for new immigrants over time and significant

improvements in skills with increased U.S. residence.’

     - The distribution of newly tived      immigrants by region of origin has shifted

dramatically during the past 40 years. Table 6 presents the ~ntage        ditibution     by decade

of arrival, calculated for the 1990 sample of working immi~ts        used to estimate the wage

regressions.5 AS has been well documented elsewhere, the percentage of immigrants fim

Europe fell from 47.4 percent during the 1950s to 8.4 -t         during the 1980s. The

percentage from English speaking countries fell *m       19.7 percent to 10.5 percent. In



   4 These estimates come tim Carliner (1995), which has a more amplete            discussion of
English language skills among U.S. immigrants.

     3 Calcdating region of origin by decade of arrival fim 1990 Census dati’implicitly
assumes that rates of atition due to return migration or mortality are the same by region of
origin. For tier    discussion of the difficdties of estimating rates of return migration, see       “
Borjas and Bratberg (1994).
                                                 17

wn~      the peuntage    of immigrants km       Mexia and fim     other western hemisphere

wuntries rose from 10.4 and 8.4 percent to 23.4 and 22.7 percent res~vely           fi’om the 1950s

to the 1980s.

       This shifi in region of origin has been accompanied by a small decline in the average

education of new irnmigran~.     As Table 6 show      in 1990 immigrants who entered the U.S. in

the 1950s reported having 12.9 years of education on average, wmpared with 11.5 years for

immigrants who tived     during the 1980s. This decline in the average education of

immigrants over time wntrasts sharply with the average education of natives, which has

increased considerably since the 1950s.6

       Immigrants’ place of birth does not change with increased U.S. residence, but

education may. Many immigrants come to the U.S. with their parents and attend school as a

matter of course. Others come in order to attend universities, and then decide to remain in

the U.S. permanently.   Assuming that immigrants acquire all their education before arrival,

and therefore that it is not part of the assimilation process, is clearly not -~.        On the

other hand, it is also not valid to attribute all the schooling ~ived   by an immigrant who

anived as an infant to assirnilatiou since such people wodd presumably have received some

schooling even if their parents had not chosen to immigrate.

       A til treatment of differenus    tieen     immigrants who anive in the U.S. as addts,



    G Bo~as (1994), Table 4 ~rts      that in 1990 the percentage of high school dropouts
among civilian male employees aged 25-64 rose fim 26 -t            for immigrants arriving
during the 1950s to about 38 ~nt       for immigrants arriving during the 1980s. He also
reports that the percentage of high school dropouts among 1950s immigrants fell fim 47
percent to 26 percent from the 1970 Census to the 1990 Census. Increasing exaggeration of
educational achievement with age, and greater return migratio~ retirement or mortality smong
high school dropouts may all mntribute to this pattern.
                                                18

those who arrive as childre~ natives who are the children of immigrants, and native children

of natives is beyond the scope of this paper. However, it is intig        to note that among        -

i.mrnigrantgroups   withless education than nativ~ individuals who arrived as children receive

more schooling than those who arrived as addts.      M shown in Table 7, Mexicans who

immigrated when they were 10 years old or less had 11.3 years of school@         versus 6.7 years

for those who arrived when they wm 26 or older. By an-             among immigrant grows

with more education than natives, the reverse is true. South Aians who were 10 or younger

on tival   had an average of 14.8 years of education versus 15.5 years for South Asti       who

were 26 or older when they arrived. Assimilation seems to involve a regression towards the

mtive mean. It is aIso interesting to note that the return to a year of foreign schooling is

worth about 7 percent less than a year of U.S. schooling, a small but statistically significant

difference.’

        In calculating the mntribution of changes in individual characteristics to cohofi and

assimilation effects on relative wages, I ~          tim   these issues and assumed that

immigrants do not increase their years of schooling ~      thq arrive in the U.S., ie, that y, =

O in equation (6). I-then regressed years of schooling on year of arrival ~.         The

estimated trend in immigrant education is a kline     of 0.046 per year (standard error =

0.001 5). In other words, over a 30 year period the average education of new immigrants has

declined by 1.4 years.



    7 Foreign education was Adated       as the lower of age at migration minus 6 or total
years of education. This variable was included in a wage regression along with total years of
education, education squared, and the other variables shown in Table 4. AS noted above,
Census data ordy reports intewals for the date of tival.   ~erefore the measures of years of
U.S. residence, age at rnigratioq and foreign education all include large errors.
                                               19

        To calculate the e~        wntribution of ckges      in English skills, educatio~ and

region of origin to cohort and assimilation eff~,    I followed the procedure described above

at the end of section ~. The change in English skills was calcdated fim the -fficients            on

YRM or YSM and YSM squared h Table 5. The change in education comes fim the

regression described in the -g         ~h.          ‘The change in region of origin was the

percentage distribution for 1980s immigrants minus the ~tage          distribution for 1950s

tigrants.    These changes were then mdtiplied by the appropriate coefficients in the wage

regressions in Table 4 to produce the contribution of each variable. These mntributions were

then divided by the total whort and assimilation effmts, calculated ~rding       to section II.

        Table 8 reports these shares by sex and education category. These dcdations

indicate that improvements in English language skills wntribute about 16 to 18 percent to the

narrowing of the wage gap between male immigrants and natives that occurs with increased

U.S. residence, and about 6 to 10 percent for female immigrants.     Most of the assimilation

seems to be the result of increases in other forms of human capital by immigrants, for

instance better knowledge of U.S. work practices or greater ability to fid well paid jobs.

The restits aIso indicate that changes in the English skills of new immigrants have had little

effmt in their declining relative wages over time. The -d       decline in their education has

been substantially more importan~ but by fiu the most imprtant      source of the relative wage

decline has been the shifi in source muntries away fim      Europe towards Latin kerica       and

Asia. For wom~      I estimate that this shifi has been responsible for 73 to 89 percent of the

~nd   decline, and for men bm    87 to 95 percent. These findings are roughly mnsistent with

estimates in Borjas (1992).

VI. Conclusions

        The average immigrant earns about 50 ~ts           less than the average native worker, but

many immigrant groups in the U.S. eam higher wages than native wofiers and mauy have

higher average education. Furth~ore,       the majority of immigrant workers speak English well

or very well. Chdy among Latin Ameriean itiwmlts              do a substantial tirity    ~rt

speaking English not well or not at all.

        When they first anive in the U.S., Hgrants          earn significantly less than natives.

With each year of added residence in the U.S. this wage gap naITows by about 0.8 percent.

As a result, the wage of the typical immigrant who arrived in the 1950s and 1960s eventually

surpassed the average native wage. This overtaking occurred more quickly for women and

for well educated immigrants, but it also occd        for less educated men. Improvements in

English language skills attributed    6 to 18 percent of this narrowing, depending on sex and

education level. The remainder came from unmeasured sources of assimilation.

       However, since the 1950s and 1960s the wage gap between natives and newly arrived

immigrants has widened by 0.2 percent to 0.6 -t              annually. Because they start with a

larger disadvantage, on average more recent immigrants may never ~              more than natives. A

decline in the average education of newly arrived immigrants accounts for 4 to 23 percent of

the starting wage gap, and shifi in the SO-       muntries of new immigrants km          Europe to

Latin America and Asia account for 73 to 95 percent. Changes in English skills and in other

fmtors have played little role in this relative decline.

       This analysis also finds a significant return to English skills. Even -          controlling

for education, region of origin, and years of U.S. residence, workers are rewarded for
                                                21

-g       English well. l)iff~        between each of the five skill categories reported in the

Census data are about the same as the return to an additional year of schooling. The rewards

m @er     for men than for women and for well cduceUed workers than hr oti,         but they are

positive and significant for all Sexducation   ~ories.
