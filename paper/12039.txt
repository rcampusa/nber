JEL No. O32

                                              ABSTRACT

We present PublicationHarvester, an open-source software tool for gathering publication information

on individual life scientists. The software interfaces with MEDLINE, and allows the end-user to

specify up to four MEDLINE-formatted names for each researcher. Using these names along with

a user-specified search query, PublicationHarvester generates yearly publication counts, optionally

weighted by Journal Impact Factors. These counts are further broken-down by order on the

authorship list (first, last, second, next-to-last, middle) and by publication type (clinical trials, regular

journal articles, reviews, letters/editorials, etc.) The software also generates a keywords report at the

scientist-year level, using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) assigned by the National Library

of Medicine to each publication indexed by Medline. The software, source code, and user manual

can be downloaded at http://www.stellman-greene.com/PublicationHarvester/

1         Introduction

Many innovation and science policy scholars make heavy use of publication data. However,
researchers face a number of practical constraints when gathering such data, especially when
the unit of analysis is the individual scientist. PublicationHarvester is an open-source soft-
ware tool that automates the process of gathering publication information for individual life
scientists. It is fast, simple to use, and reliable.


2         Data Sources

PublicationHarvester searches MEDLINE and OLDMEDLINE, two bibliographic databases main-
tained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine that are searchable on the web at no cost.1
They contain over 14 million citations from 4,800 journals published in the United States and
more than 70 other countries from 1950 to the present. The subject scope of these databases
is biomedicine and health, broadly defined to encompass those areas of the life sciences,
behavioral sciences, chemical sciences, and bioengineering that inform research in health-
related fields. As a result, PublicationHarvester will be of limited usefulness to innovation
scholars who use other scientific fields as settings for their investigations.


3         Publication Data at the Individual Level

Researchers face two distinct issues when attempting to generate publication counts for in-
dividual scientists. The first relates to the uniqueness of names: common names make it
difficult to distinguish between scientists, and scientists with relatively rare names some-
times are inconsistent in their use of publication names. The second is quality adjustment.
PublicationHarvester allows the end-user to specify a search query for each scientist so that
his/her publication output is comprehensive and can be distinguished from that of other
scientists. With this work accomplished, the software quality-adjusts publication counts by

using information about the scientific impact of individual journals, publication types, and
order of authorship.


3.1       Dealing with frequent or inconsistent names

Namesakes and popular names. The two most comprehensive publication databases,
MEDLINE and the Scientific Citation Index (SCI) do not assign unique identifiers to the
authors of the publications they index. They identify authors simply by their last name, up
to two initials (three in the SCI), and an optional suffix (in MEDLINE). This makes it difficult
to unambiguously assign publication output to individual scientists, especially when their
last name is relatively common.

       Researchers can deal with this problem in three different ways. The first solution is
to ignore it altogether. This may be less problematic that commonly thought, since name
popularity should be, to a first order of approximation, orthogonal to other determinants of
scientific productivity.2

       An easy-to-implement alternative is to make use of name frequencies as weights to ac-
count for the relatively greater uncertainty surrounding publication counts for scientists with
popular names. Of course, this assumes that researchers have at their disposal an auxiliary
data source from which these frequencies can be computed. Azoulay and Graff Zivin (2005)
use the faculty roster of the American Association of Medical Colleges to compute frequency
weights for every combination of last name and two initials. For example, if there are 9
researchers in the faculty roster whose last name is “Jones”, whose first name begins by
“J”, and whose middle initial is “E,” then in any regression with publication counts as a
dependent variable, the observations corresponding to James E. Jones and J. Edwin Jones
                          1
could be weighted by      9
                              ' 0.111.3
   2
      Assuming that the publication counts are dependent variables in regression equations, measurement error
of the classical kind results in inflated standard errors, but does not affect the consistency of the estimates
(Wooldridge 2002: 74.)
    3
      Of course, this approach assumes all scientists are equally productive, which will be a more acceptable
assumption for some research questions than others. More sophisticated approaches to distinguish between
authors are feasible, for example by using co-author inclusion recursively (Wooding et al. 2005). However,
these approaches are computationally demanding when dealing with a large number of scientists.



                                                      2
      With relatively small samples, a more labor-intensive (but more precise) approach is to
narrow the list of publications using boolean operators, scientific keywords, and institutional
affiliations. MEDLINE supports elaborate search queries of this type, and our software allows
the user to customize search queries for individual researchers. As an example, one can
examine the publications of Keith W. Miller, the Mallinckrodt Professor of Pharmacology
in Anesthesia at Harvard Medical School. Miller is a relatively frequent name in the United
States (with 702 researchers with an identical patronym in the AAMC faculty roster); the
combination "miller kw" is common to 3 researchers in the same database. A simple search
query for "miller kw"[au] returns 203 publications at the time of this writing. However, a
more refined query, based on Professor Miller’s CV found on the web would return only 145
publications.4

Inconsistent publication names. While the preceding section discussed the possibility
of gathering too many publications for a researcher, the opposite danger, that of recording
too few publications, also looms large, since scientists are often inconsistent in the choice
of names they choose to publish under. By far the most common source of error is the
haphazard use of a middle initial. Other errors stem from inconsistent use of suffixes (Jr.,
Sr., 2nd, etc.), multiple patronyms due to changes in spousal status (e.g., "graff-zivin
j" vs. "zivin jg"), or, more rarely, from inconsistent use of a first initial (e.g., M. Judah
Folkman’s publications can be found under both "folkman j" and "folkman mj").

      To deal with this problem, PublicationHarvester gives the end-user the option to choose
up to four MEDLINE-formatted names under which publications can be found for a given
researcher. For example, Louis J. Tobian, Jr. publishes under "tobian l", "tobian l jr",
and "tobian lj", and all three names need to be provided as input to generate a complete
publication listing. Furthermore, even though Tobian is a relatively rare name, the search
query needs to be modified to account for these name variations, as in ("tobian l"[au] OR
"tobian lj"[au]).5

3.2     Quality-adjustment: Alternatives to citation-weighting

Science policy researchers have long recognized that scientific output tends to be very het-
erogeneous in quality, with a small number of researchers responsible for a disproportionate
fraction of total output in any given field (Lotka, 1926). Even for a given scientist, a small
number of publications will typically account for the bulk of citations to that researcher’s
publication output. As a result, scholars in the fields of the economics and sociology of science
have often viewed citation-weighting at the article level as the “gold standard” against which
other quality-adjustment methods need to be evaluated. Unfortunately, article-level citation
data is expensive to gather when dealing with a very large number of articles. This has
led researchers to look for cheaper, yet sensible alternatives.6 This is the direction adopted
here. The software can capture two dimensions of article quality: journal prominence and
publication type.

Journal Impact Factors. We make use of the Journal Citation Reports, published yearly
by the Institute for Scientific Information. ISI ranks journals by impact factor (JIF) in
different scientific fields. The impact factor is a measure of the frequency with which the
“average article” in a journal has been cited in a particular year. The software weights each
article published by the scientists in our sample by the corresponding journal’s average JIF,
and computes quality-weighted publication counts in this way.7

Publication Types. In many scientific fields, researchers publish many articles a year, but
only a fraction of those correspond to genuinely new pieces of scientific knowledge. Others
are reviews, invited comments, errata, editorials, etc. PublicationHarvester gives the end-
user the option to break down publication output into five broad different publication types.
In so doing, the software makes use of the publication type field attached to every article
indexed by Medline. In the file sample-pubtypes.csv, we have aggregated the 51 Medline
   6
     In some cases, there is no workable alternative to the use of article-level citation data, in particular when
the timing of the stream of citations is at issue, or when information about “who cites whom” is essential to
the study (e.g., Murray and Stern 2005).
   7
     Basically a ratio between citations and recent citable items published, JIFs suffer from built-in biases:
they tend to discount the advantage of large journals over small ones, of frequently-issued journals over less
frequently-issued ones, and of older journals over newer ones (Garfield 2006).


                                                        4
publication types into five “logical” broad groups, but other users could without difficulty
elect a different aggregation scheme.8


3.3     Using order of authorship information

In the natural and physical sciences, a robust social norm systematically assigns last author-
ship to the principal investigator, first authorship to the junior author who was responsible
for the actual conduct of the investigation, and apportions the remaining credit to authors
in the middle of the authorship list, generally as a decreasing function of the distance from
the extremities (Riesenberg and Lundberg 1990). In the portfolio of any given scientist, the
publications in which s/he appears in first or last position will therefore be more important
than those where s/he appears in the middle, even holding journal prominence constant.
The software breaks down the publication counts according to the first, last, and middle
authorship positions. Whenever the number of authors is equal to or greater than five, the
software tracks separately the publications in which the author appears in second and next-
to-last position. These authorship positions have gained importance over time as the average
number of authors per paper grew from 3.37 in 1975 to 6.89 in 2005.9


4       Measuring the Direction of Scientific of Research
        through Keywords

Increasingly, science policy scholars are interested in studying how specific behaviors or
policy interventions influence the direction of scientific change. For example, Azoulay et al.
(2006) use title keywords to compute an index of “patentatibility” for individual researchers.
Scientific keywords are also useful when trying to assess how far or close apart two researchers
are in “scientific space” (Jaffe 1986). Our software lowers the costs of harvesting scientific
    8
      The first group of publications corresponds to clinical research, broadly construed; the second group
corresponds to review articles; the third group corresponds to traditional journal articles; and the fourth
group comprises letters, comments, and editorials. The last group corresponds to publication types we wish
to ignore, such as biographical articles, interviews, festschrifts, etc. This is done simply by assigning those
MEDLINE publication types an identifier equal to 0.

life sciences.

keywords by making use of Medline’s MeSH descriptors. These keywords are arranged in
both an alphabetic and a hierarchical structure. At the most general level of the hierarchical
structure are very broad headings such as Anatomy or Mental Disorders. More specific
headings are found at lower levels of the eleven-level hierarchy, such as Ankle and Conduct
Disorder. There are 22,997 descriptors in the current version of MeSH. Independently
of publication counts, the software generate a MeSH report that aggregates the keywords
up to the scientist-year level. For example, in the case of Judah Folkman, the software
returns 21 publications in 1998. The most frequent keywords for this researcher that year are
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors, Angiostatins, and Transfection. This panel
of MeSH keywords is available to researchers for post-processing according to the end-user’s
idiosyncratic needs.


5        Limitations and Conclusions

PublicationHarvester is not without a set of important limitations. First, it interfaces with
MEDLINE, so it cannot gather publication and keyword data for researchers outside of the life
sciences. Second, it is not useful for organizational-level research, since MEDLINE does not
list affiliation information.10 For the same reason, it cannot use article-level citation weights
to adjust publication counts for quality. Finally, it puts the onus on the end-user to specify
namesakes and queries for individual scientists before harvesting their data, and is therefore
better suited to relatively small samples.

       Astute readers might wonder why we chose not to query the Science Citation Index, since
it contains information about both citations and affiliations. The answer is a practical one.
Public access to SCI over the internet is slow, and getting local access is often prohibitively
expensive. In contrast, MEDLINE access is both fast and free.
  10
     More precisely, MEDLINE only lists the first author’s affiliation (from 1988 onwards). Although the SCI
lists affiliation information for all authors from 1973 onwards, it does not link individual authors with their
institutions. This seriously limits the usefulness of the SCI affiliation data when conducting research at the
individual level of analysis.




                                                      6
      Fortunately for the science policy community, other data sources, such as the AAMC
Faculty Roster or the NIH Compound Grant Application File (CGAF) contain high-quality
affiliation data. Whenever researchers need to track individual scientists across time and
space, and simultaneously want to measure their publication output, a cost/benefit analysis
would probably favor the use of these administrative data sources in combination with Publi-
cationHarvester. Furthermore, for garden-variety quality adjustment, weighting publications
by Journal Impact Factor constitutes an easy-to-implement alternative to more precise —
but much more expensive — article-level citation weights.

      From a computational point of view, our approach also has a number of advantages. The
software is extremely fast — it harvested 721,223 publications for 4,765 academics in exactly
ten hours. It uses the free relational database MySQL11 to store the harvested data. And it
is made freely available under the terms of the GNU General Public License. It is our hope
that PublicationHarvester will be a valuable tool for other researchers in the innovation and
science policy community.
