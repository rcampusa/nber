A key issue in current research and policy is the size of fiscal multipliers when the economy is in recession.
We provide three insights. First, using regime-switching models, we find large differences in the size
of spending multipliers in recessions and expansions with fiscal policy being considerably more effective
in recessions than in expansions. Second, we estimate multipliers for more disaggregate spending variables
which behave differently relative to aggregate fiscal policy shocks, with military spending having
the largest multiplier. Third, we show that controlling for predictable components of fiscal shocks
tends to increase the size of the multipliers in recessions.

The impact of fiscal policy on output and its components has long been a central part of fiscal

policy analysis. But, as has been made clear by the recent debate over the likely effects and

desired composition of fiscal stimulus in the United States and abroad, there remains an

enormous range of views over the strength of fiscal policy’s macroeconomic effects, the

channels through which these effects are transmitted, and the variations in these effects and

channels with respect to economic conditions. In particular, the central issue is the size of fiscal

multipliers when the economy is in recession.

        The gist of the recent literature on this issue has effectively been to echo earlier

Keynesian arguments that government spending is likely to have larger expansionary effects in

recessions than in expansions. Intuitively, when the economy has slack, expansionary

government spending shocks are less likely to crowd out private consumption or investment. To

the extent discretionary fiscal policy is heavily used in recessions to stimulate aggregate demand,

the key empirical question is how the effects of fiscal shocks vary over the business cycle. The

answer to this question is not only interesting to policymakers in designing stabilization

strategies but it can also help the economics profession to reconcile conflicting predictions about

the effects of fiscal shocks across different types of macroeconomic models.

        Despite these important theoretical insights and strong demand by the policy process for

estimates of fiscal multipliers, there is little 1 empirical research trying to assess how the size of

fiscal multiplies varies over the business cycle. In part, this dearth of evidence reflects the fact

that much of empirical research in this area is based on linear structural vector autoregressions

(SVARs) or linearized dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models which by

study the effects of fiscal policy on consumption in expansions and recessions.
construction rule out state-dependent multipliers. 2 The limitations of these two approaches

became evident during the recent policy debate in the United States, when government

economists relied on neither of these approaches, but rather on more traditional large-scale

macroeconometric models, to estimate the size and timing of U.S. fiscal policy interventions

being undertaken then (e.g., Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein 2009, Congressional Budget

Office 2009). This reliance on a more traditional approach, in turn, led to criticisms based on

conflicting predictions which used SVAR and DSGE approaches (e.g., Robert J. Barro and

Charles J. Redlick, 2009, John F. Cogan et al., 2009, Eric M. Leeper, Todd B. Walker, and Shu-

Chun Susan Yang, 2010). A main objective of this paper is to explore this gray area and to

provide estimates of state-dependent fiscal multipliers.

         Our starting point is the classic paper by Olivier Blanchard and Roberto Perotti (2002),

which estimated multipliers for government purchases and taxes on quarterly US data with the

identifying assumptions that (1) discretionary policy does not respond to output within a quarter;

(2) non-discretionary policy responses to output are consistent with auxiliary estimates of fiscal

output elasticities; (3) innovations in fiscal variables not predicted within the VAR constitute

unexpected fiscal policy innovations; and (4) fiscal multipliers do not vary over the business

cycle. These multipliers are still commonly cited, although subsequent research has questioned

whether the innovations in these SVARs really represent unanticipated changes in fiscal policy,

the challenge relating both to expectations and to whether the changes in fiscal variables, notably


2
  Alternative identification approaches, notably the narrative approach of Valerie A. Ramey and Matthew D. Shapiro
(1998) and Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer (2010), rely instead on published information about the nature
of fiscal changes. But while the narrative approach offers a potentially more convincing method of identification, it
imposes a severe constraint on its own, that the effects of only a very specific class of shocks can be evaluated
(respectively, military spending build-ups and tax changes unrelated to short-term considerations such as recession
or the need to balance spending changes). Furthermore, the narrative approach tends to provide qualitative
assessments of the effects of fiscal policy shocks while policymakers are most interested in quantitative estimates of
the effects. Romer and Romer (2010) and Ramey (2011) are recent exceptions that provide quantitative estimates of
fiscal multipliers.

                                                                                                                    2
taxes, represent actual changes in policy, rather than other changes in the relationship between

fiscal variables and the included SVAR variables.

        Building on Blanchard and Perotti (2002) and the subsequent studies, our paper extends

the existing literature in three ways. First, using regime-switching SVAR models, we estimate

effects of fiscal policies that can vary over the business cycle. 3 We find large differences in the

size of spending multipliers in recessions and expansions with fiscal policy being considerably

more effective in recessions than in expansions. Second, to measure the effects for a broader

range of policies, we estimate multipliers for more disaggregate spending variables, which often

behave quite differently in relation to aggregate fiscal policy shocks. Third, we provide a more

precise measure of unanticipated shocks to fiscal policy. Specifically, we have collected and

converted into electronic form the quarterly forecasts of fiscal and aggregate variables from the

University of Michigan’s RSQE macroeconometric model. We also use information from the

Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the forecasts prepared by the staff of the Federal

Reserve Board (FRB) for the meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). We

include these forecasts in the SVAR to purge fiscal variables of “innovations” that were

predicted by professional forecasters. We find that the forecasts help explain a considerable

share of the fiscal innovations, and that controlling for this predictability increases the size of

estimated multipliers in recession.

        The next section of the paper lays out the basic specification of our regime-switching

model. Section 2 presents basic results for this model for aggregate spending. Section 3

  We prefer introducing regime switches in a SVAR rather than in a DSGE model since it is difficult to model slack
in the economy and potentially non-clearing markets in a DSGE framework without imposing strong assumptions
regarding the behavior of households and firms. In contrast, SVAR models require fewer identifying assumptions
and thus are tied more easily to empirical reality.

                                                                                                                 3

results for our method of controlling for expectations. Section 5 concludes.


    I. Econometric specification

To allow for responses differentiated across recessions and expansions, we employ a regime

switching vector autoregression model where transitions across states (i.e., recession and

expansion) are smooth. Our estimation approach, which we will call STVAR, is similar to

smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models developed in Clive W. Granger and Timo

Teravistra (1993). One important difference between STAR and our STVAR, however, is that

we allow not only differential dynamic responses but also differential contemporaneous

responses to structural shocks.

         The key advantage of STVAR relative to estimating SVARs for each regime separately is

that with the latter we may have relatively few observations in a particular regime – especially

for recessions – which makes estimates unstable and imprecise. In contrast, STVAR effectively

utilizes more information by exploiting variation in the degree (which sometimes can be

interpreted as the probability) of being in a particular regime so that estimation and inference for

each regime is based on a larger set of observations. Note that, to the extent we estimate

properties of a given regime using in part dynamics of the system in another regime, we bias our

estimates towards not finding differential fiscal multipliers across regimes. 4

         Our basic specification is:


4
  Coutinho Pereira and Silva Lopes (2010) employ an alternative approach based on estimating a VAR with time
varying coefficients (TVCs) where VAR coefficients are assumed to follow uncorrelated random walks and
estimation is done by Bayesian methods. The variation of coefficients over the business cycle in Coutinho Pereira
and Silva Lopes (2010) is small most likely because (1) Bayesian methods tend to smooth the path of TVCs; and (2)
modeling dynamics as uncorrelated random walks leaves the variation in TVC unrelated to the state of the business
cycle in any structurally meaningful way. In contrast, we allow for an explicit and systematic variation of the
response over the business cycle.

                                                                                                                4

(5)        var(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 ) = 1, 𝐸𝐸(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 ) = 0.

           As in Blanchard and Perotti (2002), we estimate the equation using quarterly data and set

𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 = [𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 ]′ in the basic specification where G is log real government (federal, state, and

local) purchases (consumption and investment) 5, T is log real government receipts of direct and

indirect taxes net of transfers to businesses and individuals, and Y is log real gross domestic

product (GDP) in chained 2000 dollars. 6,7 This ordering of variables in 𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 means that shocks in

tax revenues and output have no contemporaneous effect on government spending. As argued in

Blanchard and Perotti (2002), this identifying minimum-delay assumption may be a sensible

description of how government spending operates because in the short run government may be

unable to adjust its spending in response to changes in fiscal and macroeconomic conditions. 8

           The model allows two ways for differences in the propagation of structural shocks: a)

contemporaneous via differences in covariance matrices for disturbances 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 and 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 ; b) dynamic

via differences in lag polynomials 𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿) and 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿). Variable z is an index (normalized to have



5
  We use the traditional approach of defining G to include direct consumption and investment purchases, which
excludes the imputed rent on government capital stocks. While the current U.S. method of constructing the national
accounts now includes imputed rent, this was not the case for most of our sample period. Although the historical
national accounts have been revised to conform to the new approach, we cannot do this for our series of professional
forecasts. Therefore, we utilize the traditional method of measuring G in order to have series that are consistent over
time.
6
  To compute G and T, we apply the GDP deflator to nominal counterparts of G and T. We estimate the equations in
log levels in order to preserve the cointegrating relationships among the variables. An alternative but more complex
approach would be to estimate the equations in differences and include error correction terms.
7
    We find similar results when we augment this VAR with variables capturing the stance of monetary policy.

  In principle, identification can be further strengthened by using sign restrictions. However, given the complexity of
the model and our interest in point estimates rather than ranges, we leave this alternative for future research.

                                                                                                                     5
unit variance so that 𝛾𝛾 is scale invariant) of the business cycle, with positive z indicating an

expansion. Adopting the convention that 𝛾𝛾 > 0, we interpret 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 and 𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿) as describing the

behavior of the system in a (sufficiently) deep recession (i.e., 𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 ) ≈ 1) and 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 and 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿) as

describing the behavior of the system in a (sufficiently) strong expansion (i.e., 1 − 𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 ) ≈ 1).

We date the index z by t-1 to avoid contemporaneous feedbacks from policy actions into whether

the economy is in a recession or an expansion.

         The choice of index z is not trivial because there is no clear-cut theoretical prescription

for what this variable should be. We set z equal to a seven-quarter moving average of the output

growth rate. The key advantages of using this measure of z are: i) we can use our full sample for

estimation, which makes our estimates as precise and robust as possible; ii) we can easily

consider dynamic feedbacks from policy changes to the state of the regime (i.e., we can

incorporate the fact that policy shocks can alter the regime). 9

         Although it is possible, in principle, to estimate {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿), 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 } and 𝛾𝛾

simultaneously, identification of 𝛾𝛾 relies on nonlinear moments and hence estimates may be

sensitive to a handful of observations in short samples. Granger and Teravistra (1993) suggest

imposing fixed values of 𝛾𝛾 and then using a grid search over 𝛾𝛾 to ensure that estimates for

{𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿), 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 } are not sensitive to changes in 𝛾𝛾. We calibrate 𝛾𝛾 = 1.5 so that the


9
 We also considered, as an alternative, the James Stock and Mark Watson (1989) coincident index of the business
cycle (now maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and called Chicago Fed National Activity Index).
This series dates only to the mid-1960s and cannot be used for endogenous-regime multiplier calculations, but a
potential benefit is that it incorporates more information than the growth rate of real GDP. However, our alternative
estimates using this index (not shown) suggest that the choice between the two definitions of z does not have a
qualitatively important impact on our empirical results.
More generally, we chose the (moving average of) the output growth rate over typical measures of the output gap for
several reasons. First, there is disagreement about which measure of the gap to use and we did not want our analysis
to hinge on this point of contention. Second, it is much easier to compute feedback from policy to state for growth
rates than for filtered series corresponding to the output gap (e.g., consider the two-sided lead/lag transforms
necessary for computing HP filtered series). Third, the gap tends to lag recessions substantially; that is, the
economy can be quickly expanding while the gap is still be large.

                                                                                                                    6
economy spends about 20 percent of time in a recessionary regime (that is, Pr(𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 ) > 0.8) =

0.2) where we define an economy to be in a recession if 𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 ) > 0.8. 10 This calibration is

consistent with the duration of recessions in the U.S. according to NBER business cycle dates

(21 percent of the time since 1946). Figure 1 compares the dynamics of 𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 ) with recessions

identified by the NBER.

            Given the highly non-linear nature of the system described by equations (1)-(5), we use

Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods developed in Victor Chernozhukov and Han Hong (2003)

for estimation and inference (see the Appendix for more details). Under standard conditions, this

approach finds a global optimum in terms of fit. Furthermore, the parameter estimates as well as

their standard errors can be computed directly from the generated chains.

            When we construct impulse responses to government spending shocks in a given regime,

we initially ignore any feedback from changes in z into the dynamics of macroeconomic

variables. 11 In other words, we assume that the system can stay for a long time in a regime. The

advantage of this approach is that, once a regime is fixed, the model is linear and hence impulse

responses are not functions of history (see Gary M. Koop, Hashem Pesaran, and Simon M. Potter

(1996) for more details). However, we do consider later the effect of incorporating changes in z

as part of the impulse response functions, recomputing z consistently with the predicted changes

in output.




10
   When we estimate {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿), 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 } and 𝛾𝛾 simultaneously, we find point estimates for 𝛾𝛾 to be above 5 to 10
depending on the definitions of variables and estimation sample. These large parameter estimates suggest that the
model is best described as a model switching regimes sharply at certain thresholds. However, we prefer smooth
transitions between regimes (which amounts to considering moderate values of 𝛾𝛾) because in some samples we have
only a handful of recessions and then parameter estimates for {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿), 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 } become very imprecise.
11
     Alternatively, one can interpret this approach as ordering z last in the VAR and setting all z to a fixed value.

                                                                                                                                7
       Most of the impulse response functions and multipliers we present below are for changes

in government purchases, G, and its components. While, primarily for the purpose of

comparison with previous studies, we present some results for changes in taxes in the Appendix

(Figure A1), we have several reasons for focusing on G. First, much of the debate in the SVAR

and DSGE literatures has been about the effects of government purchases. Second, we are less

confident of the SVAR framework as a tool for measuring the effects of tax policy, because (as

discussed above) many of the unexpected changes in T may not arise as a result of a policy

change, but rather as a result of a change in the relationship between tax revenues and aggregate

activity, and because we would expect the effects of tax policy to work through the structure of

taxation (e.g. marginal tax rates) rather than simply through the level of tax revenues. Finally,

identification of tax shocks depends on our ability to purge innovations in revenues of automatic

responses to output and, as discussed in Blanchard and Perotti (2002), the key ingredient here is

the elasticity of revenue with respect to output. However, this elasticity is likely to vary over the

cycle, thereby introducing a bias of unknown magnitude and direction in our regime-specific

estimates. Indeed, we have found that output responses to tax shocks in different regimes are

very sensitive to the assumed elasticity.


II.    Basic Aggregate Results

We begin by considering the effects of aggregate government purchases in the linear model with

no regime shifts or control for expectations, following the basic specification of Blanchard and

Perotti (2002), including the same ordering [𝐺𝐺 𝑇𝑇 𝑌𝑌] for the Cholesky decomposition. Our

sample period is 1947:1—2008:4. Figure 2 displays the resulting impulse response functions

(IRFs) for a government purchase shock. These multipliers demonstrate by how many dollars

output, taxes, and government purchases increase over time when government purchases are

                                                                                                    8
increased by $1. 12 In this and all subsequent figures, the shaded bands around the impulse

response functions are 90 percent confidence intervals. 13 Consistent with results reported in

previous studies (see, for example, the survey by Robert E. Hall, 2009), the maximum size of the

government spending multiplier in the linear VAR model (the first column in Figure 2) is about

0.9 and this maximum effect of a government spending shock on output is achieved after a short

delay. The response of future government purchases also peaks after a short delay, indicating

that the typical government spending shock during the sample period is of relatively short

duration. Taxes fall slightly in response to the increase in government purchases. This fall in

taxes may contribute to the positive impact on output that persists even as the increase in

government purchases dies off over time.

           The second and third columns of Figure 2 plot the corresponding IRFs with associated

error bands in recessions and expansions, respectively. Because of the smaller effective number

of observations for each regime, particularly for recessions, the confidence bounds are greater for

these IRFs than for those for the linear model in the first column of Figure 2. Even with these

wide bands, however, the responses in recession and expansion are quite different. In both

regimes, the impact output multiplier is about 0.5, slightly below that estimated for the linear

model. Over time, though, the IRFs diverge, with the response in expansions never rising higher

and soon falling below zero, while the response in recessions rises steadily, reaching a value of

over 2.25 after 20 quarters. The strength of this output response in recession is not attributable

simply to differences in the permanence of the spending shock or the tax response. Taxes

actually rise in recession, while falling in expansion. This difference, which is consistent with


12
  Because government purchases and output enter the estimated equations in logs, we scale the estimated IRFs by
the sample average values of Y/G to convert percent changes into dollar changes.
13
     The Appendix discusses our method of estimating these confidence intervals.

                                                                                                                  9
the automatic responses of tax collections to changes in output, should weaken the differences in

the observed output responses in recession and expansion; and while the government spending

shock is more persistent in recession, it is stronger in the short run in expansion. 14

         To put the magnitudes of these multipliers in perspective, consider multipliers in

Keynesian models as well as the more recent DSGE literature. Traditional Keynesian (IS-LM-

AS) models usually have large multipliers since the size of the multiplier (when accommodating

monetary policy keeps the interest rate from rising) is given by 1/(1 − 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) where 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 is the

marginal propensity to consume which is typically quite large (about 0.5-0.9). 15 To the extent

that the AS curve in the IS-LM-AS model is upward sloping, the multiplier can vary from

relatively large (the AS curve is flat and there is a great deal of slack in the economy; i.e., in a

recession) to relatively small (the AS curve is steeply upward sloping and the economy operates

at full capacity; i.e., in an expansion). In contrast, an increase in government spending in

modern business cycle models usually leads to a large crowding out of private consumption in

recessions and expansions and correspondingly the typical magnitude for the multiplier is less

than 0.5 (in many cases much smaller). Recent findings from DSGE models with some

Keynesian features (e.g., Lawrence Christiano, Martin Eichenbaum, and Sergio Rebelo. 2009,

Gauti Eggertsson 2008, and Michael Woodford 2011), however, suggest that the government

spending multiplier in periods with a binding zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates

(which are recessionary times) could be somewhere between 3 and 5. Intuitively, with the



14
  Note that the contemporaneous responses of output to a shock in government spending are similar in recessions
and expansions. This result suggests that the differences in the magnitudes of the multipliers across regimes are
driven by the differences in the dynamics (i.e., {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿)}) rather than in the covariance of error terms (i.e.,
{𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 }).
15
  For example, Shapiro and Joel Slemrod (2003) and David S. Johnson, Jonathan A. Parker and Nicholas S.
Souleles (2006) report that the marginal propensity to consume out of (small) tax rebates in 2001 EGTRRA was
somewhere between in 0.5 and 0.7.

binding zero lower bound, increases in government spending have no effect on interest rates and

thus there is no crowding out of investment or consumption, which leads to large multipliers. Of

course, our estimates are based on several periods of recession and not just the recent episode

during which the ZLB became an important issue.

       In short, our estimates of the government spending multiplier in recessions and

expansions are largely consistent with the theoretical arguments in both (old) Keynesian and

(new) modern business cycle models. Table 1 summarizes these output multipliers for the cases

just considered, as well as those that follow. The table presents multipliers measured in two

ways. The first column gives the maximum impact on output (with standard errors in the second

column) and the third column (with standard errors in the fourth column) shows the ratio of the

sum of the Y response (to a shock in G) to the sum of G response (to a shock in G). The first

measure of the fiscal multiplier has been widely used since Blanchard and Perotti (2002). The

second measure has been advocated by Woodford (2011) and others since the size of the

multiplier depends on the persistence of fiscal shocks. Regardless of which way we compute the

multiplier, it is much larger in recessions than in expansions.

       The differences between our regime-based multipliers probably are exaggerated by our

assumptions that the regimes themselves don’t change and that we consider settings

corresponding to very strong expansions or recessions. Hence, one should interpret reported

magnitudes of the multipliers for the two regimes as bounds from polar settings rather than

routinely encountered values. More realistic situations will fall between the extremes. For

example, if the multiplier is smaller in expansion than in recession and the economy has a

positive probability of shifting from recession to expansion in future periods, then the actual

multipliers starting in recession (or expansion) should be a blend of those estimated for the



                                                                                                  11
separate regimes. Calculating full dynamic impulse response functions that include internally

consistent regime shifts is complicated, because we must compute the index z and evaluate the

function F(z) at each date along the trajectory. Also, because the IRFs are now nonlinear, they

will depend on the initial value of the index z and the size of the government policy shock. For

example, the more deep the initial recession, and the less positive the spending shock, the less

important future regime shifts out of recession will be. Therefore, we must specify the initial

conditions and the size of the policy experiment in order to estimate the dynamic IRFs.

       Figure 3 presents estimates for the historical effects of shocks to government purchases

on output, incorporating regime shifts in response to government spending shocks. For each

period, we consider a policy shock equal to one percent increase in G and report a dollar increase

in output per dollar increase in government spending over 20 quarters (i.e., ∑20        20
                                                                              ℎ=1 𝑌𝑌ℎ /∑ℎ=1 𝐺𝐺ℎ ).


The size of the multiplier varies considerably over the business cycle. For example in 1985, an

increase in government spending would have barely increased output. In contrast, a dollar

increase in government spending in 2009 could raise output by about $1.75. Typically, the

multiplier is between 0 and 0.5 in expansions and between 1 and 1.5 in recessions. Note the size

of the multiplier tends to change relatively quickly as the economy starts to grow after reaching a

trough. Thus, the timing of changes in discretionary government spending is critical for

effectiveness of countercyclical fiscal policies.


III.   Results for Components of Spending

Just as output multipliers for government purchases differ according to the regime in which they

occur, they can also differ for different components of government purchases (see e.g. Perotti

2007). As discussed earlier, studies using the narrative approach tend to focus on military build-



                                                                                                     12
ups, but how useful are these shocks to defense spending in analyzing the effects of other

changes in spending policies, such as those adopted during the recent recession?

           Figure 4 shows that IRFs for output in response to defense and non-defense spending

shocks, based on a four-variable VAR including defense and non-defense purchases, as well as

output and taxes. We order the Cholesky decomposition with defense spending first and non-

defense spending second, although this does not have an important effect on the results. 16

Clearly, the IRFs have different shapes for the linear model. For a unit shock to defense

spending, output rises immediately by just over 1, which is consistent with Ramey (2011), and

then gradually falls. For non-defense spending, the output effect starts smaller but eventually

exceeds 1 and remains above 0.6 for the entire period shown. Once the results are broken down

by regime, however, we can see a much stronger dependence on the regime of the defense

spending IRFs, which are similar to the linear-model results for the case of expansion but much

more positive in recession, peaking at about 5 in the fifth quarter after the shock. For non-

defense spending, on the other hand, the differences between regimes are primarily with respect

to timing rather than size, with the most positive responses occurring rapidly in expansions but

with several quarters’ delay in recessions.

           Figure 5 shows the results of an experiment that breaks government purchases down in a

different way, into consumption and investment spending, with consumption ordered first. 17

Once again, the results differ considerably by regime and by spending component. In this

decomposition, both components of spending have positive effects on output in the linear model,

although the effects of investment spending are much stronger, particularly during the first few

quarters when the impact on output exceeds 2 for investment but is around 0.5 for consumption.

Estimating the IRFs separately for recession and expansion leads in general to the expected result

of more positive multipliers in recession than in expansion. The IRFs are also noisier for the

separate regimes, indicating an imprecision of these point estimates that is consistent with the

larger confidence intervals (see appendix figures).


IV.     Controlling for Expectations

As emphasized by Ramey (2011) and others, the timing of fiscal shocks plays a critical role in

identifying the effect of fiscal shocks. In spirit of Ramey (2011), we control for expectations not

already absorbed by the VAR using real-time professional forecasts from three sources. First,

we draw forecasts for output and government spending variables from the Survey of Professional

Forecasters (SPF), an average of forecasts (with the number of individual forecasters ranging

from 9 to 50) available since 1968 for GDP and since 1982 for government spending and its

components. Second, for government revenues, we use the University of Michigan RSQE

econometric model, for which forecasts are available for the period beginning in 1982. 18 Third,

we use government spending (Greenbook) forecasts prepared by the FRB staff for FOMC

meetings. The Greenbook forecasts for government spending are available from 1966 to 2004.

Since the FOMC meets 8 or 12 times a year in our sample, we take Greenbook forecasts

prepared for the meeting which is the closest to the middle of the quarter to make it comparable

to SPF forecasts. Since the properties of the Greenbook and SPF forecasts are similar, we splice

the Greenbook and SPF government spending forecasts and construct a continuous forecast

series running from 1966 to present. For each variable, we use the forecast made in period t-1


18
  The University of Michigan data are coded from hard copies. Hard copies of forecasts prior to 1982 were lost that
year in the fire that destroyed that university’s Economics Department building.

                                                                                                                14
for the period-t value. Because there have been numerous data revisions in the National Income

and Product Accounts since the dates of these forecasts, we use forecast growth rates rather than

levels.

           The importance of controlling for expectations is illustrated in Figure 6, which plots the

residuals from projecting forecasted and actual growth rates of government spending on lags of

the variables in our baseline VAR. 19 If the VAR innovations were truly unexpected, then these

two residuals would be unrelated, but the correlation between forecasted and actual growth rates

of government spending (net of the information contained in the VAR lags) is about 0.3-0.4

which points to conclusion that a sizable fraction of VAR innovations is predictable. Therefore,

one should be interested in using refined measures of unanticipated shocks to government

spending.

           The simplest way to account for these forecastable components of VAR residuals is to

expand the vector Xt to include professional forecasts. That is, if we let the

SPF/Greenbook/RSQE forecasts made at time t-1 for the growth rate of real government
                                    𝐹𝐹                𝐹𝐹
purchases for time t be denoted ∆𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡|𝑡𝑡−1 (where ∆𝐺𝐺𝑠𝑠|𝑡𝑡 is the growth rate of government spending

G at time s forecasted at time t) and define the professional forecasts for output and taxes the
                                                                𝐹𝐹         𝐹𝐹         𝐹𝐹
same way, we would use the expanded vector in equation (1) [∆𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡|𝑡𝑡−1 ∆𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡|𝑡𝑡−1 ∆𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡|𝑡𝑡−1 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 ]′,

stacking the forecasts first because by the timing there is no contemporaneous feedback from

unanticipated shocks at time t to forecasts made at time t-1. 20 This direct approach is attractive

because it accounts automatically for any effects that expectations might have on the aggregate

variables and for the determinants of the expectations themselves. In practice, however, we have

                                                                                                                     15
found this approach to be too demanding given our data limitations, for it doubles the number of

variables in the VAR while eliminating more than half of the observations in our sample (i.e.,

those before 1982); the resulting confidence intervals are very large, particularly for the

recession regime for which we have effectively fewer observations. 21,22

         We consider two alternative approaches. The first alternative is a two-step process. The

first step of this process is to create “true” innovations by subtracting forecasts of the vector Xt

from Xt itself. We then fit 𝛀𝛀𝑡𝑡 = 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 �1 − 𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 )� + 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 𝐹𝐹(𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 ) (i.e., equation (3)) using these

forecast errors (rather than the residuals from the VAR itself). From this step, we use estimated

𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 and 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 to construct contemporaneous responses to shocks in expansions and recessions. The

second step involves using the previously-estimated baseline VAR with regime switches. In this

step, we use the estimated coefficients 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿) and 𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿) to map the propagation of

contemporaneous responses created in the first step. This two-step approach has the advantage

of allowing us to base the VAR on our full sample and the original number of variables. Its main

disadvantage is that the IRF dynamics will not necessarily be correct, given that the VAR is

estimated under the assumption that the innovations to Xt are fully unanticipated.

         The second alternative approach is to augment the baseline VAR directly, but with only

one variable, pertaining to the forecast of government spending. For example, the vector of

                              � 𝑡𝑡 = [∆𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡|𝑡𝑡−1
variables in the VAR could be 𝐗𝐗          𝐹𝐹                          � 𝑡𝑡 = [𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 ]′ where 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺 is
                                                 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 ]′ or 𝐗𝐗

the forecast error for the growth rate of government spending or some other measure of news

about government spending. In the former specification, an innovation in 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 orthogonal to


21
  We do consider a more restricted version of this approach shortly, in which we add a series on defense spending
innovations available for our full sample directly to the VAR.
22
  Karel Mertens and Morten O. Ravn (2010) distinguish anticipated and unanticipated shocks in a VAR by using
long-run restrictions combined with calibration. We do not use this strategy in part because with regime switches
we cannot distinguish long-run responses in expansions and recessions.

                                                                                                                        16
    𝐹𝐹
∆𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡|𝑡𝑡−1 is interpreted as an unanticipated shock. In the latter specification, an innovation in the

forecast error or news about government spending is interpreted as an unanticipated shock. 23

The key advantage of this approach is that, with sufficiently long series, we can have a VAR of a

manageable size and yet we can remove directly a predictable component from government

spending innovations.

         With these alternative approaches and specifications, unanticipated shocks to government

spending of a given initial size will lead to differing government spending responses over time.

To make IRFs comparable, we normalize the size of the unanticipated government spending

shock so that the integral of a government spending response over 20 quarters is equal to one.

Therefore the interpretation of the fiscal multipliers is similar to the second column in Table 1.

Figure 7 shows the IRFs for different approaches and specifications and contrasts these results

with the results for the baseline specification (1)-(5) that does not control for the predictable

component in government spending innovations. Table 1 reports the maximum and average

multipliers along with associated standard errors.

         Panel A (Figure 7) presents IRFs for the first approach. The results suggest that

controlling for expectations increases the absolute magnitudes of the government spending

multipliers, making them more positive in recessions and more negative in expansions. Panel B

                                                      � 𝑡𝑡 = [∆𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡|𝑡𝑡−1

the spliced Greenbook/SPF forecast series for the growth rate of government spending. In this

specification, which is estimated on the 1966-2009 sample, the multiplier in the recession regime

   In principle, these two variants should be the same, but this will not be exactly so because of data revisions. That
is, we have real-time predicted changes, real time actual changes, and ex post actual changes. The difference
between last two changes will be allocated to one piece or the other depending on which variable is included in the
regression.

                                                                                                                     17
is a bit larger than in the baseline model while the multiplier in the expansion regime stays

positive but small which contrasts with the baseline model where the multiplier turns negative at

long horizons. By and large, these results suggest that the government spending multiplier in

recessions increases and the multiplier in expansions stays close to zero when we purify

government spending shocks of predictable movements.

                                                                       � 𝑡𝑡 = [𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺 𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 ]′
         Panel C (Figure 7) shows results for the second approach with 𝐗𝐗

where 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡𝐺𝐺 is the forecast error computed as the difference between spliced Greenbook/SPF

forecast series and actual, first-release series of the government spending growth rate. 24 In this

specification, an unanticipated shock to government spending in an expansion has an effect on

output similar to the effect we find in the baseline model at short horizons. In a recession,

however, the multiplier may be larger than in the baseline model, especially at short horizons,

but the standard errors for estimated output response are also rising which probably reflects the

fact that forecast errors capture only a fraction of the variation in government spending.

         Finally, we use spending news constructed in Ramey (2011) to control for the timing of

fiscal shocks (Panel D, Figure 7). Specifically, we augment the baseline VAR with Ramey’s

spending news series, which is ordered first in this expanded VAR. The key advantage of using

Ramey’s series is that, in contrast to the forecast series, it covers the whole post-WWII sample

(1949:1-2008:4) and thus allows a longer estimation period and more precise estimates. One

limitation of Ramey’s news shocks is that they are based only on military spending. But changes

in military spending do account for a large share of variation in total government spending, so

they should still be informative. Also, these shocks are dominated by major historical events



24
   An advantage of using real-time data to compute forecast errors is that it makes forecasts and actual series refer to
the same concept of government spending.

                                                                                                                     18
such as the Korean War which can make multiplier estimates sensitive to using alternative

samples. Panel D shows that controlling for spending news does not materially affect output

responses during expansions and raises responses in recessions, although increased standard

errors call for cautious interpretation of these estimated impulse responses. We view these

findings as corroborating our other evidence on the importance of constructing unanticipated

fiscal shocks, which tend to have larger effects on output in recessions.


V.     Concluding remarks

Our findings suggest that all of the extensions we developed in this paper – controlling for

expectations, allowing responses to vary in recession and expansion, and allowing for different

multipliers for different components of government purchases – all have important effects on the

resulting estimates. In particular, policies that increase government purchases have a much

larger impact in recession than is implied by the standard linear model, even more so when one

controls for expectations, which is clearly called for given the extent to which independent

forecasts help predict VAR policy “shocks.” Given the historical experience of the U.S.

economy, our preferred estimates of the government spending multiplier are between 0 and 0.5

in expansions and between 1 and 1.5 in recessions.

       While we have extended the SVAR approach, our analysis still shares some of the

limitations of the previous literature. We have allowed for different economic environments, but

there may be still other important differences among historical episodes that we lump together,

for example recessions, such as the recent one, associated with financial market disruptions and

very low nominal government interest rates, and other recessions induced by monetary

contractions (such as the one in the early 1980s). Our predictions are also tied to historical

experience concerning the persistence of policy shocks, and therefore may not apply to policies

                                                                                                  19
either less or more permanent. The effects of taxes, even if purged of expected changes, are still

probably too simple as they fail to take account of the complex ways in which structural tax

policy changes can influence the economy. And, finally, as we enter a period of unprecedented

long-run budget stress, the U.S. postwar experience, or even the experience of other countries

that have dealt with more acute budget stress 25, may not provide very accurate forecasts of future

responses.

           These limitations of our analysis should motivate future theoretical work to develop

realistic DSGE models with potentially nonlinear features to understand more deeply the forces

driving differences in the size of fiscal multipliers over the business cycle, the role of

(un)anticipated shocks for fiscal multipliers in these environments, and implications of levels of

government debt for the potency of discretionary fiscal policy to stabilize the economy.

Appendix: Estimation procedure
The model is estimated using maximum likelihood methods. The log-likelihood for model (1)-
(5) is given by:
                                    1                          1

                                                                                𝑡𝑡 𝐮𝐮𝑡𝑡
                                    2                          2

where 𝐮𝐮𝒕𝒕 = 𝐗𝐗 𝒕𝒕 − (𝟏𝟏 – 𝑭𝑭(𝒛𝒛𝒕𝒕−𝟏𝟏 ))𝚷𝚷𝑬𝑬 (𝑳𝑳) 𝐗𝐗 𝒕𝒕−𝟏𝟏 − 𝑭𝑭(𝒛𝒛𝒕𝒕−𝟏𝟏 )𝚷𝚷𝑹𝑹 (𝑳𝑳)𝐗𝐗 𝒕𝒕−𝟏𝟏 . Since the model is highly
nonlinear and has many parameters 𝚿𝚿 = {𝜸𝜸, 𝛀𝛀𝑹𝑹 , 𝛀𝛀𝑬𝑬 , 𝚷𝚷𝑹𝑹 (𝑳𝑳), 𝚷𝚷𝑬𝑬 (𝑳𝑳)}, using standard optimization
routines is problematic and, thus, we employ the following procedure.
         Note that conditional on {𝛾𝛾, 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 } the model is linear in lag polynomials
{𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿)}. Thus, for a given guess of {𝛾𝛾, 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 }, we can estimate {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿)} with
weighted least squares where weights are given by 𝛀𝛀−1
                                                    𝑡𝑡 and estimates of {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿)} must

be the extended vector of regressors and 𝚷𝚷 = [𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 ] so that 𝐮𝐮𝑡𝑡 = 𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 − 𝚷𝚷𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡′ and the objective
function is

Note that we can rewrite (A2) as

                                                                       1
                                                                   = ∑𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡=1 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡[(𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 − 𝚷𝚷𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡′ )(𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 − 𝚷𝚷𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡′ )′𝛀𝛀−1
                                                                                                                               𝑡𝑡 ].
                                                                       2

The first order condition with respect to Π is                     ∑𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡=1(𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡′ 𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 𝛀𝛀−1
                                                                                         𝑡𝑡   − 𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡′ 𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡 𝚷𝚷′𝛀𝛀−1
                                                                                                                𝑡𝑡 ) = 0.

Now using the vec operator, we get
𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(∑𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡=1 𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡′ 𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 𝛀𝛀−1             𝑇𝑇      ′           −1      𝑇𝑇              ′           −1
                             𝑡𝑡 ) = 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣[∑𝑡𝑡=1 𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡 𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡 𝚷𝚷′𝛀𝛀𝑡𝑡 ] = ∑𝑡𝑡=1 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 [𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡 𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡 𝚷𝚷′𝛀𝛀𝑡𝑡 ]

                                = ∑𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡=1[𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 𝚷𝚷′] [𝛀𝛀−1      ′                     𝑇𝑇     −1      ′
                                                         𝑡𝑡 ⊗ 𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡 𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡 ] = 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝚷𝚷′ ∑𝑡𝑡=1[𝛀𝛀𝑡𝑡 ⊗ 𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡 𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡 ]

which gives
(A3)     𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝚷𝚷′ = (∑𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡=1[𝛀𝛀−1      ′        −1       𝑇𝑇      ′         −1
                                𝑡𝑡 ⊗ 𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡 𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡 ]) 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣(∑𝑡𝑡=1 𝐖𝐖𝑡𝑡 𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 𝛀𝛀𝑡𝑡 ).

The procedure iterates on {𝛾𝛾, 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 } (which yields Π and the likelihood) until an optimum is
reached. Note that with a homoscedastic error term (i.e. 𝛀𝛀𝑡𝑡 = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐), we recover standard VAR
estimates.
         Since the model is highly non-linear in parameters, it is possible to have several local
optima and one must try different starting values for {𝛾𝛾, 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 , 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 }. To ensure that 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 and 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 are

                                                                                                                                       23
positive definite, we use 𝚿𝚿 = {𝛾𝛾, 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 ), 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 ), 𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿)}, where chol is the
operator for Cholesky decomposition. Furthermore, given the non-linearity of the problem, it
may be difficult to construct confidence intervals for parameter estimates as well as impulse
responses. To address these issues, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method
developed in Chernozhukov and Hong (2003; henceforth CH). This method delivers not only a
global optimum but also distributions of parameter estimates.
         We employ the Hastings-Metropolis algorithm to implement CH’s estimation method.
Specifically our procedure to construct chains of length N can be summarized as follows:
Step 1: Draw 𝚯𝚯(𝑛𝑛) , a candidate vector of parameter values for the chain’s n+1 state, as
         𝚯𝚯(𝑛𝑛) = 𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛) + 𝛙𝛙(𝑛𝑛) where 𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛) is the current n state of the vector of parameter values in
         the chain, 𝛙𝛙(𝑛𝑛) is a vector of i.i.d. shocks taken from 𝑁𝑁(𝟎𝟎, 𝛀𝛀𝛙𝛙 ), and 𝛀𝛀𝛙𝛙 is a diagonal
         matrix.
Step 2: Take the n+1 state of the chain as
                        𝚯𝚯(𝑛𝑛) with probability min�1, exp�log 𝐿𝐿�𝚯𝚯(𝑛𝑛) � − log 𝐿𝐿�𝚿𝚿(𝑛𝑛) ���
           𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛+1) = �
                              𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛) otherwise
         where 𝐿𝐿�𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛) � is the value of the objective function at the current state of the chain and
         𝐿𝐿�𝚯𝚯(𝑛𝑛) � is the value of the objective function using the candidate vector of parameter
         values.
The starting value 𝚿𝚿 (0) is computed as follows. We approximate the model in (1)-(5) so that the
model can be written as regressing 𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 on lags of 𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 , 𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 , 𝐗𝐗 𝑡𝑡 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡2 . We take the residual from this
regression and fit equation (3) using MLE to estimate 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 and 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 . These estimates are used as
staring values. Given 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 and 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 and the fact that the model is linear conditional on 𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 and 𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 ,
we construct starting values for lag polynomials {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿)} using equation (A3).
         The initial Ω𝜓𝜓 is calibrated to about one percent of the parameter value and then adjusted
on the fly for the first 20,000 draws to generate 0.3 acceptance rates of candidate draws, as
proposed in Andrew Gelman et al. (2004). We use 100,000 draws for our baseline and
robustness estimates, and drop the first 20,000 draws (“burn-in” period). We run a series of
diagnostics to check the properties of the resulting distributions from the generated chains. We
find that the simulated chains converge to stationary distributions and that simulated parameter
values are consistent with good identification of parameters.

                                                 − 𝚿𝚿
estimates in the generated chain.
                                                                                               𝑁𝑁
        Furthermore, we can use the generated chain of parameter values �𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛) �𝑛𝑛=1 to construct
confidence intervals for the impulse responses. Specifically, we make 1,000 draws (with
                              𝑁𝑁
replacement) from �𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛) �𝑛𝑛=1 and for each draw we calculate an impulse response. Since
                                                       𝑁𝑁
columns of 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 ) and 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 ) in �𝚿𝚿(𝑛𝑛) �𝑛𝑛=1 are identified up to sign, the generated chains

for 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 ) and 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 ) can change signs. Although this change of signs is not a problem
for estimation, it can sometimes pose a problem for the analysis of impulse responses. In
particular, when there is a change of signs for the entries of 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 ) and 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 ) that
correspond to the variance of government spending shocks, these entries can be very close to
zero. Given that we compute responses to a unit shock in government spending and thus have to
divide entries of 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝑅𝑅 ) and 𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜(𝛀𝛀𝐸𝐸 ) that correspond to the government spending shock by
the standard deviation of the government spending shock, confidence bands may be too wide.
To address this numerical issue, when constructing impulse responses, we draw {𝚷𝚷𝑅𝑅 (𝐿𝐿), 𝚷𝚷𝐸𝐸 (𝐿𝐿)}
                       𝑁𝑁
directly from �𝚿𝚿 (𝑛𝑛) �𝑛𝑛=1 while the covariance matrix of residuals in regime s is drawn from

𝑁𝑁(vec(𝛀𝛀s ), 𝚺𝚺s ) where
        𝚺𝚺s = 2[(𝑫𝑫′𝑛𝑛 𝑫𝑫𝑛𝑛 )−1 𝑫𝑫𝑛𝑛 ]�var�vec(𝛀𝛀s )� ⊗ var�vec(𝛀𝛀s )��[(𝑫𝑫′𝑛𝑛 𝑫𝑫𝑛𝑛 )−1 𝑫𝑫𝑛𝑛 ])′ ,
                                                                                       𝑁𝑁
𝑫𝑫𝑛𝑛 is the duplication matrix, and var�vec(𝛀𝛀s )� is computed from �𝚿𝚿(𝑛𝑛) �𝑛𝑛=1 (see James D.
Hamilton (1994) for more details). The 90 percent confidence bands are computed as the 5th and
95th percentiles of the generated impulse responses.

Notes: The figures show impulse responses to a $1 increase in taxes. To control for the automatic tax response to contemporaneous output shocks,
we follow Blanchard and Perotti (2002) and use their estimate of 2.08 for the elasticity of tax revenues with respect output. The shaded region is the
90% confidence interval. Dashed lines show the responses in expansionary (red, long dash) and recessionary (blue, short dash) regimes. The solid
line with circles shows the response in the linear model.
