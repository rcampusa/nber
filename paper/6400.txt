                                           ABSTRACT


       This paper reviews recent research that grapples with the question: What happens after an

exogenous shock to monetary policy? We argue that this question is interesting because it lies at the

center of a particular approach to assessing the empirical plausibility of structural economic models

that can be used to think about systematic changes in monetary policy institutions and rules.

       The literature has not yet converged on a particular set of assumptions for identifying the

effects of an exogenous shock to monetary policy. Nevertheless, there is considerable agreement

about the qualitative effects of a monetary policy shock in the sense that inference is robust across

a large subset of the identification schemes that have been considered in the literature. We document

the nature of this agreement as it pertains to key economic aggregates.
