                                               ABSTRACT

We investigate whether the inclusion of social rights in political constitutions affects social performance.
More specifically, we analyze whether including the right to education in the constitution has been
related to better “educational outcomes.” We rely on data for 61 countries that participated in the 2012
PISA tests. Our results are strong and robust to the estimation technique: we find that there is no evidence
that including the right to education in the constitution has been associated with higher test scores.
The quality of education depends on socioeconomic, structural, and policy variables, such as expenditure
per student, the teacher-pupil ratio, and families’ background. When these covariates are excluded,
the relation between the strength of constitutional educational rights and the quality of education is
negative and statistically significant. These results are important for emerging countries that are discussing
the adoption of new constitutions, such as Thailand and Chile.

           1. Introduction
           Constitutions – or constitutional arrangements– are the most important determinants of
political institutions.1 They establish the form of government, define the electoral system, specify
the rights and obligations of the population, and stipulate the extent to which property (and other)
rights are protected. A number of economists have studied the relationship between constitutions
and economic performance. In their classical study, North and Weingast (1989) argued that the
constitutional arrangements adopted by England after the Glorious Revolution (and, in particular,
after the Bill of Rights) allowed the government to make a credible precommitment that it would
not confiscate property in an arbitrary fashion and without compensation. This commitment
provided the bases for England’s economic success during the 18th and 19th centuries. In their
2005 book The Economics Effect of Constitutions, Persson and Tabellini analyze, both
theoretically and empirically, the effects of constitutions on economic policies and economic
outcomes. Their analysis is centered on two key distinctions of the political and constitutional
organization of a country: presidential vs. parliamentary systems, and majoritarian vs.
proportional electoral rules. Other authors that have addressed the relationship between
constitutional arrangements and economics include North (2006) and Qian and Weingast (1997).
           The idea that institutions (including constitutional arrangements) matter for economic
performance was already present, in an embryonic form, in Adam Smith’s The Wealth of
Nations. In Chapter VII he argued that the main reason why the English settlements of North
America had done significantly better than the Spanish dominions of South America was that
“the political institutions of the English colonies have been more favorable to the improvement
and cultivation of this land than those of the [Spanish colonies].”2
           In this paper we deal with an aspect of the relation between constitutions and economic
performance that, to our knowledge, has not been addressed before: we investigate whether the
inclusion of social constitutional rights – what constitutional lawyers call “positive constitutional
rights” – affects social performance. More specifically, we analyze whether including the right to
education in the constitution is related to better “educational outcomes.” Another way of
phrasing the question is this: Do countries that enshrine and protect the right to education at the

constitutional level have better educational results (as measured by standardized tests) than
jurisdictions that don’t grant such level of protection? In order to address this issue we use data
from 61 countries that participated in the OECD’s 2012 PISA test on education achievement.
The information on social rights protection is taken from the data assembled by Project
Constitute that covers 191 countries and distinguishes three levels of constitutional protection to
education.3
           This question has an important practical dimension, as constitutions are amended, or
completely changed, quite often – on average, every 20 years or so.4 For example, between the
years 2000 and 2013, 45 countries – most of them developing nations -- adopted brand new
political charters. Many of these nations are new democracies and/or countries that have gone
through major social conflicts and civil wars. Examples include Afghanistan, Burundi, Egypt,
and Zimbabwe. Developing countries that are currently discussing new constitutions include
Chile and Thailand.5
           Those drafting new constitutions – members of Constitutional Assemblies or other bodies
– have to decide which rights to incorporate in the new constitution. Should education, shelter,
and the right to a pension, among other social rights, be protected at the constitutional level? Or,
should countries restrict constitutional rights to the traditional ones, such as the right to free
speech, property rights, and right to privacy? Examples of countries that include social rights in
their constitutions are France and Germany; the United States, Australia, and Norway, on the
other hand, are countries that don’t include social (positive) rights in their constitutions.
           Supporters of social rights have argued that when these are enacted in the constitution,
political bodies – the legislatures and the executive – are forced to enact laws, rules, and
regulations geared at providing strong and high quality social services. That is, the inclusion of
social rights in constitutions is seen as a way of motivating and compelling legislatures to move

  On July 22, 2014, the Thai military issued a new draft or interim constitution, and announced the formation of a
Reform Committee comprised of 36 members to draft a new permanent constitution. Once approved, this would
become Thailand’s 12th constitution since 1932. In 2013 Michelle Bachelet was elected president of Chile by a
large majority. An important component of her political platform was reforming Chile’s constitution, eliminating
any vestige of the military dictatorship that ruled the nation for 17 years. She has repeatedly argued that the new
constitution will strengthen social rights, and in particular the right to education. On Chile’s economic history,
including the performance of the education sector, see, for example, Edwards (2010).
                                                   3


in a certain direction.6 Whether this works or not is, to a large extent, an empirical question. In
spite of the importance of this issue, there has been no systematic academic work on the subject.
           There is consensus among development experts that improving the provision of education
– its coverage and, in particular, its quality – is an important component of any comprehensive
development strategy. Improved education will result in higher productivity, better jobs, and
faster income growth. Moreover, a quality educational system is likely to result in better social
conditions and reduced inequality. What is less clear, however, is how to improve the quality of
education. A number of developing countries have put emphasis on teachers’ training and
salaries, while others are beginning to focus on the provision of preschool education. Chile is a
good example of a developing nation that is trying to make a qualitative change in its educational
system. In spite of having made significant economic progress since the return of democracy in
1990, Chile continues to have a highly skewed income distribution – its Gini coefficient is 0.52,
one of the highest in all of Latin America. In 2014, the second administration of President
Michelle Bachelet embarked on an ambitious program of educational reform. At the center of
this effort is the idea that education is a social right, and that the market should not a central play
a role – as it has until now -- in its provision. At the same time, the country is moving towards
adopting a new constitution that would, indeed, strengthen social rights, including the right to
education. For countries like Chile, then, it is vitally important to understand the international
comparative evidence on the relation between constitutional protection and educational
outcomes.
           The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we provide some background
on constitutional rights and education. A preliminary and unconditional analysis of the data
suggests that countries that provide a stronger degree of constitutional protection to education
have had lower PISA scores than countries that don’t protect these rights. In Section 3 we
expand the analysis, and estimate a series of regressions that explain differences in PISA scores
across countries. The results obtained suggest that, once other factors are taken into account,
constitutional protection has no significant effects on educational outcomes. These results are
robust to the equation specification and estimation technique – either OLS or instrumental
variables. In Section 4 we present a robustness analysis and some extensions. Among other

things we analyze whether here has been a connection between constitutional provisions on
education and the dispersion of test scores. Finally, in Section 5 we provide some conclusions,
including some reflections on enforceability. We also discuss possible directions for future
research. The paper also has a data appendix.
           2. A preliminary cross country analysis
           Constitutional lawyers distinguish between “negative” constitutional rights, and
“positive” constitutional rights. The former are aimed at protecting individuals from the
overreach of the State, and include property rights, the right of contract, equal protection, the
right to privacy, and freedom of speech, among other. Positive constitutional rights, in contrast,
detail the obligations of the State toward individuals, and include the rights to education, health,
and shelter. Their aim is to protect the people from poverty and devastation. Although every
constitution – or constitutional arrangement – contains negative rights, not every national
constitution enshrines positive rights. In that regard, the United States is an interesting case. The
U.S. Constitution includes a long and detailed list of negative rights – the Bill of Rights – but
doesn’t recognize any positive or social right. This is the case in spite of efforts made by many
politicians, and in particular by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to amend the constitution to
include social rights.7
           Positive or social constitutional rights have been codified in articles 22 through 27 of the
United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, and include the right to receive
social security payments in old age (Article 22), the right to work (Article 23), the right to equal
pay for equal work (Article 23), the right to an income that allows a family to live with dignity
(Article 23), the right to join trade unions (Article 23), the right to leisure and rest (Article 24),
the right to food, clothing, housing, medical care and social services (Article 25), the right to
child care (Article 25), the right to education (Article 26), the right to participate in cultural
activities (Article 27), and the right to benefit from artistic creation (Article 27).
           Project Constitute has compiled detailed information on 191 written constitutions. This
data set includes a complete English version of each charter, the date of enactment, the
requirements for amending each constitution, and the content and date of the most recent
constitutional reforms. Project Constitute distinguishes three types of constitutional protection to

education: the provision of free education, compulsory education, and equal access to higher
education. According to these data, 132 constitutions establish that the state should provide free
education up to a certain level (usually up to the end of secondary education); 120 out of the 191
constitutions include constitutional provisions that make education (at least to some level)
compulsory; and 62 constitutions ensure equal access to higher education. In addition to these
direct educational rights, in 79 of the 191 constitutions there are explicit limitations to the
employment of children.8
         In 2012 the OECD administered its PISA (Program for International Student
Assessment) test to thousands of 15 year old students in 65 countries.9 This exam measures skills
and knowledge in math, science and reading through common standardized tests. The sample
includes all OECD countries, plus a number of invited nations (and territories). Countries that
participate in this test have a significantly higher income per capita than all nations (the median
GDP per capita is $16 thousand for participating countries, and $8 thousand for the world as a
whole).
         There are detailed data on the constitutions of 61 out of the 65 countries that participated
in the 2012 PISA test.10 Out of these 61 countries, 7 had no constitutional provisions on
education; 11 had one constitutional provision; 27 included two provisions; and 16 had all three
provisions identified by Project Constitute (free education, compulsory education, and equal
access to tertiary education).
         Out of the 61 countries in the sample, 49 establish, at the constitutional level, the right to
free education, 45 countries established that education (to a certain level) is mandatory, and 19
included the right to equal access to higher education.
         In Table 1we present the average scores in the PISA 2012 tests. Panel A contains data for
the science test, Panel B for the math test, and Panel C for the reading test. In each Panel we

number of constitutions that enshrined and protected the right to education kept changing. The data provided here

  The PISA test is administered periodically. Before 2012, it was given in 2009. We also performed a number of
tests using the 2009 scores. The results obtained were very similar to those reported in this paper, and are available
on request.

   Project Constitute has no data on constitutional rights for New Zealand, the Slovak Republic, Tunisia, the United
Kingdom, and Vietnam. The 2012 PISA test included results for Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macao. We assigned to
all three the constitutional rights of China’s constitution. Taiwan also participated in the test; we used the island’s
constitution to define the strength to which educational rights are protected.

present the mean score for the 61 countries in the sample. We also present the scores for four
subgroups, corresponding to the number of constitutional provisions on education (scale from 0
to 3). As may be seen, in every one of the Panels there are strict descending test scores: countries
with stronger constitutional provisions on education have lower scores than nations with fewer
provisions. These differences in scores tend to be large. For instance, in the science test there is
more than a 50 points differential between the mean score for countries without any provisions
(510 points) and countries with the maximum number of three provisions (460 points). In fact,
this gap is larger than one standard deviation for the test results for the 60 countries in the
sample.
       In Table 2 we present formal tests for the equality of means for the four subgroups of
constitutional protection in each test. We rely on both an Anova F-test and a Welch F-test. As
may be seen, in all cases the null hypothesis of equality of means scores across the number of
constitutional provisions on education is rejected at conventional levels, confirming that
differences in performance across groups are statistically significant.
       The preliminary results in Tables 1 and 2 provide some background information on the
relationship between constitutional rights and educational performance. They also set the stage
for a more formal regression analysis that control for other variables -- including countries’ stage
of development and policies towards education --, explore some causality issues, and analyze
possible channels through which constitutional provisions may affect educational outcomes.
       3.      Regression results
       It is possible to think of two channels through which constitutional rights may affect the
quality of education: the first one – which we call the “direct production function channel” – is
the simplest one: Once the right to education is enshrined in the constitution, the legislature is
required to pass laws aimed at providing more (and better) “inputs” for the education
“production function.” For example, there would be more funds for training teachers, higher
investment in school infrastructure, and funds to have smaller classes (lower pupil-teacher ratio).
All of this would result in better test scores. The second channel is what we call the “cultural
channel.” It is possible that countries that protect education in the constitution develop a national
atmosphere, or national ethos, that celebrates and encourages education: teaching would become
a well paid, sought-after, and highly respected profession (as in Sweden); attending college could
become a prestigious achievement (as in Korea); and doing well in international tests would be a
                                                        7


source of national pride (as in China). This “cultural channel” would improve the efficiency or
productivity of the educational process; that is, it would work in a similar way to TFP in standard
growth models.
        This simple mechanics may be captured by an education production function,


        (1)


where E is a (quality adjusted) measure of “educational services,” refers to material inputs,                   is
other inputs, including family background. The amount of , in turn, depends on the fraction of
the government budget            devoted to education. This fraction is denoted by           , which is
assumed to depend on the strength of constitutional protection to education. That is,                           ,
and        0,         0. Finally, the productivity parameter         is assumed to depend on institutional
variables and culture, including, as noted, on the country’s cultural and social commitment
towards education. The latter, in turn, is assumed to depend (at least partially) on the extent to
which the constitution protects the right to education. That is,                    , and        0. 11
        If any of the two channels described above is indeed at work, we would expect that a
simple bivariate regression of test scores (a proxy for the educational services variable ) on a
constitutional rights index would result in significantly positive coefficient: stronger
constitutional protection to education would be associated with better outcomes (higher test
scores). Once education policy variables or inputs (class size, percentage of trained teachers,
quality of infrastructure, and so on) are introduced into the regression, we would expect that the
size of the “constitutional rights” coefficient would we smaller, but still significantly positive, as
it would be capturing the “cultural” channel ( ) in equation (1).
        3.1      Basic results
        In this Section we investigate the relation between constitutional rights and educational
outcomes by estimating a series of equations of the following type:


        (2)     log                                              ∑


11
   As we argue in Section 5, a more complete framework would also incorporate the degree of enforceability of
rights.
                                                            8




Where log                is the natural logarithm of the average number of points obtained in the
PISA test by country j, and                        is an index of the strength of educational rights in that
country’s constitution. This index ranges from 0 to 3, and is the simple count of the number of
education-related provisions included in that nation’s constitution; higher values represent a
stronger constitutional mandate towards education (see Section 4 for results with alternative
indexes). The basic information for constructing this index was taken from Project Constitute.
The       variables capture other covariates, including variables related to the education
“production function,” and to the socioeconomic characteristics of the families. Finally,                        is an
error term; in the estimation we allow for              to be heteroskedactic.
         In the regressions reported below we follow the traditional literature on school
performance and included the following covariates. 12 See the Appendix for detailed data
sources:
                 Logarithm of per capita GDP. This variable captures the level of development of
                  the country in question and its sign is expected to be positive. We also introduced
                  this variable squared, as a way to allow for a nonlinear impact of income per
                  capita on test scores.
                 Pupil to Full Time Teachers Ratio: This is a traditional “production function”
                  variable in the school performance literature. We expect its coefficient to be
                  negative. More crowded classes will tend to generate weaker results.
                 Percentage of private schools: Defined as the percentage of students that study in
                  private schools in country j. This variable measures the organizational structure of
                  the school system, and the extent to which it relies on the private provision of
                  education. Its sign in the regression analysis is not determined a priori.




12
  For a review see, for example, Hanushek. and Woessmann (2010). Much of the recent of the literature on
education performance has relied on micro data, and has considered individual students’ test scores as the basic unit
of observation. In this research most of the the     covariates refer to the students’ attributes, characteristics of the
students’ family, and characteristics of the the educational establishment where he/she is studying. Our analysis,
however, focuses on country averages, and not on individual data. One consequence of this is, the number of
covariates with available data is smaller than in traditional studies. See Section 4 for some comments on this issue.
                                                           9


                 Percentage of schools with a library: This is another “production function”
                  covariate, and provides a measure of the quality of the school system teaching
                  infrastructure. We expect its sign to be positive in the regressions.
                 Percentage of fathers that work full time: This is a family related variable, and
                  captures the degree of financial stability in the students’ families. Its coefficient is
                  expected to be positive.
                 Percentage of immigrant families: This variable is defined as the percentage of
                  students in the school system that are immigrants; for many of these children the
                  country’s official language is not their own. This variable measures the diversity
                  of the country. Under most circumstances we would expect its sign to be negative.


         A number of additional variables were also considered in some specifications – the
percentage of full time teachers certified, and whether the parents had a high school or higher
education, to name just a few. They were not included in the Tables reported here due to space
considerations. Their inclusion, however, confirmed the results in Tables 3 and 4 – see the
discussion in Section 4.
         In Table 3 we present the results obtained from OLS; White-corrected standard errors are
included. The first three columns are for the reading test, the next three are for science, and the
last three include the results for the math tests. For each test we first report the results from
simple bivariate regressions, where                            is the only regressor. In regressions (2) we add
the log of GDP per capita in 2009 and the log of GDP per capita squared, and the three
“production function input variables” listed above. Regressions (3) add family related variables,
including the percentage of students that are immigrants and the job status of the father.13
         The results are quite satisfactory and are summarized below. Notice that in presenting
this summary we make an effort to avoid implications of causality. Indeed, we interpret the
results in this Subsection as measuring correlation; we address possible reverse causality and
endogeneity in Section 3.2, where we present results from instrumental instruments estimates:
                 In all bivariate regressions the sign of the constitutional rights index is
                  significantly negative. That is, that when no additional variables are included, the

  For comparability, we restrict the sample to the set of countries with information available for all the covariates.
This reduces our sample from 61 to 55 countries in Table 3, and 54 countries in Table 4.

    relation between the protection of educational rights in the constitution and
    educational outcomes is negative. Countries with stronger social constitutional
    rights that protect education have had, on average, weaker performance in the
    PISA tests. This confirms the results from our nonparametric tests in Section 2.
   Once other covariates are added, the coefficient of constitutional rights protection
    cease to be significant at conventional levels (they are still negative, however).
   Regressions (2) and (3) indicate that country, school system, and family
    characteristics are related, in statistically significant ways, with test scores. More
    specifically:
    o      Richer countries tend to have significantly higher test scores. This positive
           relation moves at decreasing rates (the coefficient of the squared GDP is
           significantly negative).
    o      There is a negative relationship between the pupil to teachers ratio and test
           scores – in every equations this coefficient is significant at conventional
           levels. This confirms findings from micro data based research on
           educational performance. Fewer students per teacher enhance the learning
           experience. An important implication is that, as the simple “production
           function approach suggests,” higher expenditure on instruction – more
           teachers in the classroom --, is related to better test results.
    o      When square terms of the pupil’s ratio were included, the coefficient was
           not significant (estimates not reported due to space considerations).
    o      The school system infrastructure – in this case, the percentage of schools
           with libraries – is also important. Its coefficient is significantly positive.
    o      Interestingly, these results indicate that countries with a higher fraction of
           private sector provision of education have better scores. This result may be
           dependent on the sample, and merits further research.
    o      These results also confirm that family attributes are fundamentally related
           to school performance and test scores. The coefficients of fathers’
           employment situation and on the percentage of immigrant families are
           significant and have the expected signs. (We explore this issue further in
           Section 4).

           The finding that social constitutional rights are negatively correlated (although the
relation is not always statistically significant) with the test scores suggests that neither of the two
(potential) channels discussed above is at work. This is somewhat puzzling. Most people –
although, maybe not most economists – would have expected a positive correlation: countries
that have a stronger constitutional mandate to protect and promote education will tend to have –
through the two channels discussed above – a higher quality educational system and, thus, higher
test scores. On the other hand, skeptical observers may have expected no relation between the
two variables. After all, in many countries – and in particular in many poorer ones –
constitutional provisions are not always enforced; they are stated on paper, but politicians and
judges tend to ignore them (more on this in Section 5 below).14 In an effort to understand better
what is behind these results, in the subsections that follows we present instrumental variables
estimates, we explore alternative specifications, we consider the possible existence of
nonlinearities, and we investigate the relation between the constitutional rights index and a
number of “production function” covariates.
           3.2      Instrumental variables
           A potential limitation of the results in Table 3 is that they may be capturing a situation of
reverse causality: it is possible that countries with weak educational systems – and low test
scores – have attempted to improve outcomes by strengthening constitutional provisions that
protect education. A natural way of addressing this issue is to estimate instrumental variable
versions of equation (1). We present such estimates in Table 4. The following instruments were
used: The “legal origin” variables developed by Lopez de Silanes, La Porta, and Shleifer (2008)
in their path breaking work on corporate governance and economic performance. These authors
analyzed the historical origins of legislation protecting minority investors in a score of countries.
They distinguished between five such origins: United Kingdom, French, German, Scandinavian
and Socialist. The attractiveness of this variable as an instrument is that it has deep historical
roots that, in many cases, go back centuries, and predate most constitutions in our analysis.
Moreover, the historical origin of investment protection legislation was determined a very long
time before the development of standardized tests to measure education performance, such as the


14
     A possible explanation has to do with reverse causation. We deal with this issue below.
                                                          12


PISA tests. In that regard, “legal origin” is a truly exogenous variable that is correlated with the
type of constitution a country adopts, but that is not affected by the quality of education.15 We
also used the year of independence as an instrument. For countries that were never colonized
(and for countries with very early independence) we used the date 1700. The final set of
instruments is the region where the country is located. We distinguish between North America,
South America, Asia, Europe, and North Africa and Middle East.
         The IV results in Table 4 strengthen the conclusions presented in Table 3. In particular,
there is evidence that production function variables, including family and “productive inputs”
variables, are important in explaining cross country variations in test scores (our measure for the
quality of education). But, more important for the subject matter of this paper, in every one of the
nine regressions reported in Table 4 the coefficient of the constitutional rights index is negative.
As before, these coefficients are statistically significant in the three bivariate regressions.
However, the point estimates are larger, in absolute terms, in the IV regressions. Interestingly,
for the reading PISA scores, the estimated coefficient for the constitutional index is still
significant (and negative) in the expanded regressions (2) and (3. As may be seen, the constrights
coefficients are negative but not significant in the expanded multivariate regressions for the
science and math tests.
         4. Extensions and robustness
         We performed a number of robustness tests, and considered a series of extensions. In this
Subsection we discuss the most important of them (in most cases we summarize the results
without providing detailed Tables; these, however, are available on request):
         Constitutional rights index: We considered two additional indexes that measure the
extent of constitutional protection to education. First, we used a simple dummy that took the
value of one if the country in question had any constitutional provision that supported the right to
education, and zero otherwise. This indicator, then, treats all countries with any provision
equally. As alternative third alternative, we constructed an exponential constitutional index,
where adding another pro-education provision in the constitution has a more than additive effect
on the index. In this case the constitutional indicator can take the values 1, 2.7, 7.4, and 20.1. The
results using these two alternative indicators didn’t change the gist of our main findings: the

15
  A “first-stage” regression of constitutional rights on the legal origin variables show that these are indeed
significant as a group; the R-square is 0.45.
                                                  13


constitutional rights indicators had negative coefficients (in some cases significant), and the
other covariates were significant and had the expected signs.
       PISA Test for 2009: As a way of testing for the robustness of these results we re-
estimated our equations using the 2009 PISA test scores. The main conclusions were maintained:
there is no evidence that countries with stronger protection, at the constitutional level, for
education have had higher test scores than countries with weaker or no constitutional protection.
This is the case for both the OLS and IV estimates.
       Nonlinearities and interactions: We also explored whether constitutional rights play an
interactive role in explaining cross-country differences in test scores. We interacted the
constitutional rights index(es) with the “productive inputs” covariates, and with the family
attributes. We found that there was no interactive effect. We also explored whether some of the
explanatory variables entered into the test scores regressions in a nonlinear way. The only one
that appeared to be important was GDP per capita (see Tables 3 and 4).
       Additional covariates; In a number of specifications we included other covariates that
capture educational inputs, as well as families’ characteristics. Due to collinearity, and not
surprisingly, the coefficients for these additional variables tended to be insignificant. However,
when we substituted these variables for some of those in Tables 3 and 4, the coefficients had the
expected sign and were significant. For example, when we replaced the pupil teacher ratio with
the percentage of teachers with a teaching certificate, the coefficient of the latter variable was
positive and significant: 0.0019 with a t-statistic of 2.44. More important, when these alternative
specifications were used, the main findings regarding constitutional rights did not change: we
obtained negative and mostly insignificant coefficients.
       The ESCS Index: As noted, collinearity is a recurrent problem in this type of study. In
particular, variables that capture families’ socioeconomic conditions tend to be highly correlated
among themselves. One way of addressing this issue is by using a composite index that
summarizes in a single indicator households’ background. A useful measure is the OECD’s
Index of Economic, Social, and Cultural Status (ESCS). This index is calculated as the first
principal component of a number of specific measures (home ownership, number of books at
home, computer and internet connection at home, the existence of a quite place to study at home,
higher parental education, and higher parental job status). The index has a mean of zero,
corresponding to the average student that took the PISA test that year, and a standard deviation
                                                          14


of 1. In Table 5 we present instrumental variables results using the ESCS index as a way of
capturing families’ characteristics. As may be seen, the results confirm those reported above:
productive inputs, level of development, and household socioeconomic characteristics go a long
way in explaining cross country variations in test scores. The coefficient of the constitutional
rights variable continues to be negative, and in many of the regressions is not significant.
         Test scores dispersion: Social constitutional rights – including the right to education –
have an egalitarian bend to them. Their aim is to protect all citizens from misfortune and
adversity, and to ensure a minimum delivery of social services to the population. The role of
educational rights may, indeed, be to ensure that there are no significant differences in
educational outcomes across citizens. In that regard, we may be missing the point by analyzing
the relation between the strength of constitutional protection to education and the level of test
scores. As a way of addressing this issue we estimated a series of regressions with the (log of
the) interquartile range – or difference in scores between the third and first quartile – as the
dependent variable. Countries with lower dispersion in test scores (or more egalitarian
educational outcomes) will exhibit lower interquartile ranges. The question is whether the size of
this range is smaller in countries that provide stronger constitutional protection to education. The
results obtained for the instrumental variables estimates are reported in Table 6. As may be seen,
with one exception, for every test and specification the coefficients of constitutional rights are
non significant at conventional levels; in the one regression where the coefficient is significant
(science test, specification 1) the coefficient is negative. Complete results, including OLS
estimates, are available on request.16
         Constitutional rights and educational inputs: As noted, some authors have argued that in
countries that grant a constitutional status to the right to education, legislatures will be required
to provide higher funding to that sector; it is expected that through that channel the quality of
education would improve (Zackin, 2013). In order to investigate the relationship between the
strength of social constitutional rights and productive educational inputs in Table 7 we present
partial correlation coefficients between four such inputs – pupil-teacher ratio, percentage of
teachers with teaching certificate, percentage of schools with libraries, and percentage of
students in private schools --, and the constitutional rights index; t-statistics are provided in

16
  As a way of investigating the dispersion issue further we also estimated a series of regressions with test scores for
different percentiles of each country’s distributions. The results confirmed those summarized above.

parentheses. (We also include in the correlation matrix income per capita). As may be seen, all
pair-wise correlations between input variables and constitutional rights are weak; the reported t-
statistics indicate that none of them is statistically different from zero. This suggests that the the
“productive inputs” channel discuss above may e very weak. As we argue in Section 5, a more
definitive result on this issue would require additional research.
       5. Concluding Remarks
       In this paper we find no evidence supporting the view that countries that enshrine the
right to education in the constitution have higher quality educational systems than countries that
don’t. Moreover, our results suggest that there is no relation between the strength of
constitutional protection and the dispersion of test scores. These results hold independently of
whether we perform simple bivariate regressions or if we control for covariates that capture
countries’ stage of development, educational inputs, and families’ characteristics. The results are
also robust to the estimation method (OLS or IV), to the definition of the constitutional rights
index, the covariates added to the regressions, or the year in which the test was taken. These are
important findings for poor and middle income countries that are trying to improve the quality of
their educational systems. It is not enough to have the right to education enshrined in the
constitution. There is a need to introduce specific measures that strengthen socioeconomic
conditions in the country – and in particular among vulnerable families -- and that would
improve specific “productive inputs.”
         In a companion paper (Edwards and Garcia, 2014) we use a rather unusual data set to
investigate this issue further. We take advantage of the fact that, although the U.S. Constitution
does not include positive (social) rights, all of the states in the Union include educational rights
in their own constitutions. The strength, purview, and specificity of these rights vary
significantly across states, giving us the possibility of analyzing whether stronger constitutional
protection is related to better educational outcomes. The results obtained in this U.S. states study
confirm those reported in this paper. We find no evidence supporting the view that states with
more detailed and stronger constitutional provisions on education have better educational
outcomes. We do find, however, that school inputs (class size and the like) and families’
socioeconomic conditions (parent’s education, among other) go a long way towards explaining
differences in performance across states in the U.S.
                                                             16


           The most plausible explanation for the cross country results presented in this paper is
related to the difficulty in enforcing constitutional provisions on social rights. Indeed, it is
possible to think that the strength of the “cultural channel” discussed in Section 3 will depend on
the degree of constitutional protection and on the institutional and practical mechanisms
available to enforce these rights.
           Enforceability of social rights has recently been discussed by a number of legal scholars.
For example, in her recent book Zackin (2013, p. 92) states that “constitutional provisions must
be judicially enforceable in order to be considered rights at all.” And, referring to educational
rights in U.S. states’ constitutions she asks: “Can we really call these constitutional educational
provisions rights even though most were not written with the idea that citizens could enforce
their individual claims through court? Can mandates on governments have any meaning unless
courts are willing to enforce them?”17
           Of course, this point does not apply excusably to the United States. In fact, citizens’
ability to enforce constitutional provisions – and, in particular, provisions on social rights – are
very difficult in poorer and middle income countries, where there is no tradition of judicial
review (as in the United States), constitutional tribunals are slow and rigid, and courts are not
truly independent.18
           The discussion presented above suggests some direction for future research: an effort
could be made to develop cross country measures or indexes of the degree of enforceability of
constitutional rights (both negative and positive). An additional line of research would focus on
countries that have gone through constitutional reforms that have added (or expanded)
constitutional educational provisions. This would allow performing diffs-in-diffs analyses on the
extent to which these provisions have indeed helped countries achieve better educational
outcomes. Another line of research suggested by our results has to do with the relationship
between constitutional provisions and productive educational inputs. Table 7 suggests, at a
preliminary level, that there is a very weak and non significant relation between these variables.
This issue, however, merits further analysis. Two relevant questions are: How have legislatures
reacted to constitutional provisions? Have these constitutional provisions been translated into
higher and better inputs? A related research topic is whether the teaching profession is different

in countries with strong social constitutional provisions than in countries with weaker provisions.
In this respect, two variables of particular interest are the strength and role of teachers’ unions,
and teachers work conditions (including salaries). Yet another topic for future research has to do
with the potential tradeoff between quantity and quality: most constitutional rights on education
– and certainly the three highlighted by Project Constitute – refer to the provision of, and access
to, education. They mandate that education should be obligatory and free, and that access to
higher education has to be equal to everyone. These provisions don’t say anything about quality
or efficiency. A finer combing of different constitutions that identifies those countries that make
an explicit reference to quality would be useful. Indeed, in the companion paper on U.S. states’
constitutions Edwards and Garcia (2014) find that those states with explicit reference to
“efficiency” or “quality” in the constitutions have better performance than those that don’t
include this language.
       The list of topics for future research is long and ambitious. Addressing it would throw
additional light into the important topic of the relation of constitutional rights and economic and
social performance. In the meantime, the results presented in this paper suggest that, from the
practical, comparative, and historical perspectives, including constitutional provisions into
constitutions are neither a necessary or sufficient conditions for improving the quality of
education.
