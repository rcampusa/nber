                                         ABSTRACT

Unconventional fiscal policy uses announcements of future increases in consumption taxes to
generate inflation expectations and accelerate consumption expenditure. It is budget neutral and
time consistent. We provide preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of such policies using
changes in value-added tax (VAT) and household survey data for Poland. We find households
increased their inflation expectations and willingness to purchase durables before the increase in
VAT. Future research has to ensure income, wealth effects, or intratemporal substitution channels
cannot explain these results and ideally exploit exogenous variation in VAT in a fixed nominal
interest rate environment.

         Figure 1. Expected Increase in Inflation and Average Readiness to Spend on Durables

Note: This figure plots average monthly inflation expectations (black solid line, left y-axis) and the average monthly
readiness to purchase durables (red dashed line, right y-axis) over time. We use the confidential micro data underlying
the GfK Consumer Climate survey to construct these variables. GfK asks a representative sample of 1,000 households
how consumer prices will evolve in the next 12 months compared to the previous 12 months and whether it is a good
time to purchase durables given the current economic conditions. We create a dummy variable that equals 1 when a
household expects inflation to increase. Higher values correspond to better times to purchase durables. The sample
period is January 2009 to December 2012 for a total of four years.
