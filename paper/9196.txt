Precautionary Saving and Consumption Fluctuations

                                           ABSTRACT


       This paper uses data on the expenditures of households to explain movements in the average
growth rate of consumption in the U.S. from the beginning of 1982 to the end of 1997. We propose
and implement a decomposition of consumption growth into series representing four proximate
causes. These are new information, and three causes of predictable consumption growth:
intertemporal substitution, changes in the preferences for consumption, and incomplete markets for
consumption insurance. Incomplete markets for trading consumption in future states leads to
statistically significant and countercyclical movements in expected consumption growth. The
economic importance of precautionary saving rivals that of the real interest rate, but the relative
importance of each source of movement in the volatility of consumption is not precisely measured.

1. Introduction

According to canonical macroeconomic theory, aggregate consumption is the result of
the optimal choices of a representative consumer. Consumption growth changes over
time due to changes in the risk-free rate of return and changes in the information that
the consumer has about current wealth, future income, and future rates of return. Con-
sistent with this approach, consumption growth is largely unpredictable. But contrary
to the canonical theory, predictable movements in aggregate consumption growth have
little correlation with the risk-free rate of return and significant correlation with pre-
dictable movements in income. For the representative agent approach, there are several
puzzling features of US consumption data, such as excess sensitivity, excess smoothness,
and the equity premium puzzle.1
      This paper measures the relative importance of new information, the real inter-
est rate, the preference for consumption, and precautionary saving for movements in
average consumption growth. We develop a method that uses the consumption Euler
equation and survey data on the consumption expenditures of households to decompose
consumption growth into these four proximate causes, and factors outside the model.
Using both estimates and calibrations for a standard utility function, we implement
this decomposition and find a significant role for precautionary saving in consumption
fluctuations.
      We focus particularly on predictable movements in consumption growth caused by
changes in the amount of consumption risk faced by households, or precautionary sav-
ing. We do this for three reasons. First, because consumers face idiosyncratic risk
that they do not completely insure, precautionary saving is potentially a significant
determinant of consumption dynamics.2 The consumption dynamics of price-taking
households in a model economy without complete consumption insurance can be quite

     Complete consumption insurance is rejected by Nelson (1994), Cochrane (1991), and Attanasio
and Davis (1996).

diﬀerent from the behavior of these same households in the equivalent economy with
complete markets.3 More specifically, Caballero (1990) and Carroll (1997) argue that
many of the existing puzzles of the consumption literature can in theory be explained
by precautionary saving. Despite the implications of these models, there is no direct
evidence on whether precautionary saving causes movements in expected consumption
growth in practice. Such evidence is our main substantive contribution.
      Second, the measurement of precautionary saving is not straightforward.                     The
methodological contribution of this paper is the derivation of a robust measure of the
predictable fluctuations in aggregate consumption that are due to consumption risk.
Consistent estimates of the role of precautionary saving allow us to consistently decom-
pose consumption fluctuations. Finally, measurement of precautionary saving helps
gauge its broader significance. To the extent that consumption risk and constraints
on intertemporal substitution are important for aggregate consumption dynamics, they
are more likely to be important for other areas of research such as asset pricing and the
design of optimal policy.4
      Our method proceeds as follows. We posit a household marginal utility function. We
alternately estimate and calibrate the parameters of this function. Given this measure
of marginal utility and the consumption Euler equation, we allocate movements in
consumption to four proximate causes: new information, changes in the risk-free rate
of return, changes in the preference for consumption, and changes in expected risk to
consumption or liquidity constraints. In particular, predictable consumption growth
due to precautionary saving is the predictable variation in a nonlinear function of the
innovation to marginal utility. We deal with three complications. First, we derive a
measure that is robust to some misspecification of preferences. Second, measurement
error in consumption data implies that mean consumption growth cannot be consistently
decomposed, only movements around the mean. Finally, low-wealth households in the

      Such potentially important roles for precationary saving are considered by Caballero (1991), Con-
stantinides and Duﬃe (1996) and Aiyagari (1995).

economy may face binding liquidity constraints. We measure consumption growth due
to both precautionary saving and liquidity constraints for these households. Aggregating
across households, we decompose average consumption growth into its proximate causes.
These causes are proximate, rather than structural or exogenous, in the same way the
causes of output growth in a Solow decomposition are proximate.5
       Implementing the decomposition using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey
(CEX), we find that precautionary saving makes a statistically significant contribution
to fluctuations in expected consumption growth. The economic importance of each
source of predictable variation in consumption growth is not isolated due to covariation
among the proximate causes. The share of variance of predictable consumption growth
sourced to incomplete markets and that sourced to the real interest rate both vary over
similar wide ranges. The pattern of this correlation among sources is itself informative.
Consumption growth due to precautionary saving covaries positively with that due to
the real interest rate, suggesting that low estimates of the intertemporal elasticity of
substitution in linearized models are not due to the fact that these models omit the
precautionary saving term. Since consumption growth due to shifts in the preference for
consumption covaries negatively with that due to preferences, low observed intertempo-
ral substitution in response to the real interest rate is largely due to omitted preference
shifters or misspecification of the consumption optimization problem more generally.6
       We further find that expected consumption growth due to precautionary savings has
declined during the time period of the sample, 1982 to 1997. Consumption growth due
to precautionary savings is high following the 1982 recession, consistent with high con-
sumption risk and low levels of consumption during the recession. More generally, con-
   5
       In particular, the impact of precautionary saving is not a deep structural parameter, but an
endogenous outcome. In order to understand the link between precautionary saving and structural
parameters, one must model market completeness, endowment risk, factor prices, etc.
   6
     See for example the models of Baxter and Jermann (1999), Basu and Kimball (2000), and Ogaki
and Reinhart (1998). Carroll (1997) argues that incomplete markets are an important source of bias,
Attanasio and Weber (1995) finds that labor supply is an important shifter of the preference for
consumption, and Attanasio and Weber (1995) finds some evidence for both views.


                                                  3
sumption growth due to incomplete markets is countercyclical: expected consumption
growth is greater when the unemployment rate is expected to increase. Finally, while
there is no statistically significant relationship between money shocks and subsequent
consumption growth due to precautionary saving, expected increases in government
spending are associated with faster consumption growth due to precautionary saving.
   Our research builds most directly on papers that exploit the variation and infor-
mation in detailed household-level survey data on consumption expenditures to better
understand consumer behavior and the dynamics of U.S. consumption (such as Hall and
Mishkin (1982), Zeldes (1989a), Attanasio and Weber (1995), and Parker (1999)). Our
focus on precautionary saving owes much to Dynan (1993), which estimates the param-
eters of the utility function from the cross-sectional relationship between consumption
growth and the expected volatility of consumption. Our research is also related to previ-
ous methodologies for inferring the importance of precautionary saving, such as Skinner
(1988), Carroll and Samwick (1997), Banks, Blundell, and Brugiavini (2001), Lusardi
(1998), Gourinchas and Parker (2002), Cagetti (1998), and Storesletten, Telmer, and
Yaron (2000).
   The paper proceeds as follows: section 2 shows how to decompose consumption
growth using the consumption Euler equation and discusses the central economic as-
sumptions. Section 3 demonstrates that, in the basic decomposition, precautionary
saving is a catch-all residual, and contains all movement in consumption not allocated
to the real interest rate or preferences. This section derives a robust measure of expected
consumption growth due to precautionary saving that avoids this shortcoming. Section
3 further discusses treatment of some small-sample bias and the presence of households
that may be liquidity constrained. Section 4 describes our use of the Consumer Ex-
penditure Survey and the variables that we employ in our analysis. Sections 5 presents
our results for households that are not liquidity constrained and Section 6 presents our
results for all households. A final section concludes and Appendixes contain additional
details on the decomposition and estimation of parameters.

2. Theory

This section derives a decomposition of consumption growth from the consumption
Euler equation. The economy consists of households that receive uncertain income
over time and in each period make both a saving and a portfolio decision. Households
are expected utility maximizers and price takers. Given the usual assumptions on
preferences, a probability space, and budget constraints, equilibrium consumption for
the household obeys the consumption Euler equation for any two periods t and t + 1:

                                                f       £                 ¤
                           u0i,t (Ci,t ) = δ i Ri,t+1 Et u0i,t+1 (Ci,t+1 )             (2.1)

where δ i is household i’s discount factor; u0i,t maps expenditures on consumption, Ct , into
the household’s marginal utility in period t; Et is the expectations operator conditional
                                                              f
on the time t information set, common across households; and Ri,t+1 is the gross risk-free
rate of return between t and t + 1.
   We clarify four points implicit in this Euler equation. First, markets in the economy
may or may not be complete, in that the available assets may or may not span all
                                                                          f
possible future states of nature. Second, other than the risk-free rate, Ri,t+1 , we do
not assume that households have access to the same assets. For example, there might
be fixed costs associated with entering the equity market and some households might
choose not to participate in this market. Third, equation (2.1) rules out borrowing
constraints. Subsequently we will weaken the assumption that every household can
                               f
borrow or lend freely at rate Ri,t+1 . Finally, since u0i,t (.) can depend on any exogenous
or endogenous characteristic of the household, equation (2.1) makes no assumptions
as to the separability of marginal utility from any of the standard suspects like family
structure or leisure. Consequently, equation (2.1) has no scientific content in that it has
no testable implications. To proceed, we must place further restrictions on the model.
   We restrict the diﬀerences in utility across households and time in a way that pro-
vides identification, is ex ante reasonable, and is consistent with prior research. The
discount factor is taken to be an exponential function of a linear combination of L

the (constant) intertemporal elasticity of substitution. The marginal utility of a given
level of consumption expenditures is nonseparable from the factors in QB
                                                                       i,t ; the marginal

utility of a given level of consumption may move in response to changes in the size of
the family or in labor supply, for example. If these changes are expected, they lead to
expected movements in consumption.
   Gathering these assumptions, the consumption Euler equation is

   To move from the dynamics of marginal utility to the dynamics of consumption,
take logs and re-organize equation (2.4),

                   ∆ ln Ci,t+1 = σ ln Ri,t+1 + σXi,t+1 δ − σ ln (1 + εi,t+1 ) .             (2.5)


                                                     6
This equation relates actual consumption growth to errors in expectation, changes in
preferences, and intertemporal substitution in response to the price of a good deliv-
ered with certainty in t + 1 in terms of goods at t. To relate consumption growth to
precautionary saving, take the conditional expectation of equation (2.5) and add the
unexpected part of consumption growth to both sides, to yield our main decomposition:
                                   f                                 IM

where

                        ∆ ln Ci,t+1 ≡ −σEt [ln (1 + εi,t+1 )]                         (2.7)

are the contribution of precautionary saving to consumption growth and the contribu-
tion of new information to consumption growth respectively. The notation “IM” is used
for “incomplete markets.” This decomposition is similar to the approximate nonlinear
equation used by Dynan (1993) to estimate parameters. We use the exact relationship
to decompose consumption growth given parameters.
   Equation (2.6) decomposes consumption growth only into proximate causes. It is
analogous to a Solow decomposition, which decomposes output growth into growth
due to capital, labor and productivity, rather than into growth due to technology or
policies. We decompose consumption growth into growth due to the listed factors
rather than growth due to technology or policies. As an example, a primitive shock
to the economy that alters risk typically changes not only precautionary saving but
also wealth accumulation and real interest rates and therefore would appear in both
consumption growth due to the real interest rate and that due to precautionary saving.
Similarly, at the aggregate level, all four components of consumption growth likely
contain some consumption movement driven at the primitive level by preference shifts —
changes in consumption allocated directly to preferences measure only the intertemporal
substitution due to expected changes in preferences. The interesting question is how
important are nonseparabilities and incomplete markets for the propagation of these
primitive shocks and so for the dynamics of aggregate consumption.

      A related point is that ∆ ln Ci,t+1 measures only the eﬀect of consumption risk on
predictable consumption growth. A primitive shock to the economy that increases
future consumption volatility aﬀects both predictable consumption growth and the size
of the innovation to consumption growth. Only the former appears in our proximate
causes as precautionary saving, although unpredictable and predictable movements are
linked through the budget constraint.
      How does the presence of liquidity constraints alter this decomposition? Let λ0i,t
denote the multiplier on the constraint on wealth, then optimal behavior implies

Let    i,t+1   be the true innovation to marginal utility implied by equation (2.8). Following
the same procedure, consumption growth is given by the decomposition in equation

                        . Thus, if some households in the economy face binding liquidity
constraints, the eﬀect of these constraints appears as precautionary saving. We refer
to equation (2.9) as consumption growth due to incomplete markets, as opposed to
equation (2.7) which, for an unconstrained household, measures only the eﬀects of
precautionary saving. As before, equation (2.9) measures only the direct or proximate
role of market incompleteness in consumption growth. Finally, it is worth emphasizing
that little is lost by measuring the impact of liquidity constraints and precautionary
saving together. Liquidity constraints are missing markets for transferring consumption
over time; if precautionary saving is at all important, it comes from missing markets
for trading goods across future states. These eﬀects are substantively and technically
closely related.7

3. Estimation methodology

Our goal is to use estimates of preference parameters and survey data on household
                                                                                     Ag
characteristics and consumption choices to construct empirical counterparts to ∆ ln Ct+1

and the conditional moments ∆ ln Ct+1  , ∆ ln Ct+1 , ∆ ln Ct+1 and Et ∆ ln Ct+1  . This
section addresses two potential biases that arise in the measurement of the role incom-
plete markets. First, in the theoretical decomposition, all predictable movements in
consumption not attributable to preferences and the real interest rate are assigned by
construction to precautionary saving and liquidity constraints. We choose instead to
use a measure of consumption growth due to incomplete markets that is robust to some
   8
       We require the expectation in front of the real interest rate series because the household-level real
interest rates are not completely risk free.

types of model misspecification. Second, the sample analog to the conditional moment
Et [εi,t+1 ] is zero with probability zero in any finite sample. Since the maintained as-
sumptions imply this term should be zero, and since it would otherwise contribute to
precautionary saving, we impose a correlation of zero in the measure of precautionary
saving. It is important to note that if there is no misspecification or finite sample
correlation, the measure of precautionary saving is not biased by our corrections, hav-
ing the same asymptotic properties as the unadjusted measure. This section describes
the removal of these biases for the economy without liquidity constraints and then for-
mally defines our estimators for the more general economy in which binding liquidity
constraints may occur. Appendixes A and B provide further details.
   The decomposition requires parameter values, which are chosen alternately by esti-
mation and calibration. When estimating, we apply a generalized method of moments
(GMM) procedure based on the nonlinear Euler equation to a synthetic panel. When
calibrating, we choose parameters based upon the large previous literature studying
consumer behavior. Particularly for the calibration results, some misspecification is
likely and this biases estimates of the contribution of incomplete markets to consump-
tion growth. In fact, the measure of consumption growth due to incomplete markets
absorbs all unexplained movements in expected consumption growth. To see this, sub-
stitute equation (2.4) into the cross-sectional average of equation (2.7):

              = Et ∆ ln Ct+1   − ∆ ln Ct+1   − ∆ ln Ct+1   .

If the model were correct, then this feature would not be a concern. But in practice,
the selection of factors influencing utility and the specification of parameters is not per-
fect, and assuming it is would label our ignorance or mismeasurement of precautionary

                                            10
saving.9 Therefore, we modify our measure of precautionary saving so that it is robust
to some types of model misspecification, and decompose consumption growth into each
proximate cause and a time series of expected consumption growth that represents our
ignorance.
       We consider the following type of misspecification. Suppose that the true model is
given by
                                        h                                i
                               −1                           f      − σ1
                              Ci,tσ = Et exp{Xi,t+1 δ}θi,t Ri,t+1 Ci,t+1                            (3.1)

where θi,t is an omitted preference shifter, an incorrect choice of δ B , or unobserved
variation in the actual risk-free real interest rate faced by a given household. Let
 i,t+1   denote the true innovation implied by equation (3.1). The innovation used in the
decomposition, given by equation (2.4), is

                                                     1 + i,t+1
                                         εi,t+1 =              − 1.
                                                        θi,t

It follows that equation (2.7) is an inconsistent estimate of precautionary saving unless
θi,t = 1 since
                                                             1
                                          Et [εi,t+1 ] =         − 1.
                                                            θi,t
       To estimate precautionary saving consistently, we replace εi,t+1 in equation (2.7)
with ε̃i,t+1 defined as
                                                   εi,t+1 − Et [εi,t+1 ]
                                       ε̃i,t+1 =                         .                          (3.2)
                                                      1 + Et [εi,t+1 ]
Since
                                              Et [ε̃i,t+1 ] = 0,
   9
       An analogy is helpful here. Assume that total factor productivity only changes because of increases
in technology and (unmeasured) changes in factor utilization. In this situation, a Solow residual
measures changes in productivity due to both sources. Thus, economists develop methods to construct
Solow residuals that are purged of the utilization component and measure only actual changes in
technology. Similarly, our basic measure of consumption growth due to incomplete markets may contain
movements due to unmodelled preference shifts; we develop a method to construct consumption growth
due to incomplete markets that is purged of this misspecification and thus isolate actual consumption
growth due to changes in consumption risk.

ment in average consumption, which we call misspecification and denote ∆ ln Ct+1 . To
be clear, this is not all possible misspecification. In particular, mismeasurement of σ
or misspecification of stochastic preference shifters are not addressed by this correc-
tion. Finally, if the original Euler equation is not misspecified, that is if θi,t = 1, then
Et [εi,t+1 ] = 0, and this correction does not bias any of our measures.

expectation error may be correlated with the innovation to marginal utility. The ex-

As an example, estimation of parameters by overidentified GMM would assume this
condition holds asymptotically, but not impose it in any observed sample.10 It is also
  10
       In theory we could estimate σ and δ from equation (3.4), so that this second bias correction, while
not causing any biases, would be unecessary. This procedure would require collapsing all the data
into a single time series and using a single set of instruments to estimate all the potential preference
heterogeneity in the population. Instead, we estimate heterogeneity in the predictable movements in
marginal utility using information available at the household level and panel data. As an example, this

Note that if ET It i∈It ẽi,t+1 |Zt = 0, then corrected and uncorrected measures of
precautionary saving are numerically identical. Appendix A shows each adjustment is
necessary: removing sample correlation inside the logarithm leads to bias, and removing
misspecification outside the logarithm leads to inconsistency.
    The possibility of liquidity constraints alters the implementation of these corrections.
As described in section 2, for a constrained household, εi,t+1 measures               i,t+1   − λi,t . It
follows that Et [εi,t+1 ] should not equal zero for constrained households. Therefore, we
omit the small-sample correction for possibly constrained households. For the misspec-

household i using the sample of households that are not constrained. We denote the
sample function as ET,λ=0 [εi,t+1 |Zi,t ] and use this as the sample analog to Et [εi,t+1 ] in
                                                                                            1
constructing ẽi,t+1 . Appendix B shows that as long as Et [ET,λ=0 [εi,t+1 |Zi,t ]] =      θi,t
                                                                                                −1,   the
presence of liquidity constraints does not alter the interpretation of our decomposition.
If this assumption fails, the interpretation changes: expected changes in preferences that
occur for constrained households and that are not predicted by Zi,t for unconstrained
allows us to measure the diﬀerence in discount rates among household types in part from cross-sectional
variations in consumption growth rather than trying to infer these diﬀerences from the time variation
in aggregate consumption and the time-varying share of each household type in the population.

The measures of consumption growth due to the risk-free real interest rate, prefer-
ences, and new information all follow directly from equation (2.10). The measure of
incomplete markets includes growth due to precautionary saving and liquidity con-
straints, is robust to a class of misspecification, and removes movements due to any
in-sample covariation between the innovation to marginal utility and the instruments
for unconstrained households. Finally, there is some additional consumption growth,
         P
σET [ I1t i∈It ln (1 + ẽi,t+1 ) − ln (1 + εi,t+1 ) |Zt ]. When reporting results based on es-
timation, for which it is reasonable to believe that this truly is misspecification, we
omit this source of variation from the decomposition. When reporting results based on
calibrations, we include this source of variation as variation due to preferences.
   Three points about the decomposition deserve note. First, both of the corrections
described in this section leave the consumption growth due to incomplete markets un-
biased if there is no need for them. Second, the methodology delivers a lower bound
on the proximate contribution of the interest rate, preferences, and incomplete markets
to fluctuations in consumption growth. Unpredictable movements in marginal utility


                                                              14
are estimates of the innovations to marginal utility. To the extent that the informa-
tion set used to make these predictions is smaller than that available to the household,
the role of innovations is overstated and the role of other factors understated. Third,
as demonstrated in the next section on the data, because of noise in measurement of
household consumption, the sources of average consumption growth cannot be consis-
tently decomposed. Instead, we decompose the fluctuations in these time series, not
their means.


4. Data and variables

This section describes our use of the information on consumption expenditures in the
CEX, and the implications of measurement error in consumption for inference.
       We use data from the Family and Detailed Expenditure files of the Consumer Ex-
penditure Survey (CEX) to make an unbalanced, overlapping panel of households that
contains consumption data from December 1981 to February 1998, with some periods
omitted due to changes in the survey.11 The Bureau of Labor statistics constructs the
CEX data from a series of interviews based on a stratified random sample of the U.S.
population. Unless a household attrits, it is interviewed five times, once every three
  11
       The 1997 files include data on household expenditures for all three-month interview periods starting
in 1997, so that the data we use cover up to and including February of 1998. We use both the raw
data files and SAS files available from Lorna Greening at: ftp://elsa.berkeley.edu/pub/ices/. We omit
1980 and 1981 data because it is of significantly worse quality. Due to decennial survey changes, we
cannot match consumption growth to the first three months of 1986 or 1996. When decomposing
consumption growth we also drop the three observations on consumption growth across 1987 to 1988
and the three across 1995 to 1996 due to large increases in the variance of consumption growth in there
periods due to changes in the survey instrument. Finally, when decomposing consumption growth,
we drop the observation in which t + 1 ends in July 1996 due to several strange factors. It has a
variance of consumption growth similar to a survey change, and it has the largest mean movement in
several preference categories. This inclusion of this single observation does not substantively alter our
inference. This leaves 16 years and three months less two months of observations in levels, for a time
dimension of 177 three-month to three-month growth rates and a pre-sample of 6 months.



                                                     15
months. In a household’s first interview, the CEX procedures are explained to the
members of the household and they are asked to keep track of their expenditures for
future interviews. In each subsequent interview, detailed information is collected on
the past three months’ consumption expenditures. New households replace those that
leave the sample on a monthly basis, so that while consumption observations cover three
months, the data are eﬀectively monthly. In each family’s second and fifth interviews,
demographic and income data are collected, including income and earnings information
about the previous 12 months. This information is updated if it changes during the
course of the survey year. In a household’s final interview, a set of questions about
assets is asked, including the amount by which wealth changed over the previous 12
months.
       We define consumption as the sum of expenditures on food, alcoholic beverages,
apparel and apparel services, gasoline and motor oil used in transportation, public
transportation, entertainment, personal care, and reading.12 Data are deflated by the
consumer price index for each category of consumption for the Census region in which
the household resides.
       The real interest rate is the expected return on a three-month U.S. Treasury bill
less the constructed, household-specific inflation rates based on the deflation method
described above. Thus, estimation uses a household-specific real interest rate even
though we consider the same asset for all households. We use monthly data, averaged
to generate real interest rates covering three-month to three-month periods.13
       ET,λ=0 [.|Zi,t ] and ẽi,t+1 are estimated from linear regressions on instruments Zi,t that
the household might use to forecast future wealth, preferences, and risk, for a sample of
households deemed unlikely to be constrained. Households are counted as unconstrained
  12
       Other categories that might be included that we do not include are: tobacco, because it is addictive;
household operations, because it includes repairs of furniture, appliances, computers, etc. as well as
day care expenses including tuition; and utilities, because, apart from phone, these are to a large extent
determined by one’s housing choice.

     As discussed in Hall (1988).

if they have more than 3, 000 1982 − 84 dollars in wealth in saving accounts, checking
accounts, government bonds, stocks, and mutual funds, less debts, as of the start of their
first report of expenditures. We also include any household reporting topcoded wealth
in the final interview in this sample. Due to a large amount of missing wealth data, this
split leads to only one quarter of the sample being clearly unconstrained — an implausibly
small share of the population. Accordingly, we supplement this sample by using prior
information about the characteristics of households in the economy that are likely to
face binding liquidity constraints. Households are also counted as unconstrained if they
have at least some college education and have age greater than 45.14 These allocation
rules impose that half the sample of households are unconstrained.
       All instruments are constructed so that they are in the household information set
at the start of period t.15 Zi,t contains: a quadratic function of age, month indicator
variables, four education indicator variables, and four aggregate forecast variables — the
expected unemployment rate at t + 1, its change from t, and expected real and nominal
interest rates at t + 1, all interacted with five family types.16 That is, ẽi,t+1 is the fitted
value from 5 separate regressions of εi,t+1 on age, age squared, month and education
dummy variables, and the four aggregate variables. The aggregate instruments are
forecasts constructed from rolling regressions.17 In all of our analysis, we eliminate the
variation due to month.
       ET [.|Zt ] and ẽt+1 are estimated via regression using the aggregate variables: a con-
stant, the four forecasts of aggregate variables, month indicators, and twice lagged
  14
       Meghir and Weber (1996) and Japelli, Pischke, and Souleles (1998) suggest that these character-
istics are good indicators of lack of liquidity constraints.
   15
      This allows for the possibility of time aggregation.
   16
      The education groups are some high school, high school graduate, some college, college graduate.
Edcucation is assigned on the basis of the male head if present, otherwise on the basis of the female
head. The family types are single, single parent with children, married couple, married couple with
children, unrelated individuals.
  17
     The rolling regressions use the variable’s own lags and monthly data for the post-war period to
construct ET [xt+1 ] for the three month period covered by t + 1 given only information available at the
start of period t − 1.


                                                   17
(uninstrumented) real interest rate series. The seasonal variation is removed in all
analyses.
       We are forced to drop any observations missing the required consumption data,
variables that shift marginal utility, or instruments used to proxy expectations. Rural
households are dropped, as are households living in student housing. We drop observa-
tions in which the gender of the head of the household remains the same and the head
or spouse changes age by more than a year or less than no years in between interviews.
Only households for which the age of the head and spouse are less than 85 and greater
than 21 are included. We drop observations reporting family size changes greater than
3. The final data set contains 148, 117 observations on consumption growth.
       One important advantage of the data and one important shortcoming aﬀect the
decomposition.
       The advantage is that by using household data, we remove composition biases that
are present in aggregate consumption data that lead to predictable movements in con-
sumption growth.18 We analyze average consumption growth across a subset of house-
holds,
                                          Ag         1

Thus we omit households who are born or die, and do not incorrectly assign predictable
movements in consumption due to births and deaths to precautionary saving or other
sources, as could be mistakenly done using aggregate data.19 Moreover, aggregate
consumption data also contain many expenditures which are not truly nondurable con-
sumption. We select items for consumption that better reflect nondurable and services
consumption than National Income data.
  18
       Attanasio and Weber (1993) discuss the importance of this issue.
  19
       However, there is little evidence that these population dynamics are important for fluctuations in
consumption growth (Parker (1999)).


                                                      18
       The shortcoming is that the consumption expenditures of each household are mea-
sures with a significant amount of error. The standard deviation of the growth of
household expenditures on nondurable consumption is 36%. Most researchers believe
that the majority of this movement does not represent shifts in preferences or actual risk
to marginal utility, but is due to the diﬃculty in collecting data and the diﬀerence be-
tween the concept of consumption and the observed expenditures. That is, consumption
can vary due to omitted or over-reported expenses. To partly deal with this, we drop
the bottom one percent of households in the distribution of real consumption per eﬀec-
tive householder.20 In addition, we drop the top and bottom 2.5 percent of households
in the distribution of consumption growth, on the grounds that these observations are
more likely to represent mismeasurement than actual movements in marginal utility.21
       Does the mismeasurement of consumption bias our decomposition? Measurement
error in consumption does bias upward two statistics: the mean of consumption growth
due to incomplete markets and the variance of the movements in consumption due to
new information. But measurement error biases only these two statistics. Under plau-
sible assumptions, measurement error does not alter the contribution of precautionary
saving, preferences, or the real interest rate to changes in the growth rate of consump-
tion. For this reason, this paper focuses on changes in consumption growth and not
mean consumption growth.
       To make these claims concrete, let the measurement be classical, additive in logs:

       ∗
where Ci,t is the true level of consumption, Ci,t is the observed measure, and µi,t+1 is the
measurement error. Further, let the measurement error be independent of conditioning
  20
       For this exercise only, eﬀective household size is defined as one, plus one if there is a spouse present,
plus 0.4 times each additional family member. The first percentile in the distribution is predicted by
a constant and a time trend and observations below this fitted value are dropped. The fitted values
range from 190 to 230 real 1982-1984 dollars per eﬀective household member per three months.
  21
     These are reasonably standard procedures for dealing with the extreme outliers in the data.

tion growth due to precautionary saving, plug observed consumption growth into the

5. The proximate causes of consumption growth for unconstrained
      households

This section studies the consumption growth of households that are not liquidity con-
strained, as determined by the criteria just described. The contribution of precautionary
saving to consumption volatility is statistically significant, but the decomposition leaves
a range of uncertainty as to the economic importance of precautionary saving. Our mea-
sure of expected consumption growth due to precautionary saving covaries positively
with expected changes in government spending. Further, there is some evidence that
precautionary saving is countercyclical, consistent with consumption risk being high in
recessions.
      In order to give a robust picture of the role of precautionary saving in consumption
growth, we report results for several diﬀerent utility functions. First, σ and δ are es-
timated by GMM using grouped panel-data and the time-series moments implied by
the consumption Euler equation. Variables that shift the preference for consumption
(Xi,t+1 ) include indicator variables for the month of the year to capture seasonal varia-
tions in demand. Since reported consumption declines slightly with each interview that
a household participates in, preferences are allowed to vary by interview. We allow
discount rates to diﬀer by five-year birth cohorts. The number of family members and
the number of children are both included because they shift the marginal utility of a
given amount of expenditure. Finally, to control for the possibility that labor supply is
non-separable from the marginal utility of consumption, the number of hours that the
woman head of household works is included as a preference shifter. The intertemporal
elasticity of substitution is estimated relatively precisely as 0.652 with standard error of
0.14, although there is also significant specification uncertainty. Appendix C describes
the GMM estimator and estimates in greater detail. Having estimated the utility func-
tion, it is possible that misspecification of preferences is minimal, so we present analyses
of consumption growth with and without the correction for misspecification.22
 22
      Overidentification tests do not reject the model. However, misspecification could potentially remain


                                                    21
    The second approach is calibration. We analyze three diﬀerent intertemporal elastic-
ities of substitution: 0.3, 0.65. and 1 (log utility). In each case we include no preference
shifters, so that it is reasonable to believe that the misspecification adjustment is cap-
turing preference variation. Therefore, as noted in section 3, the consumption growth
due to misspecification is treated as consumption growth due to preference changes.
For the decompositions based on estimation, the variation in consumption growth due
to misspecification is omitted. In all cases, seasonal variation is removed.
    Table 1 shows, for our sample of unconstrained households, the share of variation
in consumption growth due to innovations to consumption growth and the share of
predictable variation due to preferences, the real interest rate, and precautionary saving.
Before turning to predictable consumption growth, note that 90 percent or more of the
variance of average consumption growth in the CEX is due to news or measurement
error, evidence that we are not overfitting in predicting consumption growth. This large
number stems from the fact that aggregate consumption growth is diﬃcult to forecast
with few instruments, and from the fact that measurement error in the CEX leads to
unpredictable changes in average consumption growth.
    Table 1 demonstrates that precautionary saving causes a statistically significant
share of the volatility of expected consumption growth, and that there is a wide range
of uncertainty concerning the economic importance of precautionary saving. Innova-
tions to consumption growth are, by construction, orthogonal to the other components
of consumption growth; however, the predictable series are not mutually uncorrelated.
Therefore the share of variation due to any series depends on the ordering of the series
in the variance decomposition. Table 1 presents two alternative orderings for each set
of parameters. After the correction for misspecification, the GMM estimates of the per-
cent of variation in predictable consumption growth due to precautionary saving range
a concern as the estimates from this model are used to construct our measure of precautionary savings at
an individual household level, rather than at the synthetic cohort level at which estimates of preferences
were obtained. That the Euler equation holds for a synthetic cohort is necessary but not suﬃcient for
it to be satisfied by an individual household.



                                                   22
from 2.5 to 95 percent. For the results based on calibration — which treat misspecifi-
cation as preference variation — estimates of the economic importance of precautionary
saving range from 1.4 percent to 37 percent. In contrast, the first row of results, which
omit the correction for possible misspecification suggest that precautionary saving is
far more economically important, directly causing 70 to 80 percent of variation in ex-
pected consumption growth. But as emphasized in section 3, the presence of model
misspecification inflates this measure by construction. The results with the correction
for misspecification show that the importance of precautionary saving is significantly
less, or at least more uncertain, when the predictable component of the error term is
removed.23
       Given this range of uncertainty, is there a statistically significant contribution of
precautionary saving to the volatility of consumption growth? The last column of
Table 1 reports the probability that there is no variation due to precautionary saving;
that is the p-value for an F-test that the true coeﬃcients in the regression constructing
the expectation in equation (3.8) are all zero. Fluctuations in consumption due to
precautionary saving are statistically significant in all cases except the raw residuals
from GMM estimation.
       The reason for the wide range of uncertainty over the economic importance of precau-
tionary saving is itself informative. Expected consumption growth due to precautionary
saving is negatively correlated with that due to preference variation and positively cor-
related with that due to movements in the real interest rate. These correlations are
large, and this is what drives the uncertainty over relative importance. The positive
covariance between consumption growth due to the real interest rate and that due to
  23
       Also, comparing the second and fourth sets of results shows the eﬀect of assuming that expected
consumption growth due to misspecification is actually due to preference variation. The GMM esti-
mates assume that estimated preferences capture all true preference variation and omit the misspecifi-
cation series from the decomposition. The calibration assumes that misspecification captures omitted
preference variation. When we include the misspecification as preference variation, the correlation of
precautionary saving and preferences decreases and the role of precautionary saving is better pinned
down.


                                                   23
precautionary saving implies that omission of the precautionary term from a regression
of consumption growth on the expected real interest rate would increase rather than
decrease the estimated elasticity of intertemporal substitution. We also find that con-
sumption growth due to shifts in the preference for consumption covaries negatively
with that due to the real interest rate. Thus low observed intertemporal substitution
in response to the real interest rate, as observed by Hall (1988) for example, is largely
due to omitted preference shifters or misspecification of the consumption optimization
problem more generally.24 Put diﬀerently, since precautionary saving leads to higher
consumption growth when the interest rate is higher, precautionary saving cannot be
the cause of low observed intertemporal substitution. This supports models in which
expected changes in consumption growth are caused by nonseparabilities of nondurable
consumption and home production, consumption of durable goods, or leisure.25
       Table 1 also shows that the economic importance of precautionary saving is larger
the larger the assumed level of household risk aversion and prudence. Lower values of
σ, the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, imply a more important contribution of
precautionary saving to predictable consumption growth. This occurs because σ also
governs relative risk aversion ( σ1 ) and relative prudence (1 + σ1 ). A low elasticity of
intertemporal substitution implies high risk aversion and high prudence.
       Figure 1 displays the three time series of expected consumption growth for both the
GMM estimates and the calibration with σ = 0.65. The data are quarterly averages
converted to annual rates, and apart from the series for preferences, are visually similar
across panels. The primary diﬀerence between the figures is due to the misspecification
adjustment, which is included in the preference series in Figure 1b and omitted in
Figure 1a. There is a significant amount of predictable variation in consumption growth
  24
       This supports one of the main findings of Attanasio and Weber (1995) and Attanasio and Weber
(1993). These papers also argue that correct aggregation is an important part of the diﬀerence between
linear models in micro and macro data.

“explained” by the nonstructural construction of ET,λ=0 [εi,t+1 |Zi,t ] , but unexplained by
the more structural utility function used in the GMM estimation.
   In both panels, we see some evidence that precautionary saving has become less
important over the sample, contributing less to consumption growth. This is consistent
with the increase in wealth and economic boom of the 1982 − 1997 period and suggests
that decreased risk has a role in the consumption boom (see Parker (1999)). We also see
that risk contributes substantially to consumption growth after the large 1982 recession,
consistent with consumption dropping in recessions due to increased consumption risk in
the future. There is no similarly dramatic pattern observed around the 1991 recession,
though consumption growth due to precautionary saving rises before the recession, and
falls during and after it, with somewhat more accentuated movements in Figure 1b.
   These are visual impressions. To be more formal, Table 2 presents the results of
investigating precautionary saving by regressing expected consumption growth due to
precautionary saving onto: the contemporaneous expected change in the unemploy-
ment rate, the contemporaneous expected growth in government spending, and lagged
innovations to the federal funds rate.
   The first column shows that precautionary saving leads to countercyclical expected
consumption growth, although this is statistically insignificant. The point estimates
imply that an expected one percent increase in the prime-age male unemployment rate
is associated with 0.1 to 0.2 percent faster consumption growth due to consumption
risk. The sign of the eﬀect supports our theoretical understanding of precautionary
saving — when the unemployment rate is expected to increase there is greater risk and
therefore precautionary saving should be high and expected consumption growth should
be greater.
   The second and third columns of Table 2 present some reduced form evidence on
precautionary saving and macroeconomic policy. Theoretically, there are two channels
through which economists have considered policy changing consumption risk and pre-
cautionary saving. First, expansionary policy can lead to less consumption risk, so that
consumption increases when the policy is announced and then is expected to grow more

                                            25
slowly over time. This eﬀect is not consistent with the observed impulse responses of
consumption to monetary policy shocks, for example, which show faster consumption
growth for a while after a reduction in the real interest rate (Bernanke and Gertler
(1995)). If instead policy is going to cause precautionary saving to increase consump-
tion growth, it must be that expansionary policy leads to increased consumption risk.
For example, if policy improves expectations of future income, households increase con-
sumption on announcement reducing their stocks of liquid wealth, and this leads to
higher consumption risk and faster consumption growth.26 To evaluate these theories,
we ask how consumption growth due to precautionary saving responds to predictable
movements in government spending and lagged monetary policy shocks.
       An expected one percent higher growth rate of government spending is associated
with a one-quarter to three-quarter of a percent faster consumption growth due to
precautionary saving. This is consistent with pre-announced increases in government
spending leading to faster consumption growth due to precautionary saving. As to
monetary policy, we find no statistically significant relationship between consumption
growth due to precautionary saving and 12 lags of monthly monetary policy shocks as
constructed by Bernanke and Mihov (1998), although the sign of the eﬀect is positive,
consistent with the impact of a monetary policy shock on total expected consumption
growth.
       In sum, we find a statistically significant role for precautionary saving, some evidence
that it has declined and is countercyclical, and conclude that its economic impact is both
similar to that of the real interest rate and similarly uncertain in magnitude. We turn
now from the sample of unconstrained households, in which we are studying the eﬀects
of precautionary saving, to the entire sample, in which our measure of consumption
growth due to incomplete markets may include the impact of liquidity constraints.
  26
       In models such as Carroll (1997), higher expected income growth leads to higher expected con-
sumption growth through precautionary saving.




                                                  26
6. The proximate causes of consumption growth

This section presents the results from a similar set of exercises as the previous section,
but performed on the data for all households. We find that expected consumption
growth due to incomplete markets is directly responsible for a slightly larger share of
consumption growth in the entire population than for only unconstrained households.
Indeed, there is evidence that incomplete markets were a more important determinant
of consumption dynamics in the 1991 recession for all households than for unconstrained
households alone. Furthermore, consumption growth due to incomplete markets is more
countercyclical for all households than for unconstrained households alone, and has no
significant comovement with our policy variables. These results must be interpreted
with care. There is a large negative correlation between expected consumption growth
due to incomplete markets and that due to misspecification. The misspecification ad-
justment induces significant movement in the incomplete markets series. The economic
interpretation of this finding is that, for all households, preference shifters (or mis-
specification) interact in important ways with incomplete markets. We give a concrete
example below.
   Table 3 presents the variance decomposition of consumption growth for all house-
holds. Similar to the findings in the smaller, unconstrained sample, expected consump-
tion growth due to incomplete markets is highly statistically significant. Slightly more
than 90 percent of consumption growth is unpredictable. Unlike for unconstrained
households alone, the corrected estimates from the GMM estimation (second set of re-
sults) imply that precautionary saving and liquidity constraints together are directly
responsible for a reasonably precise 52 to 69 percent of the predictable consumption
growth. If however, one views all the predictable variation in the constructed expec-
tation error as due to preferences then the measured eﬀect of incomplete markets is
smaller. The calibration results show a lower contribution of incomplete markets, and
a greater level of uncertainty as to its role in fluctuations. As is the case for the uncon-
strained sample, expected consumption growth due to precautionary saving negatively


                                            27
covaries with that due to preference variation, and this covariance rises when “mis-
specification” is included as preferences changes. Across specifications, the percent of
variation in predictable consumption growth due to incomplete markets ranges from 1.5
to 69 percent.
      Figure 2 displays the three time series of expected consumption growth for the
GMM estimates (Panel A) and the calibration with σ = 0.65 (Panel B). Again, incom-
plete markets and the real interest rate each lead to similar fluctuations in consump-
tion growth in each panel. Adding the misspecification correction to preferences in
Panel B leads to volatile consumption growth due to changing preferences that is more
negatively correlated with consumption growth due to incomplete markets. Why is
this? One answer is simply that ET,λ=0 [εi,t+1 |Zi,t ] is estimated only using unconstrained
households but used in the construction of ∆ ln d  C IM for all households (equation (3.8)).
                                                   t+1

Statistically, the predicted values out of sample create this negative correlation. But
a second answer is that there are good economic reasons for these predictions to be
poor out of sample: constrained households are diﬀerent. The presence of a binding
liquidity constraint leads a household to adjust margins besides consumption and this
can lead to exactly this type of negative covariance. For example, consider a young
constrained household that increases labor supply in response to the constraint. As
the constraint relaxes, labor supply declines predictably, leading to slower desired con-
sumption growth due to preference shifts, while consumption growth rises predictably
due to the constraint relaxing. The large negative correlation suggests this is what is
happening: preference shifters and liquidity constraints lead to oﬀsetting movements
in expected consumption growth.27 Given the magnitude of the negative correlation,
we suspect the negative correlation is not purely due to economic behavior, but is also
partly driven by imperfect prediction.
      That said, like Figure 1, Figure 2 shows some evidence that precautionary saving
and liquidity constraints have become less important over the time period covered by
the data, contributing less to consumption growth. Comparing Figures 1 and 2, this
 27
      See alsoAppendix B.


                                            28
decline appears slightly larger for all households than for only liquid households. Also,
liquidity constraints or precautionary saving of low wealth households seem to have
played a role in maintaining consumption growth in the 1991 recession. Again, these
are visual impressions. Table 4 reports the results of regressing consumption growth
due to incomplete markets onto the same set of variables as Table 2.
   First, incomplete markets lead to countercyclical expected consumption growth.
The point estimates imply that an expected one percent increase in the prime-age male
unemployment rate is associated with just over a one percent higher rate of expected
consumption growth rate. This eﬀect is larger than that estimated for unconstrained
households alone, implying that precautionary saving is more important for low wealth
households. Larger increases in consumption risk for low wealth households could be
due to the fact that unemployment falls more heavily on lower income households or that
credit constraints are tighter when unemployment is expected to rise, so that borrowing
to smooth consumption becomes more diﬃcult. Either way, the estimates imply that
incomplete markets amplify business cycle movements in consumption. Consumption
risk increases and/or borrowing constraints tighten upon news of a coming recession
and therefore incomplete markets for transferring consumption across time and states
amplify the decline in consumption that occurs on this news.
   The remaining columns of Table 4 show that both our measures of policy have
insignificant correlations with expected consumption growth due to incomplete mar-
kets. Unlike for unconstrained households, the impact is not consistently of one sign.
There is no evidence that the combination of liquidity constraints and precautionary
saving amplify or damp the impact of government spending or monetary policy on total
consumption growth.


7. Conclusion

This paper proposes and implements a decomposition of consumption growth into its
proximate causes. We show how the utility function and consumption data can be used


                                           29
to source movements in consumption growth and demonstrate how to measure the role of
precautionary saving in a manner robust to some misspecification. Using estimates and
calibrations for a standard utility function, we implement this decomposition using the
CEX survey data on household expenditures. In sum, we find that incomplete markets
for trading future consumption cause statistically important movements in expected
consumption growth and that the economic importance of precautionary saving rivals
that of the interest rate.
   For households that are unlikely to be liquidity constrained, expected consumption
growth is sourced to movements in the real interest rate, changes in the preference
for consumption, and precautionary saving. We find that the impact of precaution-
ary saving on variations in consumption growth is statistically significant. While the
magnitude is rather uncertain, the variance of predictable movements in consumption
that are due to movements in precautionary saving is if anything slightly less than the
variance due to movements in the real interest rate. There is some evidence, although
imprecise, that precautionary saving is countercyclical, leading to higher consumption
growth when unemployment rates are increasing. And there is some evidence that high
expected growth in government spending is associated with greater consumption growth
due to precautionary saving.
   For average consumption growth, incomplete markets are more important for fluctu-
ations in expected consumption growth. Precautionary saving and liquidity constraints
are highly statistically significant, and cause movements in consumption that are posi-
tively correlated with movements due to the real interest rate and negatively correlated
with movements due to preferences or “misspecification.” Consumption growth due
to incomplete markets is countercyclical, and so amplifies recessions, but we find no
evidence that it is correlated with past policy.
   We suspect that measurement error in consumption growth limits our ability to infer
the characteristics of consumption growth. Better measurement (or data in which with
longer growth rates can be studied) would allow a tighter decomposition and a more
accurate mapping from primitive shocks to subsequent movements in precautionary

                                           30
saving. Better measurement may also allow analysis of trend growth rates. Of specific
interest is the variation across countries in consumption growth rates, which are largely
unexplained by variations in real interest rates. Our decomposition suggests a way to
use microeconomic data to measure the diﬀerences in consumption risk across countries
into implied diﬀerences in expected growth rates of consumption.

Expanding the second logarithm around θi,t = 1, one can see that this measure is correct to
the first order but not higher. Under this alternative, θi,t raised to powers would show up in
our measure of precautionary saving.

B.     Liquidity constraints and the decomposition


This appendix shows that the incomplete markets series contains movements in consumption
growth due to liquidity constraints and how the presence of binding liquidity constraints alters
the interpretation of this series.
       Suppose that for a constrained household, omitted preference shifters are predicted by
variables in Zi,t with the same coeﬃcients as for an unconstrained household. That is, assume
that the true model is given by equation (3.1) and that the function of Zi,t , Eλ=0 [εi,t+1 |Zi,t ] =
 1
θi,t
       − 1, independent of λ. For constrained households the (theoretical) robust measure of
consumption growth due to incomplete markets is

which is the quantity of interest.
       Is it plausible that ET,λ=0 [εi,t+1 |·] is not a function of λ? Suppose that a binding liquidity
constraint causes an increase in labor supply. Suppose further that hours worked is omitted

                                                        33
from Xi,t and that hours worked do not otherwise vary with Zi,t . Then, this condition fails:
the change in the expected growth rate of consumption due to the change in hours is allocated
to liquidity constraints. To see this more formally, let θ−1 (λ, Zi,t ) be the predicted value of
θ−1
 i,t for a household as a function of liquidity constraint and other characteristics.

C.    GMM estimation of the parameters of the utility function


This appendix describes the estimation of the parameters of the utility function by GMM.
The estimator uses grouped CEX data, as in Attanasio and Weber (1995), and the nonlinear
theoretical moments implied by equation (2.3), as pioneered using aggregate data by Hansen
and Singleton (1982).

C.1. The moments

Given J instruments, the Euler equation implies J moment conditions for each household:
                                  · µ                             ¶¸

                                                     Ci,t
where E[ ] is the mathematical (unconditional) expectations operator and where

      h δ, σ, Xi,t+1 ,        , Zi,t ≡ exp (Xi,t+1 δ)                Ri,t+1 − 1 Zi,t .     (C.2)
                        Ci,t                             Ci,t

Given ideal data, we would use the estimator

                                (δ̂, σ̂) ≡ arg min g(δ, σ; Y)0 Ωg(δ, σ; Y)                 (C.3)

                                                     34
where Y denotes the stacked matrix of all data, Ω is a JI by JI weighting matrix and
g(δ, σ; Y ) is the JI by 1 column vector of the empirical counterparts to each theoretical
moment in equation (C.1). g(δ, σ; Y ) consists of I stacked J × 1 column vectors of
                                           Ti  µ                             ¶
                                       1 X                     Ci,t+1
                        gi (δ, σ, Y) =        h δ, σ, Xi,t+1 ,        , Zi,t                 (C.4)
                                       Ti t=1                   Ci,t

where Ti is the number of observations available for household i.
       We do not directly use equations (C.3) and (C.4) for three reasons.
       First, the consistency of this estimator requires that the empirical moments converge to the
theoretical moments, which, as is clear from (C.4), happens only as the time dimension on each
household becomes large. In the CEX, Ti is fixed at a maximum value of three. Since T is so
small, the properties of the estimator proposed in (C.4) are not reliably approximated by the
asymptotic distribution. The CEX data does however contain short sequences of overlapping
consumption growth of diﬀerent households covering a long time period. We therefore use a
weaker restriction and estimate our model from the restriction that average of the expectation
errors across all households average to zero over time,28 formally:
                            "        µ                             ¶#
                            1 X                      Ci,t+1
                         E          h δ, σ, Xi,t+1 ,        , Zi,t    = 0.                   (C.5)
                           I(t) i∈I                   Ci,t
                                     t


Condition (C.5) is implied by (C.1) but does not imply (C.1).
       Second, household-level characteristics and particularly consumption growth are measured
with error in the CEX. When consumption growth is measured with substantial error, and
when the model is overidentified so that the moments are not all set to zero, the intertemporal
elasticity of substitution, σ , is biased upwards by measurement error in consumption growth.
This follows because measurement error increases the variance of the constructed innovation
to marginal utility. Since, in finite samples, there is some covariance between the instruments
and this residual, the estimation procedure raises σ to lower the variance of the innovation and
thus the covariance with the moments. We address this issue and the third issue by partially
aggregating the data.
  28
    A better assumption would be that the expectation errors of similar households average
to zero, but non-linear estimation does not converge with more moments.

                                                 35
    Before proceeding however, it is worth noting that the estimate is consistent. Under the
assumptions on measurement error used in the main body of the paper, substituting the
observed consumption series into our theoretical moment condition yields

If the true parameters are δ 0 = (δ 01 , δ 02 , . . ., δ 0K )0 and σ 0 , then the probability limits of the
parameters that set the moment to zero when the consumption data are mismeasured are
(δ 01 − ϕ, δ 02 , . . ., δ 0K )0 and σ 0 . GMM does not estimate consistently δ 1 — the mean level
of impatience across households — but it does estimate consistently the remaining structural
parameters of interest.
    Third, the theoretical moments are too many to feasibly use in estimation. There are J
(the number of predetermined variables) times I (the number of households) moment con-
ditions and the predetermined variables may include individual information, aggregate vari-
ables, and characteristics of the distribution of individual variables. In an economy in which
markets are incomplete, the evolution of the aggregate economy generally depends upon the
distribution of wealth and income in the economy. In the extreme case, it may be that the
information set that each household uses to form expectations contains its own household-level
characteristics and the household-level characteristics of all other households in the economy.
    We address these issues by partially aggregating the data. We assume that the economy
consists of N groups of households that are able to pool their resources within each group to
insure their risks completely from all shocks, except those that aﬀect the group average. This
assumption is made because it renders the estimator feasible: groups are observed over long

time periods and averaging reduces the impact of measurement error.29 We construct the

mitigating the impact of measurement error. As to the subset of instruments, we assume that
Zn,t contains only information on group n’s average characteristics and aggregate information.
       Our final estimator, based on the theoretical moment given in equation (C.5) but with
groups, n, instead of households, is (C.3) where Ω̂−1 is J × J and g(δ, σ; Y ) is the J × 1

C.2. The weighting matrix and inference

We is the optimal weighting matrix so that the asymptotic distribution of estimator defined
by equations (C.3) and (C.6) is normal with variance-covariance matrix given by

                                                                   −1
                                                  (G0 ΩG)

where                                      µ                                        ¶
                                        dg (δ, σ, Y) dg (δ, σ, Y)
                                     G=             ,
                                             dδ          dσ
and
                                       Ω = E [g(β, σ; Y)g(β, σ; Y)0 ] .                                              (C.7)

We construct an empirical counterpart to Ω, denoted Ω̂ that allows for an arbitrary de-
gree of correlation across households within any time period. By allowing for this arbitrary
correlation, we make inference consistently when there is an unknown degree of market in-
completeness. Since it is possible that the decision period of the household is finer than the
  29
    Even in the presence of true panel data with a large time dimension this assumption may
be required. Attanasio and Low (2000) show that group averaging improves the empirical
performance of GMM estimation of the linear consumption Euler equation even when the
true economy has no insurance of individual income shocks.

                                                          37
period observed in the data, we also allow for arbitrary covariance among all innovations that
share any of the months from which consumption growth is calculated. This flexible form also
accounts for the adjustment that is necessary to compensate for the temporal correlation for
any single group induced by mismeasurement of consumption. Finally, we allow for arbitrary
heteroskedasticity across all observations.
    Consider a household for whom consumption growth is observed from the three months
ending in t − 3 to the thee months ending in t. This datum is constructed from monthly
observations from t − 5 through to t. It follows that all household observations for which
the last month of an observed growth in consumption falls anywhere between t − 5 to t + 5
could potentially be correlated with our original household due to a common eﬀect from an
aggregate shock or consumption insurance.
    For notational simplicity, first define a scalar expectation error for each group as εn,t+1 ≡
             ³            ´− σ̃1
 Xn,t+1 δ̃       Cn,t+t             f

                                   Ri,t+1 − 1 where δ̃ and σ̃ are estimates from a first-stage estimation that
sets Ω̂ = I . Second, let N be the number of cohorts; Tj the number of periods for which
cohort j is observed;Tij the number of periods over which both cohorts i and j are observed;
and Zi,t the instrument vector for individual i at time t.
    Our estimate of Ω̂ is:

                          N j>i Tj t=v+1
and α1 and α2 are weights to ensure the positive definiteness of the estimated variance-
covariance matrix. Thus Pv captures the set of possible correlations within a given cohort
(other than variance); and Pv the set of possible correlations between cohorts. Finally we
note that if markets are complete and groups fully insure consumption risk across groups,
then contemporaneous cross-correlations should be unity apart from measurement error. This


                                                             38
weighting matrix insures that, if this is the case, the optimal estimate and its variance co-
variance matrix are asymptotically the same an estimate derived from the model in which all
households are assumed part of the same insurance group and N = 1.

C.3. Instruments used in estimation

In selecting instruments, Zn,t , we choose variables that the household might use to forecast fu-
ture wealth or preferences and/or that are relevant for predicting income risk. All instruments
are constructed so that they are in the household information set at the start of period t for
group n, allowing for time aggregation. We assume that households know the group-average
change in family size and number of children that will occur between t and t + 1, so these
variables are included in Zn,t . The instrument set includes the indicator variables for month
and interview that are included in preferences, as well as the cohort indicators when they are
included in preferences. We include a set of average information about the household: two
indicator variables for whether a male head is present and whether a female head is present;
four indicators for the possible states of married/single and with and without children; three
indicator variables for whether there is a working male head, female head, or other; age; age
squared; an indicator for older than 45; two indicator variables for whether there is a male or
female head who is retired; two indicator variables for whether there is a male or female head
who is a government employee; six indicator variables for whether there is a male of female
head with less education than a high school degree, a high school degree, and some college but
not a degree. We include six aggregate variables. The instruments contain the real interest
rate for t − 1 and its lag, and 4 variables that are out-of-sample predictions constructed from
rolling regressions using monthly data from period t − 1: the log of the unemployment rate
for t + 1 and its first diﬀerence; the real and nominal interest rates in the last month of t + 1
(deflated using the NIPA aggregate deflator).

C.4. Parameter Estimates

We group households into 5-year birth cohorts, as done in Attanasio and Weber (1995), but
estimate a nonlinear Euler equation. At this level of grouping, there are 33 birth cohorts and


                                               39
1, 901 observations. Parameter estimates are summarized in Table A1, and the first column of
results is those we use in the paper. The intertemporal elasticity of substitution is estimated
to be 0.65 and statistically significantly. The coeﬃcients on change in family size, change in
number of children and change in female hours worked, the set of cohort dummies, and the set
of seasonal dummies, are all economically and statistically significant. The specification tests
do not reject the model (the Hansen J-statistic has p-value 0.56). The estimated σ is quite
similar if we instead define cohorts by one year birth groups or interact the five-year groups
with four education categories. The demographics remain significant, but are less stable. At
still finer definitions of cohort, estimated σ rise or the estimator does not converge. The model
has similar behavior is cohort eﬀects are not included. If we estimate the model in linearized
form (ignoring precautionary saving), estimates of σ typically decline to half their previous
values. In the linear model, our estimated coeﬃcients on the demographic variables and labor
supply variable are a little smaller than those in Attanasio and Weber (1995), although both
sets of estimates vary substantially by specification.

Note: The GMM (raw) series is constructed without applying the either correction for misspecification or for small-
sample bias; the remaining rows do apply this correction. The decompositions for the GMM estimates do not include
the movement in consumption due to predictable variation in the innovation to marginal utility -- the misspecification
correction described in the main text; the remaining decompositions include this movement in the preferences series.
