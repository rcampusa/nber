                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper we examine the link between retrospectively reported measures of childhood health and
the prevalence of various major and minor diseases at older ages. Our analysis is based on comparable
retrospective questionnaires placed in the Health and Retirement Study and the English Longitudinal
Study of Ageing – nationally representative surveys of the age 50 plus population in America and
England respectively. We show that the origins of poorer adult health among older Americans compared
to the English trace right back into the childhood years – the American middle and old-age population
report higher rates of specific childhood health conditions than their English counterparts. The transmission
into poor health in mid life and older ages of these higher rates of childhood illnesses also appears
to be higher in America compared to England. Both factors contribute to higher rates of adult illness
in the United States compared to England although even in combination they do not explain the full
extent of the country difference in late-life health outcomes.

Introduction


       International comparisons of health have risen in importance as a method of gaining

insight into social and economic determinants of health status. Partly, this is due to the recent

discovery and documentation of large unexplained differences in morbidity health outcomes that

suggest that Americans are much sicker than their Western European counterparts (Banks,

Marmot, Oldfield, and Smith, 2006; Avendano et al, 2009). In a set of recent papers, we

compared disease prevalence among middle age adults 55-64 and at older ages in England and in

the US (Banks Marmot, Oldfield and Smith (2006, 2009); Banks, Muriel and Smith (2010);

Banks, Berkman, and Smith, 2011). Based on self-reported prevalence of seven important

illnesses (diabetes, heart attack, hypertension, heart disease, cancer, diseases of the lung, and

stroke), Americans were much less healthy than their English counterparts. These differences

were large at all points of the SES distribution.

       Biological markers of disease showed similar health disparities between Americans and

the English, suggesting that these large health differences were not a result of differential

reporting of illness. We also found that these health differences existed with equal force among

both men and women (Banks, Marmot, Oldfield, and Smith. 2009). Since we purposely excluded

minorities (African-Americans and Latinos in American and non-Whites in England), these

differences were not solely due to health issues in the minority or immigrant population.

Moreover, these disparities in prevalence of chronic illness were also not the consequence of

differences between the two countries in conventional risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and

drinking – estimates of health disparities were essentially unchanged when we controlled for

different levels of these risk factors in America and in England. Models of diabetes prevalence

which controlled for both BMI and waist circumference displayed much reduced country

differences (Banks, Kumari, Smith and Zaninotto, 2011). However, the extent to which this can

be interpreted as an ‘explanation’ of cross-country diabetes differences is somewhat limited if

one views raised waist circumference for a given BMI as part of the fundamental etiology of

diabetes. We still have to be able to explain why- for given levels of obesity- Americans have

larger waists than the English. All in all, therefore, it remains the case that much of the US-

English difference in later life adult health remains unexplained.

       In this paper, we investigate another hypothesis to help us understand underlying reasons

for the large American health disadvantage. This hypothesis is that differential prevalence and

differential impacts of early life conditions, and particularly childhood health, between England

and the US may have lead to differences in subsequent later-life health outcomes. Considerable

evidence has emerged that variation in health outcomes at middle and older ages may be traced

in part to health and other conditions during childhood (Barker, 1997, Case et al, 2002, Case et

al, 2005, Currie and Stabile, 2003, Smith, 2009, Smith and Smith, 2010). In this paper, we will

test whether such variation accounts for important parts of country differences in adult health.

       This remainder of this paper is divided into four sections. The next section describes the

data that we will use in this analysis while the section that follows compares prevalence of

childhood illnesses for birth cohorts in the two countries. Section 4 summarizes the main results

obtained from analytical models relating these childhood illnesses to measures of adult health.

The purpose of this analysis is to assess how much of the large differences in illness at middle

and older ages in America compared to England can be explained by any differences that

prevailed when these people were children and adolescents. The final section of the paper

highlights our main conclusions.




                                                 3
2. Childhood Health Data in the HRS and ELSA

          This research uses data from two surveys — the English Longitudinal Survey of Aging

(ELSA) and the US Health and Retirement Survey (HRS). Both surveys collect longitudinal data

on health, disability, economic circumstances, work, and well-being, from a representative

sample of the English and American populations aged 50 and older. Both ELSA and HRS are

widely viewed as strong in the measurement of socioeconomic variables (education,

employment, income, wealth) and health (self-reported subjective general health status,

prevalence and incidence of physical and mental disease during the post age 50 adult years

(hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, stroke, chronic lung diseases, asthma, arthritis and cancer,

and emotional and mental illness including depression), disability and functioning status, and

several salient health behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity). HRS and

ELSA have both been widely used in stand alone studies as well as comparative studies of adult

health.

          One limitation of ELSA and HRS, along with the various other new international aging

data sets, is that data collection only begins at age 50 (and even later for those cohorts who were

older at the time of the initial baseline interview). Fortunately, this limitation was recognized,

and many of these data sets subsequently fielded questionnaires or questionnaire modules that

aimed to fill in, through retrospective recall, the more salient episodes in respondents’ pre-

baseline life histories. Childhood events including childhood health were an important part of

these life history interviews.

          Both HRS and ELSA included very similar retrospectively reported childhood health

histories. ELSA fielded their childhood health history between its wave 3 and wave 4 core

interviews between February and August 2007. ELSA used a stand alone ‘life-history’ CAPI




                                                  4
personal interview covering a variety of childhood circumstances and events as well as the pre-

baseline adult years. All ELSA respondents were eligible, and there was an eighty percent

response rate (N= 7,855). For the purposes of our analysis, the data from the life history

questionnaire was combined with the data from the third wave the main interview which was

fielded between June 2006 and March 2007. The HRS childhood health history was initially

placed into an internet survey in 2007 for those respondents who had internet access and who

agreed to be interviewed in that mode (N=3,641). The remainder of HRS respondents

(N=12,337) received the same childhood health history as part of the 2008 core interview.1

        In addition to a subjective question rating their childhood health before age 16 on the

standard five-point scale from excellent to poor, respondents in both surveys were asked about

the occurrence of a set of common childhood illnesses. If the condition did exist, they were asked

the age of first onset. The list of childhood illnesses that were asked was very similar in the two

surveys but not identical- some diseases were asked in one survey but not the other.2 Thus, we

confine our analysis in this paper only to childhood illnesses and conditions that were asked in

both surveys. Even within these set of childhood conditions, there are differences in wording or

inclusion that must be taken into account. The following childhood diseases have basically the

same wording in both surveys—asthma, diabetes, heart trouble, chronic ear problems, severe

headaches or migraines, and epilepsy or seizures. For the common childhood infectious diseases,

HRS respondents were asked about mumps, measles, and chicken pox separately while ELSA

  For example, the following childhood conditions and diseases were asked in ELSA but not in HRS- broken bones
and fractures; appendicitis; leukemia or lymphoma; cancer or malignant tumor. The following conditions were asked
in HRS but not in ELSA- difficulty seeing even with glasses or prescription lenses; a speech impairment; stomach
problems; high blood pressure; a blow to the head, head injury or trauma severe enough to cause loss of
consciousness or memory loss for a period of time.


                                                       5
respondents were asked a single question about all infectious disease with the question wording

mentioning these three diseases but also including polio and TB.

       The biggest difference between the two surveys involves allergies and respiratory

problems. In HRS, respondents were asked about respiratory disorders which included

bronchitis, wheezing, hay fever, shortness of breath, and sinus infections and were separately

asked about any allergic conditions. ELSA respondents were asked about allergies including hay

fever and then separately about respiratory problems. Thus, hay fever shows up in a different

category in the two surveys. The other difference of possible significance concerns the category

of emotional and psychological problems which included two questions about depression and

other emotional problems in HRS and one question about emotional, nervous, or psychiatric

problems in ELSA.

       In addition to any impact of these wording differences, the form in which the questions

were asked also differed between the two surveys. HRS respondents were asked separate

questions about each condition while ELSA respondents were shown a ‘show card’ which

contained a list of conditions and then asked to identify any that they may have had before age

16. The show card format could lead to lower reported prevalence if respondents that had

multiple conditions only identify a subset from show cards, whilst they would have answered in

the affirmative to each of the questions individually had they been asked.



3. Comparing Childhood Health in England and the USA

       Our first descriptive analysis compares prevalences of childhood conditions that are more

or less comparably defined in England and the United States using these two surveys. In addition

to presenting overall prevalence in the two samples, we also stratified the data by four broadly




                                                 6
defined birth cohorts—those born pre 1930, those born between 1930 and 1939, those born

between 1940 and 1949, and those born in 1950 or after. Given the age selection of HRS and

ELSA respondents and the fact that both samples were refreshed with younger cohorts prior to

the retrospective data collection (in 2006 for ELSA and 2004 for HRS), the youngest cohort of

our sample contains only those born between 1950 and 1956.

       Such age stratification may reveal the nature of any secular trends in the prevalence of

childhood diseases in the two countries. Given the reliance on recall for this data, however,

considerable caution in interpreting any age patterns is advisable. One problem involves

mortality selection if those with healthier childhoods live longer as they undoubtedly do. This is

a selection effect that should become stronger at older ages.

       Since these prevalence measures are based on recall, a second problem is that memory

biases may be playing a role in these trends as well and these may also be stronger at older ages.

It is well established that memory typically declines with time from the event (Sudman and

Bradburn, 1974). Salient events may suffer less from this type of memory decay and memory of

childhood happenings appear to be superior than for other times of life. Smith (2009a) shows that

data from these recall histories on childhood health show similar age-cohort patterns to those

collected from contemporaneous sources for example.

       The third and final problem is the difficulty in separating cohort or time trends in true

prevalence and incidence from improved detection or changing diagnostic thresholds. For most

childhood diseases, there is very likely improved diagnosis and detection of childhood diseases

over time, and for some diseases, including mental illness, there may be some effect of a

lowering of the threshold for diagnosis.

       With these caveats in mind, Table 1 presents the patterns revealed in the data on the

prevalence of early life health conditions in England and the United States. The first pattern of

note is that across all ages in all nine childhood diseases reported prevalence is actually higher in

the United States than in England. In some cases, the prevalence rates are rather close (epilepsy,

migraines, and asthma), but in most cases the rates in the United States are much higher

especially if we use relative risk as the metric for comparison. For example, there is a 45%

higher risk of childhood allergies in the United States and a 29% higher risk of respiratory

problems in the US compared to England. Since England includes hay fever in allergies and the

US in respiratory, the relative risk difference between the two countries is even higher for

allergies. Similarly, even though overall prevalence is low in both countries, relative risk of

childhood heart disease and diabetes is much higher in the United States. Supporting evidence

for an American excess of childhood disease compared to the English comes from Martinson et al.

(2011) who demonstrate using biomarker data from NHANES and the Health Survey for England that in



                                                   8
more contempory times there is also an American excess of childhood disease. It is important to note that

their comparisons do not rely on recall.

           The second salient pattern in these data is country differences in across cohort trends.

While for most childhood diseases in both countries secular trends indicate growing prevalence

over time, these secular trends appear to be much sharper in the United States than in England.

For example, take respiratory diseases as the first example—childhood prevalence is almost

twice as high in the youngest birth cohorts compared to the oldest birth cohorts in Table 1. The

comparable figure for England is 9% higher.

           We have discussed three potential difficulties in interpreting the cross-cohort trends in

Table 1, namely mortality selection, imperfect recall and secular trends in diagnosis. In principal,

each of these effects could also be operating differentially in England and the US, and hence

affecting our cross-country comparisons as well. Of the three, the one that is most amenable to

investigation is mortality selection, and particularly the concern that cohort trends in mortality

selection may be rather different in the two countries.

           What would be most worrying would be higher rates of mortality prior to older ages in

England. This might lead one to suppose that those who had the specific childhood conditions

identified in this table would be more likely to have died in England than in the US, hence

leading us to measure lower prevalence in England when we interview survivors of these cohorts

many years later. In previous research, we have already documented lower mortality rates in

England between ages 50 and 65 (Banks, Smith and Muriel, 2010) so to further our evidence on

this issue we analyzed the Human Mortality Base data3 on survival to various ages for the two

countries for all cohorts born between 1934 and 1958 (data on earlier cohorts are not available

for the US). The analysis (presented in Figure A1 in the Appendix) demonstrates that English

3
    http://www.mortality.org/


                                                    9
cohorts were in fact more likely to survive to age 50 than their US counterparts. If childhood

disease is predictive of mortality prior to age 50, we may if anything be understating the true

prevalence differences between the two countries at the time these cohorts were young.

         Interestingly, cohort trends in these survival probabilities are somewhat different across

countries. For cohorts born from 1948 onwards the differences between countries in the

likelihood of living to age 50 becomes rather more substantial than for the earlier cohorts. Once

again this cohort-specific country divergence may be worrying for our analysis. But further

investigation of this feature indicates that it is due to a sharp increase in the probability of living

to age 1 in England after the Second World War4 for these later cohorts so that their survival

rates were comparable to similar cohorts in the US whilst their predecessors had rather lower

survival probabilities. When we look at cohort trends in survival to age 50 conditional on

survival to age 1, the pattern of cohort trends in the two countries is much more comparable

with, in fact, an even greater advantage in favor of the English. Given that much of the diagnosis

and onset of our childhood conditions will occur after age 1 it is this last evidence that we think

is most relevant for our purposes here.

         Turning back to the ELSA and HRS childhood data that form the core of our analysis,

Table 2 compares later-life health outcomes in England and the United States, with the outcomes

measured at or near to the time the retrospective data were collected (i.e. 2007 in England and

2007/8 in the US). We divide health outcomes into three groups—illnesses that we label major,

those labeled minor, and those labeled ‘Barker’. Major illness includes cancer, lung disease,

stroke, angina, heart attack, and heart failure. Minor illness includes hypertension, diabetes, and

arthritis. ‘Barker’ illnesses include those related to heart disease and diabetes (angina, heart

 One hypothesis is that this improvement in infant mortality in England in this period was due to better nutrition
(Deaton 1976).

hypothesis linking early life and particularly in-utero factors to later life health. For both

countries, prevalence rates are stratified by age and gender in Table 2.

           There are several salient patterns revealed in Table 2. Not surprisingly for all three

disease categories, disease prevalence rises rapidly with age in both countries, with ages in the

fifties and sixties witnessing the most rapid rate of increase. Most importantly, across all three

categories of illness used in this Table, Americans have much higher rates of disease than the

English do. This pattern of excess illness in America compared to England when defined using

these aggregated disease groupings appears to be true for men and women and accords with the

various findings on the more specific conditions and diseases that we have documented in our

other research (Banks et al, 2006, Banks et al, 2010).


4. Analytical Models Comparing Effects of Childhood Health on Adult Health in England
and the USA


         Table 3 presents our baseline OLS models that attempt to isolate the salient country level

differences in adult disease prevalence. These models contain only a quadratic in age

(normalized so that age 50 is zero and defined for expositional convenience as (age-50)/10)), a

gender dummy (male = 1), a country dummy (US =1) and interactions of the US indicator

variable with the age quadratic and gender. Not surprisingly given the patterns revealed in Table

2, we find that all three disease groups increase with age at a decreasing rate5, there is a small but

statistically significant male disease excess for major and Barker disease categories and a small

(but again statistically significant) female excess for minor diseases in England. In terms of our

main interest in country differences, we find a statistically significant common excess of disease

in the United States. On average, and for the base case individuals (50 year old females), disease

excess in the US over England is 7.2 percentage points, for major diseases, 14.5 percentage

points for minor diseases, and 11.1 percentage points for Barker diseases. There is no strong

    As always, these age patterns could partially reflect cohort effects as well.

evidence that this American disease excess differs across age and gender since the US

interactions with these variables are not generally statistically significant.

     In the Tables that follow, we expand the models in Table 3 with additional groups of

covariates with an eye toward examining the marginal impact of these additions on the country

level main effect differences in adult health status. The added covariates in Table 4 include our

few available common measures of childhood circumstances, parental background and SES.

These measures are (a) whether the mother or father of the respondent was dead at the time of

the collection of the retrospective data, and if so their age of death which could be seen as

measures of shared familial environment during the childhood years and/or genetic factors; (b)

whether your SES was low during the childhood years based on fathers occupation when you

were sixteen years old ; (c) adult height measured in centimeters (normalized to mean height –

65 inches), an often used summary statistic to capture elements of the Barker hypothesis related

to childhood nutrition. Once again, all variables in these models are interacted with a country

dummy (US=1). These new variables in (a) and (c) could equally well be thought of as

alternative indicators of childhood health. Parents and children shared genes forever and




                                                       13
environment for at least decades so that parental deaths and/or date of death may pick up

elements of health transmitted from parents to their children. Even more so, adult height is often

used as a summary statistic for childhood health, or at least the nutritional components of

childhood health and as a marker for Barker related diseases.

         Examining the effects of new variables included in these models, all forms of adult

disease are higher if either the mother or father of the respondent was dead at the time of the

HRS or ELSA survey interview—an effect that is larger the younger the age at which parent

died. The effect of these variables is not generally statistically significantly different in the two



                                                      14
countries though. Through either shared family environment or genetics, having a parent die at a

younger age may indicate greater shared familial proneness to illness. Particularly for minor and

Barker diseases, adult levels of disease are higher among those who were a member of a low

SES family during their childhood years. Finally, consistent with Barker’s hypothesis, taller

adults are also healthier adults. This association is especially strong for the Barker category of

disease.

       Once again and somewhat remarkably, very few of the interactions of variables with the

US country indicator are statistically significant with the exception of the US main effect which

still signals statistically significantly higher levels of disease in America compared to England on

average. This US level effect is only slightly smaller in Table 4 compared to that obtained in the

baseline models in Table 3 indicating that this set of childhood SES/parental health measures do

not contribute very much to ‘explaining’ the country difference in adult health.

       Our first attempt to evaluate the contributory role of childhood health towards country

level adult disease differences is contained in Table 5 which adds to the set of variables in

models in Table 4 the summary childhood measure of subjective health status, i.e. whether the

respondents reports that they had excellent or very good health as a child. The other covariates

are not appreciably altered by this addition of childhood subjective health so we will confine our

discussion to the subjective childhood health measures. The estimated effect of being in

excellent or very good health during one’s childhood years is to lower the probability of all

forms of adult disease. This association also appears to be statistically significantly larger in the

United States compared to England, but only for the major disease category.

       However, the estimated overall average adult health differences between America and

England in Table 5 has remained essentially unchanged compared to those in Table 4 and in the




                                                  15
case of major illnesses has actually increased from 0.069 to 0.102. If childhood health problems

raise the probability of adult health problems and if, as the data in Table 1 indicate, there are

more such problems in America than in England, how is it possible that these problems fail to

explain the between country health difference or even more perversely make them even larger?

         Table 6 provides the answer by displaying country differences in excellent or very good

subjective childhood health as a child by birth cohort in both England and the USA. In spite of

the fact that the data in Table 1 show that in almost all childhood diseases for all birth cohorts


                                                       16
that Americans were sicker as children than their English counterparts, Table 6 indicates that

when asked to evaluate their childhood health on a subjective scale that Americans respond that

their childhoods were healthier than the responses of the English would indicate about their own

English childhood. The problem with using the childhood subjective health scale is actually the

same as the problem with using the adult variant of these scales- given the same objective level

of health on subjective scales Americans will report themselves as healthier than the English

(Banks et al, 2009; Kapteyn, Smith, and van Soest, 2007). For example the fraction of ELSA

respondents who report in excellent or very good childhood health is 0.68 while in HRS it is

0.78- a ten point differential in favor of the Americans. Because of this, and since being in

excellent of very good child as a child is associated with better adult health in both countries, this

will make the unexplained country adult health difference even larger.

       Putting aside for a moment this problem of country differences in subjective scales, the

within country patterns revealed in Table 6 are also of interest. The within country gender

differences in subjective childhood health is not large. However, there is a clear and very

pronounced trend across cohort in both countries where subjective childhood health is reported

to be better among the more recent cohorts. If we compare most recent cohorts in Table 6 to the



                                                 17
oldest cohorts, the increase in the fraction in excellent or very good health as a child is about ten

percentage points in both England and America. Whilst it is possible that childhood health

improved across these cohorts (contrary to the evidence on chronic diseases presented in Table 1

above, and subject to the various caveats and especially to the role of improved diagnosis we

identified in the discussion of that table) the magnitude of this increase seems rather implausible,

particularly in the presence of health survivor effects which would tend to work across cohorts in

the opposite direction. This points to another major puzzle in the reconciliation of secular trends

in subjective and objective childhood health measures.

       Table 7 extends our modeling of adult health in Table 6 by adding the set of childhood

disease indicators to the model as well as interactions of this set of childhood diseases with the

US country indicator variable. Since the prevalence rates of some of these childhood diseases are

low, we aggregated them into six groups. The six groups are ear problems, respiratory, allergies,

asthma, rare diseases (childhood diabetes, epilepsy, emotional), and all others. Main effects and

interactions with the US country indicator are included in the model. Because of the across

country scale comparability issue mentioned above, the model estimated in Table 7 does not

include the subjective childhood health variable.

       Once again, coefficients of other variables in the model are not significantly affected by

adding childhood disease indicators. The diseases that appear to have most consistently

statistically significant main effects are ear problems, respiratory diseases, and rare diseases.

Especially for major illness, transmission into poorer adult health appears to be stronger in the

US for rare diseases and for asthma.

        Table 8 provides a summary of the estimated main effect American excess of disease

from our models in Tables 3 to 7. If we compare the estimates from Table 7 with the age

adjusted ‘raw’ country differences from Table 3, the combination of SES/parental health

transmission variables and the childhood diseases does ‘explain’ a significant part of the country

differences. For example for major diseases, the raw difference in Table 3 was 7.2 percentage

points of excess disease in America. The adjusted difference in Table 4 is 4.1 percentage points

(and not statistically significant) so that using this metric 43% of the American excess major

disease is explained compared to the base case model

** statistically significant at one percent level. * Statistically significant at five percent level


        The comparable numbers for minor diseases is a 14.5 percentage point ‘raw’ disease

excess in America and an 11.1 percentage point adjusted excess so that 23% of the excess is

explained. Finally, for the Barker diseases, the comparable numbers are 11.1 ‘raw’ and 8.0

‘adjusted’ so that 28% of the American excess is explained.

        As a final note, it is instructive to consider the degree to which this ‘explanation’ of the

excess disease in the US arises from the inclusion in the model of the indicators of prevalence of

the specific childhood illnesses themselves as opposed to the interactions of these prevalence


                                                  20
indicators with the US country dummy. To investigate this we ran a similar model to that

presented in Table 7 but with the childhood health country interaction terms excluded (full

estimates presented in Table A1 in the Appendix and estimates of the US intercept term

presented in the final row of Table 8). On comparison of these results with those discussed

above, it is apparent that the main contribution to the reduction in both the size and statistical

significance of the US country effect arises from the inclusion of the interaction terms – whilst

there is some role for the greater prevalence of childhood conditions in the US, it is the

differential impacts of these childhood conditions on later-life health outcomes in the US that has

the main effect on changing the coefficient on the US dummy variable. Whilst these interaction

terms are, of course, just another form of 'country effect', this does suggest that investigation of

the mechanisms by which early-life health is transmitted to late-life disease outcomes in the two

countries would be a promising avenue for future research.



6. Conclusions

       Differences in prevalence of childhood diseases between England and the United States

and a higher rate of transmission into poorer adult health in the United States do appear to

contribute to higher rates of adult illness in the United States compared to England. Our results

in this paper show that, based on comparable retrospective questionnaires placed in HRS and

ELSA- nationally representative surveys of the age 50 plus population in America and England

respectively, the origins of poorer adult health among older Americans compared to the English

traces back right into the childhood years. The transmission rates of these higher rates of

childhood illnesses into poor health in mid life and older ages also appears to be higher in

America compared to England.




                                                  21
       Of course, every partial answer raises yet another question. In this case, conditions in

America appear to make people of all ages sicker than the English. This conclusion highlights a

caution that age specific answers to the question of why Americans are sicker may not serve as a

useful guide to uncovering the more fundamental causes of this important question. Our research

shows that the primary sources of the American excess in disease are not unique to mid

adulthood or old age but are more common throughout the age distribution of the two

populations. Finally, it is worth noting that we are dealing in this research with the onset of

disease rather than the treatment of disease so that the medical system and availability of health

insurance are not likely to be the primary actors in this puzzle. This is particularly true given our

use of a non-Hispanic white sample so 95% of our American sample have access to health

insurance.
