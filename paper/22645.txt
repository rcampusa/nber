                                         ABSTRACT

Domestic prudential regulation can have unintended effects across borders and may be less
effective in an environment where banks operate globally. Using U.S. micro-banking data for the
first quarter of 2000 through the third quarter of 2013, this study shows that some regulatory
changes indeed spill over. First, a foreign country’s tightening of limits on loan-to-value ratios
and local currency reserve requirements increase lending growth in the United States through the
U.S. branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks. Second, a foreign tightening of capital
requirements shifts lending by U.S. global banks away from the country where the tightening
occurs to the United States and to other countries. Third, tighter U.S. capital regulation reduces
lending by large U.S. global banks to foreign residents.

1.       Introduction

In the period since the global financial crisis, policy discussions have highlighted the potential
need for the active use of macroprudential instruments to support financial stability goals. But
some macroprudential instruments might not work as intended and have effects that propagate
across borders through the global linkages of international financial institutions. In the presence
of cross-border banking, domestic policies might not be effective as they do not apply to the
same degree to banks headquartered in foreign countries. Changes in domestic prudential
instruments might also spillover into foreign markets, because domestic banks affected by the
policies adjust their operations globally. 1

This paper analyzes these issues focusing on the United States and attempts to answer three
questions. First, do changes in foreign prudential instruments affect lending growth in the United
States? Second, do U.S. global banks adjust their foreign operations when foreign prudential
instruments change? Third, do U.S. regulatory changes spill over into foreign countries via U.S.
global banks? We find evidence of both spillovers of foreign regulatory changes into the United
States and cross-border effects of U.S. prudential instrument changes.

The United States is an interesting case, as its banking sector is markedly interconnected with the
rest of the world. Foreign global banks expanded their operations in the United States in the
2000s through local branches and through separately chartered banks (Tarullo, 2012). U.S.
global banks have substantial exposures to advanced economies and to emerging market
countries through cross-border lending, funding, and affiliates located abroad (Cetorelli and
Goldberg, 2006).

Our analysis uses regulatory reports filed by U.S. global banks and by the U.S. subsidiaries and
branches of foreign banks. These bank-level data for 2000q1 through 2013q3 are combined with
a database of prudential instruments newly constructed by the International Banking Research
Network (IBRN) (see Cerutti, et al., 2016, for a description of the IBRN Prudential Instruments
Database). The database has information on the use of 7 different prudential instruments by 64

1
  Lim et al. (2011), Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey (2015), Vandenbussche et al. (2012), and Cerutti, Claessens, and
Laeven (2015) analyze the effectiveness of macroprudential policies in curtailing credit growth and house price
inflation using cross-country data. Cross-border spillovers of prudential policies are explored in Aiyar, Calomiris,
and Wieladek (2014), Aiyar et al. (2014), and Danisewicz et al. (2015). The International Banking Research
Network (IBRN) coordinated a research initiative to explore the effects of prudential instruments on the activities of
global banks across borders. For an overview of the country studies and results, see Buch and Goldberg (2016).

countries. Our methodology largely follows that described in Buch and Goldberg (2016) and is
part of the joint research effort of the IBRN on cross-border prudential policy spillovers. 2

Our first specifications test whether U.S. global banks and U.S. branches and subsidiaries of
foreign banks adjust their lending in response to foreign prudential instrument changes. We find
statistically significant effects for 3 instruments: capital requirements, local currency reserve
requirements, and limits on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. The tightening of prudential instruments
abroad increases loan growth in the United States. Higher foreign country capital requirements
abroad mainly affect U.S. loan growth through U.S. global banks, while higher local currency
reserve requirements and limits on LTV ratios mainly transmit through the lending of the U.S.
branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks.

Our second set of tests investigates whether U.S. global banks’ exposures in foreign countries
react to prudential instrument changes there. The evidence is weaker in this case. Foreign
changes in prudential instruments have a weak and mostly insignificant effect on U.S. banks’
claims on residents in the country where the change occurs.

Lastly, we explore whether changes in U.S. prudential instruments have effects across borders.
While foreign economies have used a combination of both cyclical and structural instruments,
U.S. policymakers have favored structural regulations that are less correlated with the financial
cycle and are not changed frequently (Elliott, Feldberg, and Lehnert, 2013). As a result, the only
U.S. instrument change recorded in the IBRN Prudential Instruments Database is related to the
introduction of the Basel 2.5 capital regulations in 2013q1. Our results indicate that after this
change the largest U.S. banks, those that are required to participate on annual stress tests or
follow the Advanced Approaches capital framework, reduced their foreign lending growth
relative to the smaller banks. 3

  The following studies are part of the IBRN study on the impact of prudential instrument changes on the activities
of global banks: Auer, Ganarin, and Towbin (2016); Avdjiev et al. (2016); Başkaya et al. (2016); Bonfim and Costa
(2016); Bussière, Schmidt, and Vinas (2016); Caccavaio, Carpinelli, and Marinelli (2016); Damar and Mordel
(2016); Frost, de Haan, and van Horen (2016); Gajewski and Krzesicki (2016); Hills et al. (2016); Ho and Wong
(2016); Jara and Cabeza (2016); Levin et al. (2016); Nocciola and Żochowski (2016); Ohls, Pramor, and Tonzer
(2016); Park and Lee (2016).

Taken together, and focusing on the response of U.S. global banks, our results indicate that U.S.
prudential regulation reduces foreign lending, whereas tighter foreign prudential regulation
increases total lending and shifts this lending away from the host countries undertaking
regulatory changes. In general, the magnitudes of the identified spillovers across all the exercises
appear to be small. Changes in foreign capital requirements probably had the most significant
economic effect: we calculate that stricter capital requirements abroad added a total of $249
billion in lending of U.S. global banks over the period from 2000q1 to 2013q3.

While our results are broadly consistent with the existing evidence on cross-border spillovers,
there are some important differences that we have identified. The effect of higher U.S. capital
requirements are consistent with Aiyar, Calomiris, Hooley, Korniyenko, and Wieladek (2014),
who document that tighter capital requirements for U.K. banks decreased these banks’ cross-
border lending. In the U.S. data, cross-border spillovers of higher capital requirements work in
both directions. Tighter capital standards abroad increased lending growth in the United States,
mainly through U.S. global banks. While banks may cut lending at home and abroad to comply
with higher capital standards, the change of capital requirements in one country affects the
relative profitability of lending in different parts of the global banking organization. When
capital requirements are higher abroad, domestic lending might become relatively more
profitable compared to foreign lending through foreign subsidiaries subject to the higher capital
requirements. The fact that higher local currency reserve requirements and limits on LTV ratios
abroad have positive effects on U.S. lending growth follows a similar logic.

The weak response of U.S. global banks’ lending to foreign policy changes in the countries
where the policy changes occur is somewhat consistent with the evidence on leakages presented
by Reinhardt and Sowerbutts (2015) and Aiyar, Calomiris, and Wieladek (2014), who show that
foreign bank lending expands when the regulation of domestic banks tightens. While we do not
find that U.S. banks expand their lending growth, we do not find them contracting their lending
growth either, suggesting that foreign policy changes might not be able to impact these banks’
local operations. This result contrasts with those in Temesvary (2015), who finds significant
responses of U.S. banks’ foreign activities to stricter bank regulation in host countries. Part of the
divergence in these results may be explained by the use of different cross-country regulatory data
and different methodologies for measuring the effect of changes in prudential instruments.


                                                  3
A related literature with contributions by Houston, Lin, and Ma (2012) and Bremus and
Fratzscher (2014) exploits a database developed by Barth, Caprio, and Levine (2013), which
captures differences in bank regulation and supervision across countries, to analyze changes in
global banking activities. Using information on cross-border bank flows, they find evidence for
regulatory arbitrage through cross-border lending. As opposed to our paper, their tests rely on
aggregate bank flows instead of bank-specific claims. In another cross-country study, Ongena,
Popov, and Udell (2013) find effects of tighter home country regulation on banks’ risk taking
abroad.

The next section describes the data used in the various exercises testing the transmission of
prudential policies through foreign banks operating in the United States, and through U.S. global
banks. Section 3 presents the empirical methodology and key empirical results. Section 4
concludes, emphasizing that despite limited real consequences for the U.S. economy over the
past decade, prudential instruments applied abroad have the potential to more significantly
influence U.S. loan growth in the future.



2.        Data and Stylized Facts for the United States

Our analysis examines prudential policy spillovers internationally using four distinct bank
panels. The first panel covers U.S.-headquartered global banks’ total lending and varies by bank
and quarter. The second dataset adds a country dimension to the bank and time dimension,
capturing U.S. global banks’ claims in different locations through cross-border flows or through
branches or subsidiaries established in foreign markets. The two other micro-banking datasets
cover foreign bank lending in the United States. One contains data on foreign-owned bank
subsidiaries operating in the United States, while the other consists of data on U.S. branches of
foreign banks. The data for U.S. global banks and for subsidiaries of foreign banks within the
United States span the first quarter of 2000 through the third quarter of 2013, while the U.S.
branches of foreign banks dataset spans the fourth quarter of 2002 through the third quarter of
2013. 4

 We end the analysis in 2013q3 since the FFIEC 009 reporting form changed the next quarter. The FR Y-7Q form
used in branch regressions was not introduced until 2002q4.

2.1      Bank-level Data

Data Sources. U.S. commercial bank data cover both U.S. global banks and the U.S.
subsidiaries of foreign banks. Balance sheet, income statement, and select off-balance sheet data
are drawn from the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council (FFIEC) 031 form,
better known as the Call Report. Income statement, balance sheet, and selected off-balance sheet
data on U.S. bank holding companies are drawn from the FR Y-9C form. The FFIEC 009 form
on the international exposures of U.S. reporting banks is the source of detailed information on
the geographic distribution of U.S. bank claims on foreign residents. A bank is defined as a U.S.
global bank if it reports the FFIEC 009 and is headquartered in the United States. Capital and
asset data for foreign bank holding companies in our aggregated branch dataset are drawn from
the FR Y-7Q form. Balance sheet and off-balance sheet data pertaining to U.S. branches and
agencies of foreign banking organizations are drawn from FFIEC 002 filings, aggregated across
U.S. branches to the level of the “top bank” within the global banking organization. 5 National
Information Center (NIC) data are used to connect commercial banks to their high holders. All of
these data filings are quarterly, with the exception of the FR Y-7Q. 6 Although much of the bank-
level data are publicly available, bank-level data from the FFIEC 009 report are confidential. 7
Further details on data sources and variable construction are in the Table A1. 8

Definition of Dependent Variables. Most of the dependent variables have bank and time
dimensions, with ∆𝑌𝑏,𝑡 defined as the change in log loans by bank b at time t. For some
specifications, these loans are divided by the location (U.S. versus foreign addressees).

For a more detailed analysis of the response of U.S. global banks’ foreign lending to policy
changes (outward transmission), a country j dimension is added, with ∆𝑌𝑏,𝑗,𝑡 defined as the

  Bank in this context includes bank holding companies and commercial banks.
6
  The FRY-7Q is filed quarterly by FBOs whose activities are deemed to be effectively that of a financial holding
company, and is filed annually by all other FBOs. Data from the FR Y-7Q is then linearly interpolated in order to
construct quarterly data for foreign BHCs.
7
  Most of the data collected on the FR Y-9C, FFIEC 031, FFIEC 002, and FR Y-7Q are available to the public, but
there are a small number of series that are confidential.
8
  The data are trimmed to exclude or correct for potential reporting errors and noise. First, we identify outliers and
exclude these observations from all descriptive tables and analysis. Observations are identified as outliers if they
satisfy at least one of the following four criteria where applicable: 1) a change in log claims or loans > 1 or < -1
(precluding most major mergers and acquisitions), 2) tier 1, illiquid asset, core deposit, or international ratio which
is > 100% or < 0%, 3) not part of a consecutive string of bank-time observations at least eight quarters in length, or
4) their home country changes between our contemporaneous and lagged periods.

can be cross-border, in which case they are extended from a particular location to a counterparty
external to that location, or local, in which case the global bank affiliate in a location extends
claims to borrowers in that location.

Bank-level Variables. As the composition of bank balance sheets may influence the effects of
prudential instruments, the database also includes: bank size as captured by log of total real

assets      ( LogTotalAssets ) ,b ,t −1       percentage of a bank’s portfolio of assets that is illiquid

( IlliquidAssetRatio ) , percentage of the banking organization’s balance sheet financed with core

                                                                      10

nationality of the foreign parent of branches and subsidiaries hosted in the United States.

Summary Statistics and Features of the U.S. Banking System. The sample of reporting banks
and characteristics of balance sheet data are summarized in Table 1. The number of distinct
reporting entities for each dataset is provided in the first data row. The second row reports the
number of observations used in the empirical analysis, combining information on the number of
entities and the number of quarters for each entity. For the outward transmission through global
banks, the number of observations reflects a combination of the number of global banks active
throughout our sample period and the number of countries in which each of these banks reports
claims or local funding activity at each quarter.

These summary statistics provide a broad overview of the credit activities of the financial
institutions captured in our empirical analysis. In general, the United States is a financial center,
both hosting the offices of several foreign financial institutions and serving as the headquarters

location for a group of large global banks. The U.S. offices of foreign banks, branches, and
subsidiaries account for 18 to 23 percent of U.S. bank assets in our sample period, with their
loans representing between 12 and 17 percent of total loans in the United States. The largest
foreign participants in the U.S. banking sector are headquartered in advanced economies,
particularly in Europe.

Similarly, U.S. global banks have a notable presence in foreign markets. Foreign claims, which
are composed of cross-border claims and claims originated at foreign offices, for the U.S. global
banks in our sample average about 9 percent of total assets. Total claims increased from 8 to 10
percent of total assets, on average, between 2002 and 2012. Most of this increase is accounted
for by growth in affiliate local claims, which rose from 2 to 5 percent of total assets during that
period (cross border claims dropped slightly from 6 to 5 percent). By country of destination,
between 2002 and 2012 total claims to advanced foreign economies went up from 4 to 7 percent
and those to emerging market economies decreased from 4 to 3 percent. The U.S. branches and
subsidiaries of foreign banks have higher U.S. lending growth rates, on average, compared with
U.S. global banks. Variability in lending is highest for the U.S. branches of foreign banks. For
U.S. global banks, the growth in foreign claims by bank and by location is more volatile than
lending domestically.

2.2    Data on Prudential Instruments

The prudential instruments included in the IBRN Prudential Instruments Database (Cerutti et al.,
2016) are: capital requirements, sector specific capital buffers, limits on LTV ratios,
concentration ratios, reserve requirements (local currency and foreign currency), and interbank
exposure limits. Although the full database covers 64 countries, the only policies that enter into
our regression analysis are from those countries with banking entities in the United States or
spanned by the claims of U.S. global banks. For inward analysis through global banks, the
prudential instruments are weighted aggregates across countries, with weights constructed on the
basis of bank-specific information on country exposures in each period.

For regression analysis of policy spillovers to yield convincing findings, the specific prudential
instruments used in each regression must have a sufficient level of variation. We screen for
sufficient variation by examining the counts of changes in each prudential instrument as relevant
for the particular banking entities in each data subset, the number of countries associated with

                                                7
those changes, and the number of tightening and loosening observations. The panels of Table 2
show this information for the four datasets. While there is not a well-defined rule available for
determining a sufficient degree of variation for regressors in an econometric specification, we
apply a judgmental approach to capture a sufficient number of episodes and number of countries.
As a result of this screening we exclude concentration ratios in our outward and inward
transmission analysis for U.S. global banks, and exclude foreign reserve requirements, interbank
exposure limits, and concentration ratios from our inward transmission analysis for U.S.
branches of foreign banks.

2.3    Data on country business and financial cycles

The analysis introduces controls for country business cycles and credit cycles. These controls are
not only important to account for credit demand conditions, but also for assessment of whether
the effects of the prudential instruments vary over the cycle. Details on the construction of the
business cycle control (output gap) and the financial cycle control (credit-to-GDP gap) are
described in Bank for International Settlements (2014) and Drehmann, Borio, and Tsatsaronis
(2011), respectively.

3.     Empirical Method and Regression Results

This section provides conceptual observations on how changes in prudential instruments might
spill over internationally into lending activity, presents the main empirical specifications, and
reports results for the analysis on the impact of prudential regulations on bank claims both in the
United States and abroad. Section 3.1 focuses on the spillovers of foreign regulatory changes to
U.S. lending. Section 3.2 explores the effect of changes in foreign regulations on the activities of
U.S. global banks in foreign locations. It also analyzes the response of U.S. global banks’ foreign
activities when U.S. capital requirements change.

While more extensively discussed in Buch and Goldberg (2016), changes in capital
requirements, reserve requirements, and loan-to-value ratios could spill over to bank lending
through various channels that depend on the institutions examined. Consider first a change in
capital requirements abroad. U.S. global banks that operate foreign subsidiaries need to finance
their foreign assets with subsidiary-specific capital. When foreign capital requirements are
tightened, U.S. parent banks may cut lending in these markets and employ the available funding

                                                 8
for lending in a different location. In contrast, the direction of effects of tighter capital
requirements in foreign banks’ home countries on their U.S. subsidiaries is less clear. On the one
hand, tighter capital requirements in the foreign bank’s home country imply that the bank must
finance its balance sheet with more capital on a consolidated basis. To achieve this, the parent
bank may reduce lending both at home and abroad. However, tighter capital requirements at
home also mean that the relative costs of lending at home and abroad change, with lending
abroad becoming relatively less expensive.

As opposed to the stand-alone structure of subsidiaries, the assets in branches of foreign banks
are directly linked to parent banks’ balance sheets. A reduction of lending in the U.S. branches
should thus have the same effect on the parent bank’s tier 1 ratio as a reduction of lending in its
home offices. One would therefore expect that higher capital requirements at home lead to a
reduction in lending by U.S. branches of foreign banks, as the parent bank seeks to comply with
higher capital standards.

Local currency reserve requirements used as prudential tools are put in place by national
monetary authorities to control the growth in domestic credit. Higher reserve requirements imply
that banks need to hold a larger fraction of funds as reserves with the central bank and can lend
out only a smaller fraction to local borrowers. Reserve requirements in local currency, however,
do not constrain the bank’s activities in other countries. Since local funding becomes more
expensive, banks have an incentive to raise funding abroad and could move operations to other
locations. They could do this both by increasing lending of their foreign branches or their foreign
subsidiaries.

Limits on LTV ratios are aimed at reducing credit in the economy and often are specifically
targeted at counteracting a potential real estate bubble. Such limits apply to all banks that engage
in mortgage lending in a given country by decreasing the pool of eligible borrowers. A tightening
of LTV limits should thus decrease the local lending opportunities for all banks and might induce
a shift in lending to other markets.

Within regression specifications, the exact mechanisms through which adjustments occur are not
constrained by instrument and type of entities considered. Some policy instruments affect all
banks that operate in a given market, as is the case of loan-to-value ratios. Other instruments may
differentially affect banks in relation to their mode of servicing a location, as could be the case

                                                 9
with capital requirements, or the structure of their balance sheets in the case of reserve
requirements.

3.1        Inward Analysis: Spillovers into the United States from Foreign Prudential Policies

The inward transmission analysis investigates the consequences for lending in the United States
of foreign prudential policies through two channels. First, U.S. banks with large foreign activities
might respond to changes in regulation abroad by reallocating activity across foreign and
domestic locations. Second, foreign banks that have to comply with home country regulation
might adjust lending by their U.S. subsidiaries or U.S. branches. 11

Specifications

We run regressions separately for (i) U.S. global banks, (ii) U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks,
and (iii) U.S. branches of foreign banks. In each specification, we regress the log change in
lending ∆𝑌𝑏,𝑡 by entity b in quarter t on a relevant measure of foreign prudential policy changes,
including several lagged bank characteristics 𝑋𝑏,𝑡−1 (see Section 2.1 for details) as well as bank-
and quarter-fixed effects. We also control for financial and business cycle variables. Effectively,
these regressions show whether policy changes abroad had an effect on lending growth by entity
b, after controlling for a bank-specific time-invariant component in entity b’s lending growth and
a quarter-specific shift in lending growth common to all entities in the sample.

We estimate the following equation on the sample of 59 U.S.-headquartered banks with sizeable
exposures in foreign countries (global banks):

∆𝑌𝑏,𝑡 = 𝛼0 + ∑2𝑘=0 𝛼𝑘+1 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑃𝑏,𝑡−𝑘 + 𝑎4 𝑋𝑏,𝑡−1 + 𝛼5 𝑍𝑏,𝑡 + 𝑓𝑏 + 𝑓𝑡 + 𝜖𝑏,𝑡 .                                     (1)

where ExpPb,t-k stands for the foreign-exposure-weighted index and captures the extent to which
policies are tightened or loosened in countries where entity b has exposures in quarter t-k. 12 To



11
   U.S. credit could also be affected through foreign banks that do not have U.S. affiliates but lend cross-border to
U.S. firms.
12
   The exposure weighted prudential index for bank b at time t is calculated using this formula:
                                                          ∑ t = t −4 claimsbjt
                                                                 t −1
=
ExpPb ,t     ∑     PPjt ⋅ ϕ jb ,t −1 , where ⋅ϕ

                                                         ∑ ∑ t = t −4 claimsbjt
                                                        j ≠USA



                                                                         10
control for foreign country financial and economic developments, the regression also controls for
exposure-weighted credit-to-GDP and output gap variables Zb,t.13 Different prudential policies
are explored using this specification and for this bank panel. Prudential policy effects can be
immediate (k=0) or appear over the next two quarters (k=1, 2). Standard errors are robust.

The regression equation for the 102 U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks and 137 U.S. branches of
foreign banks is given by:

∆𝑌𝑏,𝑗,𝑡 = 𝛼0 + ∑2𝑘=0 𝛼𝑘+1 𝐻𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑃𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 + 𝛼4 𝑋𝑏,𝑡−1 + 𝛼5 𝑍𝑗,𝑡 + 𝑓𝑏 + 𝑓𝑡 + 𝜖𝑏,𝑗,𝑡 .                             (2)

where 𝐻𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑃𝑗,𝑡−𝑘 indicates whether regulation tightened or loosened in home country j of entity
b in quarter t-k. 𝑍𝑗,𝑡 includes country-specific measures of the home country’s credit-to-GDP gap
and output gap. Standard errors are clustered at the country level.

Spillovers into the United States

Table 3 presents the results of the inward transmission through U.S. global banks, U.S.
subsidiaries of foreign banks, and U.S. branches of foreign banks. We only display results for
those prudential instruments for which we find significant effects for at least one of these three
types of entities. The table presents estimates of contemporaneous and two periods of lagged
effects. It also displays tests of the sum of effects, with the presentation columns organized both
by instrument and entity type. Three instruments show significant inward spillovers: capital
requirements, local currency reserve requirements and LTV limits. Tighter foreign capital
requirements increase the lending of U.S. global banks and of U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks
(the evidence for subsidiaries is weaker though), but do not significantly affect lending by the
U.S. branches of foreign banks. In contrast, tighter foreign limits on LTV ratios and local
currency reserve requirements cause U.S. subsidiaries and branches of foreign banks to increase
their lending. We do not find significant effects on lending of foreign changes in sector specific
capital buffers. The PruC index, which aggregates prudential policy changes over all
instruments, has largely insignificant effects, probably because the consequences for lending

   The exposure-weighted cycle variables are constructed in parallel to the exposure-weighted prudential index. For
details see footnote 12.

growth vary substantially by prudential instrument and are more appropriately evaluated in
isolation. 14

Interestingly, both bank-specific characteristics and country conditions drive quarterly lending
growth rates. Lending growth by U.S. affiliates of foreign banks follows home country financial
and economic conditions. In particular lending growth by U.S. subsidiaries is relatively strong
when the home country has slower growth, while lending growth by U.S. branches is stronger
when the credit-to-GDP gap is higher in the home country (implying a larger gap between the
credit-to-GDP ratio and its long-term trend). In contrast, the negative and significant coefficients
on the exposure-weighted credit-to-GDP gap indicate that the lending growth of U.S. global
banks is lower when the credit-to-GDP gap in the countries where these banks operate is higher.
This is likely because these banks refocus their lending towards foreign countries away from
domestic lending when foreign demand for credit is strong, a hypothesis that is supported by the
positive coefficient on the credit-to-GDP gap in the outward exercise.

Bank-level characteristics also help explain lending growth. After controlling for bank fixed
effects on lending growth, U.S. global banks with higher tier 1 ratios (in the previous quarter)
have stronger lending growth. This also holds for their foreign activities as shown later in the
outward exercise and is consistent with previous results in the literature. 15 Tier 1 capital ratios do
not appear as drivers of foreign-owned bank lending growth in the United States. Instead,
lending growth is stronger when illiquid asset ratios are lower.

Below we discuss the regression results of Table 3 in more detail and evaluate the economic
impact on loan growth in the U.S. from changes in capital requirements, local currency reserve
requirements, and limits on LTV ratios abroad.

Capital Requirements

The conjecture that foreign capital requirements could shift global bank activity away from the
host country is supported by the regression results. We find a significant positive effect of tighter


14
   The effects of changes in concentration ratios were not analyzed because of limited variation in foreign policies in
all three samples. For the same reason, the effects of changes in exposure limits and foreign reserve requirements
were not explored for U.S. affiliates of foreign banks.
15
   See, e.g., Bernanke and Lown (1991) and Berrospide and Edge (2010).

                                                          12
capital requirements abroad on total lending by U.S. global banks (see column 1 of Table 3).16
We also used as the dependent variable total lending minus loans to foreign banks, C&I loans to
foreign addressees, and loans to foreign governments and official institutions. Results based on
these alternative dependent variables show that the effects on lending growth are not limited to
U.S. lending. U.S. banks increase domestic and third-country lending growth in response to
higher foreign capital requirements. 17

With regards to the lending of foreign-owned subsidiaries, the regression results indicate that our
substitution effect from tighter home capital requirements (lending abroad becomes relatively
less expensive compared with home lending) can dominate the effect associated with the
consolidated entity’s increased capital needs and give parent banks a net incentive to expand
subsidiary operations in the United States. However, overall the support for this effect is
relatively weak: the estimated coefficient shown in column 2 is significant only at the 11 percent
level. The point estimate related to branch lending is not significant at conventional levels (see
column 3).

How large is the positive effect on loan growth from tighter capital requirements abroad? If there
were a change in capital requirements in all countries in which a U.S. bank holds claims, then
that bank’s lending growth would be 3.6 percentage points higher according to the estimated
coefficient in column 1. This corresponds to around 38 percent of one standard deviation of the
dependent variable. The average value of the exposure-weighted index is 0.028 in the sample,
implying an average positive effect on a bank’s lending growth rate of 0.1 percentage point.

We conduct a basic experiment to illustrate the magnitudes of potential spillovers from past
capital requirement changes: (i) we calculate the effect on a bank’s lending growth in each
quarter multiplying the capital requirement index in each period with the estimated coefficient;
(ii) we convert the effect on the bank’s lending growth rate to a U.S. dollar value taking into
account the lending volume of the bank in the previous period; and (iii) we aggregate the
calculated U.S. dollar value over all banks. It is important to note that the estimated coefficients



16
   Lagged values of the capital requirement index are dropped in the regressions displayed in columns 1 to 3, since
these were never significant.
17
   Detailed estimates are shown in Table A2. As noted later, the outward analysis shows that U.S. banks do not
increase lending growth in the countries where capital requirements are changed.

                                                         13
often have large confidence intervals, so the resulting dollar amounts are rough estimates of
potential spillover effects.

Most of the regulatory changes in the sample occurred in the first quarter of 2012 and 2013 when
several industrialized countries introduced Basel II.5 and Basel III, respectively. In some of these
countries, U.S. banks have large operations, for example, in Canada, Hong Kong and
Switzerland. Accordingly, the effect on aggregate lending of U.S. global banks is notable. Based
on our calculations, the introduction of Basel II.5 or Basel III in 2012q1 in 28 countries led U.S.
global banks to increase lending by around 2.4 percentage points ($119 billion). Summed over
all quarters, additional lending due to changes in capital requirements abroad totaled $249
billion.

Local Currency Reserve Requirements

The conjecture that higher local reserve requirements in the home country will make operations
by foreign-owned affiliates in the U.S. relatively more attractive is supported by the regression
results, as can be seen in column 5 of Table 3. Higher local reserve requirements in the home
country increase a U.S. subsidiary’s lending growth rate by a total of 5 percentage points over
half a year (beta coefficient of 0.07). The contemporaneous and lagged coefficients in the branch
regression (column 6 of Table 3) are not jointly significant at standard levels but there is some
weak evidence that branch lending responds as well since the coefficient on the
contemporaneous prudential variable is significant at the 11 percent level. Banks should not
prefer to move activity to subsidiaries or to branches in particular, since the impact of local
reserve requirements is not related to the bank’s organizational structure as discussed earlier.

U.S. global banks do not seem to respond at all to local reserve requirement changes abroad. In
principle, changes in local reserve requirements in a market could also affect U.S. global banks
that operate there. However, U.S. global banks do not fund themselves to a significant extent in
foreign/local currencies and are probably little affected by these types of regulatory changes.

We investigated whether banks respond symmetrically to tightening versus loosening reserve
requirements. In terms of magnitudes, the effects appear to be similar but the timing of responses
differs. The effect of a tightening unfolds immediately, while responses to a loosening of reserve
requirements occur with a lag of half a year.

                                                 14
Figure 1 illustrates the aggregate effects of reserve requirement changes abroad on lending by
U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks following the methodology described earlier. The largest
effect occurred in 2012. On 18 January 2012, the ECB lowered the reserve requirement ratio
from 2 percent to 1 percent. India and China, which were parent countries for U.S. subsidiaries in
2012, also lowered their local reserve requirements in this year. Summing the U.S. dollar
changes in lending from 2012q1 to 2012q3 over subsidiaries suggests that the reduction in local
reserve requirements in this period led to roughly $7 billion lower lending by these entities, a bit
less than half a percent of their total lending over the same period.

Limits on Loan-to-value Ratios

The regression results in columns 8 and 9 of Table 3 support the conjecture that banks
headquartered abroad redirect activity to the United States in response to tightened LTV limits in
their home counties. Lending by both U.S. branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks expands in
response to these changes. 18

If tightening occurs in the parent country, lending growth by U.S. subsidiaries and U.S. branches
of foreign banks increases by 2.2 and 2.7 percentage points, respectively, based on estimates in
columns 8 and 9 (sum of contemporaneous and lagged coefficients). Figure 2 shows the
aggregate effects of past changes in LTV limits by quarter. The volatility of aggregate effects
over time is mainly a reflection of tightening and loosening in foreign countries. For subsidiaries,
the switching signs on the contemporaneous versus lagged effects of policy changes (see column
8) also play a role. Most changes in LTV limits occurred after the 2007-2008 financial crisis in
advanced economies like Sweden, Canada, Norway and the Netherlands but also in developing
countries like China and Brazil. Summing the effects of past LTV changes over the sample
period and over both types of entities suggests that U.S. branches and subsidiaries lent out an
additional $15 billion from 2003q3 to 2013q3 due to policy changes in their home countries.
Subsidiaries contributed around 45 percent, branches around 55 percent to the increase. 19 Overall




18
   We did not find evidence for differential effects of tightening versus loosening LTV limits.
19
   The larger contribution of branches to this expansion stems from a larger impact of an LTV ratio change on
branch lending, compared to subsidiary lending, and the fact that more local reserve requirement changes occurred
in the home countries of U.S. branches.

                                                        15
the additional lending over the sample period is small, reflecting a tiny fraction of these entities’
total lending (0.04 percent). 20


3.2        Outward Analysis: International response of U.S. global banks to U.S. and foreign
prudential policies
The outward transmission exercise assesses the effects of foreign prudential policies on the
growth of U.S. banks’ claims to foreign countries, including on the reallocation of U.S. banks’
external claims across foreign markets. The analysis also explores the impact of U.S regulation
on U.S. banks’ claims abroad.

Impact of foreign prudential instruments on U.S. banks’ foreign claims

First we consider the impact of different prudential instruments used by the destination country
on U.S. bank claims abroad. Each of the prudential instrument measures enters the regression
specification with its contemporaneous value and two lags. Formally, we estimate the regression
equation:

∆𝑌𝑏,𝑗,𝑡 = 𝛼0 + �𝛼1 𝐷𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑃𝑗,𝑡 + 𝛼2 𝐷𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑃𝑗,𝑡−1 + 𝛼3 𝐷𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑃𝑗,𝑡−2 � + 𝛼4 𝑋𝑏,𝑡−1 + 𝛼5 𝑍𝑗,𝑡 + 𝑓𝑗 +
𝑓𝑡 +𝑓𝑏 +𝜀𝑏,𝑗,𝑡                                                                                         (3)

where the prudential instrument changes are captured by DestPj,t, which records the changes in
the prudential instruments of country j in which U.S. bank b has exposures at time t. The
dependent variable is the change in logs of U.S. bank b’s claims on country j at time t evaluated
on an ultimate risk basis.

Table 4 summarizes the main results for individual prudential instruments on the foreign claim
growth of U.S. banks. Only two prudential instruments have some statistically significant
coefficients: LTV ratio limits and interbank exposure limits. However, the sum of coefficients on
these two measures for all lags is not significant, suggesting only a weak effect of prudential
regulation in the destination countries on U.S. bank foreign claims. The weak results have two
interpretations. First, while some of these policies have been actively used across U.S.
counterparty countries, especially in emerging markets, exposures of U.S. global banks to

20
     In 2013q3, total lending of branches in our dataset was $518 billion versus $595 billion for subsidiaries.

                                                             16
emerging markets are smaller than exposures to advanced economies; it may be that global banks
just choose to absorb the costs of the extra regulation. Alternatively, it may be that these policies
are ineffective in changing the growth of foreign claims at U.S. banks.

Among other drivers of total claim growth of U.S. global banks, the financial cycle variable has
the expected signs in most cases though the effects seem to be economically small. The negative
and significant coefficient on the international ratio suggests that the foreign claim growth is
smaller for more diversified banks (banks with more international activities). Core deposits are
negatively related to total claims growth, reflecting the fact that U.S. banks with smaller shares
of core deposits on their balance sheets (and thus more dependent on wholesale funding) lend
more to foreign residents. The positive and significant coefficient on both the illiquid asset ratio
and the net due to ratio suggest that less liquid banks and banks with more net internal borrowing
from their parents exhibit a higher growth rate in their foreign claims.

Impact of U.S. prudential instruments on U.S. banks’ foreign claims

Second, we test for the impact of changes in U.S. prudential instruments on U.S. banks’ foreign
claims. The use of prudential instruments in the United States between 2000 and 2013 are
essentially related to the stricter regulation mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel
standards on capital regulation, in particular the Basel II.5 standards implemented in January
2013 and the Basel III standards that became effective in January 2014. These regulatory
changes are captured in the IBRN Prudential Instruments Database in the capital requirements
index. Since our sample ends in 2013q3, only the implementation of Basel II.5 can be captured
in our empirical analysis. Given this setting, we use the cumulative change in the capital
requirement index for the United States as the variable of interest. This indicator is equal to one
from the first quarter in 2013 until the end of the sample, and zero otherwise. This approach
makes the empirical test a de facto difference-in-difference estimation. More formally, we use
the following regression specification:

∆𝑌𝑏,𝑗,𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 𝑈𝑆_𝐶𝑢𝑚_𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑡 + 𝛼2 𝑋𝑏,𝑡−1 + 𝛼3 𝑈𝑆_𝐶𝑢𝑚_𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑅𝑒𝑞𝑡 ∗ 𝑋𝑏,𝑡−1 + 𝛼4 𝑍𝑗,𝑡 +
𝑓𝑗 +𝑓𝑏 +𝜀𝑏,𝑗,𝑡                                                                               (4)

where the prudential instrument is captured by US_Cum_CapReqt, which records the cumulative
changes in U.S. capital requirements. We also include interaction terms between this instrument

                                                 17
and some bank characteristics in vector Xb,t-1 to complete the difference-in-difference analysis.
As before, the dependent variable is the change in logs of U.S. bank b’s claims on country j at
time t evaluated on an ultimate risk basis. In this specification, the U.S. prudential instrument
varies only by time and thus we only include bank and country fixed effects. We also use
specifications that include country-time fixed effects to account for loan demand at the country
level. In these cases, US_Cum_CapReqt is absorbed by the country-time fixed effect and thus we
focus our attention only on the interaction of US_Cum_CapReqt and bank-specific
characteristics.

Most of the recent regulatory changes in the United States have focused on the systemic global
banks which are subject to the Federal Reserve’s stress tests, known as the Comprehensive
Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and, among these banks, those that follow the so-called
Advanced Approach capital rules. 21 Therefore, we test for a differential impact of the stricter
U.S. regulation on the growth in total and cross-border claims for CCAR/non-CCAR and
Advanced Approach/non-Advanced Approach banks. To this end, we include interactions
between US_Cum_CapReqt and dummy variables that take the value of one for CCAR or
Advanced Approach banks and zero otherwise. We expect that if there is any negative effect of
the new capital regulations on the growth in foreign bank claims, it should be significant for the
group of large global banks. 22

This expectation is supported by the results presented in Table 5. The first four columns of the
table examine the changes in total claims and cross-border claims to all countries. Columns 5
through 8 examine the changes in cross-border claims to advanced foreign and emerging
economies. In almost all cases, the interaction of US_Cum_CapReqt and indicator variables for
CCAR and Advanced Approach banks are negative and significant, which confirms that the new
Basel capital regulations reduced the growth in foreign claims at the largest U.S. banks subject to
the Federal Reserve stress tests compared to smaller institutions not subject to these stress tests.
For example, taking into account that the difference in growth rates between CCAR and non-
CCAR banks before 2013 was on average 0.4 percentage points (the growth rate was 1 percent
21
   CCAR BHCs are generally global U.S. BHCs with total consolidated assets above $50 billion. As of 2013q3,
there were 30 CCAR BHCs, 23 of which had foreign claims in the 59 countries in our sample. Advanced Approach
BHCs are CCAR BHCs with total assets above $250 billion and foreign exposures larger than $10 billion.
22
   Our estimates likely provide a lower bound to the total effects of regulatory changes as the banks may have
adapted their portfolios as early as 2011.

                                                      18
for CCAR banks and 0.6 percent for non-CCAR banks), our estimates indicate that the difference
in growth rates between the two groups of banks and across the two periods should have been -
5.5 percentage points lower for CCAR banks (the difference-in-difference estimate). The growth
rate differential observed in the data is -5.2 percentage points. Thus, most of the reduction in the
growth rate of CCAR banks relative to non-CCAR banks could be attributable to the change in
U.S. capital regulation following the implementation of Basel II.5.

We explore further whether the negative impact of the stricter capital regulation is influenced by
bank-specific characteristics. To that end, we include interaction terms between the cumulative
capital requirements index and three bank-specific characteristics: size, the tier 1 capital ratio,
and the core deposits to total liabilities ratio. 23 Table 6 shows the regression results. The
estimations in the first two columns include US_Cum_CapReqt as a standalone variable and
separate country, time, and bank fixed effects. The change in U.S. capital regulation seems to
reduce the growth in foreign claim of U.S. global banks, as suggested by the negative coefficient
on US_Cum_CapReqt, but this effect is not statistically significant. However, balance sheet
characteristics appear important to bank reactions to the change in capital requirements. For
example, as indicated by the three significant interaction terms between US_Cum_CapReqt and
size, tier 1 capital ratio, and the core deposit to total liabilities ratio in column 2, the negative
impact of the stricter regulation is stronger for larger banks. In contrast, banks with more capital
(tier 1 capital ratio) and core deposits are able to increase their claims after the new regulations
are implemented. Column 3 shows that the significance of the interaction terms between
US_Cum_CapReqt and size and core deposits is robust to accounting for the foreign demand for
credit through country-time fixed effects.

To better control for the effect of bank size, and to verify that the impact of the new regulations
on foreign claims occurs mainly through the largest global banks, we estimate the same
specifications splitting our sample by CCAR and non-CCAR banks, and by Advanced Approach
and non-Advanced Approach banks. These results are shown in columns 4 through 7. As
expected, the coefficients on the interaction terms are mostly significant for CCAR and
Advanced-Approach banks. The interaction terms with core deposits for Advanced-Approach


23
  These three interaction terms have the only significant coefficients in the specifications that include interactions
between the cumulative changes in the U.S. capital requirements and all bank characteristics.

                                                           19
banks, and with both tier 1 capital and the core deposits ratio for CCAR banks are positive and
significant, indicating that large banks with more regulatory capital and core deposits are able to
offset the impact of the stricter capital regulation. Recent evidence shows that large U.S. banks
subject to the stress tests have been increasing their regulatory capital and their deposits base
(International Monetary Fund, 2015). Our results indicate that this trend may help them
withstand the tougher regulations.

Our results are consistent with previous findings in the literature suggesting a reduction in cross-
border activities caused by stricter prudential policies (e.g. Aiyar, et al., 2014). This is especially
the case for the largest global banks subject to higher capital requirements that apply to the
consolidated entity.

4.     Concluding Remarks

The 2007-2008 financial crisis has led many countries around the world to review their use of
microprudential and macroprudential policy instruments. In a financially integrated world in
which banks are global and run large cross-border operations, two questions naturally arise. First,
have prudential policies taken by national regulators affected risk taking and credit growth
beyond national borders? Second, can domestic prudential policies be effective in containing
rapid domestic credit growth and addressing excessive risk taking? The U.S. experience is useful
since the country is home to a number of globally active banks, many of which are systemically
important, and simultaneously hosts many foreign banks engaged in lending in the United States
through both subsidiaries and branches. We focus primarily on the response of credit growth
through these banking entities.

We find clear evidence that lending in the United States is affected by foreign policy changes. A
tightening of foreign prudential instruments leads to an increase in U.S. lending by both
domestically-owned global banks with significant foreign operations and by the U.S. affiliates of
foreign banks. Specifically, lending growth rises with tighter foreign capital requirements, limits
on LTV ratios, and local currency reserve requirements enacted in foreign economies. The
capacity of foreign and U.S. global banks to lend appears to shift, at least in part, from the
foreign countries, where it is being constrained, to the United States.



                                                  20
We also find that the largest U.S. global banks, those that are deemed systemic and thus have
been required to finance a larger proportion of their balance sheets with capital, appear to cut
credit abroad relatively more than the smaller banks in response to tighter capital requirements in
the United States. Although the intent of these capital requirements was not to reduce the supply
of credit, the short-term effect points to lower foreign claims growth as a result of the stricter
requirements. In contrast, we find that the use of prudential instruments by foreign authorities
does not have a significant impact on the activities of U.S. banks in those foreign countries.

While the international spillovers from past prudential policy tightening were moderate, our
results highlight the challenges that policy makers face today. Effective control of domestic
credit can be complicated by the prudential policies implemented in foreign jurisdictions. At the
same time, calibration of domestic policies will need to take into account the spillovers of
prudential policy changes in foreign countries and their cross-border effects. Despite limited real
consequences for the U.S. economy over the past decade, prudential instruments applied abroad
have the potential to more significantly influence loan growth in the future through a variety of
banking channels.

Figure 1: Home country local currency reserve requirements and lending by U.S.
subsidiaries of foreign banks

The chart shows the effect of changes in home country local currency reserve requirements on lending by U.S. subsidiaries of
foreign banks. Calculations follow the methodology described in the text and are based on the estimated coefficients shown in
column 5 of Table 3. The figure plots by date the additional lending by subsidiaries in U.S. dollar values due to observed changes
in local currency reserve requirements in these entities’ home countries.




Figure 2: Home country limits on LTV ratios and lending by U.S. subsidiaries and
branches of foreign banks
The chart shows the effect of changes in home country limits on LTV ratios on lending by U.S. subsidiaries (dashed line) and
branches (solid line) of foreign banks. Calculations follow the methodology described in the text and are based on the estimated
coefficients shown in column 8 and 9 of Table 3. The figure plots by date the additional lending by subsidiaries and branches in
U.S. dollar values due to observed changes in limits on LTV ratios in these entities’ home countries.

Table 1: Summary Statistics on Bank Lending and Characteristics
This table provides summary statistics for bank balance sheet and lending data, summarizing those observations included in our baseline regressions. Data are
observed quarterly from 2000q1-2013q3 for U.S. global banks and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks, and from 2002q4-2013q3 for U.S. branches of foreign
banks. Banking data sources by subset can be found in Table A1 and are reported at the level of the top bank within the global banking organization for U.S.
global banks and for the U.S. branches of foreign banks (aggregated across U.S. branches in this case), and at the subsidiary level for the U.S. subsidiaries of
foreign banks. The tier 1 asset ratio reported for branches is that of this associated parent. The Net Due To (or Due From) variable measures from the perspective
of a bank’s head office total net internal lending (or borrowing) vis-à-vis all its related domestic and international offices. Cycle variables in the Inward US
Global Bank sample are constructed as exposure-weighted averages.

Table 2: Summary Statistics on Changes in the Prudential Instruments
These tables show summary statistics on changes in the prudential instruments in home and/or destination countries
of banks located in the U.S. over the period 2000q1-2013q3. Data on the seven instruments come from the
prudential instruments database compiled by Cerutti et al. (2016) and are on the quarter level. The table is based on
the estimation sample. The table shows the total number of changes, i.e. tightening or loosening, for each instrument
as well as the proportion of non-zero entries. All home and/or destination countries of banks located in the U.S. are
included. Source: IBRN.

Table 3: Inward Specification
This table reports the effects of changes in capital requirements, local currency reserve requirements and LTV limits. The sample period is 2000q1 to 2013q3. Columns (1), (4) and (7) show
the results based on the sample of U.S. global banks. Columns (2), (5) and (8) are for U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks and columns (3), (6) and (9) for U.S. branches of foreign banks. In
specifications (1) to (3), the variable Pt stands for ExpPb,t, the exposure-weighted index. In specifications (4) to (9), Pt stands for HomePj,t, the prudential index that captures prudential policy
changes in entity b’s home country j. For more details on the variables, see Table A1. BIS cycle variables are similarly constructed as exposure-weighted averages in specifications (1) to (3).
All specifications include time and bank fixed effects as specified in the lower part of the table. Standard errors are robust for global banks, and clustered by country for affiliate regressions.
***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.

Table 5: Impact of Changes in U.S. Capital Regulation on Foreign Claim Growth by Type of Claim and Destination Country
This table reports the effects of changes in the interaction of changes in U.S. prudential policy with indicator variables for CCAR or Advanced Approach banks and firm characteristics on log changes in total loans
by destination country. CCAR banks are bank holding companies (BHCs) included in the yearly stress test exercise conducted by the Federal Reserve. Advanced Approach banks are CCAR BHCs with total assets
above $250 billion and foreign exposures larger than $10 billion. The data are quarterly from 2000q1 to 2013q3 for a panel of BHCs. For more details on the variables see Table A1. Each column gives the result for
the country and claim type specified in the column header. Specifications in all columns include bank and country-time fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by bank. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the
1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively

Table 6: Impact of Changes in U.S. Capital Regulation on Total Foreign Claim Growth
This table reports the effects of changes in U.S. prudential policy, the interaction of changes in U.S. prudential policy with changes in destination
country regulation, and firm characteristics on log changes in total loans by destination country. The data are quarterly from 2000q1 to 2013q3
for a panel of bank holding companies. For more details on the variables see Table A1. Each column gives the result for the subset of banks
specified in the column header. CCAR banks are BHCs included in the yearly stress test exercise conducted by the Federal Reserve. Adv.
Approach banks are CCAR BHCs with total assets above $250 billion and foreign exposures larger than $10 billion. Specifications in all columns
include bank fixed effects, with the first two columns including country fixed effects. Country-time fixed effects are used as indicated in the
lower part of the table. Standard errors are clustered by bank. ***, **, and * indicate significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.
